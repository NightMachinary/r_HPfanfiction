** If I had to pick one, I'd say Curse of the Horcrux. It's incomplete but it nonetheless reaches a (ahem) climax. Link:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2421848/chapters/5358749]]

The thing I like about it is that it does what most smut fics fail at, which is to successfully maintain the character voices while sacrificing just the right amount of realism to enable the plot. So Hermione still comes across as Hermione, just one with lower inhibitions.

Runners up include:

- Tease ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4884595/1/Tease]]) Harry/Unknown.

- Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof) ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1179394]]) Harry/Pansy.

- Sunday Morning ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586754]]) Harry/Pansy, same author.

- Whatever happened to Bromance ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767/1/Whatever-Happened-to-Bromance]]) Harry/Romilda.

- It Could Only Happen To Harry ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry]]) Harry/various.

- The Best of a Bad Situation ([[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r9s0mrns2j6hr2z/AAANNXuNwNVyPxK00U56SLhga?dl=0]]). Harry/Various.

- Harry Potter and the Veela Sisters ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4979758/chapters/11437501]]). Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle.

There really should be more Harry/Ginny ones but unfortunately everyone who writes sexy Harry/Ginny well also rams it full of saccharine sweet fluff.

**** Yes. I wanted more of that fic not for the smut, but because the Cormac/Harry bromance was hilarious. I wanted to see it developed more and see where it leads Harry later. Of course, that could be why the author stopped it where it was: smut achieved and further exploration would turn it into a more indepth work.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  During the trio's stay at Grimmauld Place in DH, Hermione spends some quality alone time with a good book. PURE SMUT. You'll find no plot to water down the smut in this fic.

** linkao3(Pride of Time by Anubis Ankh). I normally go for plotful slash or femslash, being gay myself I relate to it better, but despite the sex being straight I found it incredibly good. Of course, it's very far from a PwP, but tons of character development make for good sex scenes IMO.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

*** You know that Snape is as old as Harry's father, any Hogwarts era relationship is rape and abuse of power, the man is thoroughly unpleasant, has a very unhealthy view on the topic of love, is a war criminal, a traitor, got Harry targeted, his parents killed and hates Harry, right?

Any Snape/Harry story is going to be way more than "slightly" OOC.

**** Any ship can work, but it takes a really good writer to make a half decent Snarry fic.

IMHO dramione is just as unlikely, but the pairing itself lacks the visceral disgust that snarry (for obvious reasons) brings by name alone.

There are great works for both pairings tho!

***** Oh, sure, it can work, but it's impossible to deny that any such fic is going to have characters that are far, far more than merely "slightly" OOC.

*** Haha agreed, but holy shit is it a controversial pairing!

They're my no.1 ship :D and my current fave fic of them is Can't Take the Sky, second would be The Boy Who Died a Lot. Would love to talk about the pairing btw :D
