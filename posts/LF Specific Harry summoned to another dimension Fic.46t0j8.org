There was this "Harry summoned to another dimension" fic that I read a while ago that I'm looking for again.

Important stuff:

1. The alternate dimensions Harry Potter killed himself.

2. The universe that our Harry was summoned from is the canon universe as far as I can recall, after Voldemort's defeat.

3. This isn't the first time the people in the other dimension have summoned a Harry Potter, they all died.

4. Everyone in the alternate dimension is surprised that Harry is/was a Gryffindor, theirs was a Slytherin.

5. Alternate-Harry and Alternate-Draco were in a homosexual relationship, Our-Harry was very uncomfortable with that.

6. Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore (in alternate universe only)

7. Snape had a secret house that he took Our-Harry to.

8. [[/spoiler][Turns out Alternate-Harry didn't kill himself, but let Dumbledore kill him in an attempt to get the Prophecy to transfer over to Dumbledore]]

9. At the end, Alternate-Snape goes back with Harry to the canon universe.


** I re-read it the other day, linkffn(6730432).

EDIT: No wonder I couldn't find it, I kept thinking summoned was in the summary, not pulled.

**** I'm happy to have helped. I found it by searching for Snape, because he's not often in the fics I tend to read, so he shows up less when I ctrl F.

***** I probably would have done that, but I last read it before I most recently cleared my browsing history. Oh well.

I really should create a spreadsheet of what I've read. Hmm.

  AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.
