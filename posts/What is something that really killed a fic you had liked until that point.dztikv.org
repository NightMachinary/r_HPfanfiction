By which I mean, something that just did not mesh well with your headcanon/the story/anything else, something that broke your immersion and made you pause to say "Whaaat?"

I remember reading a fic once (I forget which one) that had a bit about how magic was produced by a gland the size of a grapefruit, only present in magicals, and just stopping and thinking "Whoa, what? How does that make any sort of sense?" I couldn't finish that story because I felt dissatisfied for the rest of the fic.

What examples of this feeling can you think of?

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

*** One of my favorite fics (not an HP one) actually went like 2 years between updates, 3 different times. The author posted a chapter in 2012, then the next chapter in 2014, then the next chapter in 2016, and they've posted 2 chapters in 2019, the latest being just a few months ago. So, it can and does happen, where a fic will go years without being updated and then all of a sudden, one day out of the blue you'll get an email "so and so fic has been updated." And you get so happy. And on her latest update, I actually left a comment basically saying "Hey, I just wanted to let you know that there are still people out there reading your fic. Even though it's been like 3 years since your last update, when I got the email I was so happy. Thanks." Just to let them know that people appreciate that they're still updating, even if it is years between them.

** there was a fic about Sirius taking care of Regulus after both their parents died which I thought was great at first, the writing was decent and the concept was interesting. But a few chapters in Sirius spanked Regulus (unironically) as punishment for something, then Regulus ran away on his broom, got lost in London, and turned into a mewling four year old. Like literally cried and went to a stranger's house to use the phone to contact Sirius. All this despite them only being a year apart in age, and by all accounts Regulus was the more mature one in Canon. Honestly there's just too few Regulus survives fics and it's a shame, shout out to izzythehutt and kuchikopi+tonberrys for writing the only good ones out there.

** Most of the things that regularly kill fics for me have already been mentioned in the thread but two more come to mind:

A few fics were killed for me because of unrealistic amounts of teenage angst. I mean, I get it, they are teenagers. Some angst is to be expected to make their interactions and relationships realistic. But some stories just seem to take this to a level where I can't help but keep cringing and eventually have to nope out.

Second, but probably more niche as it applies mostly to fics that have some smut. Not PWP, just normal fics that don't fade to black during the "action". Well, sadly most of those seem to be written by horny males that go into fantasy-SI mode as soon as they start writing that action. Harry is hung like a horse and the girl has 27 orgasms in 45 minutes and is left near comatose. Like, dude, I don't want your wishful thinking spelled out for me. I just wanted a realistic, romantic first time for the characters I have been reading about for the last 50000 words.

*** I literally once read a fic where Ginny asks for "seventeen orgasms, one for every year I've been alive."

Like buddy, have you ever actually had sex? I think if you gave a teenage girl seventeen orgasms in the span of half and hour she'd go comatose.

Also unrelated, but my favorite ever fic description:

It comes off like the author wanted the edginess of the Slytherin rape club but also didn't want to deal with the idea of his edgelord MC's girlfriend not being a virgin.

(And then of course Harry takes Ginny's virginity in animagus form, with super-questionable consent issues, but of course it is all right because Harry is our dude and Ginny gets over it eventually.)

As for the gay stuff, yeah, Blaise, Draco and Dumbledore are the only male-attracted-to-male characters, and all are one-dimensional villains who have their gay relationships used as insults towards them (either explicitly or in Harry's narration), while Grindelwald gets made essentially straight for the purpose of the fic. (And of course we get lots of discussion and flirting about woman-woman relationships, but only as titillation for Harry because eww, gays, but girl-on-girl is hot and clearly they're just waiting for the right guy to come in.)

***** I see. BTW, just reading linkffn(13285012) and I hit chapter 9, with this dialogue between Harleen (that is fem!Harry on the edge of the lesbian relationship with Hermione) and McGonagall:

#+begin_quote
  Harleen nodded and took out the box of potions from the inside pocket of her robes, expanding it as Minerva continued speaking. "Miss Brown... from what I was able to gather in speaking to her while you showered and dressed this morning... it appears that her primary concern in sharing a dorm with you is that she is uncomfortable sharing a space with someone that she thinks might look at her in a... less than platonic manner. Now, while I do not believe that you would ever use your situation to take advantage of any of the other girls, I fear I must ask if there is any truth to Miss Brown's concerns?"

  Harleen squirmed in her seat, her cheeks flushing a brilliant red as her eyes darted about and her fingers plucked nervously at the potions vials in the box in front of her. "Uh... i-if you're asking if I'm at-attracted to girls... well... well, I'd have to say yes," she admitted meekly. "But I swear, I would never-"

  "I have already said that I believe you, Miss Potter, let us let that lie. This does present a small problem however. The boys and girls dorms are separate in order to help discourage any... explorations amongst the students, however there is no such consideration for students of the same gender." She fell silent, thinking carefully for several seconds as Harleen selected the proper potion from her box.
#+end_quote

And I was like “Wait, WHAT?”. I am an active rather conservative Christian, I am not exactly in tune with the current culture which seems to me obsessed with homosexuality (for all the wrong reasons I am afraid), but it was too much even for me. So, gays and lesbians are supposed to sleep where? In a corridor with Mrs. Norris? On the top of the Astronomical Tower?

** Fate by TheTrueSpartan. The first few chapters were great. It seemed like this story would be an interesting twist on the fix-it fic trope, where instead of an entire lifetime of memories, the protagonist would only have brief glimpses into the future every so often. Then Ron arrives at Hogwarts and it all went downhill. You're telling me, the boy who wants to use his ability, not to gain wealth or power, but to save lives, the boy who clawed out his own finger nails to save Luna's mother, was sorted into Slytherin!? This Ron is definitely a Gryffindor. And then it keeps getting worse. Zabini and Nott decide to teach Ron how to be a proper pureblood prince, Ron scores like 100 points on the first day of classes, Molly sends him an angry letter for being sorting into Slytherin, etc. I don't think I've seen a greater waste of potential.

**** I strongly disagree.

Fred (RIP) and George, were geniuses in a different kind of way. They made products that appealed to all of Hogwarts, and even older/younger audiences outside of Hogwarts.

Ginny was a smart girl, she managed to become a chaser for the Holy Head Harpies, then an senior quidditch editor for the Daily Prophet. Sure it isn't academically smart (imo), but it is smart.

Bill became a Curse Breaker for Gringotts. I'm not really brushed up on Curse Breaker knowledge, but by the sounds of it, you'd have to be pretty smart to break some curses for, what I assume to be complex, on a multitude of items.

Charlie works with dragons, again, academically, eh. Not really. But it's a good job, and it makes a living, and you need to know how to train, control, and understand multiple breeds of dragons.

Percy worked in the Office of the Minister of Magic. That's essentially working in the Office of a Prime Minister/President. He also became the Head of the Department of Magical Transportation. Both of which likely involve knowledge on policy, public service, and a few other areas.

Ron, while he may seem to not be the brightest, is still smart in other ways. He knows a lot about quidditch, much like Ginny. He became an Auror, which required Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding in Potions, Charms, DADA, Transfiguration, and Herbology. Which, in my honest opinion, is actually really good.

Arthur works as the Head of the Office of Misuse of Muggle Artefacts. He needs to understand muggles and literally anything they find that relates to muggles. His knowledge of muggles likely surpasses that of a muggle studies professor.

Molly didn't go anywhere academically. But she was a mother. She knew exactly how to take care of children. At any age. She knew a fair amount of charms, potions, herbology, transfiguration and other sorts of spells.

Your argument doesn't really have basis.

Actually, we know canonically exactly zero about her academic achievements. She may be the Hermione of her year and we would know nothing about that. I was just shocked when in some story they started to geek out with Hermione on some Arithmantic theory and boys were completely lost (meant something about theory of magic; I know canonically Arithmancy is not that, but that is another point), and I was like “What? How can Ginny keep pace with Hermione?”, but then I thought about that for some time, and really we don't know. Yes, she threw it all out of window and went to play Quidditch, but there are many reasons why one would do so, and not because all sportsmen/-women are stupid.

It wasn't an unexpected attack from behind her back or an AoE attack that overpowered her. It wasn't even a result of some clever attack or tactic implemented by Molly. She just... failed to protect against a straigthforward-cast spell. It's like if an intermediate martial artist fought against an experienced veteran, and ended up winning the spar by utilising a rookie technique. Which either makes her behaviour an out-of-character incident due to Rowling's meddling, or just a sign of outright and glaring incompetency. And in both these cases it isn't something that speaks in favour of Molly or her intellectual / magical capabilities.

Where are you getting all of that? The woman was locked up in Azkaban for 14 years. She's frail and rickety. She was only able to beat Sirius because he was at about the same level. The death eaters haven't been doing big battles very often, just some raids that we don't even know if she participates in. If you believe Cursed Child, she just had a baby not too long ago. She's mentally unstable. She's exhausted from fighting the three girls just before this.

I think it's very in-character for Molly to defeat her here, because of Molly's temper. She basically had a fit of rage and hulked out, the same way even muggles can lift cars when their kids are pinned under them- adrenaline. She's known for going overboard, and in this case that just translated into her magic and a powerful curse.

Besides, don't forget what Harry did and how it worked out. Not a single one of Voldemort's henchmen was able to kill anyone in the battle after Harry let Voldemort AK him. He spread his mother's protection to the entire school by dying for them. Bellatrix couldn't have won that duel as she literally couldn't hit Molly no matter what she did. So all anyone had to do was wear her down to the point where she missed a block or dodge.

That conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from that premise. Criticism of canon aside, Harry's extremely unbalanced mass protection sacrifice neutered only VD himself, not VD and all the DEs. And even that's only according to Harry's own words, since a) VD was able to disarm Neville and b) we're following both an unreliable narrator and a plot-armored story ending.

Well, as I've said higher, she won either because JKR was idiot-balling Bella, or because Bella was incompetent enough to deal with an adrenaline-fueled low-skill opponent. That's even more the case, actually, if we assume that Bella got neutered alongside VD by Harry's sacrifice. And since Molly's capabilities were what I was intending to discuss in my initial comment, such a conclusion is satisfactory to me.

Fred and George used children as test subjects for their inventions without medical personal nearby or parental permission.

Arthur's deliberate ignorance of muggles is insulting and borders on racism. It is not admiration or respect, it sounds like an imperialist looking down on a tribe he found and being amazed at what they achieved despite their backwardness.

** Well just yesterday I was reading one where Harry got a PC with the internet at home and invested in Google. 2 years before he went to Hogwarts. In 1989. Google was founded in 1998 and the internet was very, /very/ rudimentary in '89. I know it sounds petty, but my immersion just shattered. The thing is these days you can access all kinds of information in a matter of seconds. My point is the author could have spent 5 minutes researching the history of the internet and google. Without having to leave his/ her home, going to a library and manually searching through books. But noo, let's invest in Google in freaking 1989.

​

This one I actually felt bad about dropping. It was about a math genius Hermione and she had great character development. I read through the first four years and was really enjoying it. Unfortunately for some reason, the author decided to give Umbridge one of the worst cases of plot armor I've ever seen. She committed more crimes than in canon (including torturing pureblood children of ministry employees) and even set up a whipping post in the Great Hall. I had to stop at that because it had gone beyond breaking my immersion and into crackfic territory. And literally no one ever did or say anything to her or try to stop her. The teachers just kind of stood there and Dumbledore was next to useless. (He even manipulated Hermione into lying to Harry.) The author's excuse was "but she's friends with the minister". No. Just no. It doesn't matter who she's friends with- no one is untouchable. It was such a pity to stop reading an otherwise great story.

​

Generally boring romance/ sex stuff without plot. What I mean is that I read Harry Potter for the magic, the conflict, the fights. There are plenty (some would say too many) romance novels on their own. It's boring everyday stuff compared to a magical school, dragons, flying on brooms, war, etc. It's fine to have romance/ sex in a story, but when the story is only about that it gets boring quickly.

​

Oh, I just remembered another one. During the fight in the Department of Mysteries Tonks crashed into a timerturner clock and was sent a year back in time. So she goes to Hogwarts and friends Harry. Only to let him go back to the Ministry at the end of the year. Otherwise, the fic was very good and Tonks and Hermione really helped Harry and there was character development and stuff. But they came full circle. It just seemed so pointless. I mean why write a time travel story only to get back to the same point? It just felt like I wasted several hours of my life for what was basically canon but with Tonks as a fifth year.

- Sneak through one of the tunnels to Hogsmeade and use the post office there. Or even wait for a Hogsmeade weekend.
- Send a patronus message to an Order member
- Have Harry speak to a snake and use that instead of an owl. (It would be slower, but still)
- Have Dumbledore use Fawkes. Hell, even without Fawkes, Dumbledore is a grown-ass adult who can leave Hogwarts whenever he wants.
- Have Harry use the mirror Sirius got him
- Have Harry call Dobby and ask Dobby to deliver a message
- Hell, have Hagrid go through the forest and reach the nearest village or town and deliver a message from there.

I would have kept reading if Umbridge had only privately tortured Harry and Hermione- one doesn't have parents to protect him and has been slandered by the press and the other is a muggle-born and easily discredited by a racist government. This would have been believable. But by the time I stopped reading Umbridge was about to torture the pureblood son of a ministry head of department. In full view of all the students and teachers. In the middle of the Great Hall. And the teacher didn't say or do anything. Not a peep. I'm sorry but it just went from deadly serious to crackfic/ parody.

Yeah there was one throwaway line in the subsequent chapter saying something like "Milo wondered why he just let them go. It would have been better to have captured them." That wasn't enough for me. It was the equivalent of blink, scratch head, and continue on with your day. If Milo had actually spent /time/ wondering why he made that decision, I probably would've continued with the fic. And yeah, even with the Scholar's Touch thing, I'm still not buying it.

** There is one scene in Vindico Atrum by Firephoenix8 (a Dark!Harry / Tomarry Fic), which just took me out of the plot so much and killed any mood to read it for me. Harry already becomes stupider and stupider the further along the story goes and then there is the one scene where Draco has to kill Dumbledore (and Harry already had visions or smth about Draco being tortured by Voldi) and instead of letting him do that he wants to kill Dumbledore himself. So then he stuns everyone that is there and lets Dumbledore monologue for a bit and before he can kill him Dumbledore gets away.

It just made no sense and I *hate* it when Characters make stupid decisions out of nowhere and generally become somewhat stupid just for plot reasons. That has killed fics for me a couple of times and its just very annoying. The one scene I just described was jut an example where I was quite angered by it all, because I had put so much time into reading it already and now I dont get to see the end, because it wouldnt be satisfying anymore...

** There are only three things that make me nope out of a fanfiction immediately, other than that I'll read pretty much anything.

1. Surprise incest (or incest in general). I hate reading fics where nothing is tagged and then suddenly, forty chapters in, relatives start making out.
2. Pregnancy fics/mpreg in general: It's okay if it's just a side thing, not the main focus, but HP fics are usually set during school and I can't stand the teen pregnancy trope.
3. Sexism/Racism from the author. It's okay if it's an actual plot point, something that is described but not glorified, but the casual racism/sexism from the author usually throws me off so completely I can't look past it.

** I can think of three:

I'll admit that I like trashy Hinny Soul-Bond fics, but I noped out of linkffn(The Bonds Of Blood by Death Marrs) when the author skipped Ginny's pregnancy with a Hyperbolic Time Chamber, that we didn't even get to see. I'll admit the writing was poor beforehand and people can and will find the subject matter disturbing, but it was at that point where I realised that the writer ignored and /skipped/ the most important thing about the fic; Harry and Ginny's relationship during one of the most emotional and intense moments of any relationship.

I gave up on linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always by deadwoodpecker) after the Weasleys ordered Harry to leave and never come back. I mean, I get why it happened and the event was foreshadowed a lot and it was probably in character, but it just felt *wrong.* And it's weird because something similar happened in my all time favourite fic, Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]] but I loved it in there.

I abandoned linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond by Council), another Hinny Soul-Bond when relationship drama happened between them during the Yule Ball when Ginny asked Krum (I think) to the ball. Why can't my two children just be happy together?

TL;DR, One from a crappy time skip, two from too much conflict between characters I love compared to canon and three for the same reason as two. (Also, read Meaning of One by Sovran.)

Interesting premise (Hermione is a reincarnated Salazar Slytherin) and relatively solid in its covering of Book 1-3. But I think the plot went off the rails when the author hit the GOF.

Hermione just began leaning into too much Mary Sue territory for my tastes. Plus, some plot inclusions just felt hamfisted in their inclusion (i.e. the Grindelwald storyline) and tend to make characters go too OOC.

(Very uppity, immortal, all powerful and beautiful like you wouldn't believe.) But very rarely can I find stories that are a Sirius Black romance that isn't marauder era so I rolled with it.

Hours into this thing dealing with an all powerful oc. Turns out she's the most powerful thing ever born. The bringer of end times. But she's still with Sirius so okay.

Then she gets pregnant. Okay. And then Sirius dies.

I had to stop. I know that it follows cannon but I just couldn't read anymore. I guess I was hoping that the author would do what I've seen in a really good fic before and save him. I was so excited to see how the all powerful oc would prevent him from dying and she just... didn't.

**** Not by the traditional definitions used in the fandom.

AU stories contain changes to the /set-up/ of the story.

Example:

1. A story which starts in Harry's fourth year where you stipulate that Pettigrew was actually caught at the end of PoA.

2. A story which starts in Harry's fourth year where events of years 1-3 were all the same, but you say that wizards don't use wands.

3. A story which starts in Harry's fourth year which does not contain the Triwizard Tournament.

4. A story which starts in Harry's fourth year where during the story wizards discover how to cast magic just as easily without wands.

1 and 2 are AU, because you have created changes which are already in place at the start of the story.

3 and 4 are not AU, but rather "canon compliant". They treat all the HP books prior to 4th year as fixed, then events diverge /during/ the telling of the story.

Essentially the difference between an AU and a canon-compliant fic is timing.

Probably it's best to view these concepts through the prism of history. At the time that most HP fanfic was written and the meaning of these terms was fixed, the HP series was not yet complete. Prior to the release of GoF, it was entirely canon-compliant to write a 4th year fic based on years 1-3 which did not include the Triwizard Tournament.

Now that the series is complete, it's probably a bit clunky to describe a 4th year fic which is different to the canon 4th year as canon-compliant. But that's how the term is generally understood.

***** That makes sense. I can't recall seeing any of those but they do sound like Totally Not Slash.

  People try to justify it with .. but but magic. Yes, magic can turn them into a female. Males don't have the plumbing for babies. How's he supposed to deliver it, out his arse?

I am not a fan of m-preg by any means. But I think you're seriously underestimating magic here. Magic can turn people into freaking animals, like, beetles and deer and ferrets and stuff. And INANIMATE objects, like armchairs and stumps and small bones and whatever else.

I can think of SO many ways you could get a baby out of a man- or woman, for that matter- with magic, rather than traditional birth. You could just do a switching spell and switch it out for a drop of water, for Pete's sake. You could cut the stomach open with a regular knife and heal it in seconds afterwards, as long as there was no dark magic involved in the cut.
