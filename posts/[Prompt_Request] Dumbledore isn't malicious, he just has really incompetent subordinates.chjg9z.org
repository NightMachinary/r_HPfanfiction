This is not my view of the books, but I think it could be a really funny idea.

It starts with Hagrid, then goes to the professors. In the Government, his subordinates don't give him relevant information. McGonagall doesn't act hands on, so he doesn't know of the bullying.

So a really competent Dumbledore surrounded by incompetent people.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  ‘You're the cleverest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.'
#+end_quote

Gets interpreted to make Hermione some sort of mini-Dumbledore.

Ginny gets interpreted as considering buying love potions at the beginning of Half-Blood Prince, when she is "skeptical".

Abusive Ron isn't a thing. Never once hit Hermione. Hermione has hit him on 2 separate occasions.

Hermione having 11 OWLs, it was a misprint in the first copies of the book.

And quite a bit more.

I can get Rowling interviews on tap, I have all the books as PDFs, and if I'm really lazy, the wiki is a good starting point, and well Pottermore is just a search away.

**** I was actually thinking about the whole expending an entire year to show Harry a couple of memories. How do you make that appear as him being competent? That's what I have trouble fitting this idea in.

I mean, as I understood it you would want everything to remain the same in the overall story, just making things seem very different from Dumbledore's PoV.
