linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter)

I have read this fic(and it's sequel) like 4 times in the past year. I find it to be an incredibly good crossover romance fic with just the right amount of comedy. I haven't seen it posted here before and thought I would recommend it.


** Wow, my three favorite fandoms (mostly Ranma and HP) and I've never seen this. Thanks, gonna give this a read now!

*** Right? I've loved Ranma, Sailor Moon, and Harry Potter all since I was in middle school. Finding this made my day months ago.. and surprisingly.. it was an AMAZING read. At least for me. It hit on all the right points.

** I really liked this even with no knowledge of Ranma and only the slightest of Sailor Moon knowledge from watching a few episodes ~20 years ago.

Good story. Basically a crack!fic but fairly well written.

*** Basically a crackfic, yeah.. but it gets better later on. I don't want to scare people away.. I mean, the Snape/Dumbledore bashing in the beginning is a little cracky.. but after that, it's pretty good!

** I'll sum it up with two words: Heather Snape.

Master of spontaneous naming, Harry isn't.

*** Yeah.. but that's pure Harry Potter there. Never the brightest tool in the shed. But we still love him.. usually.

  Sirius is dead. The Headmaster reveals to Harry what he believes the power Voldemort knows not is supposed to be. Not just 'love' but a specific kind of love. Harry disagrees. He reacts with an 8 timezone apparition to the Pools of Sorrow in China. Multicross of HP, SM and Ranma 1/2. Harry/Usagi SailorMoon

** I will say this much. It gets better as it goes along. (although the Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore bashing is really bad, and the Snape/Hermione bashing is also not enjoyable) But it is quite fun, even if it suffers from the HP!fixfic stylings that cause GLORIOUS ANIMU to be superpowerful.

*** True-true. But I enjoy super!anime!harry fics. The bashing is strong early on.. but gets a lot better later on. Especially in the sequel.

**** Is that you, Shampoo? but yeah it gets better. I wish thw author would go back and make the plot not depend on "evil" Dumbledore, though. And not make Ginny a psychotic bitch. Really, it's fucking annoying. (but other people, give this a shot it's pretty funny)
