I've no idea if this is even workable but I've seen shit far for insane than this. Let's say the ministry finds some way to send Harry there in the peak of his unpopularity in Wizarding Britain. The only difference is his loved ones and the Order aren't all raging dicks. They actually campaign to get him released while he has to deal with rabid dementors after his soul and the insane people already locked there. Please God don't make the Death Eaters into the good guys. I despise fics that do that.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

*** If we're thinking of the same one, I remember every detail except the title. Luna was the one possessed by the diary horcrux and was convicted and sent to Azkaban, which Harry protested by moving in to the next cell.
