As the title says, preferably a female Fay changeling protagonist who goes to Hogwarts until she reaches her first majority and changes into her original Fey form. Are there any stories like that?

The drama of navigating Fay court to keep contact with former Hogwarts friends or even help them in the war for example could make for a nice read that is quite different from most fanfiction I've read.

PS: I'm assuming if there are any stories like this the protagonist would be Sidhe, but I'm okay with other types of Fay too.


** /(spoilers for the story)/

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian Trilogy]] (W^{T} : 671,817; Complete), Harry eventually has a daughter with a fae, and that daughter stays in Hogwarts for a while. Some fae politics is also present. However, the narrative almost never shifts to the child herself.

*** Not exactly what I'm looking for, but I might read it, does it expect people to be familiar with the Dresden Files or are those parts explained clearly for everyone?

**** Regardless, the Denarian Trilogy is one of the best-written classics to grace the fandom. It's worth a read for that alone.

**** There isn't any mentioning of DF, only its noticeable influence (I'd guess) on the story.

Let's see if it works on a second try. Series, you mean sequels? because it says [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5001827/1/Grimm-A-Fairy-s-Tale]] is completed, assuming that's the right one. I don't see a sequel for it.
