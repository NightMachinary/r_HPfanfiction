Which characters did you think didn't get what they deserved?

Like it could Fred deserved better and shouldn't have died, or the Dursleys deserved worse and should have at least been arrested.

** /Albus Severus/ /Potter/. There was nothing Harry and Ginny could have done for the Potter part, but they should at least have given him a break with his surnames.

Also, Snape sacrifice doesn't magically erase years of abuse. You can respect a man without liking him as a person, and giving your child the name of a man you hate (or at least used to) seem to be a very bad idea.\\
I could understand calling him like that if it was a political statement (Snape was also a hero of the war who deserve to be remembered as such, this is why I put his name right next to Dumbledore), but that would still be very cold toward the kid.

*** I mean Eileen was a pretty shitty mom calling her son Severus in the first place (pretty sure it wouldn't have been Tobias who came up with that one). Harry becomes quite sympathetic towards Snape even as he is killed by Voldemort because Harry is quick to forgive.

Also I would think from my perspective... I had shitty, even bully teachers which I absolutely hated as a student. But after a while I got over it. Probably won't name my kids after any of them but if they had a cool name and would find out that they sacrificed their lives to protect me I might think about it.

** Tonks and Remus.

Basically, it was a case of "Pair the Spare" so they could die and have Harry act as the godfather Sirius should have been to him, to Teddy, in a "do over" of history with the next generation.

Tonks deserved better. Hell, Remus deserved better.

** The Dursleys never got any and Umbridge got not nearly enough comeuppance.

Probably the most f'ed up thing in the epilogue is that Draco was apparently out of prison in time to have kids the same age as the trio's.

I'm not sure anything ever happened to Fudge, whose corruption was fairly unambiguous and who could probably be convicted of treason with the right prosecutor. (Does anyone find it believable that he was still calling Harry a liar after the Azkaban breakout?)

This one's a little more controversial because Snape did have a pretty horrible life but I ragequit my last OotP reading because of how Snape treated Sirius in that book. The guy was in torture prison for 12 years, you got your fucking revenge, leave the guy alone.

** I think the Grangers getting obliviated and shipped to Australia shouldn't have happened.

1. Why didn't the order protect them?

2. Why should parents of muggleborns be so disconnected from the life of their 11 year old that ships away to a different and dangerous school? They have some experience with accidental magic surely. They know it's not all rainbows.

3. It seems like even wizards that are accepting of muggleborns treat muggles line 3 delightfully smart apes.

** What should have happened:

"I don't trust this Fidelius thing. If they get Peter, then what?" Grumbled Lily.

"That's ok, because they will never suspect Wormy." Laughed James.

"Are you willing to bet your life on that? Or our Harry's?"

"Ok, ok, so what do you have in mind?"

Lily stood up, walked to the entrance hall, and said "We need to place a trap here, a trap that could not be identified by conventional detection spells, a trap that could be activated by us easily."

She then walked over to the back entrance, and pointed to a spot "Another trap here, that should cover the ground floor. Even if he survives these traps, they will slow him down and give us time to prepare. Or Dumbledore could arrive with his Fawkes. Regardless, if he shows up, we will know who the spy is!"

"I see you have given many thoughts already, Lily. I don't think they would get Peter. But you are right, too much is at stake. Give me some time and I will add more ideas."

"We don't have much time left, James. If he is going to strike, it will be over the next few weeks. Halloween could definitely be a possibility. I say contact Dumbledore NOW. If he's unwilling to share some of his alchemical concoctions, then I'm going to break into an army warehouse and get us some Muggle bombs!"

** Shouldn't have happened:

Colin creevey dying

The epilogue (it's just too....sugary sweet for me. I would have preferred to read something like maybe a few months after the battle and the Weasleys (percy included), Hermione, harry and maybe teddy, are at the burrow for dinner and they just start sharing memories and have a toast to Fred and all that. Idk, it sounds better than what we were given)

** Late to the party, but...

Should have gotten more comeuppance:

- Malfoy family. No, a last minute change of heart does not excuse everything that happened between years 1 and 7.
- Dursleys. Dudley grows to be okay-ish and Petunia gets a humanizing moment, but they committed child-abuse and got away scot-free.
- Peter Pettigrew. For how much that life-debt was hyped up, it's sure collected on in an anticlimactic way.
- Severus Snape. Again, a last minute revelation does not excuse six/seven years of abuse, and Harry should absolutely not have named his kid after him.
- Umbridge. We have to rely on Word of God to hear that she's gotten any long-term comeuppance for... Well... Basically being /Umbridge/.
- Cornelius Fudge. Do we ever get to hear what happens to him, besides getting ousted from office?

Deserved Better:

- Hedwig. I genuinely prefer the way she died in the movies, /deliberately/ flying in the way of an inbound curse to save Harry. Dying to a stray curse in the sidecar of a motorcycle was a disservice.
- Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Alastor Moody. All play fairly major roles in the story, all of them die offscreen.
- Fred Weasley. Another casualty of the Battle of Hogwarts that really didn't need to happen.

There was no reason why they could not have been punished. And yet Rowling chose to just let bygones be bygones. It is her fictional universe and given how much she pushed her morals into the readers face with the DH ending, it is suspicious to say the least.
