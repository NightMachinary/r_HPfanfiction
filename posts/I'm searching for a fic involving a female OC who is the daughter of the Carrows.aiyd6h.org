I remember some plot elements but can't recall the title, and I forgot to favorite it on FFN.net. The OC shows up in the Forbidden Forest, and Harry finds her. It's set before sixth year I think. Sirius is alive and he's training Harry. The OC is the daughter of the Carrows who escaped. I'd love to be able to find it again because I hadn't finished reading it.
