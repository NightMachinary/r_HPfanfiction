I know FB is part of the HP universe but what I mean is fics that involve Harry Potter during Newts time or visa versa

Recently read Twist and Turn by Esama and while that was exactly the kind of thing I wanted... it's not been updated in over a year... I'll bookmark it anyway...

But yeah, any recs would be delightful.

/on a side note: I've noticed that there's not many FB fics on ffn, like 600? And none over say 450 faves? Ish? Weird. We've got loads on AO3/

*Twist and Turn*

** I've gone back and reread Twist and Turn twice already and every time I make a heartfelt wish that it gets completed! I'd even be willing to read someone's continuation of it, maybe Esama would be willing to allow that as a sort of challenge?

*** Oh god any kind of continuation I would love, I'm sure if the fic was down and linked as "inspired" it could be chill. Who ever did would be best letting then know tho

** While it's still not a ton of fic options, there are 165 fics on ffn.net that show up in the Harry Potter books when you filter for Newt S.

The one with the most faves is Against My Nature with over 6,000 faves. It's also a crossover with Newt and Harry! linkffn(12296472)

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
