** Linkffn(Mentordora Tonks) is a really nice, and interesting, example of this - it's as well written as anything Jlluh does, so it's definitely worth a read!

*** That one is a character assassination of Tonks. In canon, she's this bubbly, awesome girl who "lacked the ability to behave" while still kicking arse. In /Mentadora/ she is 1st week Hermione on crack. "Remember to do your homework Harry, you have to study more". It is not a terrible story, but a terrible Tonks characterisation.

**** That and the possible Harry/Tonks in the future bit in the summary is really creepy.

**** I really don't see that, honestly. The fic specifically differentiates them at several points, both in attitude and work ethic; moreover, Tonks is someone who made the grade for auror, and, concomitantly, is someone who needed the work ethic to get the grades for it. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.

  Seeing as he's her closest living relative who isn't her mother, a Malfoy, or a prisoner of Azkaban, seventh-year student Nymphadora Tonks takes first-year student Harry Potter under her wing. Possible Harry/Tonks when Harry's older?

*** I really love Tonks because her character allows you so many possibilities (at least if you go with her OoTP characterisation). Sadly Rowling decided that she and Ginny needed to have their awesome characteristics removed in HBP.

** linkffn(12745758)

Andromeda adopts Harry after the third year and a different encounter with Pettigrew. Over the course of the summer, he develops a sibling-like relationship with Tonks, even if they never refer to each other as brother/sister.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

** linkffn(11302568), Chapter 22 has both Tonks and Harry pranking each other in typical Wizarding World fashion. The rest of the pic is also pretty appealing for someone who wants to read a Dark!Harry that isn't completely grimdark or goes into Dumbledore or Weasely bashing

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

*** How exactly non linear is this narrative, I've passed on this one before hand out of unsureness over that, does it just mean flash backs on occasion or just random streams of consciousness

**** Starts beginning of Year 5 with Umbridge, then works its way backward for a bit with character PoVs and then coming back the present.

I would recommend you try it but well it seems abandonedðŸ˜ž. I like the author's spin on Dark!Harry though and the shifting character PoVs help do some worldbuilding on this AU. 186k words for a fic that spans Book 1 to 5 and then some is also quite economical
