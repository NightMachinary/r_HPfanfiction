linkffn(Hell's Champion by DanaCardinal)

linkffn(Not Your Typical Home by MidnightCharm18188)

linkffn(Cambion by FirebenderWhopper)

  On the job one night, Crowley discovers a house with a child being abused by a family. He takes the kid in and adopts him as his son. The child is Harry Potter before he ever got his letter to Hogwarts. This is a story of him growing up with Crowley and Gabriel as parental figures with all the obstacles that come with becoming part demon, part wizard, and all kinds of crazy.

  The night Voldemort came to the Potter's Lily brought her daughter to her old friend Crowley so he could look after her. He, along with Bobby, Sam, Dean and their angels looked after her and kept her out of Dumbledore's hands. Well, until she was forced to take part in the Triwizard tournament of course. Minor Crobby, Destiel and Sabriel. FemHarryXMichael. Some bashing.

  On his own one night, Crowley discovers a house where he hears a child being abused by his family. He takes the kid in and adopts him as his own son. The child: Harry Potter before he gets his Hogwarts letter. This is a story of him growing up with Crowley as his father and all the obstacles that come with becoming half demon; along with also being a wizard. (Not a romance story.)
