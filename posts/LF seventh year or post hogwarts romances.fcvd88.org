I'll take anything as long as it is well written ;) I prefer dark stories or stories that broach the subject of ptsd and war trauma or just a recovery story with some hurt/comfort. And some smut never hurt anyone.

Slash is welcomed and so are the strange or obscure ships( I do enjoy some slytherins in the mix)

I usually don't do one shots, but I'll gladly take any recs.

(No hate pls, but I like SS/HG, D/HG, D/HP ;) )

Thank youu
