What are some of your favorite, stories that have written Lavender Brown well? So many, tend be the same old, same old.

Not really, looking for her to be the main character, though she can be. Just something more then her usual, or she gets evolved somewhat.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any sites, can be any length, can be old or new.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)


** there really isn't enough good Lavender fic out there.

I love her in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209/chapters/25775856]]) and Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13975515/chapters/32175837]]) (both are wips, but the characterisation is good enough that I feel it's worth it)

And linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440/chapters/47238583]])

  When Luna is approached by ancient magicks for help with a particularly pesky problem, she sets in motion a prophecy involving a Werewolf, an irate Goddess and four marauders that will turn the Wizarding World on its head. Otherwise known as: How Luna tore apart the fabric of reality so that her friends could get decently laid, and accidentally saved the world in the process."Time Travel. Could there have been anything worse? After the past thirty years of war? It was finally over, but no. Not for Hermione Granger! Hermione Granger has to deal with space-time anomalies and causal loop theory and the consequences of others' actions."Time-Turner, EWE/AU, Wolf!Mate fic with all that follows in its wake. Previously named The Prophecy That Should Have Been.

  4th May, 2000: The Ministry of Magic passes its Marriage Act. Lavender Brown doesn't care. She really should. An experiment in SS/LB romance with lots of swearing, growling, and sass. They're both horrible people, but that's mostly okay.(Marriage Law. EWE. Werewolf!Lavender.)

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I adore Auror Lavender Brown (no spoilers of her other qualities!) in stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]], especially “Hunters and Prey” linkao3(1857084) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][stories with her and Mark Moon]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][stories of M.I.T. team]].

There is also “My Life as a Teenage Gladiator by 1hellyeahz1“ linkffn(13387005), which started very well, but I haven't seen any new chapter for long time.

And yes, I am still waiting on well-written story of Ron/Lavender, where they would decide after the Ron's poisoning to take their relationship seriously and start again as a real couple not just mutual tonsils investigation team.

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.

  No good deed goes unpunished. How does a fleeting act of compassion cause Lavender Brown's name to be drawn from the Goblet of Fire? And will she survive her unwanted journey into the world of warrior witches? Read on to find out. LavenderxRon Rated M for profanity in future chapters. Chapter Fourteen: Lavender finally talks to Trelawney.
