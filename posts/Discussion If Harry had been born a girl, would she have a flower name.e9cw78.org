How do you feel about female Harry Potter' with a flower name? Or even just a daughter from James and Lily, named after a flower? And do you think that Lily would have named their daughter after a flower?

If so, what flower do you like and dislike for a female Harry? Or a daughter in general.

If, you don't think that James and Lily would name their daughter after a flower, what could you see them naming her?

For me, I could see it going either way, either a flower name or a non flower name. Harry isn't anything named to a plant or flower, so I could see James and Lily not naming their daughter after a flower, but I could also see them naming her after a flower.

So many people often have female Harry named after a flower though, Petunia and Lily are named after flowers, though Harry and Dudley aren't named after any kind of plant life or anything. It doesn't mean it's a family tradition, and even if it is a family tradition, I could see Lily and Petunia breaking that tradition (maybe they hate their name and don't want their child to have that same issue).

Some people are like that. For instance, some people who have very normal sounding names, will name their child a very out there name, because they want to change things up.

While later on, the child is grown up, having a child of their own, hates their weird name/doesn't want to have their child to be made fun of, and gives their child a more normal name.

That kind of thing has happened before, so it makes me curious. Are you okay with James and Lily naming their daughter after a flower? If so what flower names do you like and flat out hate?

If not, what names do you like for a daughter for James and Lily?


** If she did, I think it would be most likely to be the name Holly, to copy paste something I found:

“While it's mostly the leaves and the berries of the holly that gets people's attention, it's the flowers that mean protection and defense. Apart from being defense from thunder, witchcraft and things like that, it's also a symbol of a happy home life.” [[https://www.auntyflo.com/flower-dictionary/holly-flower]]

This works on multiple levels. The first is why James and Lily would choose that name. Because it's referring to the holly flower, the name represents what they want to protect in the fight against Voldemort. To protect a happy home life as a family against witchcraft or more specifically the dark arts.

Then we consider what happens to the Potters on Halloween 1981. Lily's love for Holly through her act of naming her so provides protection from the killing curse (witchcraft) leaving only a /lightning bolt/ scar.

Then we consider Holly herself. Her desire as shown through the Mirror of Erised, to see her parents and to have a /happy home life/ with them. She's exited to get away from the Dursley's to live with Sirius, The Burrow (a happy home) is one of her favourite places in the Wizarding World, and she is endlessly self-sacrificing, multiple times putting aside her safety and happiness for the sake of the one's she loves. Not to mention the many, /many/ times she saves someone else's life.

She goes to a school of /Witchcraft/ and Wizardry, and her best subject is /Defence against the Dark Arts./ (Dark Arts being referred to previously as witchcraft.) She's in the house of the Brave and Chivalrous, the knights defending others.

Then we have to consider the symbolism of lightning and thunder in the series. Lighting is mentioned very sparingly, but the moments I remember are her scar, the lightning when the Grim is at the Quidditch game and the chapter title Lightning Struck Tower where spoilers spoilers Snape kills Dumbledore. I'm not good at symbolism, so Super Carlin Brothers' video on why Harry/Holly has a lightning bolt scar would be a better explanation. [[https://youtu.be/VW2fe5YTWxU]]

And then at the end of it all, what does she end up with? A family and happy home life with three kids, and One Big Weasley Family in law. What she and her parents who named her always wanted.

In other words, this is why Harry's wand was made out of Holly.

** I'm more inclined now that she gets named after relatives from her father's side. Dorea or Euphemia Lily Potter works for me.

  Euphemia
#+end_quote

Yeah, no. Like, a really big no in a shiny color with underlines and bells and a little bow. I refuse to believe anyone was named Euphemia or Fleamont. It sounds like a disease. Or someone trying to clear their throat of snot. Some people might dislike it, but I really like "Honour Thy Blood" and the backstory it gave to Harry's grandparents. Dorea and Charlus sound like badasses. Euphemia and Fleamont sounds just... blergh.

** I think I've read a fic sort of about this, only with a still male Harry. Sirius was queuing up outside Hogwarts with him (while he was still unnamed by the Potters) in order to get him on the enrolment list and there was a whole conversation in there somewhere with other people in the queue about what they'd name the kid and if Sirius should just make it up for them instead. I remember a bit where they ask if the Potters are going to follow the 'Evans family tradition' of flower names and there's a little bit where they throw about boy flower names like Alder or Basil or Florian or something. It's been awhile since I read it, but I remember the flower conversation being interesting.

I mean, considering the fact that Rowling has a 'wolf-wolf' the werewolf in canon, terrible flower names wouldn't exactly be out of character for canon. If not flowery, then I expect semi-regular (for the time and culture) names would probably be picked - Jane or Amy or Emily or whatever and no 'Amarathea'-s or 'Violetta'-s or whatever.

** Yes, I think it would be a flower name, I like such family traditions and I would support it (I have Betelgeuse Black as a founder of the Black family in linkao3(11233098)).

Daughter of James & Lilly in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][my fanfiction]] (not a fem!Harry, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf_harry_ginny_are_brother_and_sister/][Ginny who is not a Weasley girl]]) is Rose Potter. However when you look at this [[https://nameberry.com/list/97/Flower-Names-for-Girls][huge list of flower girl names]] you find plenty of names which are rather nice, not only the horrific ones. And yes, I liked Holly from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]], or just remotely related [[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation/][Esther Dursley]] (alluding to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(genus][Aster]])), there are useable names.
