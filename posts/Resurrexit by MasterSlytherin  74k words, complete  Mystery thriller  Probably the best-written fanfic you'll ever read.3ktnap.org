** -Features a drunk Lucius Malfoy chasing around his peacocks.

Yep, best story ever.

On a serious note though: while I haven't finished it yet, it seems to be an exceptional read.

** Just read it after I saw it was up for review on DLP. This was absolutedly amazing, a very plausible dark harry, plot twists, extremely well written, and the best part is that it isn't bloated at all, it's the perfect length for this story. In my opinion this is one of the best stories in this fandom, if not the best.

** "Best-written ever" always sounds like an exaggeration but I have to admit this story was really beautiful. If it was the best I have read I do not now but it is certainly among the top 5.

It just lays one problem... like all those fantastic, emotional fics... how do I get in the mood for the next one?

** Very reminiscent to MasterSlytherin's other good work - What Lies Beneath. Linkffn(What Lies Beneath by MasterSlytherin)

It actually holds a lot of the same themes. The self-destruction of loss. Distrust of the government. Collateral damage in pursuit of a selfish goal. It was actually a bit too similar to WLB. I was able to predict most of the plot events, but that shouldn't take away from the Resurrexit.

It's still very well constructed, well written, and most importantly - finished.

  COMPLETE. H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller

** Thanks for all your kind comments, and to Taure for recommending the story!

One of the consistent themes I'm getting in the story's feedback is that it's very fast-paced and similar to What Lies Beneath, my other story. I think that's a fair comment: my style is to limit sub-plots and extraneous characters. That probably comes from my very 21st century short attention span!

The debate about whether to post the story at once is an interesting one. On one hand, as btr154 rightly said, the fandom is such that you sacrifice the hype that goes with a WIP. However, my feeling was that this is a story that needs to be read as an ensemble. If, for example, I posted the shorter chapters such as 'Fall of the Peacock' and left a time gap of even a few days, the pace of the story would be lost. Equally, I had to complete the story before posting to make sure the foreshadowing and consistency was tight.

Thanks again!

** Thanks for the rec! I enjoy reading fics where the survivors of the war deal with emotional loss and psychological scars. This fic was right up my alley. The terse writing reflected the overall grim mood of the story. And can I just add that I love Neville in this story?

Best-written fanfic is a bit of a stretch but very well written no doubt. This fic reminded me a lot of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]]
