Make it silly. Make it serious. Fill in any plot holes yourself.


** Harry puts on the sorting hat in the chamber and instead of the sword of Gryffindor, because he knows about the elder wand, it drops that instead.

Harry kills the basilisk with the elder wand by levitating it to the top of the chamber and dropping it to the floor, and one of its teeth falls out and randomly hits the diary, killing the horcrux.

** Harry has neither the knowledge of wizarding culture to know about the Elder Wand nor is he a bookworm. Hermione might figure something like that out, but only if Ron told her about the story of the Hallows.

*** Oh my God. I just mentioned fill in the plot holes.

Lack of knowledge is not a plot hole when it comes to solving a mystery.

Hermione didn't figure it out in book 7, that was all Harry.

I'm saying, given these clues, write a prompt. It's not supposed to be a platform to argue the feasibility.

**** 1st year Harry didn't mind reading books or researching, especially when he had a bee in his bonnet.

You just need someone to introduce the story to him. Has to be right before or after he gets his cloak. Ginny or Mrs. Weasley can give the book to him for Christmas maybe.

***** See that's plausible. Hell, have Harry mention the lack of books in the Dursley household and McGonagall gets it for him.

****** If we're sticking with canon Harry, I can't see him doing that, but Ron /did/ mention Harry possibly getting presents to his mother, so that's why I said those two.

A possible Harry Ã— Ginny beginning. There's also his teammates, Hagrid, or Dumbledore himself really. I /can/ see Dumbledore giving it to him. A subtle way of connecting him to his family.

******* Book 1 Dumbledore? Yeah I can see him giving Harry a children's book. Hagrid doesn't seem inclined to read all that much. McGonagall is way too aloof. But changing canon is half the fun.

As Ginny wasn't at Hogwarts yet, maybe not her. Although if you find fics where she's really good friends with Harry before dating him, I'd be much obliged.

******** I could see McGonagall giving it to him if she does it anonymously. She has to look like the stereotypical English school marm, so she does like Dumbledore does and just doesn't sign it.

********* I've never seen marm in usage before.

Honestly, McGonagall gets too much hype in fanfiction. I think she was one of the first of many adults who failed Harry.
