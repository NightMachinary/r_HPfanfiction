I'd really like to read something about Hermiones home and her parents getting in contact with other wizards!


** A lot of Hermione's parents interaction with wizards can be seen in linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) (with Harry throughout the work; with others mainly towards the end) and in linkffn(Rocking the Boat by DerLaCroix). No home visits except in passing, though.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
