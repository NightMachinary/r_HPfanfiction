** I like Self-Fashioning a lot, but it's starting to meander in the more recent chapters.

Harry experimenting with transfiguration is super neat, and teaching Yar to crush wand wands is clever and something I hadn't seen before. I like the characterization of McGonagall, although Dumbledore gets on my nerves a little (although that's probably the point because Harry doesn't like Dumbledore much either).

But like I said, I feel like the story is starting to slow down a bit. The subplot with Regulus has been going on for a couple chapters now, and not a whole lot has happened. More to the point, due to some revelations from Regulus, it seems as if it may in fact be impossible for Harry to return his parents back to sanity. I'm not even sure if the author realizes it, and ended up writing themselves into a corner, or if there is something else at play that I missed entirely.

I hope that it's the latter, but even if it something else, I can only hope that it isn't just a deus ex machina moment of, "oh wow I never thought to feed them lemon juice, they're cured!"

I have high hopes that this fic will end well as everything thus far has been great. Fingers crossed!

*** I thought the whole point of this fic was that Harry is obsessed and crazy. Regulus is just the first one to try to explain this to him.

The Harry in Self-Fashioning is completely nuts, without the bullshit Too Young to Die used to do so.

And don't try the whole "Dumbledore's spell messed up" explanation for it. Is still bullshit, and not something Dumbledore would do in the first place.

** I liked it more as Harry mellowed a little, I couldn't empathise with him earlier and struggled a bit. The most recent chapter is excellent, I enjoyed Regulus telling Harry how it is and I thought it was a realistic (if unexpected) plot development.

** It reminds me in a way of The green girl, because Harry is a hidden genius powerful manipulator. It only manages to not go over the board into Mary Sue territory like that one did just because he's insane and there are signs that in the end his card castle will crumble all around him. And the writing is much better, but that goes without saying.

** I really like it, but I agree that the Regulus plot's been a bit slow, despite the interesting implications for Harry's parents. I loved that it focused on transfiguration, I hadn't seen anything like it before.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Dudley Dursley had a very nice life. A good job, a nice house, a loving family. He even had his parents living nearby. Then, one short walk with his four year old daughter changed that all.

** I liked it quite a lot, particularly the discussion on Magic theory (the Wand, Word, Will and Wild bit). It feels really fleshed out. I have to agree that the later chapters are meandering though and I have no idea where the story will end up now. Hopefully the author turns it around!

** I started disliking it since I read the scene with Remus and Snape ind the DADA classroom. The Harry in it just isn't for me. Also, I generally like seeing the hero succeed, so Regulus is kind of killing my vibe here.

** Review to The Art of Self Fashioning:

Note: I think someone should see as to how well the REVIEWS themselves are written, and they should have a proper format, like Prose; Concept, Pace etc.

Moving back to review itself: Prose: The story has been written decently, it doesn't have glaring grammar and spelling mistakes, but it can definitely use some polishing. The dialogue tags are, in some places, somewhat incorrect, and comments on how some things happen are somewhat odd; i.e.:

"His gaze went to Minerva's robes, before he straightened up and yelled, "FREAK!" The straightening part just doesn't make much sense, but I digress, the prose is decent, but not anything special and as such, I would rate the prose in itself 3/5.

Concept: The concept is as refreshing as can be with hundreds- nay, hundreds of THOUSANDS of fics out there. The idea of a Harry that uses transfiguration is once again somewhat appealing to me; as I remember quite clearly that in OotP I was shocked yet pleased that a seemingly harmless art could end in wizards being made legends. But once again, the concept has been taken into consideration many times, so it isn't OMGAMAZEBALLS but it does have it's own shine. 4/5.

Execution of said concept: It's not done so that- BAM- fuck all of you bitches that have studied this art for years and years, I'm gonna show all of you up- dear god no. The art is shown to be subtle and as such, is very appealing to me. 4/5.

Pace: I don't know, it feels to me that in the latest chapters it has wandered elsewhere from the path the author had originally set. 3.5/5.

All in all, 72/100 is the score I'd give.

** I've held back on this one for a while, a DLP review soured me on it for some reason, and I just never got to it.

Well, after a day of utter boredom at work, I decided to give it a shot. I'm not quite sure if it was worth it or not.

Read it in a couple sittings, which gave me more time to digest it. I thought it was a good /attempt/ at showing a damaged child, but not really well done. I've gotta be honest, I didn't buy the idea of a super cold child at that age, barely even human.

That's the key here, and I think the story lives and dies on it. If you like the idea, you'll probably like the story. I didn't. I've seen damaged children before, and not once have I ever seen one come out so cold and in control. I've seen them needy, I've seen them angry and cut off, lashing out at everyone. But cold and focused like a laser guided missile? No, not once.

That's where it all breaks apart for me. I couldn't believe the character, so I found everything that followed hollow.

It's very interesting in its own way. The magic is cool, and the use of transfiguration is awesome. I just wish there was more to Harry in over 100k words.
