So just a sudden thought. I have been reading so much fanfiction lately I wonder whether or not people would like a YouTube channel entirely devoted to harry potter fanfiction. Every paring, genre, and crossover from all sights. Ofcourse we would state who the Arthur is and rating. I am not going to steal others work just trying to get there work out there in another way for people to enjoy.
