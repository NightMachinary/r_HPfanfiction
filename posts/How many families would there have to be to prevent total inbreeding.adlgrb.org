I know very little about biology, but 28 families + a few more wouldn't work.


** 28 families is sufficient.

15 individuals, 8 males and 7 females are certainly enough to create a sustainable population, capable of growth without any out-breeding, albeit with some genetic diseases due to in-breeding.

The reason we know this is because of a small island on the Atlantic Ocean, Tristan da Cuhna, which has a robust, growing population of 266 (May 2016), and have been inhabited for about 200 years. All people living on the island can derive themselves from 15 individuals, 8 males and 7 females. The population is a textbook example taught in genetics courses.

Which is what OP wants to avoid. 56 people (28 men, 28 women) would be stretching it, but might be possible if done correctly (which was unlikely in the middle ages).

**** Keep in mind too that it's all probabilities. First cousins having kids have still-minor increased odds of issues, but if a family makes this a custom the odds get higher each generation. The odds never reach one, and no matter how unrelated the couple is they never reach zero.

***** Yeah, but with a thousand years to go by (Malfoy is connected to the Norman conquest) and everyone related to 56 people, the probability is probably a lot closer to 1 than to 0. And while not everyone would be inbred, there would be more than one who could rival the Spanish Habsburgs.

** By my understanding, it is extremely dependant on number of generations.

For example, you could probably have children with a first cousin and the child will come out perfectly healthy. Repeat that over many generations and you get the health defects of inbreeding.

Considering multiple children in a family so marriages between a family and multiple other families, by the second generation of children there could be a shared ancestor (if one family had 15 children and those children married into entirely different families who had only a single child each), and can take up to 5 generations before a married couple has a common ancestor (each pair has only a single child and the child never marries if there is a common ancestor)

Tldr; it depends on number of children and number of generations.

** The 28 Sacred Families thing is a book that was written by a Nott. It contains only the families that he considered to be not only pure enough but of good standing in society. There is no evidence in canon that purebloods are limited to marrying people from those same 28 families. The Black Family does seem to try and keep things British, pureblood, and to marry people of good standing in the British Society, but there's no rule that other families can't marry foreign wizards and witches or that you can't select a family that hasn't been “pureblood” for that long. Keep in mind that the Shacklebolt, Abbotts, and Longbottoms are in that list and they hardly strike me as the kind if families that would want to do inbreeding for the sake of purity. Even the Black family doesn't really take things that far. We know that Bellatrix's grandmother was a Crabbe and that Dorea Black married a Potter, and neither the Crabbe Family nor the Potter Family is in the Sacred 28 list.

** Ummm... is this specific to the British Magical community? Because there are way more than 28 families - there are 40 or 42 first year students in 1991, one set of twins and only a handful of them are muggleborns. Even if 30% of families decided the middle of a civil war (1980) was the perfect time to have a kid, that still would mean there would have had to have been some 100 families. Beyond that, the 28 families is a list made up by an anti-muggle blood supremacist who pretty much only included families he was closely related to or was friends with.

** What do you mean by "total inbreeding"? Do you mean "no consanguineous marriages ever" (commonly defined as no first cousins or anyone more related than that marrying)?

Or do you mean that occasionally consanguinity may occur (say, first cousin marriage), but never at a high enough frequency to cause inbreeding depression (lowered fertility, infertility, and more genetic diseases)?

**** Although I don't want to give you another "it depends" answer, it really does depend.

Based on the info in the canon, I don't think that inbreeding would be a huge problem among wizards, even purebloods.

So, the "Sacred 28" families were identified by Salazar Slytherin (presumably around ~1000 AD, when he lived). That would be 20-40 generations of inbreeding. I did run some simulations and didn't see any bad effects if I allowed my "purebloods" to "breed randomly" after their bottleneck size of 56, for 1000 years. If I kept the population size artificially small around 56, more problems started to pop up (when was wizard birth control invented? LOL). Also, population subdivision would cause far more issues to occur (e.g. if a Weasley would rather die than breed with a Malfoy, that would mean they're functionally in different "populations" as they cannot produce offspring). Population subdivision is the culprit behind the prevalence of genetic disorders among the Amish. They had about 200 founders, but those founders were geographically separated into much smaller subdivisions due to geography and religious/cultural differences.

Returning to HP canon, the concept of pureblood supremacy doesn't seem to take until the 1930. So, that would only be about 2 generations of intermarriage. If you number the families 1-28, it would be easy for the offspring of family 1 (e.g. Lestrange) to pair up with the offspring from family 2 (e.g. Black) and then in generation 2, the Black-Lestrange child has to just not marry someone from those two families. Not hard at all. Although, with subdivisions this becomes a little more difficult, and the more generations they've been holding to pureblood ideology, the more difficult, which is why Sirius is the product of second cousins, not likely to be harmful without those second cousins being more related than they "should" be because their ancestors were also marrying relatives.

JKR isn't very consistent (shocker) about when "pureblood supremacy" became a prevalent idea. But if we go with the 1930 date she offered, then there would have been no reason for Sirius's parents to be related at all. However, it seems the idea of wizards-marrying-wizards was at least somewhat prevalent before that date. That said, it doesn't take much "migration" per generation (in this case, a wizard marrying a foreigner or muggle) to introduce a healthy amount of genetic variation. According to JKR, all the "pureblood" families did this, except for the Blacks, Gaunts, and Lestranges.

Based on that info, it makes sense that specifically the Blacks, Gaunts, and Lestranges were more likely to suffer from low genetic diversity, but there were other factors, like population subdivision (e.g. the Gaunts would only have children with other Slytherin descendants, or am I making that up..?) According to JKR even Malfoys didn't always marry "pure."

If you're writing an AU where purebloods really will NOT EVER marry halfbloods, muggles, or foreigners, then yes, you will absolutely need more families to prevent inbreeding depression. You'll need about 2000 founding families to make that work indefinitely.

Also, there are 28 /English/ families, but there is always the possibility of interbreeding with foreign wizards and witches.

**** Yeah, but we know there are basically no true Purebloods left in the Wizarding World. There doesn't need to be more than 28 families for the Wizarding World to make sense, because nobody is /actually/ trying to maintain a breeding population out of the 28, they just kind of whistle and pretend that they are.

***** Absolutely not. The theory that after the Toba supervolcano humanity was "bottlenecked" to 30-10,000 individuals, while debunked now, was not ignored because of biological impossibilities. 200,000 is an insane number

Furthermore, /"A 2005 study from Rutgers University theorized that the pre-1492 native populations of the Americas are the descendants of only 70 individuals who crossed the land bridge between Asia and North America."/

Another theory suggests population numbers in Sub-Saharan Africa was as low as 2,000 at one point. And as mentioned above, Tristan de Cuhna had 15 original people, and only suffer relatively minor degenerations due to inbreeding.

***** Effective population is considered about 3100 humans of breeding age.

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1832099/]]

This is assuming those people are left to their own devices. With strict controls on over who those people are allowed to have children with, a smaller number could be viable.

And even a far smaller number could make a comeback for the human race, but then there would be quite a few problems from inbreeding before it would work itself out. (assuming those inbreeding problems aren't too habsburgian)
