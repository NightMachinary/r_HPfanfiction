He goes back to the four Founder's era, explains his predicament, and trains to defeat Voldemort.


** Why would the founders know more magic than people more than a thousand years after them? If anything Harry would be the one teaching them spells.

*** I suppose if there was a spell that required a specific counter and it was entirely disused by modern times it could be quite useful simply because noone would know how to stop it.

*** Spells that were common knowledge that fell out of use in the periods between the era of the Founders and present day?

Nearly every story I've ever read in fantasy that had magical civilizations depicts the older civilizations capable of far more advanced magic than present day iterations, only to pull an Icarus and "fly too high" only to be brought low.

**** Sure its a common fantasy trope, but only because its what Tolkien did and he did it to echo the Christian ideas of a fall from grace (ala adam&eve expelled from eden). We aren't given any indication that this is the case in the HPverse, though fanon does love using Atlantis, and occasionally Avalon, for this purpose.

In real life, advanced ancient civilizations might have used methods now obscure to us but the actual accomplishments are something we do have the technical ability to achieve. This is what i expect to be the case in the HP verse.

** First one that springs to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550820/1/Strange-Visitors-From-Another-Century][/Strange Visitors From Another Century/ by Izzyaro]], which has the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione travel back n time from the battle at the Department of Mysteries. It's still in progress, and it was last updated in February.

  The destruction of the time turners in the Department of Mysteries throws Harry, Ron and Hermione a thousand years into the past. There they meet the Founders of Hogwarts, who are not at all pleased about what has happened to their school. They decide that something must be done.

*** I don't like that fic.Even if it's good, the author paints Harry as a naive idiot that just uses Stupefy.When in the books he's Ruthless, umpredictable and reckless, he's a great duelist and uses curses like reducto, confringo and sectumsempra and more often than not two of the unforgivables.But this fic... god this fic just portrays him as a child, he even loses a duel against a simple grunt.

**** I think you're confusing canon Harry with fanon Harry. At the point in time the that story starts, during the Battle of the Deparment of Mysteries, Harry cast stunning spells and impediment jinxes. His one blasting hex was directed at the shelves of prophecies to distract the Death Eaters as he ran, and he hadn't cast the cruciatus curse yet(which he didn't even cast successfully the first time).

In all the books, he never actually uses the unforgivables while actively dueling. His usage of sectumsempra was in response to violence, before he knew what the spell did. After that point he didn't use the spell against a living being.

Also, during the Department of Mysteries, Harry had the advantage of being up against people who were expressly ordered /not/ to kill him, and to whom "combat" was a hobby, and often against people who had no defense against them(they often attacked anyone skilled with overwhelming force). Even when the aurors showed up, they were encouraged to take them alive

The founders' era was an entirely different culture. For them, combat wasn't just a hobby, it was literally life-and-death. Death Eaters were basically hobbyists that fancied themselves lords of the world by the grace of magic, who went out and did cruel things to people who couldn't protect themselves when the mood struck them .

That "simple grunt" from /Strange Visitors/ probably fought for his life more often in a single month than an average death eater did for an entire year.

Just like I wouldn't expect an Olympic duelist to win a sword fight in the middle ages.
