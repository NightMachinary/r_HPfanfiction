He hasn't updated any of his stories in years. Did he just quit? Did he pass on to the next great adventure? I just want to know, because it's kinda maddening to read such enjoyable writing that is unfinished.


** I'm curious about this too, but I wouldn't be surprised if some authors keep their private life entirely private and we never hear from them again. I sure hope he's hanging out on an island in the caribbean and not... you know... dead.

** I vaguely remeber him being sick, like bad sick, around the time he last updated but I cannot remeber where I heard it so take it with a grain of salt.

** I always enjoyed his work. Muggle Summer was a bit of a slog at times but I really enjoyed it.

I'd just say that people change, people move on. I'm sure wherever he is, he's just fine.
