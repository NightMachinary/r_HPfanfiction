What do you guys prefer? Would you rather have shorter but regular chapters or longer but infrequent?


** I refuse to read works that aren't complete because I've been let down too many times when an author is updating on a rather regular schedule and suddenly nothing for two years.

I'd prefer longer but regular, even if that's two months between updates. The only author I've kept track of worth a WIP lately is bex-chan, and I follow her on Tumblr anyway.

** Personally, shorter but frequent. I read a lot of different fics, there are some in my FF.net alerts that update so infrequently when I do get a notice about an update I can't remember anything at all about the story.

** I find that a good balance is between 4000-6000 words per chapter and one new chapter every two weeks.

I don't like chapters that are >6000 words. Then I feel like it takes forever to get through it and I would need to make time especially for that chapter. And smaller than 4000 is really just too short. That doesn't mean that you should stretch it out needlessly if a chapter happens to be a bit shorter, but just make sure that things actually happen in them that advance the plot.

As for timeframe:

A new chapter every few days is the best, but not really realistic for people that have a life. But longer than a few weeks and I forget what's going on.

** Thanks for the feedback guys! I've decided to go for 4-6k long chapters and update 1-2 times a week. I thought about doing 10k long chapters but it would just take to much time and demotivate me. I guess I'm one of those people that like stalking the stats page lol.

** I like longer chapters, more like those in epic fantasy. Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring (prologue and books one and two collected together) is 27 chapters long at 187,790 words. That's about 7000 words per chapter, including the average-skewing and rather short and punchy Prologue.

Anything less than about that 7-8k feels short to me, even in fanfic. There isn't enough room to have multiple scenes flow into each other if they get too much shorter, which to me is a problem in serially published fiction.

That isn't a hard rule, though. If a fanfiction author got away with a stylistically short chapter structure in an epic story, something that really added to the tale with each chapter's brevity, I'd clap the hardest. Surprise short chapters with a quick update schedule are also sort of cool, though maybe not for everyone reading updates as they happen.

Too many times, the length of fanfic chapters are dictated by how long the writer has had to write that week. Good rules can help make good art, but over-regularity is the bane of the creative results. I prefer natural stops in narrative, or even serial-fiction tropes of cliffhangers and dramatic breaks, to exactly the same chapter size every time and ending in the middle of a scene for no reason other than reaching some arbitrary word limit.

** As a 'writer', I've been doing about a chapter per week for the past year, short chapters of 3000 to 5000 words. Much more is just not possible for me to write and error check in my free time.

This reflects my own preferences. As a reader, I dislike infrequent updates. I'd rather have shorter chapters on a regular schedule than a fic that does not update for weeks and then has a 10k+ chapter.

** There are a couple of considerations. How frequently will you update? How many characters are focused on? What genre is it?

If no matter what you will be updating once a month or less frequently, a larger chapter is important to refresh the memory, and get your point across.

A lot of characters mean needing more space for each, unless you want to alternate chapters. The problem with that is it can desync the time in the readers mind.

Finally, the genre. I find romances and comedies benefit heavily from short but frequent updates. While drama and political plots are better in longer chunks.

*** It's a Snape mentors Harry fic. Currently I've been doing approx 5k words every two days. But I have yet to find a beta reader to edit it so once I do find one, updates will most likely take a bit longer. The story is mainly focused on Harry and Snape with Dumbledore/Voldemort/Ron/Hermione and the Dursleys as side characters.
