Because it seems like it ended in the first book, which is a damn shame. As a matter of fact, the character development was pretty light IMO (plot-driven) in Harry Potter, so anything that builds on that works for me.


** Ron fully embracing himself as an individual and realising he doesn't need to compare himself to anyone. Have him kill Dolohov or Rookwood during the Battle to give him a moment.

*** He and Neville killed Greyback, the guy who wanted to rape/eat his girlfriend and almost killed his ex. I dont think adding Dolohov or Rockwood would add much.

**** Personally I interpreted that line as Ron distracting Greyback so Neville could kill him with the Sword. I wanted him to directly take out a high ranking Death Eater himself

***** The line is

#+begin_quote
  *He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback,* Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.
#+end_quote

And one of the last line he said before that was

#+begin_quote
  “I wanna help --- I wanna kill Death Eaters ---”
#+end_quote

after Fred died, I doubt Ron wouldnt have killed him himself. Why would Neville even use a sword in combat, he is a wizard.

** I think both Ron AND Hermione could have needed some better development in the later books. For the first three or four books, they both follow a pretty clear path: Ron is the overlooked, underappreciated underdog with self-esteem issues ... Hermione's the brainy overachiever with an extremely underdeveloped social intelligence. He needs to find his confidence and stop letting other people's opinions get to him, while she needs to learn to respect and appreciate that other people sometimes have valid things to say.

For the first three books, this is the path they're going down...

... and then around GOF/OOTP the development gets massively derailed by a shift in tone, and more and more we get "Hermione can do no wrong" and "Ron can do no right." It's more prominent in the films, but it's definitely there in the books as well.

Ron's development halts because he always has to be in the wrong and never gets to come into his own, and the successes he DOES have tend to be either offscreen, or immediately overshadowed by Harry and/or Hermione doing something bigger, better and more important to the plot.

Hermione's development halts because her mistakes are swept under the rug and ignored; either it turns out that she in SOME way was right all along and everything would have been better if everyone had just listened to her, or her mistakes are presented in such a way that Hermione herself is blameless; she was provoked by mean people, you can't blame her for not knowing something that NOBODY ELSE knew, and so on and so forth.

I think much of the fault lies with how JKR is reluctant to ever get out of Harry's head. I think both Ron and Hermione would have benefitted HUGELY as characters if they each got a few chapters every book in which they got to be the POV characters. Sure, Harry can still be the POV character most of the time, but for a few chapters every book, let's follow Ron and Hermione, get to thow their minds and how they see the world... maybe even give them their own subplot independent of Harry. It would have given more room for exploring and developing them as characters.

*** Hermione's wrong to dismiss Harry's concerns about Draco in OOTP so completely.

**** EVERYBODY does that, though. It's not something HERMIONE is wrong about, it's something EVERYBODY is wrong about.

I'd also say that this falls under the "who can blame her when" point, because Harry's suspicions really only boils down to "he has to be guilty because I don't like him." Yeah, Draco's been a massive douche in the five previous books, but he's also been an extremely INCOMPETENT douche. Anyone who vaguely knows him would have problems believing Voldemort would recruit this clown for anything. Of course, the reason Voldemort recruited Draco was because he was EXPECTING him to fail, in order to punish Lucius and Narcissa... but that's another "it's not fair to expect Hermione to know this" moment.

***** There's an element of that, but Hermione dismisses everything on that basis. She doesn't even consider it might be true independent of the rivalry. Harry didn't imagine the Malfoys going into Borgin & Burke's, that there were other Death Eaters there, or that they took pains not to be observed. She doesn't credit his accurate observations about Draco's changes in behavior. That should at least have merited some sleuthing to find out if anything was going on.

****** I don't disagree, but again, Hermione is not blamed for any of this in-story. That's my point. Her mistakes are either glossed over, or turn out to not have been mistakes, or excused because it wasn't REALLY her fault that she didn't have enough info.

We as fans might point out Hermione's mistakes, but as the series goes on, the books increasingly do not. And that is what I think is detrimental to Hermione's character growth.

** I think Canon (book at least ) gives some good development, PS Ron can't be compared to DH Ron, he did grow up.

If I had to change anything, maybe having Arthur dying in OotP could have showed him the reality of the War faster than in Canon and forced to grow up. Also having the truth coming out later and having people giving his father a stupid moniker like "The-First-Victim-of-the-War " or "The-First-Fallen " would have helped him understand why people hate his fame or talking about his parents. And he could have helped Harry more after the MoM debacle, both grieving together. But well, considering Harry did'nt seem to really change after the death of Sirius, there is no reason Ron would have changed even if the events played differently.

** Have Ron always stand by Harry. They're bros. When Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, it'd be Ron swearing up and down that Harry wouldn't do that, and that they were always together so he'd be the one to know if Harry had done any trickery.

Also, have Ron and Hermione's roles reversed in Deathly Hallows- he's the one cooking, the one looking anew at old legends and the one who stays with Harry when Hermione loses her patience with their 'unplanned wandering'. Have Hermione be the one with the Deluminator who needs to find her way back to them.

Ron is the one with faith. Hermione is the one with reason. They got mixed up.

**** This thread is about changing Ron's character arc. If JKR had done as I suggest, she would have made Ron the modern archetype for loyalty; 'Be like my Ron' would be a watchword/meme, and no one would question his value. Hermione's primary function was to be the doubter, the worrier, the explainer, and the outsider. If she had 'countless' acts of faith over reason when it came to Harry, these two periods wouldn't erase that for her. As it is, her behavior in book 6 runs contrary to that assumption, from start to finish.
