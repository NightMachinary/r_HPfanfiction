Harry tried to ignore them for a while and then he heard, "Mr. Potter!"

Harry looked towards Umbridge who was still searching in her drawer for something, "Yes Professor?"

"No, over here Mr. Potter!" Harry turned his attention towards one of the cats in the pictures. "We don't like you very much!"

"Well I don't like you much either," responded Harry dryly.

"Mr. Potter, you don't remember me? Us? You used to come play with us. With Mr. Paws and Snowy and Tufty and Mr. Tibbles. You stopped coming."

"Uhm," Harry took a moment to remember where he had heard those names before, "I was a bit busy."

"Liar! Mr. Tribbles spied on you the whole summer and told us that all you were doing was lying comfy in your relatives' garden. You know our hooman's been really sad about you not coming around anymore."

"Wait... but I saw Mrs. Figgs this summer."

"Yeah, when she came to save you and your fat cousin."

"In case you haven't noticed I'm being hunted by the Darkest Wizard of all times so I don't really have time to play with some..."

"Lies! And we'll punish you for it, Mr. Potter."

"... Mr. Potter? Mr. Potter?" Harry suddenly snapped back to reality as a hand with chubby fingers was being waved in front of his eyes. He then noticed Umbridge handing him a black quill. "Mr. Potter I'd like you to write /I must not tell lies/."

"How many times?"

"Until the message sinks in," said Umbridge and for a brief second Harry thought her eyes flashed a yellow color.

** "Uh, there might be a problem with that," Harry said, smiling sheepishly.

"Umbridge" and her ceramic cohorts looked at each other, frowning or scowling. "And what problem would that be, Mr. Potter?"

/"Me."/

Umbridge whirled around, and every cat on every plate had backed up to their respective edges, paws scrabbling against the ceramic as though they were hoping to escape their confines.

Umbridge's wand fell from slackened fingers.

"Hi, Auntie," Harry said, wincing and looking as though he'd like to join his would-be tormentors in running for the hills. "What are you doing here?"

Her whiskers twitched in annoyance, and the woman slid into the ostentatious chair that would have suffered from Umbridge's rear-end. The shadows concealing her head dissipated like smoke in an autumn breeze, revealing the terrifying muzzle and face of a lioness atop a young woman's body.

She arched an eyebrow and stared at him as though he were Crabbe and Goyle having a particularly slow day. "My favourite pet was about to be tormented by /little kitties/ that should have known better."

"I had it handled," Harry said weakly.

She scoffed. "You'd have suffered and brooded in silence for months. I know you, Kitten."

He groaned. "Please tell me you don't call me that around Uncle Anubis."

Her laugh made everyone present wince: A horrid and paradoxical breeding of a youthful woman's laughter and a lioness' roar.

"Oh, 'Nubi finds it hilarious!"

Harry gave her a resigned look. "He's stalking someone right now, isn't he? Please tell me he's not going to try and mummify Snape alive, or something?"

"Everyone has their hobbies, my Little Kit."

Harry threw his arms up in the air. "Oh great, how am I going to explain that to Professor Dumbledore!"

"That's a 'you' problem, Harry."
