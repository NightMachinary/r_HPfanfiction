From what I can remember, Regulus was rescued from the lake of inferi by Kreacher but was in a coma for awhile. After recovering, he finds out that Harry is his son(?) and rescues him from the Dursleys. Harry was in single digits, nowhere near Hogwarts age, and I am actually not sure if he was Regulus's son. I thought it might have been by cywscross but it's not linkao3(Dead Man Walking by cywscross) as Harry is in his sixth year in that. Any ideas? Thanks!

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.

*** Man. The first three chapters of this story were great, but the last one didn't live up to the standard set by the others.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
