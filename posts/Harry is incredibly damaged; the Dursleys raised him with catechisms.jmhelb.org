:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ooh so I read this story like ten years ago on ffn. I don't even remember much of it, but what I do remember - I think Harry didn't go to Hogwarts right away, though I can't say if it was part way through first year or a little bit later that they go get him. He's been /severely/ abused by the Dursleys and taught catechisms to repeat about what a freak he is and such. I think he was also raised religiously, though that might not be right. If I remember right, he stays in the Room of Requirement for some time, although I can't remember if they put him there from the start of if he finds it on his own.

Any idea which story this is?

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP
