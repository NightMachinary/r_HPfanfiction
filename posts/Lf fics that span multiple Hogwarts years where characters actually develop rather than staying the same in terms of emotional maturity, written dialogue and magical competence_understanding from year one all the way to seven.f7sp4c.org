  Ever since his defeat of Grindelwald in 1945 and even before, Albus Dumbledore has been the Lord of the Light, and the leader of the opposition against any who oppose the peace. As natural selection goes however, Dumbledore's time on top is running out, as a new beacon of hope approaches, one who is equally as good as Dumbledore, and possibly even greater.

** If you like reading about about dark magic and Slytherin shenanigans then you should definitely check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11269078/1/To-Be-a-Slytherin][To be a Slytherin]] I binge read it a couple of months ago and it didn't disappoint. It's very well written and has an interesting premise: Harry has a twin sister who is basically Salazar Slytherin reincarnated. It also includes Snape as her mentor (just FYI)

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
