*** That one is brilliant, there's even a bit where Lily travels to 1994, sneak into the Gryffindor common room, and has to not be seen by her future parents

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

** This ones kind of a mess but it's Lily Potter II working for the Department of Mysteries in their time department. Unfortunately she's paired with Snape, but I like the world building and the whimsy of their government code names being time based. There was also the framework for a good mystery that never went forward. It's not complete and won't be it seems

Also there's a really good one where Harry and 13 year old Teddy have to go back in time and stop a future Dark Lord at Hogwarts let me know if you'd like that

  If you drew a time-line of Lily Potter's life it would look like a maze. But for the head of Temporal Investigations at the D.O.M. that's perfectly normal- What isn't is the strange man who appears impossibly in all of history. Add a temporally misplaced Potions Master, a time-bent elephant and her family and you get either a mess or a grand adventure. Lilly isn't yet sure which.

  Darkness is about to rise, but they aren't ready to fight. A plan was set into place; to stop it from ever rising in the first place. Harry & Teddy must time travel to 1993. They must find the boy who would grow up to become the new Dark Lord, without getting tangled in the whole Sirius Black issue. Would they be able to keep their identities secret from everyone?
