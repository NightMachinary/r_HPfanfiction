I really love bashing stories I need more to read. I prefer longer stories and for them to be completed. Any pairing is welcome. Even Slash. Thank you.


** Ron-bashing to an absurd degree:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][/Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion/]]- Harry Potter doesn't want to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. Ron thinks Harry cheated. Ron /does/ want to compete in the Triwizard Tournament though, so they find a loophole that allows him to represent Harry in the tournament.

One problem. Ron is too ****ing dumb to live.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

*** Almost anything. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12879819/1/Proud-Parents][/Proud Parents/]] does bash Dumbledore as well, but it treats Ron fairly well.

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione
