Teddy is still little - the rest of the potter clan haven't been born yet I don't think. I think he accidentally touched something - but maybe he was sent back maliciously? I'm not sure it's been a while tbh. I don't think it's crack, but I honestly I read it so long ago that I could be remembering it being better written then it actually was. I know it's a long shot, but i thought I'd try! Thank you so much!


** If this is on AO3, it may help to search was the Teddy has a character and Marauders era or pre-canon in the additional tags field.

** Sounds a bit like "Chained", but there little Teddy sent himself and Harry to the marauder era.
