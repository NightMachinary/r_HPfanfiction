[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/a7eh26/downvoting_should_be_reserved_for_shitposting_and/][Regarding this thread]], which I thought would be resolved quickly, but actually generated some good discussions. I will respond to one topic here:

Feels like we've gone backward rather than progressed.]]

I think most of us can agree that we /generally/ shouldn't shit on other people's proclivities, but that's a discussion for another day. This is more in response to this part:

I think people need to understand that the HP community consists of possibly more than a billion people worldwide. Certainly hundreds of millions. Those few thousands of us (26,582 currently) that are in the extreme minority of people who follow HP fanfiction, often fervently, have collected here as the few remaining pockets of resistance flail against the siege of time, attempting to wither our community down to nothingness, on places like FFN, AO3, DLP, SIYE, tumblr, and probably livejournal still.

I would not be surprised if this is currently the largest active HPFF community that engages in online text-based forum-style activities (although that admins over at DLP might have some site traffic statistics that can put up a good argument).

Where previously the other communities, even the small ones, were dense enough to be supported by a single ship, or even in some cases, a single author or fic, today we're all here together in one big happy family. Isn't that nice.

Well this compartmentalization also came with the benefit of cloistering opinions, protecting our less savory guilty pleasures and kinks from one another. Now that we're all here together, the dirty, cum-stained laundry comes out.

Small, secluded groups with regulated speech and strict rules are less diverse than larger populations. This means that ideas that were once protected from abuse are now being displayed openly on a large stage with much more diversity and less regulation.

Add to that the stark fact that while the HP community at large was once female (because women read fiction at a far higher rate than men), the reddit community is overwhelmingly male. Females, in general, tend more agreeable in their interactions with others.

This shift in demographics will certainly have created a new communication dynamic. There is going to be more disagreement on values and opinions. There is little regulation, so often these disagreements become arguments. There is a different mix of people than is typical for the HP community.

It's kind of sad to see many of the old communities dying out, but I'm at least happy that many of us have collected here on [[/r/hpfanfiction]]. Let's try to be nice and understanding with each other, but not too nice (imo).

That is all.

edit: I initially included a response to the original topic, but I feel like was sufficiently addressed in the previous thread, so I removed it. That thread is still up of y'all want to argue about it some more. I don't really feel like it.


** Couldn't you just reply to that comment instead of making a new topic about it...? The old topic is literally still *right there* on the front page.

If you're starting a new discussion, don't do this RE:Chain nonsense, because then nobody knows what the actual topic is at first. I get enough of that kind of spam mail at work without needing to see it on one of my subreddits as well.

*** I could. Unfortunately, you don't really get a choice in what I do. You could downvote me I guess, but I'm just expressing my opinion, which you aren't supposed to downvote.

You don't actually believe the other OP's rules for downvoting, but you're pretending to agree to be a passive aggressive twit. Huh. I guess I'm fully justified in downvoting you then. That sure will help me sleep easy tonight.

I think it was shared once in passing, if I remember correctly, DLP gets around 900 000 pageviews per month.

But there definitely aren't that many active users. DLP is tiny. The only way it'd ever be the largest fanfiction community is because nothing else exists.

** Since we're a small community, that's all the more reason to remind people not to downvote stuff like "LF this one Drarry story..." just because they disagree with the pairing. Because "LF" posts are a bit of a longshot to begin with, even when a post /isn't/ immediately downvoted (ensuring that even /fewer/ people see it).
