So, firstly, apologies for the pun in the title. I really, really couldn't stop myself. :D

But anyway, I noticed that we haven't had a good Britpicking consultation thread in awhile and I've seen a few posts around the topic recently and figured I'd make another one, since I seem to have a little series going here. :D

For those who missed them or forgot - we've done three others (links at the bottom, and yes, the second two are different), so maybe there's something there that answers any questions you might have, but otherwise, please, if you've got any questions about Being British or want to check something, ask, and if you happen to be a fellow UK person, feel free to answer! We get some really interesting cultural discussion going on in these, so I'm hopeful to see what you come up with. :)

** This one is a practically mandatory guide for anyone who want to sound as close as possible to authentic British English

*** Definitely. The first bit on 'quite' really summarises the confusion of British English very well, I think. Quite can mean very, moderately, I agree, and completely, depending on what context it's used in - and the complexity doesn't stop there. :D
