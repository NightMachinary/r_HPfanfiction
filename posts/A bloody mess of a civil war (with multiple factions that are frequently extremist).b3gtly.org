The second Voldemort war in the books is relatively neat and tidy; you have our heroes on one end, fighting for the rights of muggleborns, magical creatures, and not being slaughtered, and on the other end you have the Death Eaters, the violent blood supremacists fighting against the rights of muggleborns, magical creatures, and not being slaughtered.\\
Because Voldemort is amazingly charismatic, all the other bad creatures like Dementors and werewolves and mean giants and Umbridge join his side, leaving a handful like centaurs to be xenophobic and goblins to do goblin things but otherwise not have much influence on the war.\\
Basically, when Sirius said that the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters, he was telling a fib.

So monologuing aside, does anyone know a Second Voldemort War where things are a complete and utter mess and magical Britain is on the verge of collapse?\\
Where Fenrir's werewolf pack betrays Voldemort after he gets his hands on enough Wolfsbane to tactically infect hundreds of muggles and wizards, muggleborn extremists try to exterminate purebloods in retaliation for Death Eater actions, goblins are of two or three minds (bloody revenge, declare independence, try for peaceful federation, etc), dementors just savour the opportunity to let loose and devour souls, a long-forgotten Dark Lord from ages past aims to rebuild his power...


** Apart from the two already recommended fics, I only consider [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(5904185;12088294), having similar level of messy situations.

  Sequel to The Accidental Animagus. Voldemort's back, and this time, he's not alone. Harry and his family are caught in the middle as the wizarding war goes international. Years 5-7.

** linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has Hermione and the other muggleborns getting thrown out of Hogwarts by Umbridge and the Voldemort-influenced ministry, so they create a guerrilla military organization and start killing death eaters. They're even far more effective than the aurors once the ministry finally decides to take action against Voldemort.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Marriage law Revolution maybe? It has the Mugglenborn going full French/Russian Revolution against the purebloods after the second war and an attempt to institute a marriage law. It is still a pretty clear case (Evil Government vs people caring about human rights), but as with any proper revolution, blood is the water on its mills. And the good guys can get pretty extreme with their persecutions, although they are not entirely unjustified.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  Post DH AU. In a world where the Battle of Hogwarts was not won, but lost, the survivors must re-group and wage a new breed of war. Resistance is scattered across the countryside, and Harry Potter, their leader, is isolated, possibly unstable. Does any hope remain for our heroes? Can the Golden Trio go on when reduced down to 2? And what will be the cost of getting her back...
