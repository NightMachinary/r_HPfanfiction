It is a sad truth of fanfiction that many, perhaps even the majority, of fics die. The authors lose interest, have nothing more to say, or even actually die irl. However, not every fic that dies slips from this mortal coil with unfinished business, as it were. Some dead fics died when... well, nothing much was going on at the moment; the first arc(s) were finished and we were in the middle of transitioning to the next arc. So while we wish there was more of the story, we aren't left on a cliffhanger or right in the middle of a moment of drama or development. While we all wish these fics would rise from the dead (and sometimes [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][they even do]] ) some of these dead fics are still worth reading or rereading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] is four years dead, but provides one of the most interesting versions of potions and Arithmancy I've ever seen, as well as a detente with a resurrected Voldemort that doesn't feel ridiculous. Edit: Holy crap it just updated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] is one of the better groundhogday!Harry fics I've seen, particularly in their understanding of how the time-travel works and the massive limitations on it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty]] may not yet be 100% dead, though hope seems rather thin at this juncture. A DnD Wizard is dropped into the HP universe, bringing awareness of truly bizarre magics and rules of magic.

We all prefer to see completed fics because, well, they're done. We know what the quality is, we don't have to worry about it suddenly turning to shit or simply dropping us without catharsis. But seeing as how dead!fics are rather thicker on the ground, it seems prudent to try and determine which of the exhausting deluge is actually worth reading.


** It's sad to know that many of my favorite stories will likely never be finished.

** The Memory Box by Bella EB will forever be in my heart. The sequel The Never Forgotten hasn't been updated since 2013 I believe :(

It's on HPFF for anyone who wants to see it. But the memory box can only be accessed in a print friendly version.

Same said for linkffn(The Skitterleap; Contemplating Clouds)

  Apathetic Occlumency teacher twisting your mind out of shape? Never fear, there's a charming young girl in the year below to twist it back in the opposite direction. Just hope it doesn't snap.

*** I remember Contemplating Clouds! Though I think I remember a somewhat similar fic as well, where Luna sort of accidentally-on-purpose used her influence on Harry to start dating him a little? Like, they started with Occlumency practice and she said something like 'kissing will help you concentrate and wards off nargles' or something like that, so they ended up dating eventually (though of course it did work fine).

Man, yeah, that's exactly the sort of thing this thread is for. You aren't left at a cliffhanger (no matter what the author says, silly) and you wish there was more.
