I can't remember if the main character is harry or original characterWere raised by the mob/criminals And then go to Hogwarts the kids are relatively normal students just with some interesting talents Like Lock picking card tricks, And a mild distrust of Authority figures . Since I can't remember if it was Harry or the original character that was raised by the mob.The mob helps. Harry fight Voldemort . Harry gets adopted by the OC is dad I think. So Harry's adoptive/ foster father is a criminal/mob boss. Harris foster father deals with Any issues with Dumbledore.


** Well 893 sort of deals with this. Harry is found and adopted by a Yakuza family head, moves to Japan and later gets forced back to britain for the Triwizard tournament.

**** Once you get used to the frequent use of Japanese terms and can look at from a non english based perspective the story really shows how awesome it is. You learn a fair bit of Japanese culture as well. Keep in mind it does revolve around Yakuza activities a lot so there is a fair bit of dark humor and violence. But it really is a story that stands out in its own way. Personally its one of my favorites.

** Yup that's defiently The Diadone Method. Harry is raised by a mob boss they then hire Lupin as a document forger . He's a world renowned forger in the mundane world as well as magical linkffn(8046571). The writing is fantastic and it got undated this year so it's not Abandoned

Also maybe try The Uncle, Harry is raised by Remus and Sirius

  When she thinks no one is looking, Petunia slaps three year old Harry while stuck in traffic. Mafia Lord Salvator Diadone notices and takes action. This is a Harry grows up in the mafia story, with a bit of a twist.

** linkffn(3584221)

This is sort of a twist on the mafia Harry theme. I personally stop at the end of this fic and don't really bother with the sequel(s).
