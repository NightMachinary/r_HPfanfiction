Hello Peeps.

I'm usually not all that active in this sub but I love other peoples recommendations and some of the prompts are wack to read and think about.

I've written a couple of fics even if I only have one story up on my AO3 account (Just made my FF one). When I say one story then I mean one long one. (One actual story).

I wrote down the beginning of an idea (A longer fic) but seeing as my writing relies more on my characters than my plot (All of the time) I would love if you could tell me whether my Katie Bell is well... Katie Bell.

Thanks <3

** Definitely cute as a one-shot, but maybe a little info-dumpy for the start of a longer fic.

That said, I do really like your Katie. That's the fun of using more minor characters- you have more opportunities to make them your own thing!

*** Thank you <3

I got a comment that she might have come across as a little possessive which wasn't my intention but that is the kind of life I breathed into it in the end.

** I like the characterisation even if it was a bit of a dense infodump, but I do belive theres a serious dearth of Harry/Katie fics so I hope you do make something more out of this.

*** Yeah. It was a heavy info dump.

I think it turned into more of a "Here is a 12k long" Prompt.

I am playing with two different ideas as my next project after my Honks story and this was one of them. I am writing the other "One-Shot/First Chapter" of my other idea.

My long fic only has maybe 5 more chapters and maybe something like an epilogue kind of thing.

*** I might make it a longer story after I have finished up my current project.

It is almost finished the other story, so I was just doing some research to find out what people would like me to write next <3

This being one of the options <3
