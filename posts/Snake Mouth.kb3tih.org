Where Parseltongue actually gives the humans who speak it a serpentine mouth (unhinge-able jaw, fangs and forked tongue), making it very difficult to hide the ability and, potentially, causing more severe discrimination and fear.

Interesting to see how the Dursley's would raise Harry (whether they would even let him out of the house) then how relationships with characters early on would change if they knew from the start or Harry knew to hide it.

I'd like a scenario where Ron, with his initial anti-Slytherin prejudice, would refrain from befriending Harry because of what he is. Or there would be a huge blowout when it was eventually revealed.

Etc.


** Oh boy, Harry would definitely have a lisp. I can imagine him growing up trying to curb that and to keep the forked tongue in check (i.e. in his mouth), and ending up trying to model how other people eat without swallowing his food whole. Nothing to really do about the fangs, though they could be passed off as a vampire fad - Blimey guys, I just think vampires are really cool, alright?

One things for certain, he can definitely tell when danger is in the air just by flicking his tongue out to taste it

I feel sorry for him. Not only does he have to endure pain in his scar because of Quirrell, he also has to smell him all the time, both the danger and the garlic.

*** "Have you noticed we've never seen Harry eat?" Hermione blurted it out before she could stop herself, interrupting Ron mid-bite with her curious mutter,

"Huh?" Ron's slack expression meant a jumble of half-chewed roast potatoes nearly flopped back onto his plate, "What are you on about?"

To emphasise his point, Ron stared quite pointedly at Harry's empty plate, the boy in question laughing along with Katie Bell as Angelina and Fred traded barbs.

"No, Ron. I mean have you noticed we've never actually caught Harry in the act of actually eating." Ron's expression became pinched, squinting at her until she went on, "It's always the case that we look away sometime during a meal and when we look back the plate is empty."

The gingers expression smoothed out somewhat as he blinked harshly, realisation dawning on his face as he swallowed roughly,

"Now you mention it..." Ron's eyes fell on Harry a bit more, flicking between the empty plate and him, "He also has a... weird way of laughing."

As if to prove his point, Fred's arms waved wildly and Harry's hand slapped over his mouth as he descended into laughter.

"I don't think-"

"No, he does the same thing when he smiles sometimes. He never really opens his mouth." The last part of his sentence came out intermingled with a choked gasp, followed by a shout of, "That's right! He never opens his mouth wide enough to show his teeth!"

Hermione flinched, flicking a panicked gaze to her other friend, only to sigh when it seemed he hadn't noticed Ron's shout. She kicked him under the table and fortunately, even though he glared still, he knew to keep /his/ mouth shut...

** Wait, now that I'm thinking about it, this would probably change Voldemort's past as well, right? Since it'd be hard as a baby to hide your forked tongue and fangs... there'd probably be more pushing for him to get an exorcism or something. And would that be hard for him to hide at Hogwarts? Would it have made it easier to find the identity of Tom Riddle in the long run?

And this would change a lot of wizard culture, too. Since Salazar Slytherin would historically have snake features as well as the ability to speak to snakes, perhaps snakes would be even more demonized in Magical British literature and media? I can imagine small things like children being read storybooks with villains who's jaws unhinge and are taught to fear long tongues and sharp teeth...

Its really the cultural impacts that interest me in this regard. But Harry's time at school would be pretty cool. I can imagine him using it to his advantage later in life, maybe some scenes of him, probably in the fifth book or later, using it to intimidate someone and then maybe regretting it afterwards. Ah, the entire situation would be so fascinating! The emotional impacts, the change in relationships, the perhaps greater fear of Harry in the second book.

Also, hissing contests.

Voldemort being... well, Voldemort. He probably shows off those fangs dramatically so they always catch the light in the middle of conversation.

Would Voldemort or Nagini be the one to deliver the venomous bite to Snape? This might be a dumber question, but i think it's funny so.

*** I'd imagine certain characters may not even consider Parselmouth's as human because of it. They could be venerated by darker sorts and demonised as... demons by "the Light". Because of this, the cultural/social stigma towards them should be far more aggressive, on par with lycanthoropy in canon maybe.

And absolutely, Tom's childhood would have been atrocious. Far worse than in canon (assuming he was even allowed to remain in Wools Orphanage).

However, like Harry, he would have years of both practice hiding his mouth AND trauma from those who hate him for it. I think Harry getting caught is inevitable, but Tom would absolutely hide it and remain undiscovered.

With the bite on Snape, I'd rather they didn't have venom. But even if they did, there is no way Voldemort would lower himself to biting someone to kill them unless he was wandless and desperate. Nagini would still kill Snape.

Like... Imagine a priest going: "'kay, we shouldn't totally remove those fangs. Those are the things that are possessed by the devil." But snakes shed their fangs every few months, so they would grow back, somehow showing that they are indeed unnatural, and the process would be repeated over and over, with different techniques and tools, and with different degrees of success, but never getting to remove them altogether...

Ya know? I wouldn't fault that Voldemort for wanting muggles dead. Or dying in his childhood.

***** On the contrary, with it's historical associations with Slytherin, Herpo the Foul and Voldemort (on top of whoever else) and with how recent Voldemort is in the memory of the public, Harry would likely be labelled a dark wizard and become a complete pariah (if only for a while). Especially if he is still outed in his second year.

Canon's reaction had plenty of people suspicious and wary of him, but if it came with features that marked his as something distinctly other than human (with characters like Umbridge in the higher echelons of the government) I can't imagine it would be much different than how Remus is treated. People who got to know him before the truth came out will still like him, but beyond that...

Remus being grilled about whether he noticed baby Harry's pointed teeth, "How should I know? They went into hiding before he started teething!"

This could be why the Potters were so easily convinced that the prophecy applied to their kid. Or it could be a sign that the horcrux is slowly but surely turning Harry into a Voldemort clone, starting with the mouth. Who knows? Not Dumbledore!

When you don't do something not because of any personal feelings, but because it will have negative outcomes, that is literally the absence of personal distaste.

I looked it up - here's what he says, specifically. Hermione gives some rapid-fire info about the Houses, then says that she wants to be in Gryffindor, but that Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad. Then she leaves.

#+begin_quote
  "Whatever House I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. "Stupid spell - George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud."

  "What House are your brothers in?" asked Harry.

  "Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling in on him again. "Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't supposed Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

  "That's the House Vol- I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"

  "Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
#+end_quote

So Ron literally gets gloomy at the idea that he feels his parents will be disappointed if he's not in Gryffindor, but that he doesn't think the fallout would be as bad if he were in Ravenclaw as it would be in Slytherin. It's all what his parents will say about him not being in the same house as them and his brothers. He doesn't even bring up the "Dark wizards come from Slytherin" trope that Hagrid told Harry about - Harry does that, and Ron doesn't comment on it.

Later, when Malfoy interferes, Ron explains that the Malfoys are well-known to be Dark and followers of Voldemort, but doesn't say a thing about Slytherin.

******* Doesn't actually change my point, he very clearly places Slytherin on a lower tier than all the others (though he doesn't deign to mention Hufflepuff at all) and he clearly sits there depressed at the idea of being Sorted there. Yes, it is clear his mum and dad's opinion weighs heavily on him, but it isn't necessarily the only factor.

Reading between the lines: Ron doesn't want to be Sorted into Slytherin (because his parents will clearly react poorly, thus he doesn't want to be there because he doesn't want to gain their ire is) what is said on the surface.

Additionally, a lot of Ron and Harry's disdain for Slytherin House (during the series) stems from their interactions with Malfoy and his cronies.

However it is clear by 2nd year Ron has clear prejudice against Slytherin House, as well as the book implying his disdain stems back further than his own personal experiences,

*/“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn't be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I'd've got the train straight back home. . . .”/*

One of many things he said in CoS. What it implies is that Ron had someone who told him about Slytherin himself prior to at least his Second Year, but for arguments sake I'm believe it was pre-Hogwarts due to his choice of words ("I always knew").

I can't imagine that Ron would have a low opinion of its founder, be almost afraid of being Sorted there and NOT have at least a low opinion of the House itself and a personal desire to be Sorted elsewhere.

Again. I'm not saying Ron hated Slytherin house in his First Year, but I don't think it is out of the question that it was his least favourite of the Houses and he didn't have much of a positive opinion of it.

No, that's not true. First of all, he only references Ravenclaw because Hermione had just done so (and uses the exact wording she did, obviously referencing her comment. I forgot to include it, but "would" is in italics in the text, so it's "I don't suppose Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad"), which is why I included that context. He begins to get depressed when he starts talking about how his entire family has been in Gryffindor so far, and his first statement after saying that is that he has no idea what they'll say if he's not in Gryffindor.

******* What you have to remember is Slytherin has a BAD reputation. It attracts the "Purest" and those of great ambition, where people like Andromeda Tonks are treated as exceptions rather than rules.

Ron's disdain for Slytherin would be built on what he has been raised on/taught by his Gryffindor family. Who, in some ways, condemn and oppose many of the virtues that Slytherin's are sorted for. It is somewhat disingenuous to imply that Ron wouldn't have some sort of opinion of the House before he arrives at Hogwarts that would sway his mind.

Yes, Mr and Mrs Weasley's opinion would be very important to him as an eleven year old boy. But he is also a human being, more than capable of having multiple reasons as to why he doesn't want to go into Slytherin (such as being taught, and believing, certain stereotypes about the inhabitants).

Ron's opinion on Slytherin house is that it is the lowest of the four Houses, even as early on as Philosopher's Stone.

Only by Dark pureblood elitists. Furthermore, Hagrid - the most anti-Slytherin character in the story - takes care to note that while all Dark wizards so far have come from Slytherin, not all Slytherins are Dark wizards. "The house synonymous with the Dark Lord" produced the Order's best double agent, for all the Weasleys know. Slytherins make up 25% of the population, so they'd have to interact with them in normal society.

** I have two fics saved that do this:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5384972][The Serpent Tongue]] - where it's played for laughs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27949034][A Rather Useless Inheritance]] - Where it's still somewhat silly, but more of a leadup to a Tom/Harry ship.

The second one leans into it more, while the first one is a sillier bit about macking with someone who has a snake tongue.

** Would Harry have some sort of complex from that and from the fact of being raised by the Dursleys with the idea of such an "unnatural" disposition (I tried to use the words I believe they would use in such a case, I do not agree with them)?

  I'd like a scenario where Ron, with his initial anti-Slytherin prejudice, would refrain from befriending Harry because of what he is. Or there would be a huge blowout when it was eventually revealed.
