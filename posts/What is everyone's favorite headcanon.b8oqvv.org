*** I liked an fic about Percy that said that he stayed close to Fudge to be an informant for Dumbledore and broke his ties to family to maintain his cover and not be asked by Fudge to spy on them. It also said that the main reason he did it was to pay the "Life Debt" they contacted to Harry (because even if it's an old honor tradition, someone still had to pay it for said honor).

Honestly, in my favourite story Percy did what he did completely independent of Dumbledore. To show that not everything good came from Dumbledoere, and that you could disagree with him without being a bad guy.

** The actual purpose of a seeker has barely anything to do with quidditch, its purpose is about finding out who is going to be relevant in the future. Wizards assume that fate will cause important people to end up in that position, because its the only position that actually matters in quidditch. Basically wizards are aware that their universe is to a certain extent driven by a narrative that can notice things like goodness and actively cause ironic things to happen, and this is their way to find out who to watch out for.

I mean lets be honest 3 out of 4 Triwizard Champions were Seekers, and if Fleur didn't dislike brooms she probably would have been one too.

My headcanon has pretty much all important people have a history as seekers, including Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald. And really if any of them had played quidditch I doubt that they would have been satisfied with one of the useless positions. I also imagine that the barely mentioned seekers like that Slytherin in Harrys first year or Charlie Weasley had adventures that had nothing to do with Harry.

** Divination was real and only portrayed negatively bc we see it through the eyes of Hermione and those she admires (McGonagall) or who are influenced by her (Harry and Ron), those who are lazy (Fred and George), and those Hermione dislikes (Lavender and Parvati).

Lavender lived and became a werewolf, and also was scarred and had to adapt to that from her beauty focused existence. (Thanks to Northumbrian for the inspiration)

There were two other girls in Hermione's dorm who either never come up or Harry never notices, possibly due to their looks or character.

Not all Slytherins were evil; the child characters we see are heavily influenced from the off by the presence of essentially mafia leaders' kids in their midst and so learn quickly to play a part to get by day to day. This nuance is lost on Harry - who tends to take situations at face value, the Weasleys, who are prejudiced, and Hermione, who has been abused firsthand by a ringleader and sees the others as tacitly supporting rather than perhaps acting so out of self-preservation. (See also her punishment of Marietta)

The Umbridge/centaurs scene was not intended to be imo sexual assault and that is a grimdark!reading of the situation. Much as JKR exhibits some internalized misogyny, it doesn't suit her writing style and would have been foreshadowed more explicitly earlier on, or had a consequence like a hinted at pregnancy if that was the intent.

Or when the two of them believed the other to be the traitors who was giving information about their best friends to Voldemort ? Perhaps you're referring to Sirius dying whitout leaving anything to Lupin in spite of his friend precarity.

You're definitely not referring to the fact James was shown at numerous times to be Sirius's most cherished bond to the point he went crazy at his death. The fact that he reciprocated all the love he felt for his best friend to his son to which he risked anything for and left all he had after his death to protect him.

Dumbledore's portrait was censured for the actions towards Harry but they worked past the issues (Dumbledore had journals as well as knick knacks left in trust for Harry explaining all he could to help him). Snape's portrait is less surly and gets along better with Harry. Harry had a small break from his friendship with Hermione because she used his fame for political purposes. Harry didn't put the elder wand in the tomb but kept it for emergencies and found the stone for safekeeping. As an middle-aged adult he was just as good as Dumbledore or Voldemort at dueling. McGonagall lived in penance for not standing up to Dumbledore after she retired. Luna, Harry, Neville, Ron, and Ginny all got help from a squib psychologist for childhood issues.

As a vigilante, no one really has the right to decide death. Self-defense is generally excused, apprehending criminals, and such. Harry in canon became an auror.

To tell someone not to kill someone who is threatening their wife's life is ludicrous. It is still immoral if they kill that person, but there is enough justification to let that immoral action slide. The government has these people totally incapable of action which removes any justification.

There are so many!

Wolfstar being legit.

Barty Crouch Jr truly wanted Harry to succeed in the tournament.

That when you create a horcrux it break off half your soul each time instead of just a sliver.

Snape is the reason Harry survived the AK as a baby. Voldemort agreed to save Lily and indirectly agreed to an unbreakable vow but when he agreed with Lily to spare Harry instead, the vow parameters were updated so when he went to kill Harry the vow registered as it being broken so the spell backfired.

Harry was ‘immortal' until he killed Voldemort or was killed by Voldemort. He could only die by Voldemort's hand so quidditch, starving, etc, wouldn't kill him.

Harry was very good at accidental magic as he basically apparated while hiding from Dudley.

*** That could work... if we hadn't read the books from Harry's perspective and knew his opinion on almost everything. It's a shame Rowling liked the Weasley family more than she liked Harry really.

**** Harry was an orphan who grew up unloved in a broom closet. The Weasleys were his second family. TBH I thought it was sweet that he technically becomes Ron's brother through marriage.

People crap on Ron too much. He's extremely loyal and caring as a friend, despite his flaws.

***** Yes, and frankly, I love Weasley family. Especially Molly and Arthur who didn't ever stumble in their support of Harry. But I still find one big happy Weasley family a let down. It was too neatly wrapped up and Rowling turned Ginny into a Mary Sue to get there. It would have been far more interesting if she had given a better development to Harry and Ginny's relationship and if she used Ginny's ordeal with the diary to connect them. Think about how good a storyline Ginny and Harry's discussions about Voldemort's past after each of Dumbledore's lessons in HBP would be. And use that to show what a good team those two make and turn the trio to a quartet for a year. It would have made Harry's break up with Ginny much more impactful because it would mean he was sacrificing someone who made him stronger just to protect her. He would be making himself weaker.

What I mean to say is, Harry/Ginny relationship felt forced. Harry and Hermione's friendship was much more developed and would make for a better relationship without what I talked about.

****** Oh I 100% agree that Ginny's character was way too two dimensional in the books. She's a fascinating character to explore in fandom for the reason you mentioned. But this could be due to Rowling sucking at writing romance. The most cringe worthy aspect of book 6. She's great at writing friendship but not romance.

I always imagined Ron with Hermione, maybe because Rowling started planting seeds in book 2. A good friendship doesn't always turn into a relationship. Tbh I would have loved to see Harry date or marry Luna. I can see that pairing too.

** Man, the meaning of "headcanon" has really diluted over the years. It used to mean "canon as I see it". Now it seems to mean "some random shit I made up".

*** It still fits the general definition that most of the stuff here doesn't explicitly contradict canon, I think you are the only one who makes a difference between "headcanon" and "headfanon" as you call it.
