Harry meets the Puppeteer. It's certainly possible, but I don't exactly want Harry to die the first few times they meet. How would that happen?


** What is this in reference to? I tried googling Puppeteer and all I got was a bunch of web development tools - I'm not sure 'Harry Potter and the HTML API' is what you were getting at, though. :D

*** The puppeteer is a creepypasta. He is usually greyscale I believe, with eyes and mouth that glow gold, and golden strings he can control people with(hence the name puppeteer). I only know what I know because of SteamGeek01 on ffn and Madame Macabre's puppeteer song 'Golden Strings', but I believe he needs to kill to exist, but he sorta feels bad about it(he's an anti-hero), so he primarily targets people who are depressed, usually those who want to commit suicide but are to scared to do it. Someone in the comments of the song mentioned that, especially during the summers after fourth and fifth year, Harry would definitely have been depressed enough to be a target.

**** (Puppeteer) They call me Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Golden strings and fragile dreams. Oh, Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Broken hearts your nimble fingers steer.

(Victim) It's always like this. Standing alone here, All on my own here, Is it selfish? The pain was mounting. Can't let them in here, I'm holding up here, Why's the dark so crushing?

And then, A figure came, Reflecting golden light. And then, The air grew still, I knew it wasn't right. The fear that sprang up in my heart told me to run, But when he sang so softly I knew that my fight was gone.

(Puppeteer) They call me Puppeteer, Calm your fears, To be alone, This pain I've known. Puppeteer, Calm your fears, Just let go embrace the warm glow. Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Golden strings and fragile dreams. Oh, Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Broken hearts your nimble fingers steer.

(Victim) He's always been here, Watching me cry there, He's standing by there, Going nowhere. He called her evil, Saw what she did there, Saw the abuse there, His gaze became wrathful.

And then, Her screaming broke the silence of the dark. For years, The trauma I saw left it's scarring mark. The veil that had consumed her fell upon me too. He stood beside me singing that sweet song I almost knew

(Puppeteer) They call me Puppeteer, Calm your fears, To be alone, This pain I've known. Puppeteer, Calm your fears, Just let go embrace the warm glow. Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Golden strings and fragile dreams. Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Broken hearts your nimble fingers-

(Victim) Take all the broken, Stitch them up, With this golden token. Relief they'll finally feel, Even if it isn't real!

(Puppeteer) Puppeteer, Calm your fears, To be alone, This pain I've known. Puppeteer, Calm your fears, Just let go embrace the warm glow. Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Golden strings and fragile dreams. Oh, Puppeteer, Dry your tears, Broken hearts your nimble fingers steer.

(This is the song lol)

**** Ah, okay. Creepypasta is like the Slenderman thing, right? As you may have guessed, they're not really my area. :D

Could work though, yeah. Then, I'd suggest a taunting from Dudley over Harry being sad, because 'The Puppeteer will come get you'. Maybe have him and his mates chant something tauntingly around Harry, and his accidental magic interacts with the song to summon/bring into being the actual Puppeteer.

Could even take it to another level - since it feels guilt over what it does, there could be an interesting story in the eldritch-creature Puppeteer raising Harry, while constantly fighting it's inbuilt instinct/desire to feed on him.

Yeah pretty much. There's much more to it, but Slendy(as the fandom likes to call him) is sorta the original one/the one that got creepypasta noticed.

As for everything else, that's a good idea! If I ever do get around to writing this(bc I have like six stories all simultaneously being written right now) prompt, I'll be sure to use some of it :D

Ah, okay. Cool. And yeah, I just meant him as the 'big example'. I know it's sort of like Urban Legends and such. Have you ever looked at the SCP Foundation archives? They're a similar thing, but a bit more 'Organisation formed to deal with them' than 'a scary story someone told me one time'. Also, The Magnus Archives, if you like the 'scary story' vibe and are alright with podcasts. :)

I know that feeling. I'm currently on 15 WIPs and resisting the urge to start more. Back when I still believed I had that ever elusive 'free time'. :D

But I hope you get to it, or someone takes up this prompt for you. It's a fun idea. :)

Not the official ones but there's a series of short comics I watch on YouTube.

And for the WIPs thing, yeah. I have, let's see,

The Puppet Master(my current title), which is a fnaf crossover(most of it is just notes saved in my memo app).

Pheonix, which is a creepypasta crossover.

The Misadventures Of Hadrian And Hermione Pines, which is a Gravity Falls crossover with lots of gay and eventual Drarry, also stars self-insert OC Maddie Devon.

Draco Black, which has nothing but a vague idea.

Death's Child, a Mod!Harry thing I drew art for.

Raven's Feathers, a Undertale crossover with a lot more of my version of Frisk and a lot less of the Monsters(until sometime after PoA).

The Convergence, which is more going to be a series of One-shots that are all vaguely connected centered around different versions of people from my stories interacting. They don't have much impact in the main stories but all the shots are canon to them.

The Funtime Series, which is a multi-crossover that starts with Hp and Fnaf, Creepypasta comes in slightly after Fourth Year, and Maddie is once again an established character.

Many half-abandoned Return fics

Another creepypasta hp crossover that's missing a name

And I asked one of my favorite authors on ffn if I could adopt an old fnaf hp crossover that was abandoned.

Wow. I need to not only finish these all, but get a ffn account so they aren't just sitting around in my docs.

******** Sounds like a fun bunch. Might be worth picking one and getting that FFN account. Add the rest once you're used to working on just one. Though remember, you might not have however much time you have now in the future. I certainly didn't have as much as I thought I would when I started all of mine. :D

None of my current WIPs are Harry Potter - they're all Life is Strange AUs: I've got one with Firewatch, one with Dead Space, one with Arrowverse and Stranger's Wrath, one with Leverage, etc.

********* Yeah, the worst part is that they all have complicated, overlapping universes. I think the weirdest may be Raven's Feathers, but that's because I've been trying to not make any of the characters too op. Considering, Frisk has a hold on monster magic and teaches the rest of her friend group. She's also a hybrid, but she's a wolf monster hybrid, which is why she can use monster magic, because that's actually the origin of wizards in this au, humans who bred with monsters. Frisk and the others just have closer relations. I have entire universes in my head and I need to write them out without forgetting anything simply because it's common knowledge to me.

********** Heh. Yeah, it does sound like you need to sit down and actually write down your world/setting/plot ideas stuff and get it organised in your head before you write the story. Trust me, it helps, both with writing and with keeping it from stick around too much in your brain - a decade of running Dungeons and Dragons has taught me that. Writing your worlds helps keep them straight where just remembering them doesn't.

*********** Yeah, I probably have a dozen or so stories that are completely forgotten somewhere. The nice thing us my dad does character/world building and is working on becoming a writer I believe(he doesn't have anything published but he's writing), so I can discuss things with him.
