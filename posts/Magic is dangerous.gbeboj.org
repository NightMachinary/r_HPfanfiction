I remember reading a fanfiction where a Slytherin child, thanks to the magic without a wand, had made her cat an inferius and for this, she had died burnt by her own magic. (I don't remember the name of this Fan Fiction, sorry).

I would, however, like to read something similar where magic is dangerous, not just wandless magic. Something similar to Dragon Age lore, for example (without making demons a real presence, I don't like demons as sentient beings in the world of Harry Potter. I prefer if they were creatures of pure feeling and without reason) It can take the danger of magic from other sources, but it must be well explained even for those who do not know the other fandom.

I would prefer there were no characters from other stories.

Thank you so much
