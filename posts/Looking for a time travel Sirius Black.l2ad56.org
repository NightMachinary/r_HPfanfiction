I think I read this on AO3 or FF but I can't find it right now. It's a time travel story in where Sirius gets to choose how far he wants to go back, so we see him traveling back to when the marauders were teenagers in Hogwarts, then (I think) to during the first war, then during Harry's third year at Hogwarts, etc. Regulus helps him choose somehow, and I think at the end he decides to raise Harry with Remus.
