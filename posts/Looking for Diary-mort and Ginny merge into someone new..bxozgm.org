#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

**** His raised by Itach and the akatsuki so some Naruto but it doesn't get into the Naruto plot at all. Some times he will visit them and some of them come to Hogwarts later. he also uses justus. So as I said some Naruto elements added but besides that it is Harry Potter and follows the plot expect for small diverges.

Example philosopher's stone happens as does the basilisks as well as Triwizard tournament. But slightly different.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but fg7dragon's linkffn(The Ōtsutsuki Transmigrant) has Tom succeeding in possessing Ginny, and is then replaced latter by Kaguya.

In it the Age of Chakra as I will call it has ended with Chakra diluting to the point of becoming Magic.

  Purebloods have always been obsessed with maintaining their bloodlines. What was this based on? What is the origin of these traditions? Or rather WHO? As always Harry finds himself in the oddest situations. But finding himself face to face with the Progenitor of Magic Itself? That's certainly not what he expected when he got out of bed in the morning.
