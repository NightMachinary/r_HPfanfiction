One of my frustrations with both fanon and canon is that Harry and Hermione's dorm mates (outside of Ron and Neville) don't really interact with them all that much. Now, I realize that this is pretty realistic in terms of school in general, but it'd be nice to see a story or two where this isn't the case and they're all good friends.

...Especially if they're BAMF friends, because I think Lavender and Parvati (along with Neville and Dean) are really stereotyped, and I'd like to see this mold broken. Because 1) stereotypes are lame and 2) I've always kind of viewed Lavender as Hermione's foil, and I'd love to see her be just as rebellious as Hermione can be at times.

Oh, and before I forget, thank you in advance for any recs that you have, if you have any!


** One of my biggest pet peeves about HP is the lack of friendship between Hermione, Parvati and Lavender. It's definitely something I've made an effort to rectify in my current long fic. It's not central to the plot yet, but I'm toying with the idea that it could be. There's one scene, where I've written a monologue of sorts for Lavender that she delivers to Hermione where I've created some background for her family life, that I'm quite proud of. I can't wait for people to read it!

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.

** This was one of the more interesting concepts in The Best Revenge and it's sequel. Features Hufflepuff!Harry getting his housemates, then the other muggleborns in his year, and eventually nearly the whole year together to form a new club.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
