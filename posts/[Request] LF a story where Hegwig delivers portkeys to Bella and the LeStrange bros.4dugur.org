Hedwig delivers them during a ferry ride, the portkeys take them victims about 1000 feet straight up and drop them. Bella is last so Harry or Sirius inherit her vault and get the cup.

** I haven't read this fic, but... since they are all adult wizards, wouldn't they be able to apparate to ground safely? Especially Bella since she's supposed to be pretty competent.

*** So 1000 ft is ~300 m if we ignore the air resistance bellatrix has approximately 7,5-8 seconds till she hits the ground. I see no reason for her to not stop the fall.

*** It was a sabotaged prisoner transfer so the Lestranges weren't able to use any magic.
