  This tradition is admittedly not really prevalent now, but in the early 20th you'd be lucky if you could understand what they were talking about at all.

It totally still is. We talked in practically a different language half the time at mine.

#+begin_quote
  Due to the house system, you make friends with people much older/younger than you a lot more than you may think.
#+end_quote

Depends on the size of the school. There were 40 kids in my year in my house, and I knew some in the year above and below but not really beyond that.

#+begin_quote
  Its kind of unthinkable for first years not to get assigned personal second year student guides, this is a tradition as old as time

  calling them professor makes sense, but this always jumped out to me.
#+end_quote

You don't even call you university lecturers ‘professor' in the U.K. (apart from a small number of high level academics who are given this title), so yeah this is very weird.

#+begin_quote
  They usually express their disapproval at more dog-whistly type things, such as being crass, or crude,
#+end_quote

Or classist, which lets face it is the original British version of racist. I know an awful lot of upper class folk who are horrendously classist, in ways that if it were about skin colour would be hate speech.

#+begin_quote
  They really love croquet, pimms, tennis, and cricket. A flat lawn is a must if you're upper class.
#+end_quote

And rugby and rowing. Rugby in the winter, cricket in the summer, and rowing year round.

#+begin_quote
  They don't usually dress with a lot of opulence
#+end_quote

And the women's hair is always a state.

But yeah, this gives a bit of an insight into how the British upper class is very different to American upper class - blood lines versus money.

**** I think a lot of the language is specific to the setting - you won't use slang for things specific to school or to boarding etc again. Ours became ingrained and we definitely did it without evening noticing after the first year or so, and when I see friends from there and talk about it I definitely drop back into it.

I went on to an ancient university after school and just picked up a different slang language instead, which I definitely still drop into when talking about university with my friends from there.

** There are two main problems with this.

Firstly, Hogwarts isn't a public school (in the British sense). Rather, it is a public school (in the American sense), i.e. you don't pay fees.

And even if it were a fee-paying school, there are good reasons to think that it wouldn't share a culture with British public schools. The biggest is that literally every magical child in the UK gets invited, so it's not selective nor is it inhabited by a certain class.

Secondly, Hogwarts exists within the wizarding world, not the Muggle world. So Muggle cultural norms wouldn't really apply, especially ones which post-date the statute of secrecy.

Also, keep in mind that Harry's generation would have been born at the tail-end of the "first war", and so you're going to deal with families being killed, or simply choosing not to have children in such a dangerous time.

And doesn't the rather illogical "equal numbers" rule make it statistically "impossible" for everyone to get an invite because that implies that there is an equal number of witches and wizards born each year and that those numbers have to be dividable by 4? Once or twice maybe, but for centuries? I mean, the probability for just one year is 1/16. And it gets really low really fast.

Rowling once mentioned that she doesn't really think in terms of numbers and what they mean overall. She basically created 40 students so she can just pick someone if she need a character form Harrys year and doesn't have to create someone new. She even said that she didnt even thought about where the other kids would be sleepning.

#+begin_quote
  Well, Hogwarts. All right. Here is the thing with Hogwarts. Way before I finished “Philosopher's Stone,” when I was just amassing stuff for seven years, between having the idea and publishing the book, I sat down and I created 40 kids who enter Harry's year. I'm delighted I did it, [because] it was so useful. I got 40 pretty fleshed out characters. I never have to stop and invent someone. I know who's in the year, I know who's in which house, I know what their parentage is, and I have a few personal details on all of them. So there were 40. I never consciously thought, “That's it, that' s all the people in his year,” but that's kind of how it's worked out. Then I've been asked a few times how many people and because numbers are not my strong point, one part of my brain knew 40, and another part of my brain said, “Oh, about 600 sounds right.” Then people started working it out and saying, "Where are the other kids sleeping?" [Laughter.]
#+end_quote

But honestly it makes sense for Harry year to have more then 40 students for the simple reason that he doesn't even know the names of some until sixth year(which would be impossible in a boarding schools with only 40 people in your year) Or just the size of the magical world in general.

I personally like to think of there being around a hundred and twenty students on average every year. That would give give Hogwarts 800-850 students and magical britian in general around 12.000 wizards and witches, numbers I think roughly make sense. The other students would simply have their classes with others at the same time. I'd handwave the extra professors that would be needed, because they would even be needed with the canon number of students.

The electives can be fitted very easily (1 day for each year with just electives, you can choose 4 without needing a time turner). And the core classes can be slotted with relative ease as long as you use double lesson blocks like with electives.

And if you always hang out with the same people, you might not get to know more than ten people in three or four years (although you would know their names). And due to Voldemort and Sirius, Harry had more pressing matters than socializing for most of his Hogwarts time. Although I'm curious, are there any situations where Harry doesn't recognize another student from his year?

I have attended an all-boys school and lived in an all-girls school (parents were teachers) and in both cases the schools had much stronger and unique culture compared to the coeducational boarding school I attended -- even though the co-ed one was by far the oldest.

Hogwarts is part of the wizarding world, not the Muggle one, and those two societies are almost completely separate. It invites every member of the British wizarding world to attend, it is *not* a school for the social elite of the society in which it exists. As such, it is attended by a complete cross-section of that society and is not inhabited by the "upper class" of the wizarding world, meaning that the analogy with British public schools fails.

Why is the line of acceptable elitism having magic? Some public schools have entrance exams, judging pupils on ability, and of course ability to pay or social status or faith are all factors a school could use to define entrants. But somehow the only one that isn't seen as discriminatory is magic?

Actually, that's illegally discriminatory in the UK. Music in deaf communities is a big area of study, and stopping deaf students studying that would break the equalities act big time.

A school that /also/ teaches magic. Maybe Harry and his friends would have learned some maths too.

And kids with learning difficulties who can't complete the curriculum in the U.K. can't be legally discriminated against either.

Hogwarts is great, but it has no moral high ground over public schools because it's even more selective about its pupils and less open to access.

Granted, but they couldn't possibly learn about /in the same way/, and with the same lessons and teachers, as people with hearing. A school that teaches magical lore to nonmagicals would be imaginable in a Statute-free world, but it would not be Hogwarts. I mean, you could technically make it a division of Hogwarts, but it wouldn't be the /same school/ in a real sense.

But that would make it into a completely different establishment. Hogwarts is /not/ a general-purpose school, it's a school of magic. This is like trying to reform an art school by making it into a general school that happens to offer art as a class; both have merits but they're fundamentally different things.

Also, yet another argument: Muggles /are not citizens of the Wizarding World/. Quite a few schools around the world don't normally allow people who aren't citizen of the country they're in.

I 100% agree with you. It wouldn't be, and it wouldn't be nearly as interesting for us as readers. Doesn't mean it isn't elitist however, just that we like it as it is and don't want it to change, which is legitimate but doesn't make it in any way morally superior to a public school.

#+begin_quote
  Also, yet another argument: Muggles are not citizens of the Wizarding World.
#+end_quote

Perhaps not, but Muggle parents of Muggleborns are heavily involved in the Wizarding world, as are squibs, which means nonmagicals aren't completely excluded from society, and on top of that Muggleborns are still citizens of the muggle world with birth certificates, passports etc and thus Wizarding nationality isn't as separate from muggle one as you'd expect.

Equally, public schools actually don't judge on nationality at all in my experience. I had quite a few foreign nationalities at my school (although a Scottish equivalent not an English public school) - if they can pay they are welcome. So that actually doesn't hold up as a comparison to public schools.

At the end of the day, we might /like/ Hogwarts as an elitist school, but that doesn't make it any better than public and private boarding schools elsewhere in the U.K.

But since it's supposed to be a fantastical, whimsical, magical place, those comparisons are pointless anyway. I can find fault with a lot of what Rowling does, but how can you say she got something 'wrong' in an institution she invented? She can do what she likes with it.

** *Each public school has their own language.*

Although I can't argue with that I can't even imagine how annoying that would have been to read. I'm thankful that it wasn't included and hope to freaking god people don't take your advice and try to include it in their fanfic.

*Beatings from teachers were very common, even in the 80s.*

I think that when dealing with young magic users and the possibility of accidental magic, that this would be a very, very bad idea. This might be an apples to oranges comparison on your part.

As the main wizarding school that most magical people attended, it's going to be under a lot of scrutiny and secrets would be much harder to keep especially considering how small the magical society is. I'm sure Malfoy Sr would not stand for Draco being hazed...and those doing the hazing/were hazed have parents who know each other or work together. It's too easy to prove guilt and therefore get caught as well. I'm not saying thta it didn't happen but not to the extent you're suggesting. That said, I can see muggleborns being very easy targets.

*What to call your family if you're* *upper class:*

I think that you also have to consider the longevity of the people in these stories and the impact that would have on cultural norms, etc. Instead of comparing it to the 70's and 80's, you might want to compare it to the 30's and 40's (or possibly earlier). Their ruling body (Wizengamot) was most likely filled with people born between 1810 and 1900 - what kind of cultural impact would that have?

In regards to family names, you might want to go back even further in time since the generations are so long. What did they call grandparents in the 1700 and 1800's? I mean, that's when Granny was possibly born. You could have a great grandparent who knew Shakespeare

You also can't assume what sports they played - would croquet be considered too nouveau? Tennis is even newer and Pimm's is from the relatively recent 1840's (how gauche!).

Personally, I think JK's world building was fine. As you said, they are children's stories. But I think fic writers need to cast a much, much wider net if they want to add to JK's world.

Yeah. Readers already have to absorb a lot of new vocabulary related to everything magical. Making them learn new vocab for everyday things too is a pretty big cognitive burden.

I say this even as someone who's into constructed languages and once started worldbuilding an AU where a good portion of the magical community of Great Britain and Ireland spoke a Celtic language.

** This is great stuff. I'm currently doing a story that starts and remains in the late 80s for several chapters. And since Lucius & Narcissa are very present characters, this seems handy for me as an American, especially with what terms they might use to reference their family members (somehow I managed to accidentally get the Uncle/Aunt use down). A few things:

How would Draco refer to his father when speaking to him? I can't recall an instance of it in canon.

#+begin_quote
  Your attitude. Snobbery is usually unspoken, and hard to grasp if you're an outsider. Most members of the upper class are not fervent racists like the Malfoys. They usually express their disapproval at more dog-whistly type things, such as being crass, or crude, or whatever.
#+end_quote

Could you go into this a bit? The idea of dog whistling over just screeching about it isn't a new idea to me. How might Lucius behave/speak if, say, the he's forced to be in the presence of Muggles, homeless muggles even. He wasn't a (willing) Death Eater in my story, so I'd like to aim for him to be less bigoted about the muggle aspect and more irritated about the class difference.

#+begin_quote
  If your upper class, your grandfather is ‘Grandpa', and your grandmother is actually probably ‘Granny

  , but to her face they'll most likely say ‘Granny', ‘Granny __' or even ‘Grandmama' if they have a stick up their arse.

This and other things makes me wonder what connection there is between that usage and the fact that a lot of southern Americans speak just this way. I've always referred to my grandmother this way, she always told me to.

**** Agreed. The real bottom rungs of society aren't really treated like real people: imagine how they'd make a big deal of supporting animal charities or an injured puppy - that's how they'd treat homeless people.

I also agree that Hogwarts would probably pick up public school mannerisms, but i think a lot are there already. The random 'hexing in the hallways' isn't too different from public school life in the 80s. An older student might look out for you. Or you might end up like Snape.

Corporal punishment is clearly referenced with Filch and the good old days. I don't see Dumbledore allowing it to continue, and certainly not into the 70s / 80s when it was fading anyway - he's pretty progressive.

Hogwarts speech might pick up its own notions, but it is the premier (only?) school for a hidden community. Everyone would talk like that. So a lot of wizard-isms might represent the same thing.

Snape /did/ have an older, more popular student looking out for him, didn't he? Only, that student happened to be Mulciber and an evil bigot, and that was pretty much how Snape ended up cutting ties with Lily and becoming a Death Eater.

I also don't get the feeling he was a general hexing-bag for /everyone/, either; he was more the Marauders' personal archenemy and vice-versa --- and from the spells Harry found in the Potions Textbook, gave as good as he got.

****** Fair point. It also shows the ability for this schooling environment to polarise people along lines of who protects whom.

When I say "you might end up like Snape" I mean that you might end up with your rivalries defining you. The Marauders seem to have this to an extent, but are also fleshed out beyond this rivalry - possibly just because of who they are and their importance as three dimensional characters in the story. Snape seems quite like the bullied kid who gets his own back: his experience appears to be defined by the situation he's in, and he doesn't have much agency in his school experience.

The HPB potions book kind of goes against that but I'm not sure. Anyone with other takes on him?

For newer shows, Vicious is loaded with insults and the most recent episode of John Oliver showed a British politician insulting fellow politicians.

There are a lot of Southern dialects and a lot of British dialects. This claim only really holds up when you're more specific. E.g. Maryland and Virginia were settled and their culture originally dominated by upper class Anglican royalists from the southwest of England, and the dialect that developed there and has now almost died out is the "posh" Southern accent people associate with the plantation class.

Hogwarts is a school that welcomes students on the basis of their abilities, British public schools welcome students whose parents are willing and able to pay. In one case the filter is merit and in the other it's money which makes your comparison spurious, imo.

The rich and wealthy in my year went on cruises, owned holiday homes (near the beach) as well as had massive houses and the snobbery they expressed was towards other schools' students rather than necessarily the less wealthy. Accents were unimportant, some of the richer people even had what would be considered a 'bogan accent' rather than the more posh Australian accent.
