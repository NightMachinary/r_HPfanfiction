All I remember is him getting pissed at Hermione for making people sign a contract when they didn't even know it, and also pissed that he wasn't told.

Thanks,\\

** Silly Hermione for making them sign.. She could just write their names herself, and then use a confundus charm on the parchment, thats how it works in gof! ;)

I guess if you take the [[/u/Starfox5]]'s headcanon that someone knowing they are bound by such a contract could get a curse-breaker to dissolve it might explain why Hermione kept it a secret. The jinx did seem to have a progressive effect, and it did prevent Marietta from saying too much before she got Obliviated.

*** Also, it's not really a doomsday machine, but a way to identify and punish the traitor/leak.
