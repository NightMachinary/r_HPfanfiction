** "Expecto Patronum!" "Expecto Patronum!" "Expecto Patronum!" The shouts rang out in the Room, shaking the ceiling slightly. A swarm of silvery blue animals swanned around the room, bolstered by the laughter and chatter of the students who had cast them.

In a corner, Colin and Dennis Creevey huddled together, comparing memories and wand movements.

"Go on then, Dennis, give it a go!" Harry had snuck up to them, wanting to encourage Dennis.

"All right, I'll try, but it's never worked before. I dunno if it's my memory or what, but all right then."

Harry stood back, pulling Colin with him.

"EXPECTO PATRONUUUUUM!" Dennis bellowed, snapping out the movement with it.

Something long and thin began to drizzle out of the end of his wand, quickly taking shape and solidifying. The Room of Requirement began to expand, taking Harry and Colin and the rest further away from Dennis. Dennis stared, awestruck, as whatever it was continued to push out of his wand. It began to thicken, wildly, growing and growing and growing, as the rest of its body finally burst forth.

"Bugger me. That's the bloody Giant Squid." A voice, probably Ron's, breathed into the silence.

Dennis began to grin as the Giant Squid rested a tentacle lovingly around his arm.

Fin.

** While Colin was a stalker/photography enthusiast, Dennis was an enthusiast for japanese culture.

So it shouldn't have come as a shock when Dennis's Patronus appeared.

"Expecto Patronum."

"Fucking weeaboo."

** Everyone else is making hentai jokes, but I'm thinking about how the squid rescued Dennis from falling out the boat on the way across the lake in his first year (according to his account and Colin's speculation, anyway) and as a result he considers the squid to be his protector. Which is exactly what a Patronus is.

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
