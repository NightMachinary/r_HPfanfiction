So I was thinking about Harry buying a home and about magical realestates and I had a thought about it.

They'd probably use pensives to view the properties wouldn't they? Have a memory of someone doing a thorough walkthrough of the house/land and just put it in a vial to show prospective buyers. It would be efficient, cost effective and you could browse multiple properties in the same day.

Does anyone else have their own head cannons about the every day life and businesses of the magical world?


** - real estate agents/wizards represent properties all over the country since apparition is a thing
- muggleborn wizards who specialize in properties in muggle areas and ensure the right wards & protections are on them
- brochures with moving pictures that can take you on a visual tour
- every property has a fireplace to connect to the floo network; this can be a pain to for the real estate wizards to install in muggle apartments

** We only see a single pensive in canon as far as I recall. It might even be unique though I doubt that.

I would assume they are very rare as they seem like an invaluable tool in many scenarios, and yet we see just the one. If they were common then there would be businesses dedicated to memories.

** Maybe 'Gated' communities full of magical people, are the new version of magical villages

** I think pensieves are too rare/expensive for this purpose, but I love sparkstorm's idea.

I've just read JKR's piece on pensieves which seems a little odd. Apparently the Hogwarts pensieve belongs to Hogwarts but normally they are as personal as wands and they and the memories buried with the wizard. The article suggests that the memories can be remove prior to burial. This seems a bit wasteful to me given how rare they are, but I suppose makes sense in historical shows of wealth in burial.

Very few wizards have the ability to sort through thoughts and feelings - I guess this would help with a house move. But if most wizards refuse to use them, I would imagine more could do this than it seems.

Most wizards are scared of them, but then I think I would be too.

Sparksstorm's idea is pretty much how my headcanon worked, although I imagine that some elite properties have secretive owners who only allow viewers to enter by private portkey or perhaps side along apparition. In this way, the location would never be known.

** I think large pieces of land covered in anti muggle charms could be a pretty expensive commodity since in the age of GPS and satellite maps it's much harder to make land disappear without muggles noticing than it used to be.

**** Just a few hundred years ago claiming some land and making it muggle proof would've been as easy as casting the spells, obliviating a few locals and altering some maps. So I doubt they took more land than they needed since they could always get more later. Until eventually they couldn't, and now the dragon reserves have serious problems of not being able to expand.
