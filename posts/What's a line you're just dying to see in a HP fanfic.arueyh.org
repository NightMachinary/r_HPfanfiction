  "Lucius," Voldemort said, looking up from a piece of parchment covered with crossed-out words, "come."

  "My Lord?" Lucius said. He approached the Dark Lord cautiously. "Is there some matter in which I may assist you?"

  "No, Lucius, it is I who may assist you," Voldemort said, and there was deep satisfaction in his voice, "did you know that the words 'Lucius Malfoy' are an anagram of 'a foul icy slum'?"

  "Professor Snape," Harry said, raising his hand in class, "did you know that the words 'Severus Snape' are an anagram of 'perv sees anus'?"

  "Professor Umbridge," Harry said, raising his hand in class, "did you know that the words 'Dolores Umbridge' are an anagram of 'used bedroom girl'?"

  "Yo Greengrass," Harry called out, "are you 'angered pre shags'? Because that's an anagram of your name."

*Tl:DR Voldemort loves anagrams and Harry inherited that love along with parseltongue.*

"What is it, Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall. "This had better be important."

"Oh, erm, right, Professor," said Harry. "Well, it's just that, erm, your name is an anagram for 'Vaginal Clam Monger.'"

****** Nope, that one is the abandoned 4th-year sequel, which sucks to be honest. Coldmirror (the creator) got a copyright strike and stopped working on it. She also went through some personal hardships IIRC.

What I am talking about are "Harry Potter und ein Stein" as well as "Harry Potter und der geheime Pornokeller".

Yup. It is bashing galore but because it does not take itself seriously it is utterly hilarious. I mean, it has inbred, retarded Weasleys, Dumbledore finances Hogwarts through child pornography (which is the real reason Harry is famous), Harry and Ron want to go through a sex change to sleep with Hermione, who is lesbian and everyone fucks everything. And yet it throws no shade at any character.

Hermione: "Oh no, we are starving and cold. Now if only there was a place with many muggles where we wouldn't stand out. Preferably from a chain with hundreds of stores in the UK so that the Death Eaters couldn't watch this one in Bournemouth. Perhaps that's what I will do after the war, Harry... I think I will name it Tesco, no one has ever thought of that."
