I keep seeing this all over the place and wonder where it comes from as it seems to make no sense to me. First, if it was so easy to make an oath like this, what would be the point of an unbreakable vow. Second, characters use this for such inane reasons, sometimes to do such simple things as promising not to tell others where the Slytherin common room is.


** Freemasons. [[https://freemasonrymatters.co.uk/latest-news-freemasonry/so-mote-it-be/][Here]], basically they're an odd bunch that people think are mysterious, so basically they're wizards.

*** I worked at a museum that had a freemasons exhibit and masons would come in all the time. For a secret society, they couldn't resist telling me they were masons and showing me the handshake. Also, they can apply online.

Honestly I went in assuming it was a shady club full of nepotism and shit, but it just became obvious that it's a grown up Scouts with added pomp and circumstance to make them feel mysterious. They absolutely delight in others thinking they're in control.

It's easier to say that they are not a secret society; they are a society with secrets.

****** It may vary from place to place but there is something to memorize, though I would not classify it as a book. There is a pamphlet with some questions that you are expected to know the responses to. The questions relate specifically the ceremony you experienced for your current degree. Once you are proficient with your current degree you can move to the next. I don't know anyone who wasn't able to get their proficiency in a timely fashion.

Also, you go through the initiation first, then you study the initiation process. You aren't given the information until you are a member.

***** Yeah the exhibit was a reconstructed Masonic hall (it was a living museum, so a little town) and it was rather beautiful in there. But then all the masons would be upset that I was in there as a woman and I had to remind them it wasn't a real Masonic lodge.

****** It sounds like you dealt with a bunch of old jackasses. Even in active masonic building I am not familiar with any rule barring women. OES (a women's group within masonry) generally shares the same space, so that reaction is really weird. The only restriction is that non-members cannot be in the meeting room while the meeting is happening.

I will add a caveat that there is no central authority for all freemasons. Each jurisdiction can make their own rules, so it's possible there was one with these weird restrictions.

*** Indeed.

Note that Matt Groening is himself a Master-ranked Freemason and thus plugged into the network of those who hold the levers of power. This is why /The Simpsons/ keeps predicting stuff in an uncanny way--the Trump Presidency, Arnold Palmer's death, Nobel Prize winners in economics, Siegfried & Roy's Roy being mauled by their white tiger, Disney's purchase of Fox, the list goes on.

The only possible explanation is that Freemasons are wizards and that divination is real. So very real.

** [Another Mason here]

'So mote it be' is from the Masons, but it may have come via NeoPagans, who borrowed some material from us. It does not appear in the HP books. Don't know about the first part, but its not Masonic. Both usages seem to be heavy in HP fanfiction.

Since people are asking about us, I'll drop in this:

Here s my standard ‘elevator pitch':

We're a centuries old fraternal order, who exist to improve our own character ('we make good men better' is one of our slogans), and through that improve our communities. Along the way, we do a lot of charity (forex: Shriner's free hospitals for crippled children), and have a lot of cool and private ceremonies using the construction of King Solomon's Temple as an allegorical base for teaching Enlightenment and Stoic ideals. (yes, we really do have secret handshakes).

We have several million Brothers world wide, but no central organization. Many prominent men from every walk of life have been members, including over a dozen US presidents. Regular Masonry is open to adult men of good character who are not atheists - we require a belief in some form of 'higher power', but aren't fussy about what. As a rule, we don't recruit; we want a potential member to make the first approach of his own free will.

If you're curious, drop by our main hangout on reddit, [[/r/freemasonry]]. You'll find a lot of friendly folk there. If you prefer a book, for North Americans I recommend (seriously, I'm not trolling) "Freemasons for Dummies" by Christopher Hodapp.

** 'So mote it be' is masonic, though I have no idea what the origins of the phrase are. Masons need to believe in a higher power to join, but they don't need to be explicitly Christian. My feeling is that it is a more neutral phrase than 'amen' to end a prayer with. I don't know if that is the reason for the tradition.

The 'I swear on my life and magic' thing doesn't resemble anything masonic, I really don't have anything to offer on that.

Old-fashioned way of saying 'so may it be'.

Swearing on your life and magic could well be a wizarding oath, but we don't see it in canon and we /definitely/ don't see it actually having magical force. I could see it being like a judicial oath, to the effect that the subsequent evidence is, if not truth, perjury, but if magical oaths worked the way they do in fanon, Snape's occlumency would be worse than useless in keeping Tom from learning he's a double agent.

** The precedence of a magically binding contract probably stems from the Goblet of Fire and the Unbreakable Vow, and just became a logical extension of both. One person probably read a fic with this dialogue then incorporated it into theirs and so on. I read a really funny fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904590/1/Wizard-s-Oath][A Wizards Oath]] that deconstructs this fannon trope by arguing that if such a vow existed, Sirius could use it to prove his innocence since he would still have his magic despite everyone thinking he betrayed the Potters.

**** When Veritaserum isn't that reliable and there's Occulomency, there should be some ambiguity otherwise Snape couldn't be a good agent. If there were magic sucking Vows, the story would be over too fast. I think writers like the ideas of these vows to show that Purebloods care more for their magic than their lives, so making one is somehow more “high stakes” and think they're doing some high level world building.
