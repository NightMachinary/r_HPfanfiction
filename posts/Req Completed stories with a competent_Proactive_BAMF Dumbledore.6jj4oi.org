There are far too many stories with either an incompetent or outright evil Dumbledore but where are the ones where Dumbledore shows why he's the greatest wizard since Merlin? The only wizard Voldemort feared? The one who will bring the pain to all those who hurt the innocent? For lack of a better description (and to paraphrase Marvel Comics)...where is World Breaker Dumbledore?


** I'm only 8 chapters in but the Dumbledore in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7469856/1/][Hallowed]] is very quickly becoming one of my favorites. He's had 3 fight scenes so far and they've all been badass.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]] has an incredibly dangerous one once he lets loose. A wee bit bashy but still fun for the most part. Skip to the last couple chapters for Dumbledore.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][Denarian Renegade]] is quite palarizing but most agree that it's Dumbledore is a massive badass and if I recall right he only gets more so in the sequels.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9079271/1/The-Last-Straw-Oneshot][The Last Straw]] One shot about what finally forces Dumbledore to confront Grimdelwald. /so./ /cool./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/][Magicks of the Arcane]] is also pretty good from what I remember. Mentor Dumbledore in 4th year.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6739500/10/The-Warren][The Warren]] One shot. The /only/ proactive, competant /and/ manipulative Dumbledore I've ever read. Ever. This is exactly what you are looking for.

** I tend to write Dumbledore pretty much like that. Here are some completed stories of mine where he shows why Voldemort feared him:

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** Linkffn(9863146), The Accidental Animagus. Dumbledore is the Grand Sorcerer of Europe, and in Year 3 he kills a Nundu with the help of Australia's Grand Sorcerer. (Nundus being pretty much a magical nuke combined with a bioweapon, and usually requiring no less than 100 wizards to kill) Albus makes a set of robes from its hide. Voldemort basically has to put together a team of Dark Lords to face Dumbledore. Linkffn(One World), Dumbledore's duel with Grindelwald lasted three days straight, and ended with them fighting atop a tank, which was preserved and incorporated into a statue depicting the duel.. Then there's a one-shot on Spacebattles where Dumbledore confronts a Marty Stu!Super!Harry, and does the kindly old man equivalent of "git gud scub".
