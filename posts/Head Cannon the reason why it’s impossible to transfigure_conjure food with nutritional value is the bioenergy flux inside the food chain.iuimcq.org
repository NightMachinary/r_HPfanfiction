Google it for more details, but in simple terms plants can absorb energy from the soil, water and sun to produce bioenergy which it stores a part and makes use of the rest to fuel it's life. Then herbivores eat a large number of plants, acquiring parts of it's energy which sum up to what the animal needs. Then carnivores do the same...

However, things like a metal, rocks, plastic... just aren't included inside this flux (and here we pass from real world science to theorizing about magic/metaphysics), so they wouldn't hold bioenergy by themselves. So assuming that magic can't create bioenergy, even if such materials were to be altered magically to imitate food it wouldn't be able to sustain a living creature. Note that plants still have bioenergy, so technically wooden tables /could/ be transfigured in food -hence McGonnagals first class table to pig demonstration- but it's nutritional value would be extremely low to the point of being almost zero.

A person could theoretically get enough random plants (even if not edible) and transfigurate them onto viable food with nutritional value, though I really wouldn't want to even imagine the calculations to find out how much biomass would be needed to replace an average meal.

So, this is my understanding of why transfiguring food from anything other than food is supposedly impossible. Any thoughts?


** "Bioenergy" as you describe it is usually simply chemical energy, or potential energy stored in the form of bonds between atoms. Things like metal, rocks, plastic still have chemical bonds which means that there is potential energy stored within them. Ever toss sodium metal in water? Transfiguration changes the nature of an object, including its molecular structure, meaning that it does change the chemical bonds within an object.

Of course, I think any scientific explanation (using current scientific models, not the scientific method) of HP phenomena is doomed to fail, because current scientific models do not account for magic, souls, etc. Magic in HP is conceptual which is directly at odds with scientific explanation of concepts.

*** Good point, I learned the basis of it some years back in High School and thought that it was frankly the best way of making the cannon law on conjuring/transfigurating food make some sense without falling into the old and tired adage of “Wyzardes are jwst ztubid”. I guess the idea of trying to apply real-world science to magic /was/ very far off, still think the basic concept can be used to explain why some rules are so arbitrary.

** I always thought it was because you can't transform a significant transfiguration.

I don't know where I got the idea from, but since you have to actively 'untransfigure' a transfigured thing to make it turn back into its original form and more distinct things are harder to transfigure into each other (you start with match into needle and only get into pig into dining table stages really late), that interferes with any new processes of change the transfigured thing might undergo. Magic is essentially forcing it to stay the 'transfigured thing' and not the thing you're trying to change it into. So, if you turn a potato into a mahogany table, it won't burn right; if you turn a glass mug into a bacon sandwich, it can't be digested right; etc etc. Magic is still trying to keep the potato as a table and the mug as a sandwich, rather than ashes and poop respectively. Magical purpose overwrites mundane nature.

It's also why you can transfigure food into more food, because it's not a different thing so the process isn't interfered with enough to make it non-digestible.

Does bring up interesting ideas on if you can transfigure potatoes into chips or cows into steak and eat them with no consequences though. Or if a magical creature can eat magical things. Or magical fire could burn a magical table.

** But what is uneatable to some is food to others, not all organisms are able to break and form the same bonds, cows and other herbivores are able to eat leaves and grass, while we can't and the difference is just how the same sugar molecules are bound together. Some bacteria can eat some plastics, nevermind what some archaeans are able to use as food.

So that would mean that in the end the magic doesn't chance the chemistry of the object, but the molecule structure stays the same, you just 'convince' it that it has other physical properties
