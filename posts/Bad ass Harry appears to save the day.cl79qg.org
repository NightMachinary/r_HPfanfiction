Was just watching random videos on YouTube...and happened to see Thors entry with stormbreaker in infinity war

Now I really want to read a fic where when the good guys are beaten black and blue by voldemort and his death Eaters and are about to be wiped out... and suddenly

Harry James Potter...comes in...hair ruffling in unseen wind ...eyes glowing with an eerie green...and just decimates everyone and goes

"BRING ME VOLDEMORT"

  "Hey, Neville mate..." he flashes a shit-kickin' grin totally out of nowhere, and turning back toward the fray he finishes "...watch this."

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

*** Always a favorite of mine.

For a fic that pairs Harry with Hermione, it's surprisingly critical of Hermione.

It is worked up to in this one and its sequel. I cannot told you how many times I have read it from the begining. That being said it takes a few chapters to hit its stride. I'd say around Asgrad it hits it.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

There are hints of Thanos up to something, but it runs off more of the comic verse than anything.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
