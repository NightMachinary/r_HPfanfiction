Hi, I'm looking for a fanfic where Harry starts taking his school work seriously and baffles everyone with his intelligence. If possible, I'd like the story to start with his month at the Leaky Cauldron, seeing as he has nothing to do then.

I don't mind bashing and pairings etc. but I would prefer non-slash.

Thanks in advance

** This is largely a comedy and hints at a Stargate crossover, but is entertaining. linkffn(8551180)

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror
