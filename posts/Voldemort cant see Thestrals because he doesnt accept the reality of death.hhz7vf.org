Just had this idea that to see Thestrals you not only have to see death but to accept that in the end anything will die. therefore Voldemort cant see them.


** What about a thestral wand ? Would it somehow be less visible to someone who hadn't seen death? Like a sort of â€˜I can see it out of the corner of my eye but not really when I look directly at it' kind of thing ?

*** Maybe it works poorly? I think you would still see it because the hair is inside the wood

*** Only the core is made of Thestral, though. Unless you can use, say, bone as a wand housing, everyone can see it cause it's just made of wood that covers the entire thing.

** What about children that have seen someone die, though. I know a lot of kids don't truly have an understanding of Death, so would they be able to see thestrals if they'd seen someone die?
