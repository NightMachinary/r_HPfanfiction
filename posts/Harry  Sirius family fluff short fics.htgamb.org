It doesn't matter exactly when- it could be before the Potters were attacked, or from that short period when Harry and Sirius had the time to get to know each other, or even AU fics where Harry grew up with Sirius.

I just feel like reading something short and fluffy, so I would appreciate oneshots or short fics instead of longer ones!

Thanks!

  Sirius chose to raise Harry instead of taking off after Peter. He just really, really wishes that people would stop telling him how to raise Harry.

** Try â€žLiving with Dangerâ€œ (sorry idk how to link stuffðŸ˜…) It's an AU having Harry grow up with Sirius, Remus and some other characters, and it's really great!! But it definitely isn't a short fic, 50 chapters, and 4 sequels (but you don't really have to read the sequels, imo the first is the best anyway)
