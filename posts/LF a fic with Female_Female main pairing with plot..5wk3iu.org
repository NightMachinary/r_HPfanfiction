Mature or NC-17 is fine, but not PWP. Preferably without Hermione in the main pairing. No other restrictions.

A couple examples that come to mind are linkffn(Bound with Silver Threads) and linkffn(A Butterfly Effect by SlyGoddess).

  Lily Luna Potter years 3-7. Why is she stuck with a Little Malfoy tag-along? What do the coming years hold for them and everyone else? How will they change and grow, what will happen as they do, & who will end up with whom? Eventual femslash. Multiple pairings. Lily/OC. Also stars Scorpius Malfoy's OC little sister. Not T until Chap 29, really not until Chap 32 & nothing too major.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  After Voldemort, Hogwarts seems to be divided into untrustworthy Slytherins and everyone else. But when Lydia Carmichael, reluctant Slytherin, met Lyra Wood on the Hogwarts Express, the rules started to change. Eventual GryffindorSlytherin femmeslash.
