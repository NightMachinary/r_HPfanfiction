After she wrote the Robert Galbraith books under a pseudonym, it occurred to me that she might have written and published a story about Harry online. Of course, she almost certainly hasn't. But anyway, I'm not asking for you favourite, just the one that, when reading it, made you think that it could have been written by JKR. So it should be well written, have a good storyline, and be believable, at the very least.


** The Seventh Horcrux, the fake 7th book.

I hated Deathly Hallows.

*** This was actually the first fan fiction story I ever read. I started it thinking it was the actual leaked 7th book, and I was so disappointed that it wasn't legit. But then I realized that it want terrible in and of itself and that opened the doors to fan fiction for good for me. Good times.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2506841/1/Surviving-the-Weasley-Twins][This.]]

The start is a little slow but the writing improves, and the style is very close to Rowling's, IMO.

** Well i don't read many fics that have a similar tone or style as the originals, particularly with the wonder of the magical world while still keeping it somewhat light. I guess the closest I would have to say from my perspective, based upon what I can remember at the moment, would have to be the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series

*** the quick series is still not particularly close to jkr's level of character writing, and of plot, background, etc. very good nonetheless.

i've never read a full-length fic that had close to the right style, but i feel like i've read a couple of shorts that could (im)plausibly have been written by her.

**** I've always maintained the idea that Hogwarts Houses Divided (same author as the Alexandra Quick series) would be easily publishable as an 8th Harry Potter book.

****** I read that a while ago. I liked it mainly because the writing is pretty good. That being said, the content is a little... loose, I guess. It's good, but I never really felt captivated by it and I think I dropped it near the end.

It's been a while, though, and I had just come off reading a few great novels when I picked that story up, so that could have contributed to my opinion of it. Overall, definitely recommendable and easily one of the best next gen stories.

*** He could have been redeemed as a character if she did that in the right way, instead he seemed loudmouthed and of questionable loyalty :/

Love my bittersweet endings me, Neville killed the snake. Ron should have killed Bellatrix or Greyback or something like distracting Death Eaters to let kids get away :(
