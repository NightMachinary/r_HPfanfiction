Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7250343/1/]]) is an AMAZING one shot that really made me think. It has a realistic representation of snape*, specifically younger snape, and has it's own take on time travelling.

I absolutely loved the twist in the end. Time travelling was a really bad idea. This fic isn't your usual time travel fic, instead of being a peggy sue or something like that it actually shows what sort of situation you would get yourself in if you time travelled recklessly in real life.

*Actually, all the author's work are a realistic representation of Snape, and the author is actually really good at getting across how characters are like - in one of his fics, he managed to show the vast differences between Harry and Snape's perception of the world in the first 2 lines
