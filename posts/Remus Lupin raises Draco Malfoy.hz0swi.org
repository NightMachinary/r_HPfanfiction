Draco Malfoy was a squib, and was locked in the dungeon by his father. His mother helps him escape, and Draco somehow becomes a werewolf. Remus moved to France, and he needs wolfsbane potion, but there isn't any in France, so he apparates to London, to a shop run by Thomas Barrow. The Thomas Barrow from Downton Abbey. Draco walks in the shop with 4 sickles, and Remus and Draco live together in France. The last time I read, Remus was going to adopt Draco. It's on archive of our own. Anything helps, thank you.
