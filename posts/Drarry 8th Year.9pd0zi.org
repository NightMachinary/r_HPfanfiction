Good HP/DM fanfic where they all go back to Hogwarts after the final battle to redo their 7th year?


** This subredit isn't overly friendly to slash for whatever reason. I'd suggest going over to [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]], where you might get a better response.

We have nothing against m/m in general. But in the HP fandom, ~90% of all m/m fics involve Voldemort or a Death Eater and one of their victims (like Harry). And given that they are inspired by the Third Reich, people like OP are basically asking for the magical equivalent of Anne Frank/Heinrich Himmler. It makes absolutely no sense that Harry would be attracted to the people who killed his parents, his father figure and a bunch of other people dear to him.

And it's not like Malfoy is innocent. Just in his attack on Katie he committed several war crimes, and that's not even taking the basic "attempted murder" and "terrorism" into account. So even if Harry was gay, he'd rather date Gwamp than the magical Nazis he just fought a civil war against.

Perhaps if OP asked for Harry/Terry Boot, people would be more accepting, but Malfoy, Snape, Voldemort, the Lestranges, Rookwood and Dolohov are simply a no-no from the character standpoint.

**** This was unnecessarily rude. Inquiring about Harry/Draco is not like asking for Anne Frank/Hitler. Be less judgy, damn.

Add On: Also, because I can't sleep, why not have this discussion? Draco is not irremediable. He gains sympathy and understanding in Deathly Hallows.

***** He still committed plenty of war crimes and belongs into prison for life. Which makes a romance rather challenging.

He wholeheartedly supported genocide and only chickened out when he had to get his hands dirty. His membership of the Death Eaters was exactly what he previously asked for.

******* Opinions are opinions, but the law is the law. Or do you honestly want to argue that Malfoy did not break them when he carried out terrorist attacks? That his crimes do not warrant punishment?

******** 1. It's a fictional world. Calm your metaphorical tits.
2. Crimes or not, Draco is a redeemable character in canon. Arguing with people on Reddit doesn't make canon change.
3. Grawp not Gawmp.

***** But they usually include time travel back to a time where she was not a batshit insane sadistic terrorist, when she was a powerful witch but otherwise pretty much a blank character. On the other hand, we know that Snape chose his shady friends over Lily, we know that Malfoy called for Genocide at age 12 and showed clear sadistic tendencies at 13. By the age of 16, Voldemort had already murdered four people. There are many parts of their canon characterisation which would prohibit the common Bellatrix scenarios (time travel, she was forced by a marriage contract or potions) to work. Most Harry/Bellatrix scenarios also diverge before she killed Sirius. Without that, there is nothing personal between them.

If you want to make the same changes to the common slash pairings, you'd need to diverge in 92 (Malfoy), 78 (Snape) or even earlier for Voldemort.

****** a lot of tomarry fics do have time travel to before riddle's first kill. And for malfoy and snape, they show their side of the story. And when you look at the HP canon scenes with a bit of perspective, they can come across quite empathetic characters

******* I don't care if they are empathetic or not, they still break the laws and would have been summarily executed by any side in WWII. As for time travel to the 40s, it is utterly retarded when the time traveler chooses to waste years on Riddle when there is that chap named Hitler running around, whose Death toll is several magnitudes higher.

No matter from which angle you look at it, when Malfoy attacks Katie he still is disguising himself as civilian, not wearing distinctive insigniae and attacking civilians. That makes him an illegal combatant, who were regularly subject to summary execution (nowadays trial as war criminal). And that's completely ignoring membership of the Death Eaters (Treason), attempted murder and using an unforgivable.
