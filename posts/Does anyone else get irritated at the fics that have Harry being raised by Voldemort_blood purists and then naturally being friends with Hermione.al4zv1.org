** I generally avoid those types of fics, since they tend to read like authoritarian-rightwing propaganda thinly disguised as a fanfiction, *or* Harry's upbringing had no bad side effects whatsoever and /here are all canon plotpoints version 2174743 for you, have fun/.

If Harry is raised by Voldemort (and therefore also influenced by people like Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius Malfoy, Antonin Dolohov,...), then him being friends with Hermione is simply OOC for this version of Harry. Following this, you get all the same problems usually connected to OOC. Logical inconsitencies, doublethink, idiot balls,...

On the other side, if Harry /doesn't/ overcome his adoptive parent's lessons, then we read about a undeniably evil character, unless the world compensates for his ideologies by bringing forth an alternative universe in which they are reasonable (I'd like to note here that I have yet to see this. Its just a theoretical possibility in my eyes). In most cases it devolves into an edgy cringefest of Harry being supercool while endorsing or performing acts of extreme violence and hate.

** I suspect it is because the writers conclude that blood politics is so dumb that Harry would reinterpret it as KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and Hermione is the epitome of knowledge, so an alliance with her would translate well into power.

** In most 'Harry raised by Voldemort' fics Harry is against Muggles but not against Muggleborns. Many fics go with the idea that Voldemort (himself a Halfblood) used the Blood Purists as a means to an end but never gave a whit about their ideology beyond how it could be used to manipulate them.

In other cases, Voldemort/the Death Eaters only get hold of Harry after he has been raised by his parents/the Dursleys for a while, so Harry already has a foundation of non-extremist ideas to shape how he judges the people he meets. That makes him more likely to recognize Hermione's strengths rather than continue to blindly dismiss her.

TL;DR I only get irritated when the fic is badly written. There are ways that plot can be done well so that Harry's views make sense in the story.

******* Shapiro makes sense if you've never engaged with the actual complexities of the topics he hand waves about. I always found it ironic that he goes on about "facts don't care about your feelings" and yet his whole spiel about why abortion is bad comes down to showing pictures of a fertilized egg developing and slowly looking more like a developed person, and the saying "This is glob of cells", a clear attempt at motivating agreement with him based on emotion (namely, that people shouldn't want to prevent the development of somethinf that will look like a person eventually). And this is just a clear example, there are doubtlessly more.

*************** But they are. Most states (something like 41 or 43) ban abortions (barring danger to the mother) between. 22 and 28 weeks along. The changes you're referencing are not all uniform (One example in New York does not overturn a generality) in extending the length (see New Mexico's changes) and are about protecting abortion rights as it becomes increasingly likely that the now vehemently right wing SCOTUS is present and would like to over turn Roe v. Wade. Hell, even in the NY case the point is that the ban past 24 weeks is problematic when at, say, 30 weeks the fetus turns out to be unviable outside the womb.

In general, the point is to make it a public health issue to remove it from the legal question given it's status as a right may well be up for grabs soon. You are engaging in propaganda, even if you don't realize it. This information is easily accessible:

1. BloodPurist!Harry becomes favourably disposed towards Hermione---perhaps to the point of admiration---before finding out that she is a Muggleborn.
2. Getting severe cognitive dissonance from this, he concludes that Hermione /must/ be at the very least a half-blood, so he spends a lot of effort trying to "prove" that to her, to the point of stealing a blood sample and getting some sort of an inheritance test done.
3. Having failed to find any evidence of recent magical ancestry, he graduates to the "one of the good ones" excuse, and so on.
