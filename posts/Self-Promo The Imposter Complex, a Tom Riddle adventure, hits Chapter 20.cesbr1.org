Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed, and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

I'm always a bit self conscious about linking my own work, but I feel like chapter twenty is enough of a milestone to merit a promo.

** Brilliant! I love this fic, you have built such an interesting world, and I'm looking forward to where you take the plot! I've always figured Riddle's journey post-Hogwarts would be very interesting to explore.

*** It's about halfway through. My rate of writing has halved as of the end of the financial year, as my workload has increased and thus I cannot write at work as much, but I'm hoping to be done by the end of the year at the latest.

  The tale of a Diary that was a little more independent, and a little less puppy-murderingly evil, than he was really given credit for. After all, what's a bit of major violation of the laws of men and magic between friends?Originally posted on ffnet, now also updating here.

** Solid effort. If I had an AO3 account, I'd definitely follow this. As it is, I expect I'll keep an eye on it manually.

The canon claim that a soul can only be reunited through remorse is not in effect here?
