** I wouldn't say the incompetence lies only with his followers. Point in case: Riddle had tried and failed to kill Harry with avada kedavra /twice/, by the end of book 7, and during the final duel he tries to use it a /third/ time. That's not counting the convoluted monologue explaining why the new wand might not work, at which point LV could have pulled out his old wand, or conjured a gun or something. He's supposed to be a genius, he could figure out /something/.

*** I think we're supposed to assume that by the time he inadvertently makes Harrycrux, his constant soul-splitting has driven him completely fucking bonkers. That's setting aside the fact that, as a character, Voldemort is just plain awful. Badly written, incomprehensible, completely irrational motivations and behavior, yadda yadda. There's a reason Umbridge is so much more powerfully hated by the fandom - she's actually a comprehensible character. You can understand who she is and why she does the awful shit she does.

** I'm into it, I'd read it.

Except I'm imagining this guy:

Just think about popping round the local to find the management's changed and that guy tries to sell you a new brew.
