  A young Harry learns the everyday power of words. He's going to make the Dursleys happy by being "normal". Then they'll love him, just like they love Dudley! It's a flawless plan... right? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Harry, canonical level child neglect/abuse. Complete. Part 1 of the "Perfectly Normal" series.

*** Darn,I meant that I want Harry to realise that the horrid Durslsys were lying to him,that he is special and that he starts terrorizing the Dursleys in the way Tom mind raped Dennis and Amy for the way they treated him.I want him to be manipulative true,but not lild that.He can make bad things happen to people.He can make them HURT.

**** ah must have missed that part, most I can think of end up with evil Harry just murdering them and leaving.

Something like this for example : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10962500/1/The-Lady-of-Slytherin-Dark-Beginnings]]

but no slow manipulations.

Trust is a Relative Thing doesn't quite fit all of your points, but Petunia raises Harry to be manipulative and hate Dumbledore. I definitely recommend it.

  What if Petunia put the blame where it belonged instead of on Harry? OOC Petunia Dursley Rating for mild language
