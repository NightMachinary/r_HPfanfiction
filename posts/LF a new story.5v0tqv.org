** Other slash is fine besides those pairings? Do you prefer Harry centric stories? If so, during hogwarts or after?

*** I do prefer Harry centric stories yes, I'd rather there not be Slash involving Harry but it's not a deal breaker, and preferably during Hogwarts but just after is ok too!

**** I haven't read many Harry centric stories set during Hogwarts that arent slash tbh. Worth a shot for you though are [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=11240][Becoming Neville]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261750/1/Misplaced-Moony][Misplaced Moony]]. Becoming Neville is Harry/Neville set the summer after 5th year and really really feels like canon. IIRC the slash isn't too graphic and there is a cool mystery plot that was great. Misplaced Moony isn't Harry-centric, but he is a main side character. It is set during 5th year I think, and Remus from the past somehow time travels to the future. The main pairing is Remus/Hermione and is really well done.

  A mysterious item and mischievous Marauders end up accidentally shoving Remus Lupin into another time and place where he has to rebuild his life from scratch, deal with the aftermath of a war he hadn't yet been a part of, all with the help of new friends and a special young witch. *Art by Freya Ishtar*
