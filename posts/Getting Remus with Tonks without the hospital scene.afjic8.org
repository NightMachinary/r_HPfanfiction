My basic question is whether it would be possible to get Remus and Tonks, or Remus and OC together without having to involve other people and him being stricken by grief. You can already tell I'm not a fan of that scene, but that's because it had a lot to do with other people and I think his grief also influenced things. So, is it possible to have him agree to be in a relationship because he believes the other person understands what it might cost her to be with him? What would convince Remus Lupin that a woman is ready to be with him? I'm saying this because the marauders went to great lengths to help him. I know there's also self-loathing and so on, but I also got the impression that he thought others didn't fully understand what he was trying to say and weren't even listening. Or is it absolutely impossible and only external factors could help here?


** Maybe the other being a werewolf too would make it easier. I also think that Sirius living would put him in a position to spur Remus in the right direction

*** Agree with this as it's basically what happens in my fic. He just needs someone who he's not romantically linked to for sounding his worries without being judged. In Canon, he literally had nobody.

** I actually think that the heart of what Tonks is expressing in the hospital scene is okay and might work under less manipulative circumstances. Meaning, if she'd continued to say those same things (she'd obviously said them before Harry was around to witness it) but didn't do it in semi-public in the immediate aftermath of Dumbledore's death, it could have worked eventually. Once upon a time he was convinced to have friends; why not a romantic partner? The thing is, it would be more grind than grand gesture. Tonks leads toward grand gestures, but I'm betting she wouldn't have been the only person chosen for the auror program in umpteen years if she wasn't capable of the grind, too.

External factors would speed it up though, and there's an obvious one who was gone by that point in canon. Having Sirius survive a bit longer would have been helpful because Sirius was living proof that someone could choose to take the package deal that is Remus' goodness and badness, at least in a platonic-love sense. And if Sirius says “go be with my baby cousin” that carries a lot more weight than it would coming from someone who wasn't perfectly well acquainted with Remus' wolf side.

*** I agree that this might have worked under different circumstances, though I personally think she should have done something to prove she is capable of dealing with his condition and that she knows what might happen, otherwise she just seems naive. I also wondered about him having friends and thus thought he could have a romantic partner. But a romantic partner would have to deal with his condition far more closely, like looking after him after full moons and facing the stigma it carries, so he must have been affraid of this.

I love that hospital scene as an example of a really sick, dysfunctional way to start a relationship. Everyone's like, “Oh, she's grabbing him, shaking him, and shouting at him that she doesn't care that he keeps saying no, while he's trying to mourn his mentor's death. That's so romantic.” No.

*** Yes,that bit with animagus might work. I'm not sure about setting him up with a werewolf, though. It' seems that you might be right about him not being, well, particularly fond of them.But maybe I'm wrong. The wierd thing is that it took me quite some time to realize how that scene looked from outsider's perspective. Everyone thinks everything is so simple, but I just don't think it is, and the timing couldn't have been worse. And even all Remus Tonks fics I've read or tried to read are the same- get together in OOTP, then he suddenly changes his mind, then the final hospital scene. So I started wondering what would make him start a relationship in the first place. But I'm no closer to finding an answer than I was before ,lol.

**** In my fic, I have him turn her down by telling her he's not looking for a relationship, so she assures him that all she wants is a no-strings-attached one-night-stand, and then another one after that... Which is deceptive. Their relationship seems unhealthy to me. That pregnancy was obviously unplanned. I wonder if Tonks lied about being on birth control. I think Harry should have been more sympathetic about Remus maybe trying to escape from an abusive relationship, but of course Harry was just a teenager who didn't know the whole story.

***** You know, I had some,erm, dark thoughts about that pregnancy, but I knew this fandom would burn me alive if I said anything. It might be unfair to Tonks,but the way she behaves doesn't portray her in a very positive light. There are maybe three scenes where they are shown together, and in all of them Tonks is perfectly happy while Remus is depressed. Guess What I thought when I reread them? It was like'oh she must think she got what she wanted'. That's not very kind of me and that's definitely not what JK intended. In your opinion, what would make Remus willingly enter a relationship? Btw, what is your fic about?

****** It takes two people to make a baby. Unless you're suggesting Tonks raped Remus, there are a few very easy steps he could have taken to not have a child if he didn't want one. I didn't really get a harassing vibe from Tonks either, but I can see how one might.

That's not to say I thought their relationship was healthy, as it clearly wasn't, I just hate the stupid sexist idea of women trapping men with children as if having a child is their choice alone.

****** Go ahead, share your dark thoughts. It's winter, a bonfire would be nice. People bash the other characters all the time. Tonks should have a turn.

My fic Humansplaining is mostly canon-compatible, although I've pushed back the formation of the second incarnation of the Order to 1993. Canon doesn't tell us exactly when Dumbledore started it back up. Tonks meets Remus before Snape outs him as a werewolf, so he's still in the closet, even to most of his fellow Order members. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34317807]])

It's hard for me to imagine Remus having some happily-ever-after ending with his true love. I wrote a canon-compatible fic about the aftermath of the First Wizarding War, when Remus was one of the few survivors of the Order. He doesn't even let himself have friends, much less a girlfriend. Warning, this is pretty dark. I have ideas to do a whole Employee of the Month series about his twelve years of poverty, hopelessness, and loneliness between the wars, although no one is demanding that. My readers are demanding updates to my cheerful time-travel fixit instead. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

I have a story in which he and a muggle woman are thrown together by circumstance during the First Wizarding War. A different fanfic writer would give them a happy ending after this, but not me. This is a work in progress, but will eventually explain why his friends thought he was the spy in the Order, thus didn't tell him the plan to switch secret-keepers. In this one, when asked why he doesn't have a werewolf girlfriend, he's disgusted at the idea. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14939201/chapters/34612796]])

If you want to see Remus happy, I have this silly little one-joke time travel story: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828663]])

I know, we just want Remus to be happy, but fate (meaning Rowling) seemed to create him just to suffer.

******* You are just as cruel as Rowling. It's strange that even though I want him to be happy and therefore I happily ignore the ending of DH, I can't think of a way to make it happen. I remember thinking that he might have had friends during those 12 years, but he apparently doesn't think so. Maybe he thought that other marauders were the exception and there's no way someone else could befriend him. As for Tonks, Rowling loves the idea that opposites attract, and even though it's true, I got a bit bored with it. It also seems that in Remus's case only a woman who is inexperienced and naive could be with him. To me that sounds like a recipee for disaster. I wish there was some hurt comfort story about him and someone else, bonded by similar experiences or something. But I should stop imagining things lol. But I know that there are such examples in reality.Also, I generally might enjoy a story where a younger woman falls in love with an older man, but those two are so different. Well, and I'm not a fan of forceful characters, so Tonks, especially in most fics, is a bit too much for me. Thanks for the links. So you aren't a fan of happy endings? Well, you've chosen a perfect character then. Doom and gloom. I hope you won't get depressed after writing about his 12 years of solitude. This title already sounds gloomy.

Cheer up and read this. It doesn't really explain how Tonks and Remus work as a couple, but their adult, time-traveling son rescues them from the Battle of Hogwarts. Of course, Remus finds a way to be miserable anyway. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time]])

My favorite fic so far!

Sirius escapes and kidnaps Harry years before hogwarts. Lupin joins the search effort for his best friend's son, and Auror trainee Tonks' first job is the hunt for Sirius Black. They spend over a year searching together, during half of which Lupin actively sabotages the search after he found out the truth about Wormtail.
