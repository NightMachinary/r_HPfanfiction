:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was an incomplete (around 2016, don't know what the current situation is) AU GoF fanfic, where Harry is using Norse magic (more chanting, runes, staff in place of wand) and he is interested in weather manipulation etc., with Dumbledore being more of a genuine mentor to him.

I don't remember the name, can anyone help?

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

*** Not exactly what I was looking for. But I'm definitely going to read it!

What I remember is:

1. Harry had been fascinated with Nordic magic from the start.
2. Dumbledore, while concerned, guides and supports him.
3. It opens just a month before Beauxbatons and Durmstrang arrive.
4. Hermione is a student at Beauxbatons (if memory serves me right)

Any help would be appreciated.

** I think you might be thinking of a fic called The Life He Leads by author GeneralStarfox, I don't remember anything about Hermione in that story, but it hits all the other points you mentioned

**** Yeah, Harry calling down a lightning storm in order to defeat the dragon is the most badass version of the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament I've ever read.

*** I think you're correct, I almost confused it with "The lie I've lived" by JBern but thats the fic with the vulgar sorting hat.

(Can still recommend though, It's quite funny)
