Alright guys so I've been looking everywhere for this story I read once, but can't seem to find it anywhere and I don't remember the name of it. The plot is a romance between Fred Weasley and Rose Malfoy(Draco Malfoys twin sister). Rose sends a letter to a friend, who doesn't receive it due to the owl dropping it, but instead it ends up in the hands of Fred. He replies to it and a back and forth letter exchange starts between the two. Tho Rose doesn't know who she's talking to.
