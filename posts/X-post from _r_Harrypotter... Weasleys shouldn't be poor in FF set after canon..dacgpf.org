Alright so just hear me out. In the first book the Weasleys have Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny living with them. With Arthur at work at a pretty low-level ministry job and Molly a stay at home mom. Makes sense they'd struggle financially with 7 people and one income.

Starting from the second book, Ginny attends Hogwarts. Till now Molly had been busy as a stay at home mother and tutor to the children so didn't have time to work. But now, in theory, she had 10 or so months where she was entirely without charges with the exception of certain holiday periods.

Although she hadn't held a job in at least 20 or so years by this point, if at all, she could've started somewhere still. Despite perhaps lacking job-experience it is established that she is a very capable witch both in the books as by J.K. Rowling.

Let's assume that she can't since their financial situations doesn't seem to improve. Let's move on.

Percy graduates at the end of PoA and starts working at the ministry pretty much straight away. He's still living at home but judging by his character, he would probably at least pay for his own expenses rather than take advantage of his parents.

So now the Weasleys have 4 dependents for only 2 months a year.

Still no change. Fair enough, 4 kids is still a lot with 1 salary.

By the end of that year, Harry has won the triwizard tournament and donates his winnings to Fred and George to aid in the establishment of their shop. They start making some pocket change while at school but are unlikely to contribute to household expenses.

That year Percy estranges from his family and moves out. Arthur is attacked by Nagini and hospitalised and Fred and George leave Hogwarts to start their own business full-time.

So a pretty rough year for them and it can be assumed that their financial situation didn't have a chance to improve immediately because of Arthur being hospitalised and being unable to work.

However by the end of that year Arthur and Molly only have 2 dependents left (Ginny and Ron) since Percy moved out. Fred and George too are mentioned to have moved out and into their own flat above their jokeshop. Their jokeshop is already lucrative during the summer so they are able to provide for themselves. It's also mentioned that Arthur gets a promotion and has 10(!) people working underneath him.

Yet it is still mentioned quite frequently how poor the Weasleys are... even with only 2 kids living with them during the summer only and an increased income. Of course it could be argued that Hogwarts tuition is very expensive. But with it being the only Wizarding school in Britain and Albus Dumbledore being headmaster for decades, I doubt he'd allow tuition to be expensive.

So by all means at least by this time their financial situation should show some improvement... but it doesn't.

Then of course the 2nd wizarding war really kicks off and the Burrow burns down so it's hard to say what goes on with the Weasleys at that point. Still in Fanfics the Weasleys are always depicted as poor even when the story takes place after the end of the 2nd wizarding war.

Of course their house burnt down but realistically they only have 1 dependant left in Ginny (Ron canonically never returns to Hogwarts) and Arthur has received a promotion so should be able to provide modest housing for the three(four?) of them and for them to live modest lives without being as poor as they have been in the previous 7 books.


** They are still bad at handling money. Fred and George were gambling with their entire savings while Molly and Arthur blew most of their lottery winnings on a holiday.

  I know JKR and numbers don't always get on well with each other, but one thing that left me ever-so-slightly flabbergasted was the Weasleys' departure, together with Harry and Hermione, from the Burrow to King's Cross after the Quidditch World Cup. One-shot. Complete.

**** So it's better to have a nice month and go back to horrible second-hand robes afterwards? That does not sound like a sound investment. And there are almost always cheaper holiday options as well.

For example, I was looking at a possible trip to Ireland, but ended up booking Budapest because it only costs a fraction to get a place to stay there.

Edit: Just remembered, in Sorcerer's Stone the kids stayed at Hogwarts during Christmas break because Arthur and Molly went to go visit Charlie. Trips to visit family aren't new. Was it stated they blew the entire winning on the trip? Ron did get a replacement wand. We can probably assume any other vital issues were handled.

Limiting the stay to a shorter duration is. Or inviting Bill back to the UK as he is bound to have a few weeks off each year. So that would also work out way cheaper.

I know that they're able to buy Ron a new Gold watch and hosting a wedding. I suppose we can assume that they're not as poor as they were on the early year.

*** Honestly because the books are written from Harry's point of view, it's possible that Bill and Charlie did help out financially and that it was just something not talked about. But I could also see that Mr. & Mrs. Weasley might refuse help from their children - wanting them to save money for themselves and their future.

It's also possible that they took out loans during hard times and that they are never seen to get better off because they were paying it off (or saving all extra money instead of changing their lifestyle).

*** I don't think either Mr or Mrs Weasley would even for one moment consider accepting money from their kids. I always feel it was more people like Ron and Percy who were embarrassed by wearing worn-out clothes and using second-hand school supplies. While Arthur and Molly were more used to having modest kind of lifestyle.

The only reason it really stuck out for me was because I always felt so bad for them. And then when Fred and George started their own business I immediately felt relief that the financial burden on the Weasley's had finally lightened... only for it to never be changed or even be mentioned again... ever.

You have a proud, opinionated, overbearing mother and adolescent/adult sons in a culture that seems pretty heavy on traditional gender roles. Molly probably did not approve of them leaving the country with their wacky jobs, either.

Seems like a recipe for some simmering conflict, which would make is super difficult for them to accept alms.

And when Harry says that he wouldn't be able to pay for Hogwarts Hagrid doesn't answer with. "Hogwarts does not cost you anything" instead he says that Harry has a lot of money from his parents.

*** I think this might just be J.K. getting a little stuck in the roles she needed things to play. The Weasleys were always meant to be a poor but loving family that loved Harry unconditionally and adopted him as their own. Similarly I think J.K. always had plans of making Molly Weasley a dark horse of sorts. She liked the idea of having a powerful witch as a housewife. To show that being a housewife doesn't mean a woman doesn't have any skills or less potential and it doesn't have to be considered second rate compared to being a 'successful career woman'.

That though Molly was a powerful witch and an abundance of potential, she chose to be a full-time mother instead.

So as the plot continued and the circumstances changed for the Weasleys, they were still fulfilling their role as the 'underdogs' that they'd always been, and a good antithesis to the Malfoys and other deatheaters. Similarly with Molly Weasley she remained a warm, loving and innocent mom and primary mother-figure in Harry's life. She really wasn't supposed to have much other things going on.

The books are already pretty rich and detailed and this was either a conscious choice to 'declutter' the narrative of unnecessary and irrelevant information or just J.K. having an idea in her head and being oblivious to certain 'consequences' as she stuck to those pre-conceived ideas and setups.

It's just a minor thing that I noticed in quite an intricate and fleshed-out universe and narrative anyway. It's just that I was felt so bad for Mr and Mrs Weasley as well as Ron, since they seemed to struggle financially. So when Fred and George struck gold the first thing that I remember feeling is relief that the Weasleys would finally be able to move on from 20 or so years of being poor... Only for it to never be change or even be mentioned.
