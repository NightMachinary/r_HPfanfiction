** My favorite non-canon pairing, but there are very few of them:

AO3 has [[http://archiveofourown.org/collections/triofic/works][an archive]] of 96 Harry/Hermione/Ron fics. Unfortunately, they are either incomplete, one-shots, or just terrible fics.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is probably the best Trio fic out there, but it never dived explicitly into romantic aspects of their relationships, merely stating [[/spoiler][they slept together.]]

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771), is still WIP. It's the first fic I found that specifically paired Harry/Hermione/Ron together, is of novel length, and has a decent plot. However, It's also a crossover with Kantai fleet girls and requires a certain level of interest in WW2 naval history from readers.

*What it Comes Down to*, linkffn(6858689), is well written, but contains too much torture, angst, and is down right grim-dark. I only made it through a third before giving up.

*Ruthless*, linkffn(10493620), is high quality and has a great plot. However, Theo Nott replaced Ron and the story is relatively short.

*Just The Three of Them*, linkffn(6807742), is a cute canon rehash with a romantic Trio. One-shot only.

It's pretty damn dark, but I have to say that it is probably the only fanfic I have ever seen that dealt with the trauma of torture and rape appropriately. Usually when things are criticized as "angsty" it refers to typical teenage angst about things that aren't really that big of a deal and "oh my god stop whining about your love life".

But yeah, I can totally understand not wanting to finish it. Especially since the ending is such a huge cop-out (the author tries to re-connect to canon in the end after everything that happened).

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath. Warning: This fic depicts violence, rape, torture, suicide,etc. Both HET & SLASH. It is intended for a mature audience.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
