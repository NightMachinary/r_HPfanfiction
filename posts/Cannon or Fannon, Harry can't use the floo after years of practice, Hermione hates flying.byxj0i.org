I see this constantly in fics, but I remember in the last book, that they used the floo and Harry didn't get shot out and they flew and Hermione wasn't quite as terrified as everyone makes her in fics. Am I wrong?


** Hermione lacks confidence on a broom in Deathly Hallows and Harry's Floo usage is never really mentioned again.

*** We don't know whether she was hesitant, Ron never gave her a choice in the Room of Requirement (which might be the right decision):

  Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him.

** the thing is, many of the fics that you see out there were written pre-DH. I think it was post OotP that Harry Potter fanfics boomed, and thus it is those versions of the characters that have been fanonised. Plus, all subsequent fics rely on the establish fanon to further write their characters

** The flying thing is consistent with Hermione's character.

Flying lessons started out as a class, and Hermione is stated to always try for top spot in a class and (at least third year) taking all electives.

How do you do well in a class? Practice. Yet if Hermione was practicing flying, it would have seemed to be something that would have been commented on in the books.

So either:

1) it was just a first year class, that Hermione put her effort into until it ended. Later, she is aware that her skill level is way lower than her two quidditch playing friends. *This seems most compliant*

2a) it is a class and she still tries for top spot. It would be strange that it is never mentioned nor her practicing/homework.

2b) it is a class that she does not excell at. But that too would seem like something that would be commented on in the book, that there is s class Hermione is not on top in

3) it is a class she does not take. Except we knows she takes everything third year and again, strange that Hermione avoiding a particular class would never be brought up.

** Harry can't use floo after years of practice? So because he messed up his first time ever using floo powder, he's doomed to mess it up all the time for the rest of his days?

That's a stupid idea. I really hope this isn't common trope.
