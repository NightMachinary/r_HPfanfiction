Looking for a fic I read many years ago. The only thing I can remember from it is that it is like 7th year and Harry gets a haircut from Parvati, I think. The haircut kind of upsets Snape because it makes Harry look more like James and they are friendly in this story, if not mentor/father son-ish. Anybody remember anything like this or am I crazy?
