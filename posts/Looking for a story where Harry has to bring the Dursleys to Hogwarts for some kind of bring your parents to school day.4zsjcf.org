** I remember one where he ends up wanting to bring Lupin since he was the last thing close to a relative he had post Sirius, but that's only ballpark to your request. Lupin was kind of a dick in that one if I remember correctly.

*** I can't remember the name of this...but I do remember this story. It was very interesting. I think Harry became more and more desperate for him to show up as it went...if this is the same story.

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
