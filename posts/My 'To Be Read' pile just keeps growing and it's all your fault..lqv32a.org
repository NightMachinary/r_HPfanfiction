Every time I come on reddit someone recommends another really interesting story and I open it and the first page is good, and all the comments say its good and I get excited so i add it to the list!

And then I remember I'm only on chapter 32 of the Beurocratic Error and I have to finish that first. And my 'TBR' list is 22 stories long and ive another 6 tabs saved on my phone and its just growing and growing and growing...


** I started The Bureaucratic Error, but was not enjoying Harry's memories being repeatedly modified and stopped reading it.

You should probably avoid most of my favourites, though; they tend to be long. The "Innocent" and "Pureblood Pretense" series are well over a million words each, The Peace Not Promised is over 700k, even Nightmares of Futures Past, which is quite incomplete, is over 400k.

*** Yeah it took me a good couple of false starts but I'm actually getting into it now and enjoying it. I don't know where the story is going which is fun. I really like Lupin stories though.

I just finished reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]] which was a very dark wbwl story. Excellent but jesus, i needed something a little more mundane and easy going after that! Beaurocratic Error has been recced to me a hundred times so I figured I'd stick with it =).

Oh, my favourite is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of a Linear Circle]] in all its 1.8M word glory so I'm no stranger to the long fics which absolutely doesn't help since now most of my TBR's average at the 50 chapter mark...

*** Maybe you need more completed stories? Like linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequels. Book 1 is really good, book 2 diverges more into magical research and spellcrafting but is still okay if you find the worldbuilding interesting. Book 3 is basically a whole lot of snippets from the years and decades afterward, culminating in the Statute of Secrecy coming down and the existence of magic being published to the world.

Or linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), which is valuable for getting a different perspective on canon events and re-examining canon's assumptions. Was it really acceptable for Dumbledore to give out 170 points to Gryffindor /at the feast, with the Hall already decorated in Slytherin colours/, and thus embarrass the whole of Slytherin House, almost all of whom had nothing to do with Quirrell and had done nothing we know of to deserve it? And is it perhaps actually understandable that Professor Snape gained a mistaken impression of Harry, when Harry's quick temper so frequently led him to draw his wand in response to verbal insults, and thus Snape repeatedly walked in on situations where Harry had unnecessarily escalated a situation into violence? Not to mention Harry's act of either terrible betrayal or monumental stupidity, when he snuck a peek at the memories Snape had deliberately kept from him, /while knowing that Snape was a double agent and that Voldemort could potentially read Harry's mind to find out whatever those memories contained/.

And [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822-1/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is technically a prequel to another series, but can stand alone quite well. It retells the whole of canon, in an alternate universe with slightly futuristic technology instead of magic. The way it reinvents canon happenings in non-magical ways is quite interesting, such as Harry joining the firearms team rather than a Quidditch team, dormitories having palm readers instead of portraits, and Hermione being attacked by commandos in a bathroom.

If you're interested in series with multiple complete books, but where the series as a whole is incomplete, then linksiye(The Meaning of One) is quite well done (if the bot works). It starts off looking like it will be saccharine, but it really isn't; it takes a hard look at how Harry and Ginny's bond would really affect them and the people around them (especially the Weasleys), with complex characters who have both good and bad in them rather than being one-dimensional. The first two books are complete, but it doesn't look like there will be any more.

In a similar vein, book four of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) was recently finished, with book five coming within the next few months. The whole series is over 1.5 million words thus far, so it should keep you going for a while :). It's a really original plotline that draws elements from both HP and the Song of the Lioness, but doesn't just retell either one; it goes its own way.

** I feel your pain. I have 145 stories in my download file (I download them to read at my leisure versus reading them online). Over 70 of them are completely new (meaning I've never read an earlier version). I have 174 stories in my Partial Updateable folder (eg WIPs that have been updated within the last 2 to 2 1/2 years).

I have 511 stories in my Partial Abandoned folder. These are stories that have not been updated in over 2 1/2 years+.

What really slows me down is that when a story has been updated I have the tendency to start at chapter 1 rather than just reading the chapter before the new chapters. I also have no trouble rereading any completed story that I have downloaded previously. And I have a tendency to look for long stories eg 70K - 500K word stories (an average novel is considered roughly 40K words).

And like you if I see an interesting story recommendation I go out and download it. I do the same thing when I'm reading stories. If the author in his notes recommends a story then I will check it out and if it looks interesting I'll download it. If I like it I'll go back to that recommended author and download their other stories that look interesting. Hence the over 70 "new" stories in my download folder.

So buckle down and enjoy losing yourself in other writers' interpretations of Harry Potter's experiences. 😁

*To be read:* (/note, i haven't read these so I cannot say if they're good, these are just the ones tat piqued my interest)/

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14138082/chapters/32581830][*How to Track a Lion*]]: Sirius is in slytherin and trying to figure out Remus's secret. It looks short enough and the first chapter is interesting. I like wolfstar but im not a fan of fluff so we'll see how this goes. (recommended wolfstar that I have read- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]])

/-/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][*Basilisk Born*]]: Is a time travel to the founders era. I've read a couple of these. My favourite is from the Of A Linear Circle series but that is 11 books long so if you want a shorter Founders TT story then [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887/chapters/1173323][Strange visitors from another century]] was good.

-[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052][*A Black Comedy*]]: Harry goes back in time to find Sirius and events happen. The first few chapters were bizzare, there were extra limbs. I laughed! I want to finish it.

*What should be on your To Be Read pile!* /(These I have read and can highly recommend as excellent stories.)/

-[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410#workskin][T*he Second String*]]: Adventure story with Harry and pirates and dementors and family and squibs. A very very fun read.

*-*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5252627/chapters/12651236][*Break*]]*:* Remus and Sirius in the 12 in between years. Big look into what Azkaban felt like, the predjudices Remus faced. Implied wolfstar but theres no romance or fluff. It's just a really underrated story and I love it.

-[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801/chapters/30392982][*The Age of Lies*]]: Everything by this author is incredible. I downed their entire works in a day. This story is about Regulus who shows up at the Potters during the war. Sirius things Remus is the spy. Everyone is very tense. Remus is written wonderfully but everything by TheDivineComedian is brilliant!

***** Anything?

Have you tried Methods of Rationality to see whether you like it? Not everyone does, but as there is a fair bit of misinformation floating around, I do recommend deciding for yourself. If you do, then it's long, complex, funny, thought-provoking, and complete.

By "Severitus", do you actually mean, "Snape turns out to be Harry's biological father", which I believe was the original meaning of the term, or just Snape-as-mentor? They have quite an interesting dynamic in The Pureblood Pretense, where Riddle went into politics, so there was no war, and Harriett grew up with both her parents alive and developed a passion for Potions - but as a half-blood, she's legally barred from Hogwarts. And doesn't intend to let that keep her from the best Potions teacher around (well, okay, not best teaching skills, but the teacher with the best brewing skills), Professor Snape. Snape is still recognisably himself, but with not quite as much self-loathing as canon, since Lily is still alive and the Death Eaters haven't been a thing (he's just a member of a political party). Draco's character is even more altered, possibly because without any non-Purebloods around, he just doesn't have the same anger, and around people he considers to be his peers, he's friendly enough. Harry is very aware of the tension between him being a good friend to "Rigel Black", and the likelihood that he would turn on her if he knew who she really was.

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.
