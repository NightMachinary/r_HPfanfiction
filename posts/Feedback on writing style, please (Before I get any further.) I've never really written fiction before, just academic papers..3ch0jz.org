/The following is an incomplete first chapter from a book intended to be a canon-compatible account of the mysterious Sally-Anne Perks' experience at Hogwarts. So, mostly an OC (since all Rowling gives us is a name)./

Synopsis: Some people pass through life without leaving a mark...or do they? There were some who said that Sally-Anne Perks didn't deserve to be at Hogwarts. Others suggested more kindly that she would be happier in the non-magical world. Yet she stayed. This is her story.

Chapter 1: An Inauspicious Beginning

South London Press, 27 January 1980

An abandoned infant discovered in critical condition outside of a fire station on January 3rd has been released to state care following hospital treatment for exposure, deprivation, and congenital abnormalities.

The unnamed baby girl, likely born around November 1 of last year, had a piece of jewelry around her neck which authorities hope will assist in her identification. Anyone who has information to contribute to her case may contact Community and Children's Services at 020 7332 ####.

--------------

Halloween, 1990

Not-quite-11-year-old Sally-Anne Perks shivered in her thin coat as she stepped off the bus onto to the damp pavement. Switching her heavy book bag to her right shoulder, she began to plod along the sidewalk, a pronounced hitching motion in each step testifying to a birth defect that had been only partially correctable through surgery. She kept her eyes to the ground, disliking the glare of even the weak late afternoon sunlight. Despite the thick lenses she wore (a strong prescription which became stronger after every annual exam), Sally could see very little detail beyond a few feet, though her near vision (within six inches, anyway) had always been adequate for reading.

Today, like every other day this term, she would be the last child to return to Wool's Home for Parentless Children. This wasn't normally a problem, as dinner would not be served for another two and a half hours, but today was Halloween. Though residents at the Home were not permitted to attend Halloween parties or to go trick-or-treating, there were always care packages provided by the wealthy and faceless patrons who maintained Wool's as one of the only remaining orphanages in Britain. There would also be a not-too-scary movie projected in the meeting room tonight for the older children, but the care packages were what everyone looked forward to -- candy (the good stuff, chocolate mainly), a few cheap but effective magic tricks and prank items (last year she'd gotten a bottle of invisible ink and a disappearing 50 pence piece), and a terrific-looking mask. Now, she'd have to settle with whatever the others had left.

While she reminisced, the sun had gone behind a cloud and a few drops of cold rain had started to fall. She picked up the pace as much as possible, clutching her books to her chest to prevent them from getting damp. There was still a half-kilometre to go. If only the city bus route came nearer to her destination.

The lateness and the long walk were her fault, or at least her price to pay. By virtue of her excellent National Curriculum test scores at the end of Year 6, she had been offered the opportunity of attending Windermere Academy on scholarship. At the time, it had seemed like a dream come true -- attend a good school, away from the violence and apathy that lurked in the hallways of the public secondary school. Everyone, from her friends to her teachers to the adults at the Home, told her how lucky she was and that opportunities like this didn't come every day. And, to be honest, she had never seriously considered declining the invitation. Sally-Anne may have been a near-sighted child with a bad limp that even her own mother didn't want, but she was smart and craved an escape from a life of poverty and dependence. It might not be easy, but it could be done.

The hard part was people. The social drawbacks that she had expected manifested the first week of term and had not yet let up. Her fellow Year 7 students resented her presence among them, and from the very beginning she was reviled as an interloper by children whose parents spent hundreds of pounds per term for them to attend school there. Though clean, her faded uniform was obviously second-hand. Her books were on loan from the school library, not hers to highlight and annotate. She alone of all the students was given a free lunch in the cafeteria. The scholarship did not extend to extracurricular clubs and trips, so she found herself left to a teacher's supervision while the others went on outings to museums or sporting engagements. (There had been some talk among the members of the school board of Sally-Anne being permitted to accompany her class on their three-day trip to Paris in March; she hoped so, as she had only once in her life been outside of London, and then only to the countryside for an afternoon.) In the end, she was an unwanted outsider, and an outsider she remained. Good grades wouldn't fix the problem (if anything, her continued academic success only irritated her detractors further), but they would make that someday-escape possible. And so she spent every lonely free period and lunchtime studying.

Sally-Anne sighed. It wouldn't be so bad if only things were the same as they had always been at the Home. She had always had a comfortable niche there -- helping her classmates with their homework, teaching the little kids to read, grubbing out a little vegetable garden in the yard, helping the cooks in the kitchen...in general, being the “smart, reliable one” in a tumultuous environment. Now she allotted little time to non-school-related things (she had to attend to her grades) and while she would have still been willing to help those in her year with their work, she found that they now resented her for not being satisfied with the life they were stuck with. She was shunned in the common areas and ignored at mealtimes; her uniform was mocked and more than once it had been sabotaged in some small, spiteful way -- a wad of gum stuck deliberately on the hem of the skirt, a splash of grape juice “accidentally” spilled on her blouse during breakfast. More and more often these days, she stayed inside the room she shared with another girl, a slightly disabled girl in Year 5 who seldom said anything to her roommate or anybody else.

Having finally arrived, she was walking up the stone steps when she noticed an unfamiliar vehicle parked beside the janitor's battered van. She stared -- and who wouldn't? An older Renault 25, it was painted a vivid purple that certainly was not a factory colour. Glancing at the license plate to see if it was local, she felt a strange, twisting, dizzying sensation in her eyes. It was impossible to make out for certain the letters and numbers, though the plate was clean and the characters were not foreign. She looked away and looked back. It had gotten no better -- she couldn't make out a single letter or number, though she knew that they should have been perfectly familiar. Panic soaring in her stomach, Sally-Anne wondered wildly if she could be experiencing sudden-onset dyslexia...if such a thing existed, that is. Dropping her book bag with a thud on the top step, she grabbed for the nearest book, a battered school copy of A Tale of Two Cities. It was still “the best of times and the worst of times” with no intruding illiteracy. She looked once more at the plate, then looked away -- it made her feel ill. Shaking her head, and looking back at the lurid car once more, she went inside.

** Disclaimer: not a trained writer.

I like this style of writing and would like to see more of it in fanfic. Feels like a real novel to me, unlike a lot of fanfic that is very dialogue-heavy and light on inner monologue and description, leading to me having a hard time ever feeling particularly immersed in the characters or setting.

I'd certainly be intrigued and continue reading if I came across this story.

*** Thank you for your encouragement. Actually, I suspect that convincing dialogue may be a weakness in my story as I introduce more characters, but I'm glad the inner monologue part sounds okay.

** I think it's quite good. We haven't seen dialogue or action yet, but this sort of writing style and your ability to paint the environment are quite captivating. I would love to read more.\\
Also, having spent some time in the UK, the distance thing is a bit weird. Officially they use the metric system and young people use kms and miles interchangeably, but old people use miles almost exclusively and signs around the UK are in miles. It would be interesting what Sally-Anne would use.

****** No problem! It's words like that which trip non-British fanfic authors up all the time! It's because you ordinarily use a completely different word, so you don't expect a different word to be in use in Britain. Another one is that we usually refer to 'autumn' instead of 'fall'!
