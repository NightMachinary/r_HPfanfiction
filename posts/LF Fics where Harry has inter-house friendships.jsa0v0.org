It really frustrates me how insular the Houses are, both in canon and in many fanfics. I hated how Neville was treated in canon - he was derided, bullied, and ignored, with Harry passively complicit even though he'd been bullied before. Luna was also very obviously bullied, and Harry despite his "saving people thing" did absolutely nothing. There's also the rampant stereotyping of all four Houses and the demonization of a quarter of the school, so fics with at least a modicum of inclusivity are like a breath of fresh air.

Bonus points if Harry sits at another House's table, someone says "what are you doing here?", Harry says "eating" (extra bonus if done flatly/nonchalantly/innocently), the person, bewildered, responds with "but you're in Slytherin!", and Harry, with an air of shock and realization, turns to his friend and goes "wow, Hermione, did you know that I'm in Slytherin? I suppose that explains all the green and silver."

(Slytherin Harry not required, it's just that that seems to be where Harry ends up in a lot of those fics. Nor is a friendship with Hermione required)

So far I've found:

- linkao3(C'est La Vie) - Hufflepuff Harry who basically b*tch-slaps any and all prejudice he finds
- linkao3(Harry Potter and the Greatest Show) - Harry time travels back into his eleven-year-old body and befriends Draco, Neville, Hannah Abbott, and Mandy Brocklehurst (plus others)
- linkao3(Rose Petal Red) (it's an OC SI where the main character is Ginny's twin but she's in Slytherin and the Weasley family + Golden trio are noticeably more tolerant of Slytherins so I think it counts)
- linkao3(A New Kind of Normal) - Harry's friends with Pansy as well as Ron and Hermione, I think??
- linkao3(Sarcasm and Slytherin) - Slytherin Harry, friends with Neville, Hermione, and Justin Finch-Fletchley (among others)
- linkao3(Souls Touch) (well Harry's more of the "you seem important and therefore i will cultivate you as an ally" type than friend to Neville
- linkao3(i won't just survive (no you will see me thrive)) - one of the "James was actually in a coma" fics with an iconic "I thought you were in Slytherin," from James (incognito as the DADA prof), Harry's reply of "am I? I didn't know, hey Ron, did you know I was in Slytherin? Now the green and silver of my common room makes sense-" at which point Ron chokes on his food and, when James ('too startled to take points') says "this is the Gryffindor table," Harry 'peers up and down the table as if appearing to notice the occasional red and gold scarf for the first time,' and says "why... so it is. Huh," /and takes a bit of his toast like the stereotype-smashing badass that he is/
- linkao3(Got Balls?) - oneshot where Harry realizes how insular he's been, starts to see other people as actual people with nuance, and makes an effort to be more open-minded


** linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay) I don't remember if there's any scenes of Harry eating at another house's table, but Harry, despite being a Gryffindor, spends a lot of time in the Raveclaw common room and has friends in other houses.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** Linkffn(A New Better Life by Ulltima101) it's my own story and Harry is already friends with two puffs(though one will be graduating school at the end of first year)

When the next school year starts im planning on expanding his social circles greatly due to what happens year 2 within the cannon story along with Harry actually learning about House Potter and their "allies"

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.

*** Yes, but multiple times, him and Ron laugh and insult people like Neville:

*At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.*

*Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling.*

and

*“ What?” said Harry, completely distracted by this startling news.*

*“Yeah, I know!” said Ron, some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh. “He told me after Potions! Said she's always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff --- but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn't want to go with Neville ...
