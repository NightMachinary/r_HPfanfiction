Looking for some good a/a fics. I'm looking for stories with amazing fights/battles. They can be new magic or muggle style fighting. I don't care if it has a ship or not, I'm just not into slashes. Thanks ahead of time.


** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) It has my favourite battle scenes in all of fanfiction, possibly all of fiction.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.
