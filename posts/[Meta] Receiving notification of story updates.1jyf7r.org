To those who read "work in progress" stories, I'm curious where you go to receive notification of when a story updates. I'm not talking about story recommendations or archives, but rather clearinghouses for "[X]'s story [Y] updated--here's a link" sorts of messages.

Myself, I receive them from a few places:

- Direct email notification from fanfiction.net to my fanfiction gmail account
- Postings in the [[http://www.ladyimmortal.org/beyondtheveil/viewforum.php?f=1][Updated Fics]] thread on the [[http://www.ladyimmortal.org/beyondtheveil/index.php][Beyond the Veil]] site
- Mentions in passing on either the Spacebattles.com Creative Writing/Harry Potter discussion thread or on DLP.

Are there other update threads of note?

Also, I'm wondering whether a stickied thread in this subreddit of the Beyond the Veil sort might increase traffic. (Just a thought.)

*** Same.

Side note, for some reason I can only read stories on ff.net. Every other site seems to have unnecessary and distracting formatting, margins, backgrounds, etc. Unless the story is /amazing/, I generally give up on it unless it is on ff.net.

**** I am in complete agreement with you about the layout issue. The first thing I do when I find a fanfiction it see if it is also hosted on ff.net. I find the formatting comfortable.

**** Totally agree with the formatting. I had to write a script to scrape stories from harrypotterfanfiction.com just because of their awful styling. It was the only way I could read them on my phone.

**** I get email notifications from ff.net but I'm actually not liking their formatting much. I've been devoted to ArchiveOfOurOwn.org which is also email notification.

I'm on a mailing list with others and we all remind each other when a fav story updates so we can discuss it.

** One of the reasons I asked the last question is because I've probably found more new stories to read on the Beyond the Veil updates than from any other source. That site has a very tiny userbase though and I was wondering whether it might make sense to try a similar thing here with the subreddit.

It seems to me that it might be mutually beneficial--a one-stop clearinghouse of updates as well as an attractor of participants in the forum. Thoughts?

*** I think that sounds like a great idea.
