Looking for a Harry who thinks things through, a planner, good dueler, saving hero complex and a Ginny who is witty, sarcastic, confident and protective. Looking for the two to play off each other well. If Harry tried to dump Ginny in his 6th year she would have none of it and go with them on the Horcrux Hunt. (Not saying the last part has to be in the story but that's the type of Ginny I am looking for). Thanks!


** Well, a Harry with your desired characteristics would not break up with Ginny in the first place. It's also very questionable whether canon plots would still have happened. A good fic with a different Harry should generally have a different plot.

That being said, I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/Hail-Odysseus][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463), has a Harry/Ginny pair that resembles your criteria the most.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
