** Cheddartrek's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] is some very sad, emotive writing.

For some reason, Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] is all sorts of sad. I mean, I'm a guy with guy bits and sensibilities. Why the hell am I getting all choked up over a damned fictional owl's death in a story that starts out tongue-in-cheek and makes lame-ass Star Wars references? The same author wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], the last scene of which always gets me as well.

*** All three are excellent suggestions, though I found Hallows to be more dark and stark-raving mad than tragic and sad. Living with her guilt is not enough for her crimes.

** I had skipped over Cauterize several times already. I shouldn't have. Thanks for getting me to finally read it.

*** Thanks for the rec. I thought it was okay but it doesn't have enough detail and buildup to have the same impact as others.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5600794/1/Who-Needs-a-Hug][Who Needs a Hug?]] is short and canon compliant. The ending gets me every time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10517316/1/][Yesterday's Wishes]] is a Harry/Draco fic. Be warned: it is a tragedy, set around a funeral. Beautifully written, however.
