I remember it's humorous, maybe a crackfic. Might be a time-travel story. Most likely Harmonious but unsure.

Fairly sure that that line was the last line of a chapter.

Edit:

[[/u/ILikeToUnzip]] got it: it was linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff year two by BajaB)

#+begin_quote
  The last thing he heard, as he walked away, was a fifth year 'Puff shout, "We can TOO murder in cold blood!"
#+end_quote


** Could be Harry the hufflepuff year two when they suggest Harry is the heir but everyone laughs it off saying Puffs can't be evil. Sorry I don't know how to link on mobile

** Are you thinking of The Dark Lord's Equal linkffn(6763981)? Time travel, H/HR, some good humor moments and Hufflepuff is pretty non stereotypical. If I'm thinking of the right story this is the one where Hufflepuff wrote the book "why I like killing people and taking their things."

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

*** that sounds like it might be right. Any idea which chapter the quote is in? I can obviously check myself but I just had a call come in along with some emails I must reply to.
