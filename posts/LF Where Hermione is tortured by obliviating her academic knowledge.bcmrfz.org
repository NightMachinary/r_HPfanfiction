*** Now imagine him also putting cursed injuries on her brain to give her dyslexia and to strip her of some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy][higher order thinking skills]] (e.g. abstract thinking, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking][the number of simultaneous concepts the mind can keep in focus,]] etc). Then curses similar to the DAAD position curse that force negative feedback loops on her for anything learning-related and mild positive feedback loops for restraining herself from learning-related activities.

Hmm... are we there yet?

** Balls, there is some fic that used to exist but doesn't anymore on FFN where Hermione's academic knowledge was taken out and put into a pensieve by Theodore Nott.

So this is 1 and 2 in a series and in the second Hermione is cursed to lose her ability to read.
