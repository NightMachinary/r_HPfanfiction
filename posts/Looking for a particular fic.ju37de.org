:END:
A long time ago, I read a fanfiction where Draco and Hermione go to Beauxbaton on some kind of foreign exchange trip. While they're there, I think they have to share dorms because they're head boy/girl (or something of the sort) and there is some fluff. Students start to mysteriously die and Hermione, Draco, and some other students band together to try and figure out who the killer is.

I distinctly remember a scene where Hermione tries the Beauxbaton food and finally understands why Fleur said Hogwarts food is too "heavy".

The story was incomplete when I read it but maybe the author has finished since?
