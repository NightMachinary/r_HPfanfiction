** Alright, so first off you want to flair your post. Since here you're looking for a specific fic, you want the “What's that fic?” flair. Second. You probably want to slim down the title slightly, it's a bit bulky and hard to read, instead put most of the identifying information inside the post, with only the most important/memorable parts in the title.

*** I have also notice you haven't help me at all and only criticise my post. Thank you for that. If only more reddit users were like you,the world would be a better place. As for the more memorable parts,that's it. What is written up there is all I remember.
