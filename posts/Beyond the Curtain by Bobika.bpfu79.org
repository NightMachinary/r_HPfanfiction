Do you enjoy well written stories?

Do you like original engaging plots?

Does a well build world within an AU really tickle your fancy?

If you answered yes to any of these questions then you should definitely check out linkffn(Beyond the Curtain by Bobika)

Looking at the title you might think this is just another veil of death story... but that's where you're completely wrong.

It's not my story but I found it, binged it, and now I'm sharing it with all of you because it really lacks for exposure considering its quality .

*** The author's here.

Thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts here!

The story started as far away from canon as I'll ever go - we'll be only coming back to it: seeing some familiar places, faces and of course, more and more magic.

Hopefully, I'll manage to answer all your questions: but in their due time ;)

**** I really like the story too, adult wizards in different settings/worlds than cannon are one of my favorite fanfiction story types. And this is one of the rare well written ones!\\
Looking forward to the rest of this story and your future work.

Also thanks to OP for the rec.

** Wow, thanks a lot for putting in a good word for the story, truly appreciated!

I knew the title would bite me in the arse. It most probably discourages a lot of readers to open. But well, I've grown quite attached to it. So, once again: thanks for the exposure ;)

  "I'm going to make you immortal, Harry. The least you can do in exchange is to stay civil." - in which Voldemort learns the truth behind Harry's scar and the world changes greatly for it. AU from the Battle of Hogwarts. Powerful!Harry. Independent and on occasion mature, too.

** It's an interesting premise, but unfortunately I can't get past the "dead zones" where magic doesn't work.

*** It is a rather strange concept and I'm not surprised it could put some people off.

The zones aren't the focal point of the story though, and only a fragment of the timeline will take place in them.

They provide a balance: they serve as a stark contrast to the very magical chapters up ahead, and they are the price to pay for the feasts of magic that are in play in this AU world (e.i. the Curtain).

I like to put our beloved characters in challenging situations. A place where they can't use their wands is one of them.

But ultimately, to each their own ;)

(this is the author speaking, btw)
