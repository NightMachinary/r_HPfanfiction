They eventually end up in Ancient Greece, with no way back home. But do they dont despair? No, they are foolhardy Gryffindors coming from a time both magicaly and scientificaly superior. As a result two friends end up exploiting the s#ht out of Ancient mediterrenian.

They intefere with Trojan war, changing the outcome, and causing Hermiones name to be mentioned in the legends.

They help Hercules in his quest for immortality, inventing The idea of horcruxes and making themselves immortal in the process.

They cause the bronze age collapse with their scams and exploits.

Over the centuries, they invent many identities, including Heckate goddes of magic, Hermes god of mischief, Hades god of underworld, Heracles also known as Hercules, Herpo the foul, the first dark lord amongst many more.

They continue to mess with time after ancient greece, Slowly making their way to British Islands. By the time they reach england, they are known as Merlin and Morgana. After causing a civil war in Albion, they flee to France, eventually assuming the identities known as Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel.

I actually outlined a "Harry and Hermione inserted into GoT at the end of Robert's rebellion" fic with uplift as the goal, even if I took them from the hunt rather than out of 3rd year. And even with magic, an uplift would not really be feasible, even with magic and Hermione's bag as Wikipedia substitute. And I was assuming that transfiguration could be exploited to hell and back. It is simply not doable. The pair can whip up a WWI destroyer or the like in a few days, or enough weapons to arm a regiment, but they do not have the ability to create a sustainable industry.

Let's say that you want to magic trains into existence. You need trains, which means that you need steel. So steelworks/ironworks, which require smaller steelworks for the machinery, which need raw iron. Raw iron means mines, mines need steam engines to pump water out and move stuff. To build steam engines, well, the circle begins anew. Then you need places which build machine tools and so on. Coal and coke, which means special bricks for the furnaces...

During the industrial revolution, that process was supplied by a mixture of small companies which specialised in making one of these, often by craftsmen who were already making things by hand and automated their work. Only slowly, the giants of industry came to be. Coke and its supply chain came to be ~200 years before trains were a thing, and almost a century before proper metal factories IIRC.

You can uplift a country in a lifetime, Japan being the prime example. There were people born during the Samurai age who witnessed nuclear weapons. However, Japan could buy stuff from the West. And while magic can substitute a lot of things, it cannot mirror every industrial and military mission, every large company like Yarrow or Krupp. Additionally, Japan had a pretty stable political landscape all things considered, unlike a smattering of cities loosely connected by religion and language with frequent invasions in the general neighbourhood.

I concluded that it would be infeasible to do that properly with a late medieval/renaissance tech base. You are suggesting to start with the bronze age. And while immortality could eventually overcome the issue, that would lead to the reader being pretty detached from every other character because they kept dying while Harry or Hermione invented stuff 24/7 for a few centuries.

*** You make some very good points. I wasnt thinking about our characters uplifting technology of ancient near east when i wrote this prompt though. I was thinking our characters building new lives for themselves while lost in time and influencing the greek mythology of today(i was thinking on them becoming something like the doctor from doctor who, or sirius and harry from a fanfic i read long ago and couldnt remember the name of.)

There is someone named Hermione in the legend of troy after all, and many myhological characters and gods have names starting with the letter H, so i rolled on from there.

Also bronze age near east was technologically closer to renaissance levels of technology than medieval europe. They did invent a steam engine and a mechanical calculator that calculated astronomical events after all( if you dont believe me google it :)). There was also merchant guilds similar to proto corporations if i am not mistaken(i can be it is late at night and i need sleep.)not just in greece, but also in Mesopotamia. Furthermore, population of the world was much smaller back then (less than 300 million) and thus needed less resources.

I want some of what you are smoking there. The renaissance was after all the result of gradual progress from medieval times. Medieval Europe had steel and cannons, the bronze age as the name said had bronze.

The steam engine was actually not an engine as it did not power anything, it was a fancy trinket and building a working one would require metallurgical advances from early-modern times (mainly quality steel).

And a small population is not to your advantage. In order to sustain heavy industry, you need demand for their goods. Britain became an economic powerhouse because they had access to half of the world, could draw resources from their empire, which created demand by its very existence (you needed ships to bring the goods, a navy to protect them, trains to move goods and so on).

And Medieval times had merchant guilds as well, even entire merchant nations (eg Venice, Genoa) and a merchant proto EEG (the Hansa).

***** I think the issue here is that you're both confused as to when, exactly, the bronze age was in relation to Ancient Greece. Or at least one of you is. Yes, the Trojan War occurred during the bronze age, and no, they didn't have steel. But the bronze age ended about 1200 BCE, while the civilization we think of as ancient Greece lasted until they were conquered by the Romans over a thousand years later (146 BCE). In fact, Ancient Greece is generally considered to have begun around or just after the Trojan War. The Classical and Hellenistic periods, which are generally what one is picturing when they think of Ancient greece were at the very end of that time frame. And they (and other ancient cultures, cough cough rome) did have fairly advanced technology (though I won't speak to the steam engine thing, I'm an art historian, I don't follow engine developments) relative to the medieval period. But by the time the greeks had that kind of stuff, it was no longer the bronze age by any stretch of the imagination.

I would also like to point out that this is a closed loop time travel prompt where history as we know it remains exactly the same but has been secretly influenced by Harry and Hermione's presence. It's a "magic people from the future game the system" concept, so the existence of heavy industry is moot. They're not changing what tech is available, they're just pretending to be mythological figures and gods. Although your point about guilds existing during medieval times is spot on.

****** I know about the historical periods, I passed ancient history just a few months ago. That's why the whole trojan war thing confused me somewhat since the title mentions ancient Greece, generally starting around 800-600 BC, depending on your exact definition.

Closed loop makes even less sense. I've read my share of uplifts, and generally speaking, there's a bunch of technologies basically anyone can realistically whip up in a few days. Stuff like hot air balloons, germ theory or optical telegraphy (with signal lamps akin to those used on ships which use Morse code). And let's just say that if someone introduced Morse code in 500 BC, it would not be named that. Same with medicine. Greek and Roman texts would mention it. And even printing presses are not that difficult, something Hermione would definitely prioritise.

If you have a pair of immortal time travellers, they will have steam power by the year 0. Working steam power. If they join in with Greece, well Macedon would probably not rise to power, so no Alexander the Great and no Hellenism. Probably no Roman Empire, or one more akin to west rome rather than conquests in the east. Hermione has been in London after all, she has seen HMS Belfast so she can whip up some cannons with transfiguration (wood to steel is the first thing they learn), which would end any Roman conquests which enslaved a good chunk of Greece (aka her people if she's a traveller). And if not Greece, then Gaul or wherever else she happens to be. Do you think the Romans could land if the Dover battery was operational, even a cheap knockoff made from 4" guns like the secondary battery aboard a town class cruiser (small enough to use a regular log as match substitute and to be moved by foot/horse if need be)?

******* The point is that this isn't an uplift though. It's not about making the technology of the time better. And I'm not so sure about the whole "will definitely have a steam engine by year whenever". Keep in mind that Harry and Hermione are thirteen and fourteen here, and haven't been involved in muggle schooling since they were 10. Even being a genius, I don't think it's unreasonable for Hermione's grasp on how modern tech works to be too theoretical/child friendly to be entirely actionable. Why would she have studied it when she could be studying magic? Add to that her assertion that "bad things happen to wizards who meddle with time" and I could definitely see them not making any sweeping changes to history.

Even if you nerf Harry Potter magic by 95%, that's still enough magic for a belt-fed machine gun with obisdian-tipped incendiary ammunition or ten. And in the political arena, either you use the imperius curse or any HP character is useless on their own. My attempt with the uplift was "fuck the balance, time for a good stomp."

*********** Hence why I said fused mechanics and a better understanding of a World of Ice and Fire is required. I think you don't understand what a fused fic is exactly. It's not your everyday crossover where you just dump characters from one reality to the other.

Besides, whose to say the spells made in one world will work in the other? For example, with potions in the HP world it's known that more complex potions may require keeping track of celestial bodies. It's not known what exactly goes into spell craft beyond arthimancy and incantations, but perhaps being under a foreign sky and stars might effect the numerology fuel that goes into them. In A World of Ice and Fire something magical is causing the imbalance in seasons. That could also very well effect Wizarding magic like it is every other type of sorcery on that planet.

As for Harry helping people... he could try, but I doubt they'd listen to him. Septon Barth had similar concepts and almost nothing remains of his work. They got put to the torch by Baelor the Blessed. There'd be a point where Harry would have to accept that he can't save everyone, and there's a reason Wizards hid from muggles.

If the magic is no longer "wave a wand and stuff happens", it is not HP anymore. Some spells working wonky, fine. But if, coincidentally, anything which would be useful for Harry is no longer an option due to some contrived reason (eg different stars), that feels like an asspull to create conflict where they should be none. Kinda like the "I can explain" trope, where a 2-hour drama is caused by someone randomly storming off after getting the wrong idea about something. And that is cheap, bad writing.

But that would make Harry grossly OOC. Harry accepting that the Unsullied have to die because they have been brainwashed into infant-slaying murder machines is one thing. But we are talking about the guy who saved Malfoy after everything he did in HBP. Who ran straight into the DoM, despite the obvious trap, to save Sirius. That guy would never leave the people to die. Nor could anyone catch a competent wizard, which Harry undoubtedly is. Even the medieval witch hunts were pointless in canon.

That's why I consider at least a partial uplift inevitable. Maybe not trains connecting every big city, but at least some basics.

************* It isn't an asspull. We're talking about Planetos, the World of Ice and Fire. A world that's so magically damaged to the point seasons are imbalanced because of celestial magical phenomenon. A world that has experienced several magical apocalypses(the Fall of the Great Empire of the Dawn and Asshai, the scourge of Ghiscar and Sanore, the Doom of Valyria, and the Long Night extc.) to the point magic has died out in several places. It stands to reason that any spells designed to work on Earth won't work properly on Planetos. Might even backfire in extreme ways. Spells would have to be reworked from the ground up. Hell, they could take longer to cast.

As for bad writing... bad writing is a soulless piece of work where there is no conflict, tension, or journey.

An uplift would not work. The moment Harry leaves or dies the society would collapse because it's heavily relying on one person. Harry also isn't knowledgeable in the different fields necessary to keep a society running or uplift it. Daenerys's entire arc is exactly that. Even with her dragons keeping the peace everything still fell apart for her in Meereen. That's why she decides she'll head to Westoros in the books.

Also, it's quite clear to me you don't know enough about ASOIAF. Else you would understand that, when I mentioned Septon Barth and his works, I meant that Harry could share all the knowledge in the world, but people would not follow just because he saids so. I also wasn't referencing witch hunts. It just isn't feasible for Wizards to help everyone. That may have played a factor in why they hid among other things.

The very first transfiguration, wood to (stainless) steel, alone would guarantee that.

And I am aware that it would not be sustainable, hence me dropping the idea. Hermione might have a better shot if you use her handbag to include a complete encyclopedia Britannica or some other relevant works, but even then it will not be as fast as "a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court".

I don't think Harry would go with some obvert display of magic seeing as it's a medieval setting. Any witch or wizard worth their salt would know to exercise caution should they find themselves in said setting. Additionally, I doubt Harry knows how to make a microscope or a steam engine. He's a Wizard not a scientist or engineer.

If you're aware, then why are we even arguing about this? You don't need a tech uplift to make a HP crossover work. I think a witch or wizard, should they find themselves in the World of Ice and Fire, would concentrate more on solving the higher mysteries of said world should they ever get a handle of making their magic functional again. And for as much as Hermione is a better option for tech uplift, though equally as dubious since her specialty is of a magical pursuit, we'd be back at square one. Just because someone saids so and proves so doesn't mean people will listen, follow, or believe it.

Additionally, the first book (GoT) came out in 1996. Hermione could have read it if you take them from the hunt as I intended.

And the obvious solution is to go north, where there is no organised religion (the old gods have no clergy) and women can earn the respect of their peers. No one really bats an eye on warrior women from the Mormonts, hell no one cares that they have bastards carrying the name and using bestiality as an excuse.

Those aren't particularly interesting tbh. Especially if you have magic. Fire takes care of the undead and from what little we see of the white walkers, they fight meele. So bring a gun to a knife fight, or a crossbow to be more period accurate. Obsidian tipped bolts make quick work of the Others, especially if you'd take the show version. As for the books, trying to guess an ending or their capabilities is difficult with what we have after 5 books. I'd rate the Long Night more dangerous than the walkers. But farming and starving in the dark isn't particularly interesting.

There's a reason why a lot of fans would prefer if there were no supernatural events at all and simply good ol' backstabbing politics. That's the prevalent opinion on other sites at least.

***************** Hermione is educated in magic. She's a witch. She'd be limited by that alone. She's book smart, but that doesn't necessarily translate to being good at the practical. That's a big facet of her character. The practical doesn't come as naturally as it would others. Though I'd imagine that compared to everyone else, she'd be the quickest to get her magic functioning.

Actually, she'd have to go South to Dorne. The North is highly patriarchal. Mormonts are an exception, not the rule. Otherwise Arya would have been allowed to pick up the sword as soon as she was able without resorting to secrecy, Lyanna Stark would have been free to pursue martial interests as well, and Alys Karstark would have been able to inherit peacefully without being ousted from her home and forced to marry the leader of the Thenns. If she hadn't married the Thenn, her uncle would've forced her into a marriage with her cousin as his right as guardian and regent, and she would've lost the inheritance to her uncle's son because he too was of Karstark blood. The only reason Lady Maege is in charge of Bear Island is because Jeor took the black after Jorah fled in exile for selling poachers into slavery. Contrast all of this to Dorne; where the Sand Snakes are allowed to openly wield weapons, absolute primogeniture (inheritance is determined by birth order and gender is irrelevant) is practiced, female rule is respected and being usurped is unlikely with or without marriage, and bastards are treated better; and Dorne appears like a more egalitarian choice in comparison.

You do realize that there are other mysteries out there in the World of Ice and Fire, right? The ruins of Sothoros, Stygai, Sonore, Valyria, Rhoyne, and the Leng underground. There's Asshai, K'Dath, Carcosa, and the City of the Winged Men to visit and plenty more to see. As for the Others, fire may work on Wights, and obsidian may work on White Walkers, but for all we know, the White Walkers could absorb any magic thrown at them. That could increase their strength, and Hermione isn't a melee fighter. The White Walkers could just keep throwing bodies at her till she tires and keep doing so as she's forced to give ground. They're also able to control weather as a range tactic, so it's not a stretch to say they could freeze ranged fighters from afar. The show did a great disservice to the Others.

But if you look at how things like armour plates or boilers are made, there are giant steelworks which turn "raw" steel into the necessary parts, a step which requires giant factories like the Krupp complex in Essen. As for why I'm using Krupp as an example, they developed the Krupp process, which was a leap forwards when it came to hardened steel by mixing other elements into the steel alloy, another step completely missing from Factorio.

***** You're missing the point. The limiting factor of human advancement isn't the production of things. It's the generation of ideas. We took hundreds of years for the industrial revolution not because of how long it took to build those things, but because someone had to figure out each of the inputs.

I brought up Factorio because it demonstrates the rapid nature of capital accumulation. In your previous post, you claimed that Japan was uplifted in a lifetime because they could import goods from the West. However, as demonstrated by [[https://i.imgur.com/OHOCfQc.png][this graph]], an economy growing under a neoclassical growth model (s=0.1, d=0.1, Y=100K^{0.3}) can go from a dirt poor country with no capital (k0 = 0.001) to a rich country (k =718.86) in less than a century.

To demonstrate what time travelers could do, I [[https://imgur.com/6h7xBz4][simulated]] a the same economy on a balanced growth path. At year 100, our time travelers show up and spend a century injecting ideas into the economy. As you can see, the time travelers do quite a lot.

****** Wealth is meaningless when you lack the resources to invest it in or qualified workforce to do something. And you won't be able to accumulate capital, you'll have to be spending it as soon as it is available to invest in projects, most of which will not be financially profitable (eg water supply, schools and so on).

Workforce is not an issue in Rome generally speaking, especially since the Military has a tradition of public works. Slavery is also a thing. Qualified workers on the other hand... In theory, casting any metal is pretty much the same process. You heat it up, it melts, you pour it somewhere. Yet cast bronze was a thing 2000 years before steel casting was feasible. Simply knowing that it is possible will only get you so far, you need people familiar with the process who then can teach other people. And the Roman Empire is in a much better position than Greece.

And scale is another issue. In the 1950s, the West German railway needed some ~50000 tons of steel (and 100000t of coal to produce that) *just for maintenance* of their rail network. West Germany is also significantly smaller than any ancient empire. You could probably build a local railway between Athenes and Piraeus with the local steel industry, or a bridge. But if you want to expand more than that, you will run into the limits of your capacities very quickly.

Steel casting took so long to figure out because someone had to figure out how to create a fire hot enough do the "heat it up" part. Human instructors are nice, but people routinely figure out methods solely from cryptic publications. Give Roman metal casters the basic ideas of how to accomplish this task, maybe via magically translated textbooks, and they will have steel casting down within a few years.

Have you ever taken intermediate macroeconomics? I don't think you really understand my model or the neoclassical growth model is based on. The capacity of an economy is a function of its technology level.

In my model, the time travelers only inject ideas into the economy via dumps of books. Imagine what would happen if we suddenly discovered an alien library full of advance knowledge.

******** I get your general idea as for how to advance. And for some fields like medicine, it would undoubtedly work and allow rapid advances, especially when you apply the Greek or Roman genius to the matter.

But for others, well let's say that you want to introduce the Krupp process. On paper, it does not sound so difficult. Take nickel-steel, add 1-2% chromium and then carburize that with carbon gas before heating and quenching the cemented side. But where would Greeks or Romans get Acetylene from? Chromium in sufficient purity and quantity (the process was only discovered in 1797 and is unlikely to be in any book Harry or Hermione might have at hand)? The same goes for Nickel. And while the process itself might not be widespread outside of armour production, it makes for a good example for the difficulties of adapting technology.

** I've read a fic like this (for a different fandom though) where the mc becomes known as Sisyphus among many other things. He goes on to play many of the famous roles of history, while only slightly changing the present so it remains intact.

I actually had a lot of fun reading that fic. Although his exploits in the past had been largely skimmed over, and even left vague due to the mysterious nature of his character in the fic, it was still very interesting. Especially when they got back to the present and we got to see mc interacting with the main cast with his new found experience and thousands of years under his belt.

I hope theres a fic out there for HP.
