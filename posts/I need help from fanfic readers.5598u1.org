So, I am new to fanfictions and have read only a couple of them and rank them: 1. Isolation (by far) 2. Turncoat 3. Broken 4. A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy 5. Roomates The rest are really short and were nothing special so I won't be looking their names up.

You might have spotted a patern in the stories I read (Dramione) and that is because Draco is my fav character. I plan on reading: Rebuilding Crimson with a silver lining The Fool the Emperor the...(I forgot) We learned the sea.

I am writing this because of two things. 1. Do you have any suggestions for me to add to my To Read list? 2. I am looking for a fanfic that will fit this: Hogwarts story At least 200k words (a lot more is good) Bonus points for having Draco in it (doesn't have to) Does not feature homosexual relationships (nothing against it, just not my thing)

That would be it, I really hope this post won't go unnoticed.

P.S. Which of mu To Read stories should I read first?


** linkao3(742072) This fic is a monster, and Draco is a pretty important character in it.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

****** There's actually still a yahoo group where the author comes on like once every six months and promises everyone she's still alive and still wants to finish the fic someday before she dies. I think part of the problem is her beta became a co-author with her at some point and then had to quit.

** If you don't mind disregarding every book after GoF, try The Psychic Serpent trilogy. Draco plays a reasonable part in fic #1 and a more central one in fic #2 - which is the best of the series, in my opinion.

** As far as keeping with the Dramione theme, I enjoyed An [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=582][Aversion to Change]] (need an account to read the story), as well as *Aurelian*, *Silencio* and [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]]. Everyone and their mother loves [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] but it was much too angsty for me to remotely enjoy, however you might like it.
