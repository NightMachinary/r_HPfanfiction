Looking for a Harry centric fic - HP was raised in china (asia) and know he is the boy-who-lived but he doesnt care. He is fifteen or so. He have father and one or more brothers. He is some kind of assasin that works for money. Dumbledore finds him and decides that its time Harry goes back home. He pretends(maybe not) he have work for Harry to lure him into hogwarts. Harry starts sleeping with almost every girl in hogwarts and practising some kind of sex guide, it have more than 20 steps, and he started with tonks. I also remember one particular scene with harry working out and jumping in standup just with two fingers, and hermione watching him and i believe she also wants to sleep with him. Harry thinks millicent bulstrode is beautiful, his father and brother agree, and hermione is jealous. Harry is also kind of humorous and flegmatic. He doesnt fear of voldemort. I dont know if it was on ffn or ao3, but i really need to find this fanfic. Sorry for grammar


** That would be /Harry Potter and the Sun Source/.

  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with
