I don't really want to read conversations between or the thought process of actual 11 year olds, so making characters act older doesn't really bother me personally. But I see a lot of people complain about it.

I do find them engaging in political subterfuge and wordplay at a level you would only expect from the best masters of statecraft to be immersion breaking, so I'm not a fan of that. But just having them talk like young adults instead of children is something I prefer.


** I don't necessarily mind it, /or/ the political stories. Given that these are not muggle children so I can headcanon their abilities as being derived from a charm or potion, an interpretation of accidental magic, or simply putting all of their points to that one 'stat'. Result = kids who are great at, say, politicking, etiquette and strategy, but absolutely hopeless at some kind of other basic task that we just never see bc its not story-relevant.

Especially given that even in muggles, child prodigies who've minmaxed their skills in one area at the detriment of another /do/ exist, just from having had their education keenly focused down one particular path from very young childhood. In a world where human modification is magically possible, why would you /not/ make every child a prodigy, if only to be able to fit in with the others? But that's getting into my headcanon of pureblood society as necessarily transhumanist, viewing muggles and muggleborns as people unhealthily and limitingly attached to default human limitations.

**** That is a very interesting point of view. It could also be tied into the 'hereditary family magics' fanon. Bloodlines would become better and better at certain things, far exceeding muggleborn or diluted halfbloods practicing the same thing. You want some fiendishly-difficult-to-produce Felix Felicis? You can either call up a muggleborn master potioneer, who'll take two or three attempts to make a perfect batch or you can call up scion X of the Y family, who can churn one out in an afternoon while hungover.

Difficult points with this theory are the existence of monstrously powerful halfblood wizards, such as Dumbledore and Voldemort who outclass everyone else at a wide variety of subjects. An explanation for this could be old bloodlines mixing with 'new' muggleborn magic, or simply the fact that they are a rare breed of hyper-competent generalists who can practice a wide variety of magic up to a high level (but still falling short of very old bloodlines in their speciality).

***** Sure. I just have always wondered if purebloods, not /had a point/ per se, but if they did just have a very different culture that none of our protagonists picked up on - Harry because he wouldn't think of it, Hermione because if society is pureblood-dominated as it seems to be, it might not be in any of the school books if its an established social norm, just like bathing or eating with a knife and fork might be in a muggle book, and Ron - or possibly all the Weasleys - because they'd assume Muggles had a similar version.

Compare that it takes them seven books/years to realise the wizarding fairy tales Ron grew up with aren't universal.

In this reading, Harry and Hermione's assumption that judging people based on blood is simple prejudice rather than a cultural conflict becomes flawed and adds depth to the conflict, while still being fairly canon compatible and not excusing the villains' actions when they cross over into violence and sadism.

It would be interesting to read postwar fics of Harry and Hermione only coming to realise these things and gain a greater appreciation of the politics behind the conflict in peacetime.

******* Just the fact that there doesn't seem to be much to any crossover influence from muggle to wizarding culture, even among the wizarding family we see most of, who are outright muggle 'lovers'. Muggles are kind of looked down upon and infantilized, either in a mean way or endearingly, depending on the individual in question's politics. Muggle studies is seen as a joke topic. Etc.

Even if wizarding society as a whole wasn't pureblood dominated there definitely is a core of pureblood-exclusive subculture that provides most of our villain characters and no small number of our heroes either - the Lovegoods and Weasleys are pretty ignorant of muggle things even if they're not also intolerant to their presence.

*********** I agree. I'm pretty peeved when people get the time period wrong.

The statute came out the time of King William 3rd after the monarchy was deposed by Cromwell and people invited king William back as a Monarch. I still think that over throwing the Stuart Monarchy is he cause of the splitting. Cromwell's victories at home and abroad helped to enlarge and sustain a Puritan attitude of mind, both in Great Britain and in North America.

Assuming that what ever oaths magical had to their reigning monarchy was broken when the successions was broken, the Magical now had a right to Barter a Treaty with King William who at the time is busy with multiple wars but eventually won the "glorious revolution" a war won "without bloodshed" two years after, Statue of Secrecy was in operation. So I think he two years was preparation for the separation.

King William was succeeded by Queen Anne who was the last of the Stuarts who decided to unite the crown of Scotland and England which became great Britain.

Queen Victoria is from the line of Sophia of Hanover. Victorian Era came after 61 years after King George lost America. America is Older.

WIZARDS DIDN'T SPLIT OFF FROM VICTORIAN ERA. VICTORIAN ERA is fucking INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. You'd think Wizards will know more about machines if that were the case.

To put things to a perspective..

Queen Elizabeth never married during her lifetime. However, there was "ample" evidence suggesting that Lucius Malfoy the first sought her hand in marriage, but was rebuffed by her. She's the Last of the Tudor Dynasty followed by House of Stuarts. Her Father was the one who Ordered the Beheading of Nearly headless Nick for the backfired curse for a Lady in his court. Not for being a wizard, it was for his failure. Which is believable since king Henry beheaded his wife for failing to give him a son.

********** 1) Gas lamp and no electricity : I won't say electricity doesn't work around Magic (because canon only say that for Hogwarts that may be a special case), but you seem to forget this is a Magic world. They use Gas lamp because magic deal with most of the problems who forced us (and Muggles) to inovate. If you have a gas lamp that still work after 200 years, that is magically refiled and you can easily clean the house, why bother to change it? Some parts of Hogwarts (as the Great Hall) still use candles, but if it works, why change it?

2) Victorian Architecture : Where did you get that? From what we say, wizards just do what they want when it comes to their house. The Black House and Malfoy Manor may seem Victorian, but I'm pretty sure neither the Rook or the Burrow are of this style. Neither are Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade.

3) Robes and riding boots : well, this is their fashion. Are you saying that because they don't wear pants, they are stuck in the past? Because if this is the case, some countries from Middle East and Asia may want to have a word with you. Also, magic, it's easier to sell leather boots when you can duplicate the leather of one beast hundred of times.

4) Kicked of family because of blood purity : Are you talking about Andromeda ? Because the Black family is probably not the best example to judge the mentality of a whole community. That's like taking a KKK family to judge all the US.

​

​

As for racial slurs, who use them? The rare times slurs like this are mentioned, they are either used during a private conversation (like Draco and Blaise in the Hogwarts Express), or in situation without any teachers (on the Quidditch pitch). From what I remember, the only time Draco truly use it in public, teacher arrive just after and are a little more preocupied by the seemingly dead cat and angry Rusard. Also, according to Rowling (and on Pottermore), most of the teacher of Hogwarts seem to be Half Blood.

*** I don't like this simply because it's not canon, even if it can be hand-waved by saying "magic hurr durr". In canon the eleven-year-old still act like eleven-year-old, and it seems logical because magic doesn't seem to remove humanity in canon (excepts for extremely fucked-up dark wizards like Voldy), so I'm not convinced by your story of engineered 11yo trained in politics with RPG stats, especially when some of them are muggle raised and thus have zero excuses not to be just childs (Harry for exemple).

To be fair, if a character don't act like he would in canon without a compelling reason to do so, like a change in their backstory for exemple, I'm probably going to quit, children or not.

***** First off, you may actually be entirely correct in saying that authors did not read the books. I've seen several times now, authors saying they never read/finished book xxx (many years after publication) because they didn't like it. /Shrugs/ Others who have finished the series probably haven't read the books in 10 or so years.

Anyways, ignore the rest of this post. I was going somewhere with it and went off on a tangent.

In many of the fics I read, 90% of the characters are OOC, and I don't particularly care. I just consider them to be OCs and read along. I still prefer for them to take a canon name though, because it tells me their background.

Eg. there's an OC named Hermione? Probably a muggleborn, and smart.

Or. An OC named Harry Potter? He (or she) likely has an invisibility cloak that will be passed down.

TL;DR I don't care about the characterizations, but rather use canon names as guides to their family backgrounds. This makes me very open to weird interpretations of characters, since I read everyone as OCs. Ron Weasley to me is just a guy with siblings, little money, and overbearing mother. He could be the sneakiest guy or an absolute idiot and I won't care either way.

****** That's an interesting point, and -- to a degree -- I think I'd have to agree. On the flip side, many characters are supercharged with tropes and stereotypes, many of which have little to no grounding in canon. Now, I'm no canon fanatic. I like Rowling's world, but I couldn't care less about some obscure essay or twitter post of her about XYZ. But it annoys me that characters that are, effectively, tabula rasas have so many weird tropes associated with them. Luna isn't omniscient or a genius. Daphne isn't some cold-blooded princess. And, yes, Ron isn't a coward. In a way, I think he's the most innocent of Rowling's main cast. Is he perfect? No. That doesn't make him an arse.

Anyway, long story short, most characters are OC by definition as soon as you start writing fanfiction.

******* His problem is that he is disliked/ hated by several groups of fan for differents reasons :

- "Harmony" fan hate him because he dare to be with Hermione and not Harry (a ship I never really understood considering Ron and Hermione start to show feeling for each other during year 4 while Harry and Hermione never showed anything other friendship/ almost brotherhood. Hell even during year 6 when Harry is convinced they will finally be together, he is only afraid to become the 3rd wheel.
- Movie fan : Realisators loved Hermione and made her a Mary Sue, taking elements from others character to do so, including Ron "Pureblood Knowledge".
- Also (for films), Tom Felton. They want a whitewashed Draco and since Ron hate Draco, he has to be bad to hate this beautiful leather pant guy.

​

Finally (and that may be only a personal opinion), Ron failling are not glossed other (especially in movies) compared to the other ones. Some people say Ron is a arse because he ruined Hermione Yull Ball, yet completely ignore Hermione inacceptable comportment during year 3 (/"Your rat, that you love, dissapeared and there is only traces of bloods in your bed, and you think it is my cat, that had already tried to attack him several times? Don't be riddiculous, Crookshank would never do that."/, plus most of her reactions to Divination and with the Firebolt). These same people will also be quick to notice Ron "betrayed" Harry 2 times in year 4 and 7, but will ignore that both time, Harry also said hurtfull things to him (in DH, they were under Horcruxe influence, but Harry told Ron to leave).

** It bothers me because while I can accept children being slightly more mature than their age (because writing a child is hard; and can make a very annoying character), 11 years old Occlumency trained, master politicians children is one of my pet peeves.

It make different character than canon (so different we are almost at an AU level), and almost justify Blood Purism (if Pure Blood Slytherin children are politicians behind closed doors while children of other houses are children, Pure Blood ARE superior).\\
I also don't really like the plot that are born from it (I remember reading that a character can only be as much intelligent than it's author, and since most of the authors are not politicians, their "plot" often feel . . . empty, rail guided).

PS : a character often victim of this is Daphne Greengrass, master politician who stay out of the Blood purist in Slytherin House. But even if I do like the character (who gives a nice alternative to Pansy if you want to have a Slytherin romance), the only thing we know about her, apart her name (and since it's not in books but from Rowling, this much is already discussable), is that she was member of Pansy gang, member, not leader. So she is probably a character comparable to Pansy, only less powerfull, intelligent, ruthless, rich and/or connected.

But she doesn't have to be a Crabbe or Goyle. It's just that, since there is the notion of "gang" and not just friendship (like Malfoy and Zabini, who seem equals), Pansy is a "leader" and must have something that put her at least a little over the others. It could be a big difference (Malfoy Vs Crabbe and Goyle for example), but also something not big. Just being a little more pretty, or popular, having a little richer family may be enough. I would think that Blood Purity could also work, but since both character seem to come from "Sacred 28", they could be both "very pure".

It bothers me some if children straight-up act like adults (and not just when romance gets involved), but a few years too mature is fine. Besides, child protagonists usually have to act mature for their age in order to be readable, just as when you're writing, you delete most of the um's and ah's.

On the other hand, I /hate/ it when characters act /younger/ than their age. Whether it's Harry crying unnecessarily, Ron acting like more of a childish, petulant berk than in canon, or Hermione failing to break out of her naivety in the face of hard evidence, it's likely to make me nope out of a fic a lot faster than if they act older, so I definitely err on the side of older.

  12 year olds having meaningful political power? Nah, get over yourself
#+end_quote

There is that thing called monarchy. Alexander the Great was 20 when he ascended to the throne. Charles XII even just 15 (without a regency). You will find plenty of examples of young monarchs who wielded a lot of power. By the time he turned 18, Charles had already defeated Norway and would crush a massively superior Russian Army at Narva before the year was over.

That is not to say that I like Slytherin politics, but teenagers leading even entire nations is not unprecedented. And most pureblood politics assume a system based on nobility.

** If I had the time to write a fic, I would have everyone be more enamored of magic. While I agree serious 11 year olds exist (I used to be such a child myself), the political games makes no sense that early.

I do think cliques as well as basic cronyism should exist. And magical society comes across as conservative, so look at how upper class children were educated before the industrial revolution.

** I completely agree with you. But I also want to bring up 3 points for others reading this thread.

1. Children and especially teens actually do act older than they appear quite often and are capable of quite a lot of more adult things. But as adults, we often fail to recognize this and because we think of them as younger and inexperienced, in our minds they "shouldn't" or "don't" act that way. This is especially true in wealthier or more well to do areas of the world. Go to more poverty stricken or tougher areas of the world and you will see children and teens especially, very much acting like adults with all the responsibilities and hardships that may entail.

2. Children who suffer at a young age from hardships in whatever form (Like Harry), often have to "grow up" faster. Harry may be stunted in terms of recognizing relationships and love perhaps, but he was cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the Dursleys from a young age (or so it's implied). He dealt with abuse, and full awareness of the lack of parents, along with experiencing strange occurrences of accidental magic. He is not really a true child and so stories that have him acting older than he is age-wise are not really doing anything wrong and in fact, are more accurate than folks may realize. Again, he certainly may be stunted in some areas, but it would not be surprising for an 11-year-old Harry to embrace the Wizarding world and "grow up" mentally VERY fast because of his childhood.

3. The wizarding world is NOT MODERN BY DESIGN. It is a world that, in large part, has not kept up with the muggle world advancements because it has not needed to. Magic solves many problems that both societal and technological advancement solves in the muggle world. This means that we can't look at the wizarding world from the point of view of modern society. In the past, children DID grow up faster and had more responsibilities earlier. There are elements of Wizarding society that would force this, the most obvious one being that you wield a deadly weapon from the age of 11 (or younger). JK wrote the series from the mindset of school children dealing with a hard world, but never really dived into how much the setup of the wizarding world would affect how quickly the children had to grow up.

--------------

It is almost expected that in HP fan fiction, the children should act older than their age. The world and the setting demand it, and it's not as far off reality as many would like to believe.

** I hate it when people write first year stories where every kid is either an experienced political scientist or a neo nazi in training. Like someone else said here, it's not a stretch for a 12 year old to act like a 17 year old sometimes, but don't get carried away with it.

I generally avoid any stories that start before 4th year now partly because of this. Having older characters means that the characterizations can make more sense and the power levels aren't as outrageous for the age group (usually).

To write children well is a really difficult thing to do, honestly. It's why I generally avoid fics with first of second year included.
