#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

This is book 2 but just click on the author and all 6 books will pop up. Basically Harry is in Slythrin and he is friends with that whole group which includes Daphne

** I don't understand why people like fics that ruin characters just for the sake of ruining them. People can't be bothered to write an interesting and different backstory so they just ruin canon, breaking suspension of disbelief completely and usually writing cliche stories.

  how some fics are doing a turnaround of tropes and basically kissing Ron's ass these days. Super!Ron, Ron!the!flawless!friend
#+end_quote

Links? I've only seen one fic that could be considered such, and it was an SI fic. And anyway, after 20+ years of Hermione ass-kissing in fics it's nice to see some variety.

*** Because Hermione is a know-it-all, Ron is jealous with poor eating habits and pushes everyone else away from Harry, and if Harry wasn't emotionally stunted he would see what terrible people they are. Much like fannon has been able to do ;)

******* I'm sorry, what? Ron's attitude before the first task in GoF and him leaving Harry and Hermione during the Horcrux Hunt clearly shows that he isn't loyal and leaves when things get tough. He is jealous of Harry's fame, at least. That's completely sure.

And if you're so smart, why don't you tell me how real people work?

******** Real people are nuanced.

Ron was splinched and couldn't heal without proper care and food. Something that the group was extremely low on.

The tensions slowly rise within the group, the horcrux steadily breaking them and their resilience. The tensions eventually spill over into a grand fight, where Harry /literally tells Ron to leave/.

Ron didn't just up and leave by himself. They fought and Harry, in a moment of anger, told Ron to go back to his home. This is why I said that you haven't read the books.

Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzxwcBZFuI&t=1508][this]]. It will help you understand what /actually/ happened.

********** Ron was jealous and felt betrayed. He felt as if Harry had lied to him and gone behind his back.

Remember, no one said that Ron was flawless. Obviously he isn't, he's a bloody human after all. And a teenager at that time, too. It was one of Ron's lowest moments, the one time he allowed his jealousy to take control of his emotions and ended up hurting both himself and Harry tremendously.

Harry was devastated, he thought that his friendship with Ron was being destroyed, a friendship he thought very highly of. It's wasn't random that Ron was Harry's hostage. Above all, Ron was Harry's best friend, the one who understood him best. Even more than Hermione. Hermione simply wasn't the same.

The movies took a look at that and proceeded to completely ignore it and turn Ron into a comic-relief character.

Literally watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCzxwcBZFuI][this]] entire video. Maybe then you'll get a better understanding of what the characters are. Humans, with flaws and low and high moments. Not the caricatures that the movies and many a fanfic author tend to portray them as.
