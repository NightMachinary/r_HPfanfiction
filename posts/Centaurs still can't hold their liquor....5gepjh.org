"And so, as acting Minister for Magic, it is my pleasure to give my assent to this bill..."

Kingsley raised a quill and scribbed out his approval on the parchment resting on the lecturn in front of him, while an audience of hundreds watched with baited breath.

"...Formally admitting centaur-kind as not just beings, but equal in every way to human witches and wizards!"

Raising his voice to be heard over the start of the cheering, "With this, we continue down a path that atones for the shames of our past, progressing towards a world where /who/ you are means more than /what/ you are."

The cheers grew louder; pointy hats were flung into the air, sparks were shot from wands and flowers were tossed every which way.

...

But then there was a sound. A terrible, terrible sound, that filled the hearts of every centaur (and many humans in-the-know) present with horror.

~pop!~

The sound of a bottle of Ogden's Old Firewhisky being cracked open.

Besides Kingsley, the centaur Havigan leapt forward, arm outstretched, futily reaching to stop the inevitable.

"NOOOOOOOOOO^{OOOOOOOOOO..."}

/Bill signing turns to chaos as alcohol fumes overwhelm centaurs!/

/Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic: "I gave express directions for no alcohol to be served at the signing reception. The person responsible for bringing Firewhisky in is currently under investigation..."/

/.../

/Dion, affected centaur: "I remember exactly what I did while I was under the influence. I owe multiple apologies to Mrs. Malfoy for my unwelcome advances, and to the MLEP officers who were trying to apprehend me at the time..."/

/.../

/Hermione Granger, Department Head: "Everyone knows it, even muggle legends have it; centaurs cannot handle wine, the smell alone can easily intoxicate them."/

"I'm afraid it's simply not possible to destroy all alcohol in Britain, sir Pelagius." Justin Pilliwickle of the newly reformed Centaur Liaison Office said to the dejected centaur in front of him, "Leaving aside the economic value of Butterbeer sales alone and the gains from tariffs on imported liquors, we would have to find some way to prohibit alcohol use by the muggles as well. And, well, the 1920's in America can tell us how well that will go."

The centaur, Pelagius, looked up, "American wizards tried to ban alcohol in the 1920s?"

Justin shook his head, "No, the muggle government did. For moral reasons, I understand. It backfired catastrophically, millions of...'dollars', were lost in tax revenue and a huge black market sprung up which paved the way for modern crime syndicates today."

The centaur looked down again, "Still, there must be some solution...maybe-"

He was interrupted as an aide quietly eased into the room and dropped a sheath of papers on Justin's desk, "Update on the Wolfsbane Potion production, Mr. Pilliwickle." the aide muttered quietly as he left again.

There was silence in the room. Pelagius's eyebrows twitched thoughtfully.

"Are you having an idea, Pelagius?" Justin asked hopefully.

The centaur shook his head, "No, I was just thinking...that Firewhisky antidote you used earlier...perhaps it could be modified?"


** Something tells me I might be using the Prompt tag incorrectly...I was hoping for someone to write a fic based on this concept.
