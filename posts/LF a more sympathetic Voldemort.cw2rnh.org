** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] Voldemort regains his sanity after his resurrection in the graveyard and returns to his original goal of protecting and revitalising wizarding society. linkffn(11540013)

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] Voldemort is the leader of the opposition whose faction resorted to terrorism under a distopian regime which had completely blocked them out of the political process. This fic has blatant Dumbledore and Ron bashing, but it also has some neat worldbuilding. linkffn(8163784)

The following two fics depict a world in which a sane Voldemort has won and carried out his vision of magical supremecy. Voldemort's ideal society is a pleasant place to live for the average wizard but is nightmarish for multitudes of others.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle received a thorough education in magic, cultivated an influential following, and secured his immortality. He then disappeared into the Muggle world and was quickly convinced that, left unchecked, Muggles were certain to doom the entire planet. Tom returned a decade later with a careful strategy for world dominion. He succeeded. By the time a young Harry Potter, Heir to his Name and ward of the Malfoy family, is handed a wand at the traditional age of eight, he stands to inherit a modest territory of 25,000 square kilometers and eight thousand restless Muggle subjects.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. But when the remaining resistance breaches the Magical Curtain guarding Voldemort's empire, he suddenly resurfaces and offers to guide them through the new Europe where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. But why hasn't he aged a single day?

** Good luck, lol. I've been asking/looking for a story with logically consistent, 3-dimensional antagonists for a very long time, and I've gotten nothing.

It's somehow built into the fandom that the antagonist - if including Tom Riddle and Co. - can't be real people with a logical and moral framework.

They seem to be doomed to stay as evil, psychopathic, sadistic, genocidal idiots forever.

It won't be the first time I say this, and it won't be the last, but JKR is a vastly overestimated writer. She is a passable children's author, and she came up with one good idea (of a somewhat unique magic-wielding society), but if you look at the stories from a serious perspective without the rose-tinted glasses, there's really not much there.

******* True. She's not very good at plot or worldbuilding, brilliant at characterisation but sacrifices it for the sake of her (inconsistent) plot. More of her popularity is owed to brilliant PR and marketing than most realise. But, to be fair, her prose is excellent, especially in the first three books, and then you're stuck reading all seven of them over and over until it's two decades later and you're still talking about it on the internet with complete strangers.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

*** If they have a genuine point, they're not "pure" evil. One can still be really, verily, appallingly wicked without being /pure/ evil, which is a very strong phrase to throw around.

What's more, there are certainly evil people (in fiction and in real-life) who /claim/ to have a non-evil goal, but are in truth only doing what they do out of personal ambition and sadism.

This is in fact the difference between Lord Voldemort and Grindelwald: Grindelwald /genuinely believed/ in his idea of the Greater Good, whereas Voldemort is just a megalomaniac misanthrope who claims he wants to make a heaven for purebloods but is really only saying that so the Death Eaters will remain his obedient minions, whereas what Voldemort really wants to do is just to take over the world and then rule it forever, being worshipped as a God-King.

Hence, OP wants a Voldemort who's not a hypocrite. A Voldemort who /genuinely/ wants to change the world for the better, for a given definition of better, and only commits unforgivable acts in misguided service of a good, or at least sympathetic, cause.

Protect "olde ways" that have zero depth or actually importance in the narrative, just words dropped over canon with no changes to it at all except to give Harry a corny inheritance and weirdly pseudo feminist "powers" that come across more as preparing her to marry voldemort and give him babies. And Harry doesn't seem to remember for more than a chapter that he's a racist, power hungry villain who not only killed her parents, her godfather, and countless others, but has a platform and supporters that would see her best friend killed.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
