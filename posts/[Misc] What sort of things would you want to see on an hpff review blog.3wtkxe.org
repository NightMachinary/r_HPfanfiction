Or would you even read one at all?

I'm starting a blog, partly for updates on my own stuff, but mostly as a fan fiction review site. I read... an insane amount of fan fiction, and I've often wished for a place where I could share my thoughts on them with other people. I'm planning on using tumblr, so that I can interact with the community nicely, but if people have other suggestions I would be happy to take them.

Also, do people have any idea of what sort of things they'd want to see on such a website? Any specifics my reviews should include? Right now I'm starting with a format of overall recommendation, author summary, extended summary, and review.

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!


** I would subscribe to this. :) I occasionally review fics on my tumblr but I would love a fic rec blog.

I would want to read the basic information + author's summary, with your thoughts on the fic in a few words.

Other ideas:

- Choose your favorite/best portrayals of a specific genre, pairing, character, or fanfic trope. Like "Fics that will make you fall in love with [character]."

- You could do different things on different days of the week, like posting feel-good/fluffy fics on Fridays and oneshots on Wednesdays.

- You could try to get someone else with different interests to help you so that you can cover a broader range of fics.

*** These are some great ideas! I will definitely take these into consideration.

The url is sirelliot.tumblr.com

It's obviously still in its early stages right now, as the layout might change, and of course there's going to be a ton more posts. I'm also going to add more menus for searching by more tags I'm going to add to different posts, like relationship tags or genre tags.

** Have at least one day where you review crap. Cos ranting about terrible stuff is fun.

*** This is a great idea. I'd feel bad about bashing something too much, though.

**** Eh, I'd suggest only ranting on occasion if a fic really bugs you. Spork comms have fallen out of favor for a reason - they're generally mean-spirited and not nearly as funny or insightful as they think they are. I love reccing comms, but if I realized the reccers were taking pleasure in fic-bashing on a regular basis, I'd bail. Having a genuine bone to pick with an author's premise or a story's execution is one thing, and it can foster interesting critique; searching out badfics solely in order to mock them gets old fast. It also invites the irony of setting yourself up as an arbiter of quality and invariably getting caught showing your ass. Meaning, people who don't like the things you like will feel justified in mocking you for your taste because you've made it clear you think mocking is okay.

Or if you feel an overwhelming need to make fun of other fics, set up a separate blog for that and don't mix it with your recs.

My feelings on sporking aside, I applaud your idea for a review blog. I love reading reactions to fic and discovering stories and authors I haven't encountered before. I browsed through the entries you've posted, and it looks like a good beginning to me. Also, thumbs up for reviewing The Boy Who Died a Lot. I have a couple of minor quibbles with the fic, but they scarcely matter in light of how many things it does brilliantly, with an amazing blend of humor and pathos.

One suggestion: be careful not to overschedule yourself. Too many updates per week can lead to missed deadlines, which in turn leads to playing catch-up and feeling obligated. Post when you feel like it and when you actually have something to say. Less likelihood of burn-out that way.

***** Thanks for the advice! Thankfully, I've got a good backlog of fics I've loved that I can review now and save for when I can't write something new.

**** I think it would be fine as long as you didn't link to them and didn't direct people to go and read it for themselves.
