Often I see chapters on various websites and over a variety of fandom's and they all have Notes by the author saying something along the lines of “I am so sorry but my computer crashed and my chapter was lost” now I'm not saying that Computers never crash but this happens way more often than computers crash. it's OK for an author to just say I'm sorry for the delay they don't need to lie and say that something crazy happened we understand


** I dunno, I've seen some people have a truly impressive amount of computer trouble before. Gotta remember that it's just not computers that break, it's people that break them. :)

Definitely okay for people to just say it too though, I completely agree. It's a hobby, and if you're having a 'no writing' period that's completely okay. Life happens and you can't go at 100% all the time.

** I myself don't write fanfiction, only read it, but I can see where the authors are coming from. My laptop crashes more often than it works. Though can get moments when they don't manage to write no matter the reason, or they do write but they find it somehow inadequate.

** There's a reason I pay for cloud storage nowadays.

I once had three external hard drives fail in the space of two months. And no, no vibrations or excessive heat or dust. Sometimes, you get weirdly unlucky.

So, nowadays all my geeky stuff, be it RPG scenarios or fanfic I enjoy is stored on the cloud.

*** May I suggest you add another storage medium to your backup scheme, to follow 3-2-1 rule more closely - 3 copies, on 2 different mediums, one off-site.

** I completely understand your sentiment. It seems like a forced excuse for something that you don't see a need to excuse for.

​

I've had month long "breaks" where I didn't write much. My last one I tried to write a chapter three separate times during that month and lost three different (Honestly IMO bad versions) during that month. Combined with a lack of inspiration and it became a slog to write again.

​

The problem with the long periods of times where I don't upload is that you as a writer gets reviews or comments or whatever the site calls them and they ask if you are going to write more. That happens no matter what.

​

My current writing project I started in July and now there is 136k words in it. So in the span of 3 months I wrote close to 400 pages. Some would say that is a lot some would say it isn't. That isn't the point the thing is I was fairly consistent with my writing and I still had people ask me if it was an abandoned project.

​

So for a writer it feels natural to explain what has happened since the last chapter (Especially) if something major happened for it to be delayed past the perceived "Schedule".
