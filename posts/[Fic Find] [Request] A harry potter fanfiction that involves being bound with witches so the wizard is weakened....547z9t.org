D you know a story where the witches are weaker than the wizard so they bond to the wizards so they share his power weakening him in the process and harry figures out how to avoid that.. Tom never bonded and its why hes a dark lord. Albus bonded YEARS ago and they let him get away with being powerful since hes so old...

Warning, it gets progressively weirder (not in a good way) and heads into grimderp in the later books.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
