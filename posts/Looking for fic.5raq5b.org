I found this really good fanfiction where they replace manipulative Dumbledore with Good Dumbledore, and he goes around trying to fix all the problems that the manipulative Dumbledore (by then known as Wulfric) caused. I recall it being really good, so I would like to know the name.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon).
