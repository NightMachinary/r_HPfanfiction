I've been wanting to ask this for awhile now as a long time lurker. But why does this subreddit seem to hate slash so much? Slash romance is a huge component of fanfiction, especially for female fans. If you don't want to read it that's cool - but it seems like slash ships get unfairly targeted sometimes. This is an honest question I'm not trying to attack anyone.


** You will get a range of answers, including people not being able to connect to or immerse themselves in a gay mc, the 'fact' that 90% of slash is "bad" (which, frankly, I agree with since I find most fanfic bad), or 'problematic ships' (which, according to the range of definitions such people use, certainly includes het ships as well, so whatever). Some will also say that they downvote posts they don't agree with or don't find interesting. For this one, I can only roll my eyes and refrain from downvoting yet another pet peeves thread or silly prompt that would never make for a readable story.

As a gay guy who writes and reads slash (as well as everything else), I couldn't give a crap if someone who doesn't like slash doesn't want to read my fics. I didn't write them for that audience. I'm happy if they simply pass by and find something else that they can immerse themselves in, feel comfortable with, and enjoy. It's as simple as that.

What does bug me is, as you note, the reflexive downvoting of slash requests or slash recs. Others may say that "oh no, this doesn't happen," but that's simply not true. Some on this sub, as it is on many subs, indulge in the juvenile problem of 'punishing' people who dare like what they don't like.

EDIT: I'd like to point out that I didn't downvote Lantana. Theirs was an honest and answer, and while I obviously wish social stigmas and taboos were radically different, I upvoted it.

I think the majority of us who are wary of Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, and Harry/Voldemort being by far the most popular slash options for the main character are also opposed to Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Draco, Harry/Bellatrix, and the like as well. I think the main issue is that 95+% of slash fic for Harry is with a problematic or antagonistic character as opposed to, say, 50% of het fics. Which just seems weird to me.

FWIW, I like Wolfstar, and I remember reading a Harry/Cedric story that was absolutely phenomenal a number of years ago (don't remember the title unfortunately :( )

But Harry/Theo sign me the fuck up adorable 10/10 even if he was a death eater the books never developed him enough to view him as an antagonist

****** The thing is, why would you want him to get the opportunity to turn his life around? He committed perfidy, which would have seen him shot by the Allies in WWII. Reduce that to life in prison due to his age, nevermind the whole unforgivable thing and several counts of attempted murder, use of poison, arms which cause unnecessary suffering and so on (and none of that was on orders of Voldemort, nor is coercion a valid defence for crimes against life such as attempted murder).

Why would you give Death Eaters a second chance when their victims get none? And then, why Malfoy, without any time served (you could argue that even the first batch of Death Eaters deserve more since they paid the price for their crimes by being tortured for a decade in Azkaban)?

******* Because he was a teenager who was radicalized by his parents from birth and many of his actions were partially under some form of duress (Voldemort saying he'd kill his mother). Further, I believe in the ability of all individuals to better themselves and to move away from who they once were.

I also do not hold to any logic of "well the <insert evil people here> wouldn't do this for us, so we can't do this for them". The reason the bad guys are the bad guys are that they are different from us and won't give others the same benefits we give others. Failing to uphold our own legal, ethical, and moral convictions because of who is on the other side of it is damnable in and of itself. And often leads to bad outcomes that even those who only want to direct it to "the truly evil ones" should recognize as bad - look at what a lack of due process (and some people would like to get rid of due process for the "evil and obviously guilty") did to Sirius

Personal agency is what matters here, not any offered excuses. And for the record, I'm speaking as a fan of many post-Voldemort fics where Draco and Harry settle their differences in an eighth year of Hogwarts.

Or where they just fuck in secret in said eighth year because I find that hot.

********* We don't know the full context of Andromeda. She might have been a Narcissa Malfoy or Pansy Parkinson type at age 16 and fell in love with Ted Tonks later, changing her views. Or she might have always been good. Hard to say. A lot of people don't change until they are good and truly away from home - it's a common trope for college for a reason.

And personal agency is but one factor of why choices are made. To take out everything else is absurd, both in fiction and in real life. In the case of Malfoy, it helps explain how he got into a situation where even though he clearly no longer wanted anything to do with this that he still felt it was his only choice.

I'll conclude with what I say a lot - Explaining mitigating circumstances is not the same as excusing situations.

As opposed to the general threat of Voldemort showing up anywhere and killing your entire family? If you are willing to accept "but his family would suffer otherwise" as a defence, that argument would get a lot of war criminals off the hook because their families were likewise threatened by the regimes they were serving.

Also, Voldemort never told Draco to poison anyone, nor to Imperius civilians. That was 100% Draco. While his orders were illegal (assassination is against the Hague convention after all), illegal orders have been rejected as defence countless times. And most of what Malfoy does comes from his own initiative, not his orders. In fact, after Voldemort and Umbridge, he's probably a solid third when it comes to crimes committed "on-screen". He certainly breaks more laws and conventions than even Bellatrix Lestrange (at least from what we have seen). I am sure that Rowling did not intend to make him guilty of dozens of counts of war crimes, but that's what she ended up writing.

2. The threat must be believable.\\
   Ie. you have to believe wholeheartedly - to the point of /knowing/ - that this person - the one threatening you - will, without doubt, go through with their threat.

From Wikipedia.

What Malfoy was doing/trying (murder/various war crimes) was nothing less than what he was threatened with. Hence coercion/duress is not a valid defence.

Inescapable might also be argued with since he did not try to get protection from Dumbledore/the Ministry.

He got involved in the Death Eaters and Voldemort through his family - keep in mind, he was 15 at the time so he obviously didn't call up Voldemort and all that on his own. And he didn't ask nor volunteer for the 'mission' - that was Lucius' fault.

It could be argued that he also tried to kill a dozen Slugclub attendants, but even without that, it is 3 lives vs 5.

1. She wasn't really a part of his plot. The goal was to kill Dumbledore. She was only hurt because s/he opened the package/. That's on her. Yes, he gave her the package (sort of). But he didn't make her open the package. That was her and her curiosity.
2. Draco was having a panic attack. Harry barged in. Yelled at him ad accused him of things. They, obviously, got in a fight. Draco /attempted/ to Crucio Harry. He did not succeed. Harry used Sectumsempra against him - and we all know what happened.\\
   To successfully cast an Unforgiveable, you've got have meaning behind it. Strong intent. Harry's Godfather had just died and he didn't have the ability to make an Unforgiveable against Bellatrix. Do you really think a crying 16-year-old boy under extreme stress could've done any harm?

**** You can make almost anything work (other than Voldemort and Snape romances that is). I've outlined previously how to do so for Draco and Bellatrix. For Bellatrix you can even cheapen out via time travel (would be grooming with Malfoy). The issue is that most people who are into those kinds of fics do not want them to be less problematic (or in the case of Draco, refuse to do so because it would mean admitting that it is problematic).

Because let's face it, if you diverge in year 2 and make Draco grow into a different person due to the chosen divergence, he will be almost unrecognisable from his canon terrorist self. And the people liking Malfoy do not want him to fundamentally change, they want to handwave away his war crimes and then ship Tom Felton. Likewise, Bellatrix defecting before the DoM removes a lot of conflict those fics seem to thrive on.

More to the point, I spent like half a year in the Bellamione sphere on tumblr. They had top-notch shitposting, and I had quite a few interesting conversations with bloggers. But they made it very clear that they want the relationship to be problematic, to have the issues which come from the torture scene (and killing Sirius to a lesser extent).

He committed crimes, he must pay for that. Without at least a decade in prison (preferably life -> time travel), I consider his actions irredeemable. And unlike Bellatrix (after a potential defection before the DoM), he can't redeem himself on the battlefield since, well he is not up for that tbh. He proved that he can only kill when he does not have to look at his victim.

I personally like seeing what Draco becomes when he isn't criminally evil. He can still be sour, sarcastic, mean and proud, and he has grown up with a different worldview that is mostly challenged but sometimes affirmed (like he might insist that Harry get better clothes, even if he needs to drag him to a muggle clothing store to do it).

Oh, and there's the fact that a lot of this fandom started off in FFN, where they don't have any way to filter slash. That, combined with the fact that not all slash writers mark there fics as such means that quite a few people have annoying memories of scrolling past pages worth of slash fics to find the ones they like, or reading a fic and getting hooked in only to experience a visceral shock when they're slapped in the face with some of the more questionable (not necessarily morally questionable, just... odd) elements that can crop up in slash fics (like cross-dressing, or mpreg).

I think with that you get a certain ambivalent and, in some cases, hateful attitude toward slash (and some het pairings) that's not shared among other fanfic communities. I think the general ignorance toward slash here exacerbates the few bad apples who are actively downvoting and making stupid comments on slash posts.

Maybe some of us who don't read slash but want to make the community more inclusive can leave an upvote on a slash post if it looks like it's unfairly downvoted. I don't think there's much that can be done about these serial downvoters, but we can at least try to counteract them.

Other ships in slash tend to have a less volatile duo but because of the toxicity of the other two, other slash ships and fics aren't that well recieved.

(Unless it's like specifically based in homophobia--a difference of like passive dismissal/willful ignorance of this type of writing versus angry-opposition). Heteronormativy determines what's "normal," and in this case determines that slash fics are generally a "side" body of writing that's for a niche audience. This makes it so that slash fics can be judged merely on the fact that they are slash, rather than merits of "normal" fics which is judged on its tropes, writing, plot, etc.

It also allows for people to essentialize all slash fics with tidy broad-sweeping critiques like "I just don't like the pairings." Slash fics feature an enormous diversity of pairings. If someone told you "I just hate the pairings in het fics so I don't read any of them" you'd be sort of confused, no?

To be clear I'm not calling anyone homophobic (except the people who very clearly and obviously are). I'm explaining that this is a consequence of the way heterosexuality is normalized and assumed as the "default" within Anglo-American culture.

I am above such petty emotions." No it's not cool and mature to be 'over' your parents' violent deaths. It's frankly unnerving and unsettling.

I mean the pairing is weird and problematic in a whole host of other different ways but that one point seems to be the thing that always gets me.

There are plenty of stories where Harry isn't paired with one of them. They're not that hard to find either, just search Google, you can find a ton. Or make a post on this subreddit asking for slash, just not with Harry/Death Eater, etc.

I've found a ton where Harry isn't with someone super older than him, and where he isn't with a Death Eater.

** I keep seeing the same comments about the characters of Draco, Tom Riddle, even Snape regarding their repugnant identity, behavior, and values. And that's all true that they're basically bigots (or were, in the case of snape), but the concerns about mild pedophilia and general antagonism of the ships along with the bad things they've done being "forgiven," feels like an exaggeration for me. The good drarry, dramione fic addresses those concerns. Tomarry, Harrymort, and even some Snarry can be specifically about the unfair and cruel dynamics at play. Where you find dark fic, you often find people who have had trauma, and are writing out their catharsis. There will always be fic that doesn't address critical issues between m/m pairings, just as there's always fic that's written by primarily guys that seems to apply hermione, daphne, luna, or any of the women as being solely for Harry's betterment and his purpose in life and not a fleshed out character of their own. Further, when it comes to consumption of fic, you're responsible for bringing your own moral framework when you choose to read a fic with problematic pairings. No one is responsible for what you read except for you, if you are an adult. And if you're not an adult, please speak to a parent and avoid reading things that are not appropriate for your age. Even more so from here, what we want to read in fic is not necessarily a reflection of what we want in real life, so being the thought police about abusive dynamics is basically freaking out about people not being able to tell the difference between real and fantasy, and frankly that's kind of insulting towards people. I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but this subreddit is full of dudes. And yeah, I think a lot of guys are the ones downvoting m/m. Because it's definitely not like this on female dominated spaces on discord, facebook, tumblr. Everyone keeps going on about /their/ circumstances justifying why they like a, b, and c, m/m pairings when it's entirely unnecessary to justify yourself. And to turn it around and complain about "most" women "weirdly" fetishizing m/m is in itself misogynistic. I think ultimately m/m is a consequence of media being male dominated. When most of the central cast is male, you get m/m pairings. I truly think there's a bit of a difference between knowing what you're doing with m/m and doing it because you reflexively want one male character to be more helpless/disenfranchised/"female". For instance, I've written a/b/o "m/m" that is designed to make clear that there's similar dynamics to being a woman when you are a male Omega and the societal impact of that. Is that fetishizing men? Maybe, maybe not. I come at it from an angle where you can explore these gender dynamics where women are often and genuinely suffering with real life discrimination, feel safer getting into these topics with m/m ships, and in turn some people look at that and think "feminizing men is happening," when that's not necessarily true.

Other ships I often see, like Snape/Harry or Tom/harry, just gives me a bad vibe of pedophilia and I just can't accept that.

Ironically enough, the slash-ship that would make the most sense for Harry, which would be Ron/harry, is pretty barebone and often ignored in favor of that 'bad-boy/good guy' trope.

They don't? Harry x Hermione is vastly more popular. And for the sake of argument, Daphne Greengrass is an empty parchment for writers to build on. The equivalent of Harry x Daphne in slash is something like Harry x Theodore Nott, who is another Slytherin character mentioned by name who has no impact in the story at all.

I think for the people who like the best friends become lovers trope, Harry x Ron is a very good ship to explore.

Also, I get the idea of just using someone's face and ignoring their personality for a fanfic, this is why I don't mind OOC Draco with Harry or Hermione, for example. You can create a "different person" for that face as long as it's well done. But having a better personality doesn't change the fact that the relationship is between an adult and a teen (Snape x Harry / Hermione, Snape x Draco, Tom x Harry, Bellatrix x Harry, etc.) and for me that's a no no. To each their own, I suppose, but pedo is not my thing.

Which would be a good reason why I don't read slash as well. When I read about people in a relationship, I do it for the characters, not just so two hot people can bump hips endlessly.\\
a LARGE majority of it is literally Harry/person who constantly tried/has hurt him, mocked him, bullied him, or directly tried to have him killed. Being hot is not gonna change that.\\
Or in Snape's case, a person that literally lusted for Harry's mother, which creates a whole other VERY creepy scenario.\\

Writing a pairing that disregards the story and who the characters actually are as people just for the sake of “but they look so /attractive/ together” is something I think makes fanfiction as a whole, worse. People ship Hermione and Harry more than just about any other het pairing in all of fanfiction across any fandom. People ship Harry and Daphne because she's a named Slytherin with an interesting name, isn't connected to Voldemort, and isn't described as pug nosed or troll like.

I was uncomfortable reading lesbian pairings because female characters are so easy to relate with and it distracts me from enjoying the story because it becomes an uncomfortable psychoanalysis of myself. Male characters make it easy to just sit back and enjoy the romance.

***** Disclaimer: I mostly engaged in fannish discourse back in 2004-2008, my thoughts probably give more insight into fannish history - which informs current trends - than current trends themselves.

Lesbian pairings can still contain those sexist ideas. I think a lot of us got into mslash because we're used to the female characters being written in irritating ways, and getting rid of the men and het romance doesn't fix that, but only using male characters and treating them in a genderblind/non-binary way /does/.

I'm reminded of how the MLP fandom wasn't happy about a PoC analogue being introduced in the form of a zebra (most of the other characters being ponies) because previously, fans assumed that any of the characters, if they were human, could be PoC.

95% of the femslash had Marian or the other woman be abusive, or there was slutshaming, or both, and eventually I just gave up and only read fics with m!Hawke, because I was more likely to find decent fic that wasn't awful.

******* My two fanfic favorites are Dragon Age and Harry Potter. A lot of Dragon Ave fanfic seems to fall back on the idea that it's medieval so women are chattel, need protection, have a weird obsession with virginity, shouldn't be sexual, etc. Despite that in canon women can and do kick ass and do what they want. Anyone want to tell Cassandra, Morrigan, Leliana, Cauthrien, or Vivienne that they're not as good as male fighters cuz they're women?

In retrospect, kind of a different point to yours about femslash, but overall it says a lot about how fanfic writers treat women in fic.

***** Oh sorry nah I don't think all straight women who read slash are fetishising them at all. But there are a lot of ones who very much are. We all read and write fic for different reasons and it's honestly going to be different for a lot of people, but responding to people who don't want to be fetishised by saying ‘but I'm innocent and a victim' sucks bruh

Like the very sexist imbalance you're talking about is still found in a staggering amount of slash. Just because the heterosexual male gaze is taken from a story doesn't immediately make it not sexist. And the level of purposefully using struggles like internalised homophobia to create angst porn for gay characters is super prevalent and fucked up

There's no reason that someone who isn't gay can't revel in gay awesomeness, and using characters who aren't like you to discuss stuff in your stories or fulfil fantasies is awesome and healthy, but we're allowed to talk about problematic behaviour of privileged individuals. You suffer from sexism and misogyny hurts literally everyone but of you're turning around and oppressing others to make yourself feel better that's shitty behaviour

and honestly whenever anyone comes up with that last argument I find it really interesting that you're so content with the media's habit of making men represent all of us that you'd use that as a fallback. Like we all have issues and reading fic isn't something that necessarily needs to be dealing with things, or doing everything right; but I'd ask you why you are more relaxed reading male characters than female characters written by women. Esp in a genre of story making that was founded by women. HP has a surprising amount of male authors and a lot of them are creepy af, so it's cool not to want to be reading that particular voice; but fandom and fanfiction were founded by women, and so I think maybe take a look at what you're saying, and think about where all of that is coming from.

In short, writing and reading gay stories is awesome, no matter if your preference is because of comfort or trauma or experiences with a lot of fiction. We /want/ more quality gay stories; but writing stories about gay men or any other oppressed population being raped, gang raped, or beaten just so that another character will have feelings, or fetishised for the gaze of heterosexual women is shitty, and that happens a lot in slash. Like /a lot/ and it's perfectly ok for us to criticise that and not singling you out as a poor unfortunate straight woman

And like the implication that woman is a role, like, nah. Women are all kinds of people and so are men. There's no reason to make a gay character have curvy hips and long hair and delicate features just because they bottom; that's so twisted

I think mpreg itself isn't problematic as a concept, but it so often is done in a super weird and gross way and sometimes it's straight up fetish porn and/or body horror.

Who knows, maybe some guys want to get pregnant. I know some trans men do, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that a guy would want to have a kid without a surrogate, and magic makes thing possible, but it's so often not written from that POV, and I don't blame you for just filtering it out

** Personally I think this is one of the worst fandoms for quality slash, since the basic premise of the popular slash ships other than Wolfstar require a justification for longer fics or we're already starting off with bad writing. For oneshots and snips and stuff I'd say there's not really a need for justification most of the time since they play out like snapshots of their life, but I don't like Draco, Snape, or Voldemort much so I have very little incentive to start such short fics. I only bother if the fic will convince me to care about that version of them. I do read a bit of Wolfstar, because I think it's a great pairing, even if I'm not super interested in it over other slash pairings like Harry/Neville or Harry/Ron which are super rare. So yeah, I'd say I don't hate slash, but I despise certain pairings, and those pairings make up most of the slash in this fandom, so I despise most slash fic in this fandom.

** TLDR at bottom.

If you want an indepth theory, there are some major studies published about the raise of hateful rhetoric and the lack of hiding of unaccepted social response due to the internet. Modern social theorists argue that the internet has allowed a light to be shown on the fact that tons of people have heavy biases, largely with the shield of anonymity.

Some biases arent bad per say: desiring to not be uncomfortable is a bias. You will subconsciously lean away from something that makes you uncomfortable, and that is natural. For most, that is enough. However, for some, and there are a fair number, whos response to seeing or feeling a negative reaction is to lash out. This is further supported by the aforementioned anonymity shield. For a large majority, its unconscious, and it doesnt "hurt" per say so no thought is placed on it further. The majority of down votes for something likely falls here. They mentally justify their actions as "its a downvote, who cares. I dont wanna see that shit anyway." Or "Im not the only one that felt that way... So it cant be wrong." So they react,and try to keep their " perfect personalized world" in line.

Then... There are the extreme minorities who spew their hateful rhetorics. These people are the ones who use the shield to spew what they truly felt, with hate speech and views that are clearly ignorant of reality.

TLDR: most people who "hate slash" likely dont hate it. They dislike it, dont want to see it, and down vote it thinking that only their opinion matters.

** I don't hate slash. If I find a fanfiction with a slash pairing that I think would work, I'd give it a read. I'd rather not read slash smut, as I am a straight man and I'd rather not read that, but two guys being romantic with each other and all that cutesy shit? Sure, go ahead.

What I don't like are really troublesome pairings. Like Harry/Snape (Pedo Vibes are strong with this one), Harry/Draco (Draco wished death on Harry and his friends, and even tried to kill Harry at one point. Super strong foundation for a relationship there my dudes) and Harry/Voldemort (A neat combination of the last two pairings).

And anyway, even if I don't like these pairings, I'm not going to abuse and downvote people who do write them or ask for them. It's their business. I'm just going to avoid those pairings like the plague.

There are so many people you can pair Harry with if you want a slash fic where the relationship isn't built on a foundation of hate and murder attempts. Harry/Neville would be a good one. Harry and Neville could help build each others confidence up, and help cover each others weaknesses.

Harry/Colin could work, ignoring the slight age gap, the broody Harry and excitable Colin would guarantee some great moments.

To clarify once again: I do not hate slash pairings. I hate toxic pairings.

** I can think of a few possible reasons.

1. The characters in canon are straight and it makes them angry when their favorite character is changed.

2. Many fics do not notify the reader that there is slash in the story and therefore they cannot do as many of you say to do and avoid it. With it snuck in, the reader is left vulnerable and basically slapped across the face with it. This offends them and they go on a rant about it.

3. Some slash goes pretty far and does things that can unnerve people.

That being said, some slash can be enjoyable to read. If the relationship makes sense, in the flow of the story, you can end up with an "Oh... that's actually cute" moment. Sadly many fics these days that use slash just go for the abrasive version where someone ends up basically a whore.

Not so. This subreddit in general has a very clear bias against certain pairings, characters and even themes/tropes in stories, and proceeds to downvote them.

Which, imo is wrong. I don't like Harry/Hermione, or Draco/Hermione for example, but I'm not going to downvote someone for giving me a fic recommendation, especially if it fits everything else that I asked for.

And yet, people on this subreddit will do that. They will downvote the story, even if it fits exactly what the person asked for, if it has a character/pairing/trope that they don't like in it, which is just rather petty and childish to me.

If, you ever want pairings or the like, you can always ask to exclude the popular pairings. For instance: Ask for slash, but ask people not to give you any Draco/Harry, Severus/Harry, or Tom/Harry, etc. People are usually good at trying to give you what you want, if they can, while also trying to not give you the stuff you don't want.

It has helped me to be rather specific in my posts, if there's anything that I do not like. For example: I don't like over abusive Dursley's, and have been asking people to not give me stories with that trope, and they've been doing a pretty good job on that.

  Not so. This subreddit in general has a very clear bias against certain pairings, characters and even themes/tropes in stories, and proceeds to downvote them.
#+end_quote

That is true. My point is that those biases are specifically against Snape, Malfoy, and Voldemort, and seeing people shipped with them, not against slash in general.

Now maybe that is still a problem that should be dealt with. But framing it as a slash or homophobia problem just distracts from the actual problem and makes people get defensive.

What's "crossing the line?" Being LGBT isn't crossing a line, it's fiction. You can change characters however you want. I highly doubt Harry would become super OP, or be multi shipped with a bunch of girls in canon, but people write that type of stuff here, if that is okay, slash should be too.

*** You clearly do not read much slash.

Pull up Drarry on AO3 and sort by Kudos. (I use Drarry as an example because of the sheer size of the fandom, and the quality of fics available there).

The first, like, hundred or so Drarry fics when sorted by Kudos are incredibly well -written, with amazing storylines in addition to wonderful romance. Most of those top-rated fics are not particularly kinky, even, because that's not everybody's thing, even in the world of slash.

I have sobbed my face off reading Drarry and I've also been terrified (there's some good horror fics out there) and rendered so anxious I can't sleep until the problem's resolved. A lot of it gets quite deep into the emotional components of the paired characters in a way that feels honest and compelling.

I've done the same thing with het pairings (especially Dramoine and Harmony) and in my opinion, the HP slash fics blow the het fics out of the water. There are so many incredible slash authors in HP fandom, people who, quite frankly, I have to believe are published writers in their 'real life' (in some capacity, anyway), because they write as well as or better than many published writers, taking everything -- from plotting; literary merit; beautiful, poetic language; emotional arcs; themes; painting atmosphere and setting in vivid and unforgettable ways -- into consideration. You're crazy if you think it's all about sex.

Please note that I say this as someone who, outside fic, reads almost exclusively non-romance (mostly fantasy and sci-fi, and horror), with the occasional het romance thrown in when I get the urge.

Not to mention, you may not like gay sex. Cool. But some of the sex in HP slash fic is BEYOND incredible, and is very obviously written by people who know their way around a pogo stick. I am not generally into reading about d/s relationships, alpha/omega, bondage, kink, or any of that stuff, nor do I prefer it in my fic. I'm talking about beautifully-written, romantic, gorgeously-developed sex between two people.

And this bit: "Sometimes it seems the author is of the opinion that "we've crossed a line, let's cross all the lines!" and includes everything from whips to golden showers" is quite revealing. What's the initial line that was crossed? Having the audacity to write gay sex at all, obviously.

You've really tried to dress up your comment as something false, as a critique of particulars instead of the thing itself, but it's a flimsy cover-up, to be honest.

Long live HP slash fic, may it continue to be a treasure trove of excellent stories.

Out of my 200+ bookmarks, only 8 of those have any hint of MPreg in them. Even though they are my fav. author, I haven't read their MPreg work. I purposefully stay away and don't click on anything labeled 'MPreg'. A quick view on my post history - anything asking for recs - has me specifying 'No MPreg' multiple times.\\
So, no. I don't like it.

** For me personally when I hear the term slash I do tend to think of same-sex smut, rather than less sexually centered stories. I think this is because I nearly always found to be the case when I first started reading fanfiction. I actually like slash just fine. I do however dislike Draco and Harry together, I just don't like them as a pairing.

Downvoting slash fic recs seems a bit silly if the ‘requester' hasn't spezified no slash. Just ignore it, like I ignore H/Hr fics. Don't like, don't read.
