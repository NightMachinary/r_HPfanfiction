I'm happy with anything - slash/dark!Harry/whatever, so long as it's either completed or pretty long.

Honestly, I dont mind as long as it's some fluffy, heartwarming fic...

** I mean, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has a pretty intricate friendship between the two due to their shared circumstances. Its actually a large part of the fic too.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Harry potter and the marriage contracts. Has a really close friendship between harry and Neville. Some serious molly and ginny bashing with some ron bashing later on but it was the fix that made me start reading fanfics.

** That's in almost every fic that bashes Ron or has Harry ditch Ron for one reason or another.
