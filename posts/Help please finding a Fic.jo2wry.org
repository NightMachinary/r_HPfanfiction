:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi I'm looking for a particular story that featured a amensic!Harry who has become some type of creature. What kind I can't remember. All I recall it was possibly a crossover and he's able to remember certain events pretaining to the final battle, and his friends. Whose he's all given nicknames like Book for Hermione and Moon for Luna


** Is it an avengers crossover? Where he travels around with Bruce Wayne?
