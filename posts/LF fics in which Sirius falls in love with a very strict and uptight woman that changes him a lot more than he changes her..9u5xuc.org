Soo, I have never been a fan of Sirius Black. In my eyes he was always a violent bully, who let his frustrations about secretly being in love with James out on everyone else. I also do not like pranks and do not like groups, so yeah.. Sirius has never been a favorite of mine.

However recently I read this story: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7240597/chapters/16438630]]) and found myself shipping the hell out of Umbridge (!) and Sirius.

And this story: linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5803846/chapters/13376221]]) and found myself shipping Petunia and Sirius.

Something about pairing Sirius with a strict woman would be so volatile and could even go deeply into an extremely twisted Oedipus complex - I am sure I would love it.

I am very interested in a Sirius that learns to be independent of James and the Marauders.

No Snape bashing if possible and please absolutely no bis age differences. I would prefer a female partner, but slash is fine if done well.

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated fight. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause hold the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU that explores the questions of how much we know ourselves, how much we're truly influenced by our surroundings and how much we do so in turn, whether unexpected consequences arising from the choices we make are our responsibility, and ultimately, whether truth is truly an objective axiom of existence, or only what we make of it.

** Recently really enjoyed Sirius' arc in this one. I know it sounds weird, but surprisingly very good.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
