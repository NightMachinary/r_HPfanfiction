** Oh one other thing that bothered me was why have a career discussion in 5th year where certain careers would require certain electives but you chose those electives before third year. Shouldn't there be a discussion about what the various possible careers are and what subjects you would need to have in order to work in that career before you choose your electives

** Increase the number of teachers; if not, reduce the number of positions one person can hold (none of this Transfiguration professor/Head of House/Deputy Headmistress baloney). One way or another, they desperately need more adults there.

OK, that wasn't a class, but it is an issue.

Release Binns. Modify Divination to be more of an introduction to the possibilities with a test (if possible) to find those with a genuine talent who should get instruction. Move Potions out of the dungeons and light and ventilate the place properly (the lighting and ventilation conditions may mostly be fanon, but if not, it should be fixed). Vet the teachers better. Update Muggle Studies with an emphasis on cameras. If there are educational standards, enforce them; if there aren't any, put them in place.

All that out of the way, I like the idea of adding courses like Intro to Wizarding Society, Estate Management (or some sort of financial or economic course), Household Charms (like Home Ec), Intro to Magical Law (aka political science or Civics). Arts/Humanities classes like Literature or Magical Painting. Alchemy for the advanced students. Some physical ed classes. I feel as though something medical would not be amiss, although I'm not sure what exactly.

Some basic seminars might be helpful. How to use the library properly, for example; I know there were one-shot classes in both my high school and college that did that. How to write with a quill--that could be part of the Into to the Wizarding World. Tutors to bring under or disadvantaged students up to snuff (reading, etc) as well as providing help in other things like classes or how to write an essay. [how many essays do you think homeschooled kids like the Weasleys wrote? And why would Muggle standards be the same as Hogwarts'? Sounds like more than half could use this.] Sex ed? Covering relevant potions, spells, how to say No, and how to identify magical threats like succubi (if they exist).

Didn't mean for this to be so long; started typing and it all just /flowed/!

*** And an orientation! Are the teachers not tired of first years arriving late (or never arriving at all) to class? It's ridiculous how they're just expected to figure out everything for themselves. Like, are there even signs?

I'd also add more inter-house common areas. The common rooms are fine if your friends are in your house, but it doesn't seem like students from other houses are allowed in?? Like, there's the library but you can't talk or else you'll get kicked out by Madam Pince (if she's still alive). There's also the Great Hall, but that's not nearly as cozy.

And it'd be cool to have a place where students can get food at all times. Like a snack cart or something?

*** There's a part in OOTP where it says Umbridge sits in on all of Trelawney's (or maybe Hagrid's) classes, and my first thought was "there is absolutely no way she sits in on even half of them." DADA is never shown to be a double class, so that's 4x5=20 classes for just first through fifth years, plus however they do 6th/7th, and then she goes to /all/ of someone else's classes? Way too many classes are one house only, there's /no/ way things don't get absolutely out of control if they try to cover for a sick teacher for a couple days.

** “Muggle Studies”, would become compulsory for the first two-three years, and I'd change it to “History and Traditions of the Non-Magical World”---although I suppose Muggle Studies is a sufficient enough name, I rather dislike the word Muggle. It would teach students basic history and traditions of the Non-Wizarding world, how to use Muggle writing instruments, basics maths etc. and if you continue it past year three it teaches you things like how to get a higher education in the Muggle world, job applications etc, etc.

And on the other side of the spectrum I'd make a compulsory course for years two-three for “Introduction and Traditions of the Wizarding World”, or something similar to that name I suppose. It would teach students things like how to use and care for quills, ink, etc, etc. along with any traditions that are commonly seen in the Wizarding World---whatever those may be. It would introduce students to all the basics so everyone's on the same page and no one is left feeling clueless.

Edit: I'd also remove Divination, and for those who show talent/promise towards it would get something of a tutor of sorts. I suppose like a one-on-one apprenticeship, or however many show promise.

** A dueling elective. Magical theory classes (if hogwarts really is one of the best schools then I'm assuming they have university level courses for the upper years). Healing classes. Wizarding world art and culture (ie how to charm paintings, painting history, etc). A home ec class, where you learn basic household charms like sewing, cooking, cleaning, hair cutting, etc that wouldn't fit in the charm curriculum.

And definitely more clubs/extracurricular, especially since it's a boarding school. Fashion design club? Maybe intramural football for muggleborns or something like a transfiguration competition. Definitely theater! England is famous for its theater. Can you imagine what magical special effects would be like?

Casting of magic above a certain level outside pre-approved areas will carry serious consequences. Potions use on another will have serious consequences. The use of a mild truth potion will be allowed, it should be a potion that makes it impossible to lie, but you don't have to answer. Mind magics will be prohibited, and punished harshly unless appropiate permissions are given. That's all I got right now.

** The first thing that I would do is to hire more staff. How the school operates in the canon is really unrealistic. There are just fifteen teachers for a school that has over seven hundred students. Really, I'd have more assistant professors on the Hogwarts staff that would be able to manage the education for the lower years( Perhaps 1-3).

Secondly, the classes for the lower years(Years 1-5) are organised as two houses of the same year together at a time. If we calculate it for the first year, the children would have the following classes:

1. Transfiguration
2. Potions
3. Charms
4. DADA
5. Herbology
6. Astronomy(Wednesday Nights Maybe)
7. Flying lessons

The time table should be made in a way so that the courses can be completed satisfactorily within the time of an academic year. In these classes, I'd add introductory classes to both the wizarding world and the muggle world, which would then form the basis of the muggle studies course as [[/u/Mishcl][u/Mishcl]] said. I'd also expand the muggle studies course to be a kind of an accumulation of joint courses offered by various schools such as Eton along with Hogwarts.

Then there are other electives, which I'd want for all the third years to have a trial class so that they can understand what they would be getting into. These electives will also be used to give the students a better specialization.

Removing Divination wouldn't do much. There are forms of divining such as tarot card reading and tea leaves which while being extremely vague would be useful.

More clubs, definitely.

Also, along with the trial classes, the students would be given a list of professions that require an education in the subject, so that they can choose wisely. The students would also have the option of having extra classes during their sixth and seventh year to learn another elective if they suddenly want to change their path. Career counselling will happen every year from the third year onwards.

The higher years( i.e., 6 and 7) would have more specialized classes and projects. It would also be emphasized upon them to form connections, and many times they'd have guest lecturers and scouts invited to the school so that they can both provide for information and to find capable candidates for things such as apprenticeship or auror training.

Edit: Forgot about it the first time, History of Magic should be an actual course, not a place for students to sleep. We learn many things from history. It is a testament to our lives today.

** For one week (probably the same one as OWLs and NEWTs) regular second year classes are canceled and instead second years take all the electives. One week isn't a lot for studying an elective subject, but it can cover:

- What the subject even is (I don't think Harry found this out about arithmancy until later)
- Why it's useful
- Why it's interesting
- Some very basics that every Hogwarts graduate ought to know so they don't embarrass themselves
- For each student, whether they're likely to be good at it

After this, each student meets with their head of house to discuss which electives they want to take. They discuss careers, mostly from a keeping-options-open perspective. They also discuss total workload (some students will try to over-exert themselves, others to under-exert -- both need to be reined in).

At the end of the discussion the student picks subjects.

No more getting cut off from careers because of your 12-year-old self's "closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list".

** It seems like everyone covered the courses and classes but one thing no one mentioned is the fucking moving stairs. It seems so inconvenient to be heading to class but the staircase starts moving so you have to go the long way around and now you're 25mins late to charms. So yeah get rid of those maybe have magical escalators instead?

Get rid of peeves or give him an actual job like being a ghostly guard that looks out for students past curfew instead of being a general hazard to students. On the subject of ghosts Binns needs to go and update the course since it seems like Binns hasn't changed anything.

I read this fic where the houses have combined common rooms so there's the Slytherdor, Griffinclaw, etc. anyone can go into those common rooms doesn't just have to be the two houses and each room has it's own thing. You're allowed to stay up past curfew while in those rooms too.

Include more sports like quidditch is fine but seriously wizards need some variety. Like what about broom racing and people are able to modify their brooms to go faster (limited to professional racers only though). Also you can't tell me muggleborns and halfbloods dont play muggle sports like c'mon you're telling no one in Hogwarts has ever said "Hey does anyone want to play some football?"

There needs to be more modes of magical transportation especially for underage wizards. All brooms should come with a "cloak mode" that makes them invisible when activated that way people can fly without worrying about being seen.

Feild trips should definitely be a thing where they are able to go to prominent magical places. Career day should be a thing how can anyone chose a career when they dont know their options?

More wizard holidays there's Yule but I dont remeber if there was anything else. Merlin seems to be pretty important so why not have a holiday around him? There has to be /some/ major events in wizard history that would have holidays around them.

A better fucking government. There should be a magical CPS cause it seems like wizarding families dont know what "child endangerment" means and of course so that magical children don't become obscurals (spelling?) duh. Some sort of goverment financial aid as well, muggleborns and poor wizarding families could benefit from that. How are muggleborns paying for things when they dont have wizard money or they might not have enough so yeah finacial aid.

Magical kids should be able to practice over the summer maybe some sort of summer camp? It would gives those that failed a class the chance to make it up and those that want to get in more practice or stay a bit ahead would be able to. (I imagine Harry would go to get away from the Dursleys and Hermione would go to get ahead)

This one is very simple and its give first years a map of the school you dumbfucks one the first things Harry and Ron did was get lost getting to class. The Muardurs (spelling?) managed to do it so why cant you oh great headmaster? The map could be like the minecraft map where it tells you where you are and points in the direction you're facing. Boom no more children accidentally wondering into potentially dangerous areas.

There should be a student body government I know there's Perfects and Headboys/girls but they mostly deal with their own houses. Plus more house unity yay.

Dont house dangerous objects that Dark Lords want to get their hands on in a school full of children (looking at you Dumbledore safest place my ass)

Substitute teachers. If an applicant doesnt get the job but their resume and credentials are good they can be called in to substitute for that class.

The school should have more events once the allure of magic wears off it seems kinda boring. Like no prom for 7th years? what a drag.

There should be a study group with teachers and perfects present to help those struggling.

There should be some sort of snack bar. There has to be situations where a student doesnt wake up on time so they miss breakfast or if someone is just thirsty then what? Wait until dinner? No

I mostly focused on more social issues and general incovinces since most people already talked about classes and courses.

*** There's an unfinished fic where Harry got some extra tuition over the summer (post 4th year IIRC) and made these maps for Gryffindor first years. Based on the Marauders Map, it showed all the public spaces and the best route to get there, plus would add places as the student went there. As soon as a student got one, it would be keyed to them. Gryffindor because Harry knew that House. Flitwick saw one and got very excited, because of the charms work as well as the concept itself; Harry gave him an unkeyed one and told him how to adjust for Ravenclaw. Don't know if he gave one to Sprout and Snape wouldn't ask Potter to spit on him if he was on fire.

You would think if a group of students could figure out how to tie something like that into the magic/wards of the school, a headmaster could as well. I suppose it can be chalked up to the Wizarding World's notion of "if it works, no need to improve." If a thousand years of students managed to get around without extra guidance, then it's fine.

** The two easiest changes would be to bring muggle studies up to the current technology and have a wizarding culture class for all muggle born and muggle raised to be better informed about the wizarding world that they have joined.

Then maybe add a chemistry course since it also involves precise measurements and handling of ingredients just like potions. Update astronomy with the latest telescopes etc (assuming that the brass magical ones aren't as "good" (since canon implies but never states that)).

Then add other muggle courses so that muggleborns and muggle raised (and any other magical) could continue a muggle education.

** Minor houses, as suggested by The Rupert in Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy: you get sorted into your main house, and then your secondary house based on your other personality traits. Like Hermione would be a Gryffindor major with a ravenclaw minor. sleep in whatever dorm you want eat at whatever table you want. reduces house rivalry/bullying and overall us/them mentality in the wizarding world.

*** Definitely gonna have more inter house friendships/interactions. I won't have minor houses cause I don't wanna change those though that's a good idea. I'm gonna have it so every house has a common room but you can hang out in whichever one you want and you can eat at whatever table cause separating the tables is just dumb.

** Abolish Slytherin and resort its students into other Houses.

It really should be obvious why the following is a recipe for disaster:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and self-aggrandisement over other things.
2. Teach them that these are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be xenophobic /in his own time/.
4. Appoint heads of house who are alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries.
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

But, apparently, people insist on following it because tradition, or something.
