#+TITLE: Peggy Sue!Harry tells Voldemort the whole truth during their final showdown, in front of thousands of witnesses. His attempt at over-dramatization does not go as planned, and he is carted off to the DoM right after beating Voldemort to get looked at by the ever-so-curious Unspeakables.

*** Harry could've been captured by the Death Eaters and tortured for information on the location of the Elder Wand after he blabbed about it to everyone. The Order and the Ministry forces suffered severe casualties in comparison to the Death Eaters

Order/Ministry casualties in second war.

- Snape, Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Scrimgeour, Moody, Emmeline Vance, Amelia Bones.

- An unknown number of Aurors were killed, given that Rowling wrote that Harry and Ron were allowed to join the Auror Department due to severe losses.

Confirmed Death Eater casualties

- Voldemort, Bellatrix, Peter.

- Given that Rowling wrote that the Malfoy's avoided Azkaban due to them pulling a Karkaroff and giving up information, we can believe that a significant amount of Death Eaters survived given that no other deaths are accounted for.

Harry either gets tortured for information or the remaining Death Eaters kidnap Ron/Hermione/any Hogwarts student to use as leverage for negotiation to the weakened Ministry.

** ‚ÄúInteresting! His blood contains both basilisk venom and Phoenix tears? His body will be extremely durable, now we can perform /much/ more invasive tests!‚Äù

Harry groans around the gag in his mouth, tears leaking from his eyes as the Head Unspeakable meticulously jabs and prods his exposed organs.

*** Experiment #371: Subject was successfully transfigured into a levitation charm and proceeded to levitate a feather to a height of 3.1m (ceiling height). Reverse-transfiguration resulted in a dead body. Fortunately, after being brought in proximity to artifact #3171 (cloak), #3172 (wand of elder), and #3173 (stone), subject revived itself.

***** I would if I could actually write decently without it being like, a huge long line of text with a ton of commas and like two periods or something, for some reason I find it ridiculously easy to make a long box of text, NOT TO MENTION that all the text would be a disjointed story that no one would get because the side plots probably wouldn't have been written and would only be in my head, sooo, no I wont write it, Sorry.
