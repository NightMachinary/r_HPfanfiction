I heard a lot of good things about this fanfic. I want to read it, but I'm kinda terrified I won't like it and wasted my time with it. Also, des it have slash, or anything else I should be wary of?


** I think Basilisk-Born is the best Lordship/ Power trip story fanfic (which, to be honest, does not set the bar very high). The fic is far from perfect and has its own defaults that have already been said, but I think its best quality is that Harry powers are, for once, explained.

Harry isn't the Lord of several Houses because Gringott's will said so, but because>! he is a 2000+ years old immortal who met a lot of people and created most of these Houses!<. He isn't a legal expert because you can learn everything about law in one summer with some books, but because he has been a "politician" for centuries, and helped writting most of the laws he talks about. He isn't a friend of the Goblins because he recognised one of them and told him hello, but because he really gave them a big help in the past.

If you like the Lordship, Political and Power Trip tropes, you should have a good time reading it. If you hate them, reading it should just be a bit less painfull experience that other fics using these tropes.

PS: Hidden the spoils since you didn't read the fic, and also there is no Slash, MPreg, ABO or anything like that in the fic (at least until now but I doubt he would either add them).

** I've tried reading it several times before due to a premise similar to that of A Long Journey Home, but only recently have been able to read more than a couple chapters and catch up.

The fic is divided into two separate storylines: the past, which covers Harry being sent back in time until he returns to when he was sent back all while living in a teenage body, and the present, which covers the actions of a Harry who has lived all that time during 5th year.

The start is pretty boring. "Harry trying to blend in at Grimmauld Place" isnt very interesting, and neither is "Harry being a confused outsider in early times".

In my personal opinion, the "present" is a lot less interesting than the "past". Theres a lot of boring melodrama between Harry and his friends, and a lot of Harry's action are just build up to other things that dont happen for a long time. Recently, the present has been getting more interesting, mainly because Harry has stopped making vague references to his "plan" and started executing it.

The past also has quite a few issues. Theres a lot of pureblood tradition shit that's very boring to read through at the start, but that boring stuff is also some of the more important stuff plotwise. The author also makes Harry very OP to connect him with Merlin, Arthur, the Founders, etc. but then does a bullshit resetting of Harry's power and age. Theres also the fact that a lot of story elements repeat. Theres almost always a part where someone is like "That kid is a liar/wrong because he is a kid" and Harry is like "haha no".

I do prefer reading the past, mainly because things actually happen; past chapters generally cover months or years of activity at a time, and you get the sense that the world is actively changing whenever Harry takes a quick step away from society. Contrastingly, the present feels like a slog to read through, with chapters only covering days or weeks, or a couple of hours at times.

Theres also a fuckton of wizarding politics.

Overall, Basilisk-born is pretty fun, but I'm still not sure if reading 15 chapters or so to get to anything interesting just to decide whether or not you want to continue is worth.

** I really don't understand the popularity of this fic, I hate it. Not only is essentially half the fic a backstory, it's a backstory in which time travel can't change the past. Beyond that it seems to try and hit every boring contrivance it can. Harry is related to Merlin oh and Arthur and Morgana too! He taught Modred! He owns Hogwarts which is Camelot! He's also Slytherin and not prejudiced! And he and the other founders were tots cool and related! And he's a legal expert! He has all types of ancient magic! He's adopted by goblins! He's a healer but a special super rare type! All the lordships! It was kinda ridiculous.

*** Dropping into Merlins lap is plot armor but what story especially fanfic doesn't have that Arthur and Morgana make sense in the plot. Slytherin being prejudiced true but A: It Is an AU ad fanFICTION B: history always gets distorted. As for legal expert he's a century-old politician. Hed know the law. Being a family ad starting a school makes 100% sense. In that time not a lot of people depend on non-family or lieges for stuff. He's not an adopted goblin and respect does equal friendship. Its for acts he has done. Heler point but it's unique and well executed.

Its also in a niche genre where the comparisons are either not active or sucks worse.

** it's an attempt at subverting all those harry potter is powerful tropes. harry tends to be the central figure in every bit of conjured up history and does abit of magic to resolve it. then he explains all the context and history to himself or occasionally someone else.

*** I read the first two chapters... I posted this thread right after Harry was complaining about not having a wizard name... that really gave me reservations about reading.

I think I'll pass on this fanfic.

** I tried to read it and got maybe 10 chapters in but I had to quit due to the spelling errors. It says "locked" instead of "locket", and "sighted" instead of "sighed", little things like that, but frequently and repeatedly. It was the death of a thousand paper cuts.

** The first impression of this fix was that it had a great concept, but a horrible execution.

A few chapters in, we go to the past timeline, in which we learn stuff that only just now influences the present.

This repeats on/off for the rest of the fic.

If you have the patience for this and tropes in general, it's a good read. Otherwise, you're in for a few hours of aggravation and skipping through chapters.

** I think it's a great fic especially if you get into latter parts. The war against Grindelwald and the cause of Harry's animosity towards Dumbledore is excellently explained. Characters like Moody and Sirius get their own arcs. You can skip the Merlin era chapters like I did but as you get into the latter chapters the story gets interesting and the writing gets better.

** It's a great fic overall, however take in mind that the reason why Dumbledore never faced Grindelwald before was because of a bood pact they made, which would kill the one who broke the pact. (the pact was that neither of the would fight each other, and this was later broken by Newt Scamander).

Also, Harry in this fic, although is nearly a thousand years old, still has the mentality of a teenager. He believes that Dumbledore is a meddling old fool. Now, don't take me wrong, but Dumbledore holds so many titles and power over the Wizarding world, that it is natural to do so. How good would it do, if a major political personality dropped all his secrets out in the open. People believe that he used Harry Potter as a way to kill Voldemort, but in reality he really hated to do so, but it was either that or sacrificing the numerous lives of magical Britain and other Magical Community. Not to forget that he still tried to give Harry a chance, by not giving Harry to Voldemort and finishing Voldemort later, and by giving the discrete hint of the Deathly Hallows to Harry, even if we accept that he had tried to end the loyalty of the Elder Wand by taking it to Death with himself.

I think the fic is a good one, considering it was written a decade ago, but if we add in the new facts and theories that Rowling introduced since then, it doesn't really sum up. However if you like reading a fic with Dumbledore bashing and all powerful Harry, which has a deep running storyline and plot go for it.

*** I mean it says at one point he doesn't age and this includes his mind in the sense he'll always have a 15 year olds brain while he's in the past, so that he's like that makes sense from within the narrative. He still is a teenager mentally just one with a lot of experience.

#+end_quote

They acknowledge that in-universe. He cannot physically age, which includes his brain being underdeveloped and perpetually suck in puberty.

So while he has centuries worth of memories and experiences as an adult, he is perpetually stuck as a teenager at the same time.

**** That is what I was trying to point out there. Even if Harry lives for such a long time, he still can only mature as much as a teenager can and views the world through that Point of view only. Guess I could have worded it better.
