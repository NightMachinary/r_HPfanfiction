I'm looking for a specific fanfic in which harry is really talented at magic. I don't remember all the specifics, but the one thing about it that stuck out to me was that dumbledore asked harry to do an introduction for hogwarts during the triwizard tournament when all the other schools were doing there introductions. If i can remember anymore details about it ill update this post, but right now that's all i really have in terms of information. thanks.


** It was good the first time I read it, second time not so much. But I do like this better than the one by Sage Ra, Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power, even though that one is finished. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elemental Changes)

*** Who is that Rachel Owen character...

I smell self-insert, but I'm not sure.

**** Either that or someone who the author is familiar with. So ... maybe?

***** Its just weird, tbh.

I mean, the story is not good. But that Rachel is just /there/. Eventually it turns out she is a fire elemental - stated as if the reader just knows what that means - and all she does is show how awesome Harry is.

The whole thing is really.... odd. Bad odd.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

** Did the fic contain Draco trying to kill his father? I vaguely remember something like that.
