I'd love one where there's adventure or world building, but I'd even take fluff over all the weepy stories I keep finding. I get that the war was damaging, but I really don't enjoy stories where I spend hours reading about grief and ptsd..

Most of their fics are militaristic in some way, sometimes muggle wanky, have extensively headcanoned Europe, etc. Just a completely different tone from the actual Harry Potter stories.

  This story follows the Battle of Hogwarts and considers how the main characters might have moved forward from those harrowing times. They embark on a journey of friendship, healing, relationship, and growth toward the Deathly Hallows epilog scene nineteen years later.

** Here's a fluffier Dramione post-war fic. Admittedly, it's also a "secret pureblood Hermione" fic, but it at least doesn't have her go down the path of forgetting that she was raised by muggles in this one. If you do like Dramione, Colubrina is an excellent author for that (one of the few authors I actually enjoy reading Dramione fics by). linkffn(11149377)

The Sum of their Parts is a fairly classic and believable rise of Dark Lord Potter. And I mean that when I say you see the rise of Harry becoming a dark lord, because you see very few of the actual effects beyond what's implied. linkffn(11858167)

Here's a currently unfinished fic where Harry becomes the DADA teacher after trying to be an auror for a few years and realizing it doesn't make him happy. He's working on mending the Gryffindor/Slytherin rift and also trying to mentor a muggleborn student who doesn't want to be at Hogwarts. linkao3(15813657)

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

Political Drama between Hermione and Neville, after they won the war they can't agree on how the country should be run. Neville wants a return to the old, pre-Voldemort system while Hermione wants to completely replace the system with a muggle style democracy.

**** I felt the same way when I read that one. I like how the author writes characters that do frustrating things w good intentions. Amelia Bones was written like that in Divided and Entwined (same author.)

***** She's not as sympathetic in that as Neville is in this tbh. Her failure to appreciate that the muggleborns were already being murdered by her aurors in cold blood with the information available to her requires some pretty willful ignorance.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.
