At the end of book 4, with Fudge refusing to accept that Voldemort has returned, Dumbledore remembers that he has a lot of political influence and finds a way to circumvent Fudge and get the truth out. He has Harry testify to Voldemort's return in a secret deposition conducted by the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, and he arranges for Harry to give an interview to the /Quibbler/ about what really happened at the cemetery and who was there when Cedric died.
