  Boredom can actually make people do very weird things, really. After who knows how long of feeling so numb, waking up as Tom Riddle is going to change things. Fate really does have a weird sense of humor. Harry reincarnated as Tom Riddle, Dark Lord Harry

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** Really loved this one. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113639]])

Also, if you haven't read the author's fics before, I'd suggest browsing through the profile. One of my favorite authors of all time. It's a pity she got hate-bombed away from writing as much as she used to.

EDIT: Upon further thought, this might not /exactly/ fit what you asked for, but it seems very close.
