** Not a fan of this method, to be honest. For you to be able to churn out a chapter every 2-3 days of readable quality would restrict you to an upper limit of 3000 words (unless you're one of those rare writing machine authors). More realistically, 1-2k words.

Now I suppose you could run this as a sort of "Quest" type story that's popular over at SV/SB, but even then, you'd need more time than 2-3 days if you wanted to make it decent. The fact that you need to take into account other people's input in that short amount of time only makes this harder for you, time-wise.

*** I think Quests actually update faster than 2-3 days, or at least most of them.

** I would recommend that you go to spacebattles or sufficientvelocity and check their quest sub-forums. That seem to be more or less what you intend to do, but short updates are rarely of much interest. People like decently-sized updates with good character interaction and so on.

** You can make it into a quest. They're pretty popular in some fandom's right now, but they take a lot of effort to get a decent end product.

** I'm kind of doing this at [[/r/magicmuggle]]. Weekly or bi-weekly chapters, then I see the readers feedback and take that on board. Not quite what you're describing, but fairly similar.
