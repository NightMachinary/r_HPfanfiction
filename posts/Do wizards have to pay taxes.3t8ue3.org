*** I figured that the Malfoys (among others) could do a decent job of funding the government unless all of their money went straight into Fudge's pockets.

**** Isn't that considered like... extremely high-scale corruption though? The government getting /all/ its money from a select few "donors"? (Might as well be called a plutocracy at that point). What would Malfoy (or someone like him) be getting in return for funding the government? Whatever it is, it can't be good -- or fair.

** Rowling tweeted that Hogwarts has no fees (outside shopping list), so it's a good bet that it's Ministry funded via taxes.

** Taxes were established long before the Magical World split off, so I do think taxation was kept in Wizarding Britain.

** they tax floos and portkeys for definitely; that's why the ministry controls it. i would guess 60% or more wizard are too crap too do most magic. jobs probably involve learning a single set of high level spells, and so business continues on like normal. most cannon wizards barely do magic, and harry is a genius at defence because he can actually do all the standard spells.. wizards are rubbish at magic, yo.

*** From what we've seen in canon (most adult wizards can't cast Shield Charms, Snatchers, etc.) I have to agree.

**** That reinforces the headcanon that Hogwarts/Durmstrang/Beauxbatons are the Ivy League of the Magical world. Everyone else works in trades and clerical.

** I figure they probably run off donations and asset seizure. I don't think the wizarding economy is very fluid and jobs don't pay very much. Wizards don't need to buy a whole lot, pretty much just food. This goes quite a way toward explaining away some of the inconsistency in Rowlings pricing.

*** Do we have a definitive source on wizarding income? The most I can remember from canon is the starting salary for Hit Wizards (700 Galleons a month, which is considerably above average for Muggles at Â£42,000 p/a). There was also Dobby's Galleon-a-week wage, but that doesn't really count.

**** That isn't canon. Salaries are never mentioned except in abstract. However we know that wands cost 7 galleons which is about 35 pounds. Yet Harry spends a similar amount on, an albeit large, amount of sweets.

***** You also got to remember a lot of the places we see prices for things are places where the normal price is usually inflated.

Getting food and especially candy on a train is usually not a good idea due to inflation. It's like getting concessions at a movie theater.

The Butterbeer? Hogsmeade is basically a tourist trap, it's the only place most students can buy things from, so the town itself could put whatever price they please.

This kind of a problem if you want to get an idea of the economy of Harry Potter. What little information you have on products are places where mark ups would regularly occur, and what families we regarding the subject of Finance are the Weasleys, who have a total of nine people to take care of with only one income, yearly schools supplies, whatever resources it takes for upkeep on the property, Arthur's rather expensive sounding hobby of fiddling with anything Muggle related /(including a car, which can't be cheap.)/ All this accumulating to the question of if the Weasley's are actually smart with their finances, considering they Arthur's aforementioned hobby and the fact that they spent the money they gained from what was essentially the lottery /(The Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw)/ on a vacation to Egypt instead of using it buy better school supplies or clothes.

** It seems like a good portion of the wizarding world works in the Ministry of Magic, and I'm not sure the population that Wizarding Britain seems to have could really support it as written.

I thought about this and concluded they mostly fund the MoM from the muggle government somehow. They are a part of the government so maybe it's budgeted in. The muggles that are in the know might be willing to pay to keep magicals under control.

In the USA at least it might explain those thousand-dollar toilet seats in the defense budget.

If I had to guess I'd say that there's taxes on goods, and possibly property taxes, but no income taxes.
