Would Harry go to Dumbledore or McGonagall for lessons to protect himself from the Dementors, since Lupin isn't there?

Can be any kind of changes, maybe Lupin is the History Professor, maybe Lupin is the Care of Magical Creatures Professor instead, or just anything. What could happen with Sirius and Umbridge happening in the same year, or Remus being involved in the story in a different way? Since the Ministry was for Dumbledore and Harry in Harry's third year, maybe Umbridge is more supportive entirely? You can go nuts with this.

If Remus was in the story in a different way in third year, would Umbridge let her hatred of Werewolves and creatures show? What would the characters do about it?

Edit: Snape hates Remus, Umbridge has her prejudice against magical creatures, plus Sirius who was suppose to be someone he trusted is "supposedly" coming to attack, capture or kill Harry. Would Remus snap? Everyone has a breaking point after all. (This is just one part of an idea that could happen, something else could happen entirely).

IIRC, him being a werewolf wasn't public knowledge until the end of third year.

***** Yeah, you can have her find out in pretty much any way sense it's fanfiction, not canon.

And as I said, that was just one possible plot point that you could bring up in this AU.

** I wonder if she wouldn't start suspecting there was something wrong with Remus. Even in peace time, people aren't exactly fond of werewolves. I wonder how much time it would take for her to guess what is going on. The fact that it just seems too unbelievable that a werewolf would work at a school is an advantage. And if she does figure it out, Dumbledore is unlikely to defend Remus. I wonder what she'd teach the kids in this scenario.
