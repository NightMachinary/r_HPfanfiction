  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

That's the one where "blood magic" turns out to be as simple as just injecting someone's blood into yourself and you get their unique abilities... but the wizarding world doesn't know about blood types so most blood magic results in the recipient horribly dying thanks to type incompatibility, right?

**** The actual title is [[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], commonly known as HPMOR. It's a very 'look at how smart I am' fic, and it definitely seems the author was trying to prove something; but there is a not-insignificant amount of people that like HPMOR, even though it's gotten pretty infamous at this point, so I'd suggest giving it a try anyway. You might end up liking it.

******** All right, I'll bite. There are things to like about HPMOR. It's fun, outright funny in places and decent written. It's undeniably ambitious and cleverly plotted. It references some interesting concepts (although I'm told the science isn't always right).

But. It is a terrible example of 'science'. Throughout the story, Harry doesn't actually show any scientific thinking. He sees a problem, has a stroke of genius, and solves it. That is the inductive thinking of Aristotle, not the deductive (scientific) thinking of Francis Bacon.

The author is well aware of what the scientific method actually (and tells the reader so at length). The reason we never see it in action is because, well... science makes for bad storytelling. Readers like to see clever protagonists jumping from scene to scene, not scientists repeating the same thing over and over to get p < 0.05.
