Looking for fics where someone besides Harry travels back into the past and messes with the timeline or just does things differently. For example future Draco ends up back in his first year and decides to do things different. Could also be considered a prompt I guess. Preferably no Ron bashing.

**** If you're actually interested in the ship (most aren't) I'll see if I can dig up a few of the better ones.

Mind you, I'm not proud to say I read it---but it's an occasional guilty pleasure, and there's a few fics that are real gems.

** The Draco Does it all Again series covers this. There are three completed stories for their first three years at Hogwarts, and story four is being regularly updated.

  Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. First step: befriend Potter.

  All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.
