Mostly what it sounds like He didn't get sent to Azkaban and is either the main character or a very important character in the fic.

It can be that he was the secret keeper all along and so Lilly and James were never betrayed( I've read Promises Unbroken but thats the only one I've read with that premise), or it can be that he just didnt get the chance to go after Peter, like maybe Remus stopped him or something.

I'm good with m/m m/f or f/f for the ships. Gen fic is fine.

I do like ones that has alot of focus on Sirius and Remus.

I like plotty fics but if its more focused on Just exploring Sirius's character im fine too.

I do want it to be a decently happy ending for Sirius. Aka him not dying and being mostly not miserable by the end.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

Here's the rub. This scenario can turn out to be a lot more horrible than canon if Pettigrew is still the traitor. All he has to do is to lead Voldemort to Sirius (in canon, Sirius knew where Pettigrew was hiding). If Voldemort succeeds in killing Sirius, which is highly likely, the flaw in the Fidelius Charm comes into play. Everyone who knew the secret becomes the Secret Keeper, /including Pettigrew/. The Potters still die, Voldemort still falls in the same way, but Sirius is dead and Pettigrew remains free, his treachery unknown.

The only way I could see the Potters survive is if Sirius manages to escape Voldemort somehow or if he manages to warn the Potters via Patronus and they evacuate.

** I only just found this fic so I am unsure what criteria it meets other than Sirius is stopped from attacking Peter. I remembered your post and decided to recommend it. Quality wise chapter one seems decent, but YMMV.
