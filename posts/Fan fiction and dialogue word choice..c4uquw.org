I have been reading fan fiction for quite some time now. I absolutely love exploring peoples reimagining of the Potterverse. It's amazing. However, I have one small pet peeve when it comes to writing dialogue: word choice that doesn't fit the character.

Let's look at some lines said by multiple characters. Notice how the word choice can evoke the voice of each character in your head without a vocal description.

"Go get your stuff," said Ron. "Go gather your things, dear," said Molly.

You can hear the difference in your head right?

How about two lines by the same voice. Which of these sounds more like Dumbledore?

"I will figure out what to do," said Dumbledore. "I shall determine the best course of action," said Dumbledore.

A little over the top but you get my point.

Last example is a goblin but isn't exclusive to them.

"Fine, do what you want," said Griphook. "Very well, do as you will," said Griphook.

There is a difference in tone that can be evoked by word choice. Make your dialogue smooth and readable but don't forget that each character sounds different, regardless of it being written.


** In one of my fics, I cowardly sent Hagrid to France just to avoid writing his dialogue.

My pet peeve is house elf-speak. Not every elf speaks like Dobby, and even Dobby himself has better grammar than many authors think. And Kreacher is actually rather outspoken:

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄúKreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master's house,‚Äù said the elf, then muttered very fast, ‚ÄúMistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries it's been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it---‚Äù

*** People don't seem to realise is that the only difference between the way elves speak and everyone else is that elves seem to have no understanding of first or second person pronouns. They always speak in third person. Dobby isn't just a more excitable version of Gollum

**** And even first person isn't totally alien to them, though it varies depending on the elf. The three elves we get to know have different ways of speaking.

Kreacher always speaks in third person, and very seldom uses second person; he'll refer to both himself and the person he is talking to in third person. But his grammar is good.

Dobby MOSTLY speaks in third person but will occasionally say "I," or "me/my, " and he's far more likely than Kreacher to say "you." His grammar is less perfect than Kreacher's, but it's mostly because he always uses third person verbs, like "you is" or "you doesn't." He also sometimes, but not always, says "'tis" instead of "it is."

Winky actually says "I" quite often... She uses third person a lot less than the other two, but like Dobby she always uses third person verbs, like "I is" or more often "I is being." A unique quirk of Winky is that she inserts a lot of "-ing" words in her speech... "Winky is being," "you is saying," and so on. Weirdly enough, lots of fanfic authors give this quirk to ALL the elves, but in canon only Winky says it.

Say what you will about JKR's writing, but she's good at giving her characters their own style of speaking.

**** True. Probably because the only reason for the elves to exist in most fics is to happily serve their master, and admitting that some of them can be just as (if not more) eloquent as humans they serve would bring uncomfortable realisation that house elves are people too and maybe Hermione was right about them, even if she went about it the wrong way.

****** BTW, could you recommend some of these? I know only about:

- [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC]] , and
- linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian) ... lovely but a one-shot, which is obviously just tool for explaining contemporary stories
- one more about some Ollivander's ancestor in Greece?

But that's it. I am still hoping for that Harry Potter x Golden Ass crossover.

  The year is CE 476. Cenau Redhair is a very long way from home, and she's in prison. While she doesn't want to die in front of the crowds at the Flavian Amphitheatre, escape seems impossible. Does her friend Rhea the falcon have a plan? This is a story of the early days of magic, long before the founders.

**** It also seems that the usage of "will be [verb]ing" is slightly different, and slightly more common, in the Elvish dialect compared to Wizard English (which, of course, isn't /quite/ Muggle English either, though the differences are more subtle). But it's not universal in the way some authors apply it; it's just a construction that they use more readily and more naturally than us humans.

**** I'm so glad you mentioned that. When I first started to read fanon!Dobby I was really confused at his lack of English ability, because I had only remembered him using 'sir' excessively. I had to reread his sections of CoS to make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. After rereading CoS, I was like: "okay he's not perfect with English, but canon!Dobby is way better at English than fanfic authors give him credit for."

Hah, yes. For years I have avoided writing Hagrid in any meaningful role just to avoid having to write his dialogue. But I've finally faced my dialogue-boggart with the latest chapter of Victoria Potter.

In the process, I came up with this handy guide to writing Hagrid's speech:
