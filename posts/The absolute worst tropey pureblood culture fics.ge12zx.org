** I made it about halfway into the first chapter before it got too annoying

Linkffn(king of magic) (I'm sorry for linking this)

The fact that Harry just accepts it immediately and becomes the perfect pureblood noble in minutes is quite disturbing and not fun to read, (the first chapter details everything he owns and I think all his betrothal contracts..

I just took a look at this. The sheer length of the list leads me to question the possibility of Harry discovering all of this as I doubt Gringotts has a long enough roll of parchment!

**** That's the one with the castration curse. It doesn't really remove it, just makes you wish it did. It's like cruicio. But for dicks and buttholes. And requires an extensive handjob scene. Between brothers.

Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!
