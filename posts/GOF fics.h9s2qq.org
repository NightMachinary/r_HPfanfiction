I am in the mood for GOF fics preferably AU but I will take whatever as long it's not crack My only stipulations are: no fem Harry, if there is any romance it has to be good, no slash involving MC ( I don't care if wolf star is there in the background or Ron is hooking up with dean or whatever just so long as the Mc is not involved it's fine), no bashing, NO CRACK

**** That author makes such likeable OCs and is a great writer, but i had to give up the story. He allows so much to happen 'off screen', while chapter after chapter Harry reads, studies, is tutored, etc. At first, I thought 'okay, maybe writing action isn't his forte', but then there was that epic battle with the acromantula, and I realized he was capable of amazing action scenes and choosing not to show them.

Had to drop it, because it was too frustrating to read how Harry comes out of the Chamber every day to get updated about all the exciting things that happened while he was jerking off with his mini-dragon... ðŸ™„

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. The story contains detailed magic, politics, social situations and complicated motivations. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** This one definitely fits the criteria of being an AU. The canon divergence being that Remus remembers to take his Wolfsbane potion, so no time-turner, Buckbeak dies, and Pettigrew goes to Azkaban. Harry isn't a Triwizard champion, so that means the Tournament doesn't get much air time. So no Voldemort or graveyard resurrection either. It /does/ feature plenty of magical theory, Harry taking his studies seriously, and Black family lore. So if any of those things interest you, I'd recommend giving it a try.

  The magical contract made by the Goblet of Fire inadvertently sets underway events that change everything you thought you knew about the boy-who-lived. AU GOF, depressing and a bit dark.

  GOF fics preferably AU
#+end_quote

Minus the fact that it covers both 3rd and 4th year, Hogwarts Battle School meets your criteria. The AU is heavy enough that third year also has a major series of competitions too. The GOF section is really interesting and is super different than the stuff in canon or even a lot of fanfics.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
