In 2020, Harry Potter is an unspeakable success.

Over the years he has had a career, a family, everything that the "boy who survived" could wish for. The wizarding world cares little about the unrest and the cold war between Russia, America, China and Europe. Their world has always been separate from that of Muggles and this separation has always protected them. The unspeakable Potter worked until late at night, in the room of time, completely unaware of what is happening on the surface. A series of nuclear bombings devastated the entire planet, who started it doesn't matter, after all, it is the end of everything. Harry raises his head to the ceiling when a massive dust hits him. The ministry collapses, unfortunately for him, Harry is in the room of time and, for some strange reason, the sands (mixed with the work he was doing) keep him in stasis rather than making him travel through time. He will wake up 300 years later, in a world completely devastated and populated by monsters, where the inhabited areas are in constant war with each other. The magic, as Harry knows it, has forgotten. Wizards no longer use wands, the knowledge of which has long since been lost. Harry will have to be able to survive and live in this new world, to understand its rules (or non-rules). Clearly, this prompt takes inspiration from Fallout 4, you can take inspiration from the factions, situations, mutated animals of the entire Fallout saga (imagine the magical animals mutated by radiation. The mutated dragons).

I hope someone likes this idea, you can also take inspiration from other sagas. Maybe the magic is managed like the powers in "Mass Effect" (for an example rate).


** It's a cool prompt, you could also have the time magics throw Harry forward in time 300 years instead of stasis if you like.

** Kind of reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6281862/1/Firefly][Firefly]]

When they went to sleep, they hoped of a better future. But with Gaia insane and Magic as dead as his friends, Harry has no reason to stay. Escape and exist was all he had in mind when he stowed away on a ship to Pandora.

** Hmm two fics come to my mind. Both crossovers. One with Firefly : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]

And one with Star Wars : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11675231/1/Shiver-me-Timbers][Shiver me Timbers!]]

There are of course many other crossover with Star Wars and one I unfortunately don't remember the name of with Star Trek (if someone knows which one tell us).

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

  He'd slumbered in Hoth's cold embrace for millennia before being exhumed by the Alliance. Could he help them defeat the Empire? A HP SW crossover(obviously)

There is another one but Harry isn't the last (only think he is at first) called Beyond The Veil which is sadly abandoned (and I think it was near the end).

** I've started a fic like this. I had him doing a seminar at Salem when the bombs dropped, and he went into a stasis in a basement vault before waking up in the future
