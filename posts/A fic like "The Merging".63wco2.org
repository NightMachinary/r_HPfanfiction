I remember i really liked it because of its Harry (because he is training to be strong, and is it, but not overly so and Tonks, so if you have anything similar please tell me. Also the dimension travel chapter was Gold, would also be glad for similar stuff.


** as far as dimension traveling goes, it's present in a similar vein in linkffn(stages of hope). child soldier dimensions travelers end up a relatively peaceful world

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
