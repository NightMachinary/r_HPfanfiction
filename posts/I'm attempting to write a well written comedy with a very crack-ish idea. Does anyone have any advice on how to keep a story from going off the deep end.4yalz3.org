#+TITLE: I'm attempting to write a well written comedy with a very crack-ish idea. Does anyone have any advice on how to keep a story from going off the deep end?

** The thing you really need to be careful about it how you write your characters. Crack fics and crapfics typically use very one-dimensional characters.

Take Lockheart for instance. Yes, he goes on and on about fame and bullshit like that, but add some love for adventure, and have him wish that he actually was able to do all the things he wrote and you have a lot more to work with, while still keeping the basis of his character. Perhaps have him work on improving himself so that he can write a book about his own adventures?

You might want to think about adding more than one character as the point of view. The problem is, that a lot of people think that if the protagonist says or thinks something then that is automatically correct, and not just his point of view. You can either try and ignore that or add someone else that disagrees with your character to show that this isn't the case.

Do I like your idea? Short answer is no. Long answer is that I feel that there is potential funny moments in it, but a lot of things that make the premise seem stupid.

I generally don't like the OC fics where the OC has had a previous life and/or knows about this universe. What I do like are fics with OC's that are from that universe, new characters that would fit in.

If you want to go the Trump make Hogwarts great again there really is a very good character to work with: Draco Malfoy. It's basically what his father and him are harping on about. If you then want to add the Diary you might have Draco steal the book from his father before he gives it away because his new best friend convinces him it's a good idea? Perhaps exchange it for a fake, and thereby Ginny Weasley just receiving a free book and nothing else.

*** Off topic but your potential characterisation of Lockheart got me thinking. What if he took the DADA job as a way to teach himself enough to become competent. He could even plan on working multiple years and working on mastering like 1-3 year material his first year, 4-5 for his second, and 6th and 7th in his third and fourth years teaching.

** I love the idea, I would love to see more crack-fics of this type. I think one of the problems is most of the fan sites have rules against real people being used? At least that's what I've heard. I guess investigate whatever platform you want to use to publish.

Humor is really subjective, and I almost guarantee that whatever you find funny, someone else will find stupid, so I'd say write whatever is funny to you. One way to keep it from completely devolving is to have your other characters stay in character- try to imagine how they would react to Trump/Ginny's antics, don't just have them go along or get as zany as he he is, at least not at first. You can have one or more characters loosen up over time if you wish.

** It should remain canon expect for this new character.

Think about it from the perspective of the other characters. The only person or thing that should seem out of place to them is this new character's behavior and the events they cause.

  Let me tell you about the Bat Bogey! Its a great hex, the best hex. I use it all the time. Its great.

I think what you need to use often is citation. Research Trump to a degree that you can fake his speech patterns. People will make the connection and there you go... you got yourself a joke.

The kind of obvious thing would be to make Ginny a anti-muggleborn populist.

*** Research details. I first became aware of Donald from Spy magazine, so please call Ginny a "short-fingered vulgarian." [[http://www.npr.org/2016/03/07/469209254/decades-later-spy-magazine-founders-continue-to-torment-trump]]

*** Is it wrong that I have never read a story with "magical exhaustion," and now I want to write one? Sounds fantastic. Magical meh. Yes.

** Don't push the story to be tvtropey, as in, use pop-culture references sparingly and if you absolutely have to, stick to universally known/funny things, like Back to the Future or Ghostbusters or something. Try to devise funny jokes based on the world you're creating. One trope might be particularly helpful though, Only Sane Man.

Also, names. Names which are silly in intelligent ways are funny. A name like Dick Johnson is imo funnier than Big Balls Steve, because Dick has two layers: it's the guy's actual name /and/ a dick joke.

Read funny stuff to inspiration. Humor is arguably harder to pull off than drama, tragedy, thriller, or any other genre, especially in writing. It's much easier to do jokes in movies, where you have two entire additional mediums to enhance the jokes on top of dialogue (sound and image). For HP, I recommend A Black Comedy (immature, silly humor, definitely one of the top fics in the fandom, probably the greatest comedy) and Seventh Horcrux (the MC is, imo, a well written comedic character because he kind of inverts the Only Sane Man trope, as in, he's Insane while most of the people surrounding him aren't and it results in some great deadpan jokes).

** If you don't want Trump to fall completely flat, you could do worse than to read [[http://blog.dilbert.com/tagged/Trump][Scott Adams's blog]] about Trump's campaign. It should help you flesh out Trump's 'character' (??????).

Also it will be amazing.

** Terry Pratchett once commented that the key to Discworld is that it isn't funny to the characters. To them, it's home. It's their life. They live it as best they can and feel the same way about that as we do ours.

The same should be in play here. Ron and Percy should react to what their little sister has become. Maybe they're heartbroken, maybe they're scared, maybe they're in denial... They absolutely should now brush it off as "oh, she's just a self-insert".

You may find the first half of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][The Abridged Guide to Intelligent Characters]] useful.

** Have you written anything yet? I thought about something. What if the book that Ginny got wasn't Tom's but instead Trump's. Trump is her secret friend that supports and slowly drains her life?
