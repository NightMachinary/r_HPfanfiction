In which Harry is adopted into an extremely influential and rich family, from Asia, I think. The family is always neutral, except for one member each generation, the family sides with them, and each generation it switches between light and dark. At some point in the story, he tells hermione that he doesn't need a fad to show wealth, and explains his gold and stupidly expensive suit to her. Any help identifying the story would be nice.


** Never mind. It's Gabriel by Shikatanai
