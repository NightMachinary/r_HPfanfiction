As the title indicates, I'm looking for fics where Harry is a dad while he is still a still a student at Hogwarts, raising his /own/ child together with the mother.

There are a lot of fics where Harry is "active" at quite a young age, but everything I read so far goes without him actually getting the girl(s) pregnant. Is magical teenage pregnancy something explored in a story?

The "making of" of his baby does not have to be fully featured in the fic (but bonus points if it is). It might be an /accident/ or a conscious decision. It could out of a one night stand (e.g. the Yule Ball going very well, with extra action at the end HP/PP, maybe + RW/PP? or HP/FD), out of young love (HP/GW, HP/HG), Harry been taking advantage of or Harry tanking advantage (HP/CC at DA in 5th year).

I would like to see him taking responsibility, (fully?) embracing his new family, dealing with all the consequences and benefits.

Thanks for your suggestions.


** Linkffn(secrets by potter8668). Although it it missing the "together with the mother" part.

*** Ah, yes, thank you. I did like that one, even if the pregnancies are during/after the war, and its not that centered around family life.

** I've read a couple of fictions where somebody got pregnant at Hogwarts. Both of those were in the 7th year, though, so the baby would be born after school, and none of them featured Harry as the father.

*** Yeah, I searched some more and this topic seems strangely absent. Most fics tend to end with the birth.
