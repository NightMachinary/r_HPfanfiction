I am writing again and every few days I get pms with requests for collabs or to publish an idea. I don't really remember getting a lot of these in the past, but I haven't been part of the community in a while.


** Dear [name], thank you for the thoughtful invitation to join in on your work. While I think your idea is interesting, at this time I am focused on my own writing. I wish you best of luck, [Name]
