** One of the first Slytherin Harry stories I read was On the Way to Greatness, and it is still my favorite Slytherin Harry story for this exact reason, the characterizations felt relatively true to canon. A lot of that description matches nicely with what I remember of the story, so it could be the one mentioned or at least something very similar. It's sadly unfinished, but still very good.

**** I ABSOLUTELY ADORE On The Way To Greatness. It's by no means my favorite fanfiction, nor my favorite Slytherin!Harry story. But all of my favorite stories are AU. Never have I encountered a Slytherin!Harry story that is so close to canon. Harry isn't on friendly terms with Draco, not his head of house. Being sorted into Slytherin creates a divide between Harry and Ron, but they aren't exactly enemies. Harry is acquaintances with Fred and George and Neville. But what I love most about this story, is the fact that Harry's still fundamentally the same person deep down. But being in a Voldemort supporting house known for the dark arts changes him. Harry might be the same deep down, but he's still had a harder life. And he doesn't have the same trust-filled loving relationships that he had in Gryffindor. It's kind of sad that the only house that can truly help him “on the way to greatness” comes at the cost of the happiness Harry had in Gryffindor.

**** That assumes that Snape would be a Head of House who actively supports his students and interacts with them regularly and has regular 1-1 interactions with them. I don't really see Snape as the kind of teacher who wants to be an active Head of House. He's not teaching at Hogwarts because he likes it, he‘s teaching at Hogwarts because he has to. Many Slytherin fics portray him as a very interactive Head of House who gives welcome speeches on the first night, requires health checks, has individual student meetings, and sometimes even only allows healthy food at the Slytherin table, and I just don't see that as a realistic portrayal of his character.

Harry's interactions with McGonagall as his Head of House were almost always related to being in trouble, other than their one career advice session in fifth year. If Snape treats his Head of House role similarly, interacting with Harry 1-1 only when he got in trouble, it would only further Snape's assumption that Harry is like James.

*** I can imagine it being a part of wizard of society that they let children inherit lordships with some magic bulls**t but they would definitely end up the pawn of some adult who “just wants the best for them” and “knows better”. Suddenly Harry's better at wizard if society than wizards that have lived in it their whole life for 50+ years by reading a few books. I would like to read a fic where Harry is a child politician/Lord of House Potter (none of that Gryffindor Merlin crap, just Potter and maybe Black) and is constantly being manipulated by the adults around him, he doesn't see through every manipulation because eleven year olds can't see through the well thought out plans of seniors and most of his friends are fake/manipulating him. Even Hermione tries to use him to promote whatever social movements she wants promoted. Rich pure bloods (and even muggleborns) without lordships offer him bribes and blackmail him in exchange for turning a blind eye to things they want promoted, these aren't even necessarily bad things, they're just using bad things to achieve their goals.

**** Kinda, most of the main characters are children of politicians. Not exactly 13-year-old Wizengamot Lords, but certainly more politically active than most kids. Keep in mind this is an Aristocracy where magic can bind contracts. Harry certainly likes to manipulate the press to get his revenge, there's children taking people to court, and plenty of Pureblood ettiquette. But in the end, they're still just teenagers. Just add in a dark lord and manipulative old man.

They take facts and manipulate them to suit their ideals. Just like politics in real life. While Harry may only be exposed to one side he should eventually have to confront the idea that it's not as clear cut as he originally though.

** If you're looking for canon-like fics I'd recommend On The Way To Greatness, but that's already listed. So I'd say linkffn(Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance by Watermelonsmellinfellon). It's kind of AU, and the divergence starts before Hogwarts. The divergence causes Harry to be more aloof, and funny, he's also slightly bisexual even though there's no real romance aside from Viktor/Hermione. Even though it's AU, reading this causes me to feel a relief from the typical Slytherin!Harry trope. Because Harry isn't suddenly an 11 year old politician just because he's a Slytherin, nor any of the other cliches. Harry and Draco still don't like each other, but since they're since they're in the same house and Harry's more aloof it's more of a friendly rivalry where they happen to find each other annoying rather than being complete enemies. What I love most of all about it, is that this does something better than any other fanfiction I've ever read, or even the original books themselves: It makes Harry a normal teenager. I mean, sure he still has a dark lord after him, but he approaches his problems like the aloof, funny teenager that he is. In this story, Harry is far from serious(no pun intended) despite having real problems. And like any teenager in the real world, he doesn't plan on becoming serious(once again, no pun intended), he just plans to live out his teenagers years trying to have as much fun as possible.

** So I feel that your request simply is an oxymoron, or at least a dead-end, if you write it -- Canon!Harry does not fit into Canon!Slytherin. At all. Which is why he is -- /choose/ to be, when offered "greatness" -- in Gryffindor.

So if you put Canon!Harry into Canon!Slytherin, he is missorted. He doesn't belong, can't belong, and won't belong. And writing "Harry doesn't fit in" is fun for all of one chapter, before it just gets tedious. It's the same as if you wrote Canon!Draco in Gryffindor.

I entirely agree that you shouldn't change Slytherin, which consequently means you have to change Harry. And to an extent, /any/ Slytherin!Harry story (that isn't just crappily written) does this, because even if Harry arrives the same at Hogwarts, he's not the same person the moment he doesn't refuse Slytherin.

 

In light of this, the best I can offer are aspects:

This has kids just being kids: linkffn(Out of the Depths by Mordac)

And this is an interesting take on "Harry is an outcast/underdog": linkffn(Harry Potter and the Pursuit of Significance by ALJhp)

** Plot twist: The older Slytherins were old enough to remember first-hand how much of a living nightmare the war was, and most Death Eaters waited until the later years of the war to have children due to being busy with the war and in some more empathetic cases not wanting to have children before Voldemort was clearly winning since they didn't want to leave war orphans.

As a result the Slytherin's from the older years as a general rule absolutely /loath/ the Death Eaters and when they see Snape and the canon younger year Slytherins bullying Harry they circle the wagons around him and adopt him as their unofficial younger brother.

Any new students from second year onwards would've been born after the end of the war and therefore either didn't have Death Eater parents or had parents that were smart enough to tone that stuff way down, and remembering what the older years taught him Harry becomes a cool older brother figure to the younger Slytherins.

When Horace Slughorn returns to Hogwarts and sees the state of Snape's Slytherin House he assumes that Harry is following in his footsteps and he tries to give Harry unsolicited advice on "How to more efficiently build a network of connections", which eerily reminds harry of Gilderoy Lockhart.

** linkao3(magical relations by evansentranced) will always be my favorite Slytherin Harry story because he really is perfectly in character. He does become friends with Draco but the situation with the death eaters and Lucius really takes a toll on their friendship in 4th and 5th year in a way that makes perfect sense and doesn't gloss over Draco's death eater support. Sadly the fic is likely abandoned but it's so worth the read!

Another great one is the serpensortia series which starts with linkao3(quiet like a fight). This one is “complete” after third year.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13852147/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Perversion-of-Purity]] This is close to canon Harry, he is friends with draco but only because Of Draco having an older sister who doesn't let him fuck up the meeting at Madam Malkin's

** Probably not the one you are looking for but if you do look for Slytherin Harry with characteristics similar to canon this fic might be a decent try. Linkffn(12174463) In this fic, Harry and Ron were sorted to Slytherin. The author really gave a detailed Ron's thought process that make the sorting realistic and very much believable. Both of them stays as natural nemesis of Draco. No playing nice there either. Harry and Ron sort of have a unofficially unpopular member of Slytherin. Though be cautious that this fic may not follow canon closely.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Harry Potter, sorted into Slytherin, has joined the Wizarding World, and it is a world embroiled in turmoil. Yet nothing feels fresh to Harry, and every new turn of event brings about only a sense of old. And yet Dark Lords, secret orders courting mysteries and death, and magical adventures awaits Harry Potter. For nothing is as it seems and nothing can -- forever -- be the same.
