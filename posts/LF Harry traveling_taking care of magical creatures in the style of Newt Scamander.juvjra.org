It doesnt have to include the super suitcase of awesomeness, but its not forbidden ;) i prefer if Harry is traveling around, meeting/wrangling/helping various creatures. I am specifically interrested in the interactions between Harry and the creatures. Any length, premise, and pairings are welcome as long as the focus of the fic is on the creatures.


** Not entirely what you're looking for, I think, but linkffn(12459242) has Harry meeting Newt Scamander, and he does get a suitcase where he looks after snakes in particular (if I remember the fic correctly). I read it a while ago, so I'm not entirely certain if he goes travelling, but I'm fairly certain that I remember him having a suitcase with snakes.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way; by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that may protect or destroy him.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.
