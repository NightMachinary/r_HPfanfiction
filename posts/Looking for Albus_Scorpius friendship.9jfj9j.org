Any good fics with an Albus/Scorpius friendship? Would prefer no slash, but if there's one that's REALLY well written, I'll give it a go.


** Did you already read one of the CC novelizations? The plot is somewhat crappy, but characterwise it's alright.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7666957/chapters/17458867]]) is pretty solid.

#+begin_quote
  This is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as a novel. From the perspective of Albus Severus Potter and sometimes Scorpius Malfoy. Dialogue and directions the same (except for one scene ahem). With added novel-ish character stuff.

  Draco knew from the moment he held his infant son, Scorpius, in his arms that something wasn't right about him. But Albus Severus Potter didn't realize how "wrong" Scorpius was until it was too late for everyone -- not just him. Two-Shot.
