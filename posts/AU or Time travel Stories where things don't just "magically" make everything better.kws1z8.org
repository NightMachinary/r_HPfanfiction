Would be better if going to an AU or Time Travel was completely an accident, but not mandatory.

The character or characters, depending on who goes to an AU or Time Travel, keeps making mistakes. Have a hard time fitting in, etc.

If it's Harry or whoever who goes. I want them to slip up, call McGonagall, Minerva, Flitwick, Filus, etc. Just random mess-ups like that.

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any length/old or new

Would rather it be finished or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash etc

Would rather NOT have any Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

No child grooming please. No stories where "technically" 31 year old Harry (but he goes back as 11) is lusting after eleven year old Ginny or 12 year old Hermione, just no thank you.


** I'm reading linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Harry goes back to 1976ish but doesn't do the whole "Find his parents" trope. Instead he carves out a place for himself in hogsmeade and joins the fight against Voldemort for his own reasons. He really struggles. There's a lot working against him here. I don't want to say anymore because spoilers but yeah... It's not the usual tropey fic you're used to seeing. And he does make mistakes. A lot of them ðŸ˜Š

It's a new history. Broadly canon but a few key things happen that make it different. I have no idea how the story is going to end but im very excited!

Harry is a lot more mature. And he really grows up he's a fecking idiot for the first while but life and experience really matures him. I'm really proud of him now!

There's so much plot. Secret vigilante groups, barfights, pirates, politics, Squibs, jail time. It's amazing how...canon adjacent it is. Different enough to be a whole new story but with little hints of big events that you recognise from the books.

10/10 would recommend. It's genuinely brilliant.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** Tread Softly by Dius Corvus (on fanfiction.net) is a time-travel story where Harry has a really hard time fitting in, makes terrible mistakes, and is even the cause of worse events. It begins with the side effect of Voldemort trying to kill Harry and a piece of Voldemort's soul (and memories) ends up in Harry. The resulting magical backlash sends Harry/Voldemort back in time to the year his parents graduate Hogwarts; Harry takes on the name Jonathan and attends another 7th year at Hogwarts where Dumbledore can keep an eye on him. Harry is in this early 20s, I can't remember exactly how old, pretending to be an 18 year old, and is interested in another 17-18 year old. If that age difference bothers you, please take note!

*Please note: story features a scene of child abuse*; a memory of some older students sexually abusing a much younger student at Hogwarts. It is absolutely recognized as abuse in the story, there is no excusing or sanitizing the violation and trauma.

Major spoilers:

Harry/Voldemort really fucks things up; he murders a classmate, kills the DADA professor while she is defending Hogwarts, is responsible for Snape being noticed and sought after by Voldemort in the first place, and causes Peter Pettigrew to betray Potters. The awful part of Harry learning how to get back to his time, while struggling with feeling that he doesn't have the power to change anything, is that Harry /is/ so magically powerful because of his strength combined with Voldemort that he could have made a better future. Snape, already an angry, abused, and abrasive teen, ends up a broken and bitter man from his entanglement with 'Jonathan' and being enticed into the Death Eaters.
