I've only seen this once in A Red Headed Step Child by mugglesftw on ffn. By any chance has anyone read a fic where Percy played a larger role and was a good guy?

** I think it's Oh God, Not Again, where Harry makes an effort to bring Percy in with his family and he turns out to be a half-decent brother in that. I can't remember for certain, though. I remember a scene with them in front of the mirror and Harry makes a comment about Percy's desire being just to be accepted by his family and that being okay.

** I have recommended this fic for like three different asks in the past week but it does fit. linkao3(The Meaning of Geranium) has him playing an excellent role but you do need to read the prior two fics to know what is going on. But they're worth it.

** There's linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter). It's very much an ensemble cast, but Percy does play a big part in a lot of the plotlines and is definitely portrayed as a good brother.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
