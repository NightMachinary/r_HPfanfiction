I'm looking for recs where a character gets thrown into a parallel/divergent universe.

Which fics are the best? Has anything been resurrected or newly come up during the pandemic?

Where harry immediately tries to go after Sirius through the veil. It's only 13 chapters right now and updates somewhat sporadically but I've found it to be nice.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

** My own fic, if you don't mind, has Sirius and Remus making different choices that lead to a different universe in which they sort of raise Harry plus their kids (not Wolfstar) And they get thrown into the canon universe! So it's actually the opposite, hope you can enjoy it anyway!
