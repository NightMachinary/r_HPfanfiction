If all magic a person has cast ends when they die why couldn't they romove Sirius mother portrait off the wall in fifth year?

I see this fact trotted out all the time by people in this sub, but in canon we see at least one contradiction of this at least.


** We also see some confirmation of this in canon, when Dumbledore dies, the paralysis spell he puts on Harry stops working, suggesting that magic stops when the user dies. Interesting though, because you're right- technically by that logic the portrait magic should have stopped.

*** And also a great many powerful magical artifacts, Hogwarts itself, etc.

It's only really the most transitory Charms and Jinxes that seem to disappear with their caster. Imagine if the Flying Charms put onto brooms by Nimbus employee #76 just randomly failed one day when he died.

** I think there's a difference in the types of spells used as to whether or not they're permanent. If all spells were temporary, healers potentially wouldn't work, lots of magical structures likely would crumble the moment the original caster died, etc. etc. Some spells must be temporary while others are more permanent in nature. At least that's the only way I can see it working.

** My interpretation is that some spells require a continued effort by the caster to be maintained and others don't, which is why some spells are lifted when the caster dies and others persist.

** Simplest solution, the sticking charm is actually worked into the frame of the painting in the same manner as the magic which animates the painting.

** As others have already mentioned, not all spells work the same. Spells that would have faded anyway, like a paralysis spell, disappear, but "fixed" effects like a Transfiguration normally remain.

That being said---

there's a good reason for that: it's believed by a lot of people that /Kreacher/ was the one who stuck the painting to the wall. Not only was he quite alive, but this explains why wizards were so helpless to unstick it, since they were trying counterspells to /wizard/ sticking charms, not House-Elf magic.

** My explanation is that Kreacher was the one who stuck the portrait on the wall and could possibly be under orders from his mistress to never remove it.

As others have pointed out, Dumbledore's paralysis spell on Harry ends when Dumbledore dies.

*** That doesn't explain the sorting hat it still works and Gryffindor has been dead for at least 700 years (depending on how long he lived.)

Unless you think that the sorting hat is conformation that Godric Gryffindor is still alive?

**** Magic could be tied to Hogwarts? Staircases are moving still... I don't know how Hogwarts works and I doubt JKR thought that far.
