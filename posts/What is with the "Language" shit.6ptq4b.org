Sorry had to include atleast one cuss word but seriously why is it that at 15-16 or full grown wizards are not allowed to swear in all fanfics SOMEONE just has to yell out "language" anytime somebody swears? Surely everyone hears foul language daily or close to it in real life why is wizarding britain so against the damn thing?


** Keep in mind that this was set in the 20th century too. It has progressively become more and more socially acceptable to cuss in the last few decades. Some curse words that are quite casual now, might seem pretty rude 20-30 years ago.

*** Yes, such a long time ago that social archeologists are needed to interprete. The only difference between now and then is the willingness of the public media to use profanity. Swearing was just as prevelant IRL in the 1990's as it is today as it was in the 1940s. THink of it this way, It used to be verboten to portray any male/female couple kissing with an open mouth on television. IRL of course, they kissed with open mouth, tongues and even had sex in a single bed every day.

**** I don't claim to know about every culture all around the world, this is just an observation that I've found for my neighbourhood in Australia. I have 2 aunts and a great uncle who are teachers here and they've also noticed an increase in swearing and curse words used by the children that they teach. The swearing also seems to start earlier and earlier.

I will admit that this could possibly be only evident in my country, but with the introduction of the internet and video games, I wouldn't be surprised if this trend holds true in other places around the word.

***** What is considered rude and offensive changes by time and culture. In Spain "cunt" is regularly used but is considered so offensive in the US that your face would get slapped for saying it.

The op has a general question that ideally would be answered using society in general. While your great aunt and the neighborhood in Australian have valid experiences, they are isolated and may not follow society as a whole. MY own conservative German Catholic mother thought it was fine to shout out "shit" whenever the situation required but me saying "fuck" demanded that I be disciplined.

***** Paraphrasing:

Molly to her mid-twenties son: "Your life choices are horrible (hair, earring, working out of the country for Gringotts) and you should let me make them for you."

Molly to her twins: "Your life choices are horrible (not caring about school grades, setting up their own business instead of doing something 'respectable' like working for a corrupt Ministry) and you should let me make them for you, but thanks for the expensive Christmas present even though I didn't even consider you part of the family when discussing how 'all' of the kids had been prefects and I can't even tell the two of you apart (though I suspect you want it that way)."

Those are the two instances that bug me. I'm sure that she would have (or did, I don't remember) tried to talk Charlie out of being a dragon wrangler even though it seems to be his dream job just because it can be dangerous.

It's ironic that Percy, who seems to be her perfect child (i.e., good grades, prefect, head boy, nice respectable job at the Ministry), is the traitor of the bunch, placing his ambitions that she stoked above the family.

****** Yes of course, when a mother cares about their child grades.. that is bad. Really, what did you think would happen? "Oh you're dropping out of the only school in England? And going to run a joke shop that has no guarantees of success? Also how did you get all the money that's more than this family is worth to run the shop?" What the fuck kinda parenting did you expect?

******* I expect a good parent to say, "So you don't want to work at the Ministry and your alternative is to open a joke shop. Okay. What's your business plan. Where are you getting your startup capital. What does your product catalog look like? Where will you set up shop? How much will all of this cost and how do you plan to pay for it?"

I don't expect a good parent to throw away her children's work that they've done throughout the summer (/GoF/) just to deter them from following their dream.

And they didn't plan to drop out of Hogwarts. They were just months away from their NEWTs, at most when they left.

But she didn't ask those things and even if she had they probably wouldn't have answered her because she showed no support to them or faith in their idea at all at any time.

PS: I understand concern. I understand incredulity. I understand trying to change their minds. I understand having their NEWTs as a fall-back (like a professional athlete still graduating college). I don't understand, "No. You can't do this. You'll be a failure."

******** And when is "you'll be a failure" or "you won't succeed" ever mentioned? We are talking about the same thing right? Harry Potter, not an analysis of children's psyche from parenting? Sure I get that it's not ideal she doesn't ask those questions, but how do we know that? We don't follow their lives, just Harry. Also what we see is through Harry while he goes through his angst period. I think your blowing that completely out of proportion. To me I feel it's alright to say she's overbearing and unfair because of OWL scores and perfect status. But to go to the level of 'mentally scarred' is unfounded and has no substance to back up that accusation.

******* Paraphrasing is expressing what someone else said or wrote in your own words. Do you know what an "argumentum ad hominem" is? For the others (since you obviously must know), I'll paraphrase the definition by saying that it's when you attack a person instead of the argument that they made. You attack my perceived intelligence instead of refuting the argument that I made.

** I suspect it's an attempt to add verisimilitude to dialogue by authors who aren't sure how else to do it. It could also be a cliche way to characterise someone as bossy/uptight (Hermione) or motherheny (Molly).

Another possibility is that the author genuinely grew up in an environment where any swear word was met with serious disapproval to the point where they can't imagine a world where it isn't. Those places aren't all that common, but they certainly exist.

Now that I think about it, bad language is often associated with lower classes in Britain, and Hogwarts is a public (read exclusive) boarding school in a Scottish castle. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be just such an environment.

*** Hogwarts being "exclusive" is pure fanon. In canon, every young witch or wizard gets a letter of acceptance, and Hogwarts doesn't even have tuition fees of any kind (the Ministry funds it in its entirety) so there's no money barrier either. All this, of course, does not go against the idea that it might be rather old-fashioned in such respects as foul language, but it has nothing to do with being "exclusive".

I've never seen it used with Molly, but every time I read Hermione using that word in a fic, I have a strong urge to click out. It's not just in /Harry Potter/ fics either -- I've seen it in other fandoms with "uptight" characters -- so it's probably one of those awful fic writer-specific word/phrase tics like "ghosted" or "pupils blown wide" or "carded his fingers through his hair" that make me cringe whenever I read them.

If they hadn't been a part of my life since I was about Harry's age in the first few books I'm not sure I'd love it as much. Nostalgia.

It was brilliant how the books grew with kids. And I wish that's what the Cursed Child had been, a book that grew with the original readers.
