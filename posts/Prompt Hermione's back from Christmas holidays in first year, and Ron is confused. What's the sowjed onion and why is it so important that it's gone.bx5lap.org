  "But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden --- anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.

  But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry.

  "Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you."

** Also, the Muggleborn visit to the Diagon Alley happened on the day when the First Iraq War started (Premier Minister Major standing with the cup of tea in front of the 10 Downing St. and announcing that we are at war).

linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) works with it, and Mr. Granger celebrates the fall of the Soviet Union (and Sirius explains to him that the magical power behind the Soviet Union was Konstantin Jugashvili, the Dark Lord of Leningrad).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

**** How would Hermiones' accent render "Soviet Union", and how would Rons' accent render this never-before-heard phrase? Would their accents clash in ways that might make it more difficult at first for Ron to parse the correct pronunciation?

If I was writing this scene where Hermione is trying to tell Ron all about the news, I would have Ron sound it out as, "Sew-vee-et union". The word "union" would already be in his vocabulary, but not the word "Soviet".

Being American, I'm not really sure how British accents work, or play off each other.

After learning the word "Soviet", Rons' next question would be, what's a com-you-nist, what are their blocks made of, and why are these blocks such a big deal?

I kind of want to read a scene where Hermione hands Ron a recent muggle newspaper, and then she has to correct his pronunciation over every word that didn't exist before WWII.
