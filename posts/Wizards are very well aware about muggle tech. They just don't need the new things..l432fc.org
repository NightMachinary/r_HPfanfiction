** Realistically they also need to keep abreast of new developments, or at least sponsor some sort of taskforce that does so in their stead, because concealment spells and such need to be updated for new technology. It's all well and good if your spell hides you from being burned into film, but does it hide your color values from being recorded as digital pixels? Same for Radar, seismographs, etc. All sorts of detectors and telescopes and such that would need to be studied and countered by magic as soon as they are developed.

The wizarding world would have fallen with the launch of Sputnik 1 if wizards didn't make an effort to stay hidden. And that doesn't even touch near-future tech that will soon come, such as neural interfaces, cybernetic eyes, lightspeed photon cameras, etc.

*** That's all debatable. I don't see magic working that way. It's too mechanical. A Shield Charm doesn't need to be altered for every different spell. It just protects, broadly, as HP magic works on a conceptual level. It's why things like the Fidelius, Unplottability, DADA curse, and such things exist.

If a spell is meant to conceal from technology, as we know it easily can, then it should conceal from all technology. You're not going to bypass a Disillusionment Charm by using infrared or x-ray cameras. How I interpret it, at least.

***** If we translate it into relative energy, then the explosive hex Confringo would be a very small detonation. Given enough Confringo's at once, the wards would fall eventually. A single strafe from a B-52 Stratofortress would bring Grimmauld place down. During WW2, there was nothing like the B-52, which was developed after the war. Now? There are bombers/fighter missiles that would put it to shame. The wards needed to protect a location from increased energy (I.e. a bigger bomb) would need to be likewise increased. The shield charm won't stop everything. Put enough energy against it and it will shatter.

******* Yeah, my thing was all under the assumption that it is a form of energy that we can understand. If we go to a more abstract form of thinking, that magic can do literally anything you can think of and everything you can't think of, then perhaps a beginners shield charm could stop a nuke because they believe it can. If you take the energy requirements away, the younger you are the more potentially powerful you could be. As you age, you gain certain view points on how the world is and how it works, which could limit your imagination. This is all also an assumption on how magic works. It could be something completely different. Who really knows?

****** That doesn't make sense. If we want to talk about energy, wizards use enough energy to make 100 nukes look like nothing. Conjuring matter is no joke. Even a glass of water being conjured would require more energy than several nukes. Wizarding protections should, therefore, protect against even nukes.

But canon doesn't abide by our rules anyway. Which just makes it even more likely wizards can protect against nukes. We made nukes and understand how they work. We still don't understand how the human mind fully works. So, really, the mind magic we see in canon is far more insane than nuke protection.

Any way you spin it, canon points to nukes being child's play.

***** Why not? If it's meant to block things, conceptually, only other magic should be able to overpower it. This aligns with canon and Rowling's Word of God statements, one of the few things she's stayed really consistent on.

Wizards also used to cast protective charms on muggle neighbors during the world wars, so that implies it does.

And if you want to look at shield charms in the lens of scientific energy, then shield charms would hold against nukes easily, given what kind of energy wizards would require to casually conjure matter.

What I said was that blanketing magic is boring as shit. Magic that adapts by itself without any sort of effort. The same is true for all other cases of this:

- one shield charm for everything? boring as shit.

- wandless magic that just requires "wanting it" real hard? boring as shit.

- "this unique spell was actually xyz known spell"? boring as shit.

- "there is no dark magic"? Boring as shit.

- Silent spells/spells without the movement needing "just wanting it more"? Boring as shit.

All these, in addition to the magic you describe, is boring as shit. Magic is not supposed to just be a flexible wishforce - it's an academic field that requires study and cleverness. Creativity and thinking outside the box.

I like intricate magic systems, ones with necessitate strange methods for strange ways of doing things, unique spells for unique effects.

Magic that effortlessly does everything by itself is boring and breaks the suspension of disbelief.

I don't think computers should beat magic outright, but I do think that the spell would need alteration, as physical film and digital data works on radically different principles. Not to mention the absolute non-organic logic that governs them. You can't distract a computer, for instance - it doesn't have an attention to distract.

They're deterministic automatons, and as such, would need special spells to be fooled.

The magical world would have never stayed hidden if they hadn't stronger stuff than obliviate and so on.

And I guess Hermione used something more potent than a obliviate. Something that deleted her out of the lives of her parents completely since it only takes a family member or friend to ask about Hermione, etc.\\
Something that deleted her out of their lives completely also because if their parents go to Australia, some official will most likely ask about what happened to their daughter since she didn't come along.

I always believed that emotions power spells and Hermione should have been burning with all kinds of emotions when she deleted herself out of the lives of her parents.\\

** "So let's go over what we learned about last year in muggle studies. Who here remembers what the topic was?"

A hand went up. "Jenny." The professor of muggle studies said, pointing at the girl with her hand up.

"Infrastructure."

"And what was the main takeaway of that topic?"

"That while it's impressive and ingenious in its own right, the magical world has no real need of it."

"Correct. And why?"

"Because the infrastructure exists to provide muggles with things a Wizard or Witch can obtain using simple spells. Similarly, the machines supported by said infrastructure may produce extraordinarily complex effects, but there are equivalents in the magical world that work without such things."

"Correct, though there was another reason for which muggle-style infrastructure isn't widely adopted in the magical world. John, do you remember?"

"Ummm, complexity? I mean like, magic isn't easily tamed and muggle style systems are so complicated to begin with that magic, uh, subverts it?"

"Not quite. Magic has a tendency to induce sapience in complex systems, so the system subverts itself once magic is applied to it, but good try nonetheless. Now for the curriculum for fifth year-mechanics, machinery and computing. What they are, how muggles use them and, more importantly, how some of our own academics and researchers have used them throughout the years. Be warned, though, that this will involve fieldwork, so make sure you talk to your parents about the various options available that you will be able to pursue. Now then, we will start the first lesson. Open your textbook onto page 210-motorized vehicles. Now, as per usual when it comes to muggle artefacts, these are all compound artefacts composed of several different elements put together. That said, these are a little different from carriages, as I will illustrate here-"

**** The other reason I didn't touch upon is relative population size. Large scale infrastructure makes sense when you have a large population because the cost to benefit ratio favours infrastructure over individual supply systems. In the magical world, where the estimates range from 10,000 to a million Wizards & Witches, everyone has a wand that can conjure virtually anything infrastructure can and muggle infrastructure already exists, the cost of dedicated magical infrastructure is far greater than the benefits attained by providing it.

Unless there's a baby boom or wand ingredients start going extinct, the allure of technology is limited to 'that's cool. Do we need to invent a spell to replicate it?'.

The one area that I think Wizards don't have the edge in is information acquisition, and data processing. Even in the 90's and 2000's, Information Technology was developed enough that all large scale computation problems were solved by computer, whereas computation clusters where a mathematician broke down complex equations into simple steps , which is when clerks called 'computers' (yes, that was a thing) did their individual math problems and passed the results down to the next person etc.

Wizards arguably don't need such systems unless someone builds equations to solve numerology problems, which would accelerate spell creation and research if numerology being a key component isn't, in fact, fanon.
