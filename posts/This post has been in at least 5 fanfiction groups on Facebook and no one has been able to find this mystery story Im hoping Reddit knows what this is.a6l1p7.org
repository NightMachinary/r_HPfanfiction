This is the copy of the latest post on FB!

(I am slowly going insane trying to remember this fic. I know I've read it and enjoyed it, but i can't find it. Any ideas are appreciated!

This one was requested in another group and will now drive me nuts until found. Details I recall. Hermione, in not great shape ends up at Malfoy Manor. Between her being Severus Snape's other half and the Malfoy's not actually being terrible people they patch her up. Then since Hermione's old wand was destroyed they let her use an old Malfoy family wand. Problem is, she needs Malfoy blood for the wand to accept her, so Lucius adopts her and Draco snarks about his new “sis”. It isn't too terribly fluffy, the Malfoy's are suddenly saints, but they are realistically doing the best they can. Any ideas?!)

Any ideas Reddit?!?

** Yes, we have all seen how much Malfoys care for doing their best when senior set loose a basilisk in a school.

I get trying to make Junior into a good guy in a story but even the idea that same can be tried with Lucius is ridiculous to the extreme.
