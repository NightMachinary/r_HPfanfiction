i can't seem to find any good ones now, and i've already read 'My Brother'


** I think Harry's sibling in *The Dark Prince Trilogy*, linkffn(2913149;3340621;3959072), is very well done.

I like Harry's new siblings in *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), their interactions was kind hilarious.

In *Yes, I am Harry's Brother*, linkffn(8192853), Harry gained a new 'brother' after his parents' murder. Save for that cringe-worthy 'romance' with Tonks, this story is actually pretty good.

*** [[/u/Daviatella]]

Disagree about *Yes, I am Harry's Brother*. I've been reading it over the past few days, and while the 'romance' with Tonks is indeed quite cringe-worthy, seeing how it's a 12-year-old having a very sexual relationship with a 16-or-17-year-old, it reads incredibly like a Gary Stu or wish-fulfillment-fantasy fan fiction.

Likewise, it also includes what I would consider to be "Dumbledore bashing", and quite a few other common Harry Potter fanfiction clichés, including "Pureblood marriage contracts", and "celebrating pagan traditions and holidays". However, neither of these examples are ever shown in the books or films.

Not to mention, most of the things that actually happen in the story are so outlandish, out-of-character, and 'what-the-hell-did-I-just-read' territory that it didn't just break my suspension of disbelief. It outright shattered it to pieces. I think I stopped reading it because Harry and his 'brother' get everything that they want, with no actual challenges or obstacles, and it's too unrealistic.

That's not even including that Tonks's own /mother/ jokes about her marrying the 12-year-old that Tonks ends up having a sexual relationship with. It doesn't matter if it's an adult in a child's body, it still is predatory and pedophilic to me, and it's vile.

Likewise, Harry himself, in my view, is not only heavily out-of-character in this work, being far too naïve, but also is too far removed from the original Harry from the books.

--------------

Likewise, here are two other reviews I agree with from TV Tropes:

- "The story has its ups and downs, especially towards the start, but steadily declines as it unfolds. It's an interesting read, especially if you don't mind rampant character bashing, but it doesn't really stand out from all the other OC/Super!Harry (even if it's not actually Harry in this case) by the end."

- "An incredibly dark story where The Bad Guy Wins and most of the heroes either die or are irredeemably corrupted. Also contains a good deal of squick in the form of multiple cases of pedophilia and some rather gruesome murders along with genocide. Do not recommend."

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry and Lily were home alone that night, James having taken Jazmin(twin sister) to the family Samhain party. When James and Albus feel the wards torn down around Potter Cottage, they arrive to find Lily dead and Harry crying over his mother, an empty robe with Slytherin's crest upon it. See a world where Harry lived nearly the life he should have.
