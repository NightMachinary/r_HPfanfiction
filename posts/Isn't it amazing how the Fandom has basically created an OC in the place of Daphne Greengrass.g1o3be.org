Okay, it's 4:30 am for me right now, so if this sounds a bit odd, forgive me.

I just finished what now has to be one of my favorite fics linkffn(the lion tamer by James spookie) and it's an amazing take on Harry/Daphne. All I can think is - man! That was so good! Anyways, I'm not here to talk solely about that fic, no matter how glorious of a read it was, I'm here to talk about Daphne Greengrass. It is /amazing/ that the fanfiction community has kind of created together, such and in-depth and generally accepted character. If you ever hear someone talking about how fanfiction writers only write it because they can't be original, you take Daphne Greengrass, shove it in their face, and walk away. Because that character is such a perfect representation of what a tight-knit bunch we are. And it's awesome. My last note - what do you think of Daphne Greengrass?


** It's funny too because back in the day (I just used that unironically...wow) before we knew about Daphne it was Blaise as we did not know the gender at the time. I think HP FanFiction website still has tags for both male and female Blaze. But there are a lot of similarities between how both are portrayed in fandom

** I think the fact that there is a Slytherin girl in Harry's year called Daphne Greengrass opens lots of potential character interactions and I enjoy seeing authors who use her character in interesting ways.

However, the vast majority of Daphne fics are not that.

Personally, I would not consider it laudable that so many fanfic authors copy each others ideas wholesale to the point that a "fanon consensus" emerges as to how to characterise an OC. Certainly I wouldn't consider it a counter-argument to people who accuse fanfic writers of lacking originality. If anything, it's prime ammunition for that argument: even where the fanfic community creates something original, they then beat it into the ground with carbon copy knock-offs.

Fanfiction has great potential as an art form. Hell, when an ongoing franchise like Marvel brings a new writer in to write the script for the next Marvel movie, that is essentially a form of fanfiction: one writer using the characters and universe set up by another. However, I think it's undeniable that most of fanfiction wastes that potential. There are literally hundreds of thousands of HP fanfics on the internet, but the vast majority of them just tell the same story. Once you've read one indy!Harry fanfic, you've pretty much read them all. And yet there are literally thousands of them out there, each one essentially identical to all the others.

I can't help but think about how rich a body of stories we would have open to us if all those writers had written something different rather than just following the script established by others.

Instead we have a fandom with hundreds of thousands of stories but very little worth reading. Once a reader passes their initial "fanfiction flurry" where they consume everything they can get their hands on, pretty much all fanfic readers enter a state of being surrounded by an ocean of fanfic but dying of thirst for something good to read.

If people were a bit less tolerant towards the idea of "fanon" - that is, a community-guided accepted set of ideas as to how certain characters, places and events should be written - perhaps that problem would not be quite so bad.

This is such a good way to describe that feeling, thank you.

There are so many fics out there, even for the ships I like, but I can't stand 99% of them. They just....blur together after a while. If you've read one, you've read them all and that's kind of sad honestly.

*** Is fanon meant to be as strong as 'should'? I tend to think of it more as a shortcut/collection of tropes for how something might go, that have been repeated enough that people will recognize. Like, the fanon 'magical core' idea isn't saying that they /should/ be there, but that if someone's writing with a similar idea in mind, it's easier to just plug into the magical core idea and use that name.

Fanfiction is in a bit of an odd space because, well - we can't expect too much from it in the aggregate. What you say is true about the lack of quality and identicality of most of the fics out there, but most of them are (at least to my eye) written more for the fanfic writer to play out their thoughts, ideas, etc. People thinking 'what if ___ had happened, or was the case?', and writing it out for themselves - which means that by default there'll be a lot of repetition. There's only so many 'good' writers out there - and I find that if someone is a talented writer, their twist/take on even common tropes will be enjoyable - and unique.

It's a bit like looking at, say, the fantasy genre. Except that fanfiction doesn't have as much of a centralized reviewing and publishing field, and the good stuff gets much more mixed in with all the bad stuff (eg, the equivalent of self-published amazon books).

I think it's more the difficulty in finding the quality ones out there that makes me, at least, feel like being in that state you mention. It's not having repetition and different takes on similar tropes/ideas - it's just more of a slog through fics that include things that just make it hard to read, which will depend on the reader (eg, bashing might be a deal breaker for one person, having an excessively positive interpretation of Snape or Malfoy might be a deal breaker for someone else, grammar, etc). At least in my case, lack of originality has never /really/ been a dealbreaker for me - the closest I've had to it is the combination of lack of originality + use of tropes I dislike, which is a completely different discussion IMO.

(Though, you're certainly right about the lack of originality in a lot of fics and the potential of fanfiction. I just don't know if that potential should be looked at overall, vs the top/highest quality fics)

** Fanon Daphne fills a niche that there's no real other option for - that of a not-too-bad Slytherin pureblood, that Harry can have a relationship with. It's a niche that enough people wanted that it makes sense that there's a stock character for it.

It's certainly interesting how pervasive the primary interpretation of her is through fanfiction - it'd be very interesting, IMO, to see how that spread over time. The common additions to the basic framework of 'not evil girl in slytherin that's a pureblood' are also intriguing to think about how they became default - her being smart/close to on par with Hermione academically, politically savvy, an ice queen persona, etc. Obviously, it's a matter of people seeing one interpretation of her like that, liking it, and running with it themselves - but it does make me wonder if there were ever alternate characterizations that really warred with this interpretation of a blank slate character to any substantial degree (as opposed to the state of the fics I've read, where other characterizations of Daphne are more individual, fic by fic)

** I don't enjoy reading 'fanon established' Daphne.

Then again, I don't generally enjoy reading about Slytherins anyway. I don't dislike Slytherin characters or stories revolving around them on principle, but authors tend to really drop the ball when it comes to that house in particular.

People are people. It should go without saying that in every house there's bullies, goofers, people who blend with the crowd, gossips, loudmouths, etcetc. With Slytherin, however, you only tend to get smarmy, articulate, and plotting people with highly unrealistic, convoluted backgrounds. This is especially jarring when the story stars before the fourth year.

*** Agreed. I think some of the Slytherin characters can make for decent sub plots, short character studies, or short stories. A Post Hogwarts Auror!Harry mystery featuring Snitch!Draco can be interesting and done while keeping the characters in character. And I've read a few well done Slytherin/DA member romances taking place at Hogwarts during DH that were either short stories or side stories.

But the 100,000+ word Gossip Girl meets House of Cards Slytherin House fics that people like to attempt are inevitably super cringey, OOC, and chock full of bigotry apology.

It might be interesting if it was focused on the ambition aspect instead. Everybody wants to become president, or an astronaut, or a doctor when they're a kid. What if Slytherin was just the place where the kids who really meant it go? They focus on their goal above all else which makes them stand offish to outsiders.

*** I think the problem is that Rowling dropped the ball with Slytherin first, she just painted the entire House as Hitler Youth with sticks and that's it, she had to make Harry extremely prejudiced against it so the Hat suggestion would not be followed.

I honestly think it was a missed opportunity to use more grey in HP. I mean she lambasted it to a point that if you get Slytherin in one of the tests she especially recorded a video to tell "Hey, you're not evil", lol, it's just not realistic that a quarter of the school would be formed completely by racist pseudonazi people, only because they are ambitious and cunning. /Merlin/ was a Slytherin for crying out loud.

So when writers try to expand on them being more than little villains, they have very,very little to work with.

One of the better portrayals I find, if only with a bit too articulate 11 year olds(though not In the realm of impossibility with aristocracy) is one where they are bullies, to others. And Harry is among them and despite stopping them from going overboard, joins in sometimes(normally when the other side starts). It's surprisingly realistic because I can totally see an emotionally stunted child with not a single good role model being molded by peer pressure after being well received.

** This actually made me think of a different character. Specifically from back before there was a cannon gender for blaise zabini.

There was a series pairing a female version of the character with harry, starting with Apprentice Potter, by Draco664. Harry is also an apprentice to Alastor Moody, who is related to Zabini in some way. I remember it being quite good, back in the day, though its been years since I read it.

** We haven't, though. She's different in every fic I read, and fundamentally too. In some she's brainy, in some she hangs with the Death Eaters, in some she hates muggleborns, in some she marries one, in some she's smart, in some she's vapid, in some she's an ice queen and hides her emotions, in some she makes friends easily, in some she's bullied, in some she bullies.

I don't get why people say this, when it's obviously not true at all. She's a completel different character every time. There are some basic things she isn't, because if she were, then canon would have commented on it, but as to the things she could be it depends on the fic.

** I personally love Daphne Greengrass, because while there is pretty much of a blank slate for her there are a lot of elements that make Daphne, Daphne. Daphne is often portrayed as witty and can have good banter. My favorite stories with Daphne uses this element well. Daphne is also portrayed as the "Ice Queen". I like seeing this element in play wherewith strangers she is cold and intimidating while with friends she is more open. Of course, the best Daphnes are those with flaws, whether it's her arrogance, insecurity, or some other reason.

I think that yes, while there is a lot of copy and paste that is not done well, I think there is also plenty of well done and pretty original Daphnes.

** Does she even have a single line in Canon?

I see what you mean. I also like the Fanon order and sacrifice for the Horcruxes more than the Canon one.

Canon; The Diary, The Cup, The Locket, The Snake, The Ring, The Diadem (found in camberia), The Skull. In That Order.

Fanon; The Diary, The Ring, The Diadem, The Cup, The Locket, The Skull, The Snake. Or, another way, Love, Family, Acceptance, Beauty, Sanity, Corporeality, Cunning.

A girl that loved him and his ability to Love for 1/2 of his soul in the Diary, his father and any blood Family through the ability to have children for 1/4 in the Ring, his old orphanage matron and Acceptance for 1/8 in the Diadem, the last of the Hufflepuff line and his beautiful face for 1/16 in the Cup, an unknown human sacrifice as well as his Sanity for 1/32 in the Locket, the (death) of his prophesied defeater and his Corporeality for 1/64 in the Skull (although the Cloak got in the way of that ‘death'), and Mrs. Bones, and the last major opposition to him in the DMLE and his Cunning for 1/128 in the Snake.

**** The skull of his prophesied defeater. Harry's head, his scar.

Wouldn't it make sense, if Voldemort was going to attach his Crux's to things that were important to him, that he would use the skull of his prophesied defeater, buried in the ruins of his home, as the ‘final' one? Six total Horcrux, seven total soul pieces, only later creating the Snake after assuming the Skull wasn't made, after all, Harry was alive; and you can't make a Horcrux without a human sacrifice.

Of course, by that point he was so off his rocker, that he promptly forgot he'd been planning that, but didn't lose the ability to plan entirely until after creating the Snake.

*** It's got a Ron who is quite distrustful of Slytherin house and it's members in general and he and Harry have a fairly large falling out about it. It's not bashing, as I see it, and he's still a good guy. Give it a try.

*** In my opinion, it's one of the best ways to portray Ron. It keeps his faults, and it feels a /tiny/ bit Ron bashing at times, but his character actually develops over the story very well, instead of just 'perfect friend' or 'worst friend and jealous git'.

** Same for Blaise. I feel like he's written to be a hilarious comic-relief who is dramatic and chill with everyone. I'm not against it as that usually adds a lot of spice to stories but I am curious how he went from a quiet background Slytherin to comically dramatic Slytherin.

** So I absolutely LOVE Harry/Daphne stories- James Spookie actually got me started on that pairing! If this is a pairing you'll follow I highly recommend Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd. It's one of my absolute favorites

** I generally avoid fics in which Daphne is the main love interest or secondary protagonist. I love OCs and like them as a main and POV character for the audience but I generally stay away from characters who have a tiny role in canon and are now the main character in a fic, I don't even know why.

** In canon, we only know about two Slytherins and they are dumb (Pansy) and a brute (Milicent) with little potential and room to explore their characters.

Fanon Daphne is how canon Pansy should be.

** I enjoy her character, far more than some canon ones in fanfics, maybe it's just because she feels interesting qualities, being a Slytherin who isn't evil, and someone who can teach Harry more about wizarding culture.

*** She's a writers dream character. In Canon Ron, while pureblood, is rather ignorant to some parts of Wizarding culture. Hermione, of course, is muggle born, and is learning as well. Daphne can be the character to explain anything.
