Shot in the dark but if anyone has any good ones I'd love to hear them. I've read Hogwarts; To Welcome you home and Just a Random Tuesday but thank you for those in advance. (If you haven't read those they're fab!)

Ideally, if anyone knows a story where the teachers are discussing/setting up the Philosophers stone protections that would be great.

Preferably circa 10k words if possible.

Thank you!


** I was planning to have my fic be like this but now you mention it I totally veered the fuck off of this concept. God damn.

*** To answer your question though I've definitely seen some. I think they were mostly odd moments in â€˜Harry goes back in time and becomes a teacher' fics, but I'll try and figure out if I can remember which ones
