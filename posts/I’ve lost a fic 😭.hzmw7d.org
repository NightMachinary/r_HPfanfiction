:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was literally reading it about a week ago and didn't actually finish reading it but I neeeed to Okay So I'm sure it starts with Harry running away from the dursleys in third year? Goes to the leaky cauldron, he buys all these fancy magic bookshelves that shrink and all these cool things and stuff He sends some stuff to Hermione and everything Can't remember the next but or a lot between that But Harry Hermione and Luna got Trelawney turned into a tree person and they got themselves turned into fairies and metamorph-whatsitcalleds people Hmmmmm oh HERMIONE set fire to dumbledores office and destroyed LOADS of his trinkets and everything and hmm hold on that's all I remember. It's definitely not in that order tho. Can't remember the exact order but it's not the one I put it in Please please please if anybody knows the name of it I'm BEGGING YOU please link it ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º

I must have deleted it from my search tags by accident have no idea what the name was ðŸ˜” Pleeease ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸŒŸ


** Sounds like Half-kissed Hero. I think rule 8 prevents me from linking, but I honestly repressed most memory of that story so I can't be sure. :D

**** Rule 8 is the no sexualization on minors/non-consensual sexual content rule on this subreddit

**** Sure. Happy to help. :)

And Jane-Foster is right, it's the no sexualisation of minors rule. I'm not certain, but I vaguely recall something about underage people getting involved in that story from the big 'Subjective Review of Half Kissed Hero' from a while back - I could be wrong, but I wouldn't want to link, just in case.
