:END:
Hello, I am oping that you all can help me relocate a fanfiction that I read a while ago. If I am remembering correctly, it begins with Snape going to the Dursley's and discovering an almost dead Harry because of stab wounds. Harry is brought to Hogwarts but requires the medical skills of a doctor from St. Mungos. Uncle Vernon goes on trial in the wizzarding world for attempted murder. Anyone know what fanfiction I am looking for?
