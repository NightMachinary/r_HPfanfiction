Sorry if someone has pointed this out previously, but I've yet to see it listed here.

Like many of you, I've read a frankly ludicrous amount of HP fan fiction over many years. Multiple pairings, WBWL, time travel, bashing fics, Slytherin!Harry, powerful!Harry - there is no story type out there that has eluded my eyes.

After reading so many millions of words in this universe, I've recently come to a realization/theory regarding the type of stories I enjoy versus the ones that lose me after a few chapters, and I'm curious if others feel the same way.

This Can-AU theory (cleverly pronounced “canoe”), focuses on, you guessed it, the ratio of cannon to AU factors employed in a story. Essentially, it boils down to this:

If the story elements of a fic (plot, setting, timeframe, etc.) are AU, the characterization must be canon, and vice versa.

I believe that for a story to be considered good, it must first and foremost be well written and structured. This goes without saying. But that same story must also contain at least some recognizable elements of the HP universe; otherwise you're just using existing character names and descriptions to tell your own stories

For example, if your story has Harry accidentally time traveling back to the Marauder era and somehow activating a marriage contract, then your version of Harry and the other characters needs to be close to cannon in their thoughts and actions.

Conversely, if your story has Harry ending up possessed by Tom Riddle after the Chamber of secrets, then the plot of the story must logically follow from that character change, but those changes must be organic to the original canon plot. There's nothing that drives me more batty than starting a fic that's relatively canon, then by chapter 20 there's like some secret society of dwarves that controls all aspects of pure blood magic or something else just completely out of left field and with no basis in the HP universe.

By keeping either the story elements or characterization in canon, you allow the reader to truly immerse themselves in the experience of seeing a recognizable aspect of a familiar story they love in a completely new and interesting way. For me, like I assume many of you out there, this opens up the HP wider universe in ways that still today continue to bring me surprise and joy.

With all that said, is this theory regarding story enjoyment infallible? Of course not! First, it's why it's a theory instead of a law! More importantly though, whatever type of story personally brings you joy IS the right kind of story for you. At the end of the day, we all read fanfiction to bring a little more happiness into our lives, and if your happiness is reading a story with a version of Harry that more closely resembles Draco Malfoy in personality, set in the pre industrial US where magic doesn't exist, then more power to you!

Again, I'm curious to see if others agree or disagree with my thoughts on canon versus AU. Or, do you have any other personal theories in HP fanfiction stories you enjoy that work for you?


** That's an interesting theory and it probably applies to me 85% of the time. But do I also read those stories that are HP in name only? Yeah. If a story sucks me in then I'm game.

** I think if you were looking for a formula to safely create popular fics, this would be fairly reliable. But I don't think it's the complete story. I can think of many types of popular fics that don't fit the formula:

- Canon "missing moments" i.e. both setting and characters in-canon, only exploring a new perspective or event.

- "Character upgrade" AUs. For lots of people, their view of what a character /should/ be is not the same as what the character is in canon. The most obvious example being Harry - lots of people feel like he should have continued his more traditional, heroic PS-POA arc, rather than starting to become an everyman from GoF onwards (a process that culminated in HBP). Super!Hermione is another common substitution. So for these people, your formula works well, but before you start using the formula you first apply a substitution of your preferred interpretation of a character for their canon self. Thus the proliferation of "Master of Death" crossovers.

- Complete AUs - stories that could have been original fiction but the author happened to call it HP fanfic - Alexandra Quick, for example.

** Honestly it's a pretty good 'rule of thumb' theory that people could keep in mind when starting to write fanfiction. Apart from recongizability of the source material in it you're also getting another very important part done - keeping it simple.

It's pretty difficult to write a compelling fanfic that changes all sorts of things around and makes sure they all are properly explored, have some point to them and are logically tied to the rest of the world/story, whereas making a simple change here or there as a starting point and then rolling with it's consequences as the butterfly's wing flutter is far easier.

And, well, fanfic is popular because of the pooularity of the source material, if you're writing an almost completely original story only tangentially related to the original - well, it's propably going to be a huge miss simply because writing is hard. At this point you could've changed a few names and some other minor elements and written an original piece of work instead of still dabbling in fanfic.

*** I'm not sure your last point applies to HP fan fiction. I've seen a lot of very popular fan fics that are very AU -- I think HP fan fiction has taken on a life of its own, separate from the canon material.
