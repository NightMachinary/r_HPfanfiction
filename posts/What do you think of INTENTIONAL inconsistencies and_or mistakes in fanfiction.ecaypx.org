This question also applies for fanfiction outside of the HP fandom.

For example, Character A says they are /severely/ lactose intolerant, only to be described as eating standard, full-fat yogurt a few scenes later. Additionally, certain things make no sense, e.g. Character A is stated to be a pacifist -- by themselves and other characters -- only for a later action scene to reveal them going ape-shit and loving it on the battlefield. Later on, it's revealed that Character A is an impostor.

How do you feel about such inconsistencies, especially if it isn't revealed much later, though with big pay-offs?


** That's good shit!

But I'm a little more afraid in fanfiction that it's a legitimate mistake than I am in something professional. It's kind of an advanced move and I kinda don't think you should try it unless you're confident there aren't also legit mistakes...

or do, it's fanfiction, write what you want, I'll probably like it!

** I think it's great when people pull this off, and not just with inconsistencies and mistakes but also with fanon and things like [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality][Protagonist-Centred Morality]], but there's always a risk that a good number of readers will put the fic down before that, because in the vast majority of fics where this type of thing happens, it's exactly what it looks like---a mistake, fanon, or other badness. Two examples come to mind (not naming fics to avoid spoiling):

- A fanfic protagonist fed a Muggle woman he is in love with Amortentia. I almost put the fic down because it was a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon][Moral Event Horizon]], and as the fic was clearly going towards another 'ship (with a witch), I thought it would be profoundly OOC for the witch to forgive his actions. However, it turned out that he was only trying to prove the existence of magic to her, and when she still didn't believe him, he gave her the antidote and sent her away, accepting that he couldn't have her.
- A Dumbledore, who, in the classic Manipulative!Dumbledore fashion, denied Sirius's innocence and tried to railroad him (again). Until, that is, Sirius said a key phrase, and Dumbledore remembered that Pettigrew was the Secret Keeper and that he had False Memory Charmed that knowledge away for extra security---to be unlocked by the phrase.

So, I think that /if/ the author wants to pull this off, they need to do it pretty far into the fic, when they've built up some amount of trust by the reader that they know what they're doing, so that the reader would give them the benefit of the doubt long enough for the reveal.

I would have dropped it anyway because this is a stupid way to avert expectations. Feeding the muggle a love potion instead of just transfigurating a random piece of furniture to show her magic exists can only be justified by the forced twist that came latter.

Communities like this are in a somewhat tricky position of having to both accommodate the readers, who want to honestly and candidly discuss the stories, and the writers, for whom discussions that are /too/ honest can end up feeling jarring or demotivating. I'm not sure what advice should be given to authors in regards to such community discussions, but in case of this specific discussion, here's my disclaimer that I will be treating you as a member of the former group, rather than the latter.

#+begin_quote

This could've been an ok-ish counter-argument if I was trying to criticise him for his "immoral" behaviour (which I was not). What I was criticising was the poor decisions made by the character.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Since there isn't any more detail provided by discussion participants on this, I can only assume that this means that she, as a muggle, couldn't see manifestations of magic, --- like how Duddly couldn't see the dementor. However, 1) even Duddly could feel that something wrong was happening and 2) many manifestations of magic leave tangible, physical consequences after their "activation". So even if she couldn't see the portrait or the animated frog, she should've still been able to see objects being toppled over by the frog, or things getting burned by the cards, or a chicken wing getting bitten off [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Biting_doorknob][by a cursed object,]] etc.

The only way I can see him to continue to fail in his endevaour is because of bad writing tropes like [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills][PoorCommunicationKills]] and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama][DramaBall.]]

People can have other flaws unrelated to morality, and in this case the character under discussion does. Since the character's personality and past circumstances would lead him to make bad decisions, it is in-character for him to do so.

Aside from all of the other good points the author made on this subject, I'd like to point out that the story is a *comedy*. The author does a good job of keeping everyone in character, each person acting according to their personality and motives, but their flaws are at least partially orchestrated to lead to hilarious circumstances. Thus, your critique without having read the fic for context is about as bizarre and off-target as someone who has never watched the comedy film /Mrs. Doubtfire/ trying to criticize the main character's tactic to spend more time with his kids as being 'unrealistic' or 'out of character'.

******** Give up any hope you may have that comments here will demotivate me from writing. Distract, yes. Demotivate, no.

Readers who have actually read the story agree that his beloved's inability to comprehend magic is believable in context, so you'll just have to take my word for it, or read the story yourself. The issue is not that his demonstrations aren't convincing, but that she has already decided that he is insane, and magic isn't real. People's beliefs color their perceptions, so people are literally unable to see things they don't believe in. Psychologists have studied this. Show racists a video of a white man robbing a black man, and they'll describe it as a black man robbing a white man because that's what they were expecting to see, so that is literally what they saw. (Considering that seeing is as much of function of the brain as of the eyes.)

Light from his demonstration reaches her retinas, but she's convinced that this is some sort of sleight-of-hand trick as practiced by stage magicians. She's not interested enough in the subject to try to figure out exactly how the trick was done because she wants nothing to do with him and his mad ravings, but she's certain there's some simple, non-magical explanation.

You must be familiar with the phenomenon that no amount of evidence will convince some people of the truth. Just try presenting evidence to a flat-earther or anti-vaxxer. In this story, the truth is the existence of magic, which of course is an even harder sell.

********* /edit: spoiler warnings/

I've got to admit, the problem with that story is somewhat more tricky than the usual variety of PoorCommKills. It's a three-fold amalgamation of a problem, really: [1]the classic PoorCommKills, [2] misinterpretation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_disorder][Delusional disorder,]] [3]and a bunch of other [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWritingIndex][Bad Writing tropes]] for when even the first two are not enough (e.g. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision][No Peripheral Vision,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor][Weirdness Censor).]]

1) Firstly, the classic PoorCommKills. In stories that have badly designed plot structure and heavily rely on PoorCommKills for plot advancement, characters (compared to real people) often have a really faulty understanding of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind][theory of mind.]]

Tom Riddle Senior wants to go make amends with his sweetheart who feels deeply betrayed by him because of how suddenly he has had switched his affections from her to Merope Riddle. A normal person (or a realistic portrayal thereof), in this situation, would make tentative contact, and then ease her into the truth by a gradual chain of statements like "magic exists"→"it allows controlling people's minds, emotions, and affections"→"Meropy used such mind control on me and that is why I seemed to have abandoned you". Such a person would be understanding that it's a lot to take in, and would be providing overwhelming evidence for each subsequent statement. Here's what he tells her instead:

#+begin_quote
  --“I did not kill her! Well. I mean. Not directly.”

  -- “Oh my god.”

  -- “She died in childbirth, all right? So in a way it was my fault, but these things happen. I have the death certificate and everything. And a son, now. Suddenly everything's different. So I thought, as long as everything in my life is changing so radically and unexpectedly, well, I might as well see if I can get you back in the mix somehow.

  [some skipped dialogue]

  -- What would an owl have to say to you?”

  -- “It's a long story, and I'm not allowed to tell it, but, oh hell, I'll tell you. You deserve to know the truth. I can explain everything. You see, there's this secret society of witches and wizards, and they communicate via owl messengers rather than telephones and the post. Merope was a witch, and the only reason I married her was that she gave me a love potion and used a mind-control spell on me. It took me months to break free. By then I'd got her pregnant. So now my son is a wizard, as he inherited his mother's magical ability, although fortunately not her looks. The only reason I know this is because a different witch told me. She claims she's from Australia, but that's actually just her cover story. She's really a time traveler from 1997 who traveled back here to 1927 to try to change her past, our future, so my son doesn't grow up to murder her parents. I confess the paradoxes there don't make sense to me either. Anyway, I'm trying to help my son grow up not to be a murderer, and fit into the wizarding world, hence my correspondence with the wizard who owns that owl. That tapping does make it hard to converse, doesn't it?
#+end_quote

2) Secondly, the delusion misinterpretation.

#+begin_quote
  People's beliefs color their perceptions, so people are literally unable to see things they don't believe in.
#+end_quote

Looks like you're aware of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3lh0kz/is_it_true_that_when_the_indians_saw_ships_for/][this pseudo-factoid,]] or have made conclusions from some other similar ones that have managed to make their way into your worldview.

#+begin_quote
  Show racists a video of a white man robbing a black man, and they'll describe it as a black man robbing a white man because that's what they were expecting to see, so that is literally what they saw.
#+end_quote

You'll have to provide the link to the relevant academic paper for that argument to carry any weight. More than that, a psychological experiment involving misinterpretation of a video is not proof enough for a statement like "people are literally unable to see things they don't believe in"; and is not the same as ignoring someone literally sticking their entire hand inside a wallet either.

#+begin_quote
  You must be familiar with the phenomenon that no amount of evidence will convince some people of the truth.
#+end_quote

Yes, it's called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusional_disorder][delusion.]] Most people are not delusional, this character wasn't delusional prior to her latest encounter with T.R. Snr, and to make your character delusional towards magic specifically, with which she had no prior interaction with, is also bad writing.

3) And lastly, regular human unwillingness to accept things that clash with their strong beliefs and worldview. It could've worked, perhaps, if he was presenting only barely enough evidence for her to be able to double down. But he literally sticks his entire hand inside a magic wallet, and she just ignores it.

#+begin_quote
  He took it out of his pocket and showed her. Much of his forearm fit inside it. She didn't even glance at it. Her worried eyes were fixed on his face. He put it back in his pocket.
#+end_quote

Not only that, but [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce][he immidiately gives up on trying to wave the obvious spatial impossibility even closer in front of her eyes.]]

So, really, this looks like exactly the kind of a frustrating story that heavily relies on entire sets of Bad Writing tropes [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave][to make the plot make any sense.]] Which is what I was telling in my previous comment anyway.

p.s. The prose seems nice though, and that "flower slang" joke was pretty good.

********** I'm confused by your apparent expectation that the protagonist here would act like “a normal person.” His behavior before this firmly established that he is not a normal person, which is to be expected after all the canon trauma he suffered before the story even began. There's no reason to expect that he would act normal in this scene either.

You've done an impressive amount of reading on TV Tropes. If you'd care to do some reading on psychology for a change, I recommend the work of [[https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/][Elizabeth Loftus]] There's also a lot of good information on her [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus][Wikipedia page.]]

Edited to add: OK, I've discussed this with my beta, who says that when my protagonist is at his worst. as in that babbling run-on paragraph, or going through with that awful amortentia plan, that's when he's acting most normal. After the hell Rowling put him through, it's remarkable that he can function at all. I think my beta is right. If you're going to complain about anything, you should be complaining that this traumatized victim is too functional in much of the story, not that he's too dysfunctional in a few places.

I'm not saying that I expect for him to be normal, I'm saying that the way he currently is makes him be used by the writer as a plot / handwaving device for designing bad plot developments and scenes, like the ones I've quoted. If we went with the "it's subjective" / "depends on audience preferences" stance, then nothing would've been open to criticism at all; and just because some people like your story doesn't mean you have to expect to never get criticised by others who don't.

If that's what your readers want to read, what your beta says is ok to write, and what you want to write, --- then of course do whatever you want. I am only criticising it from the point of someone who doesn't find these things appealing in a story; and your response is being "that's the way it's intended to be". So seems like further discussion is moot anyway.

Now in this comment you say, “I'm not saying that I expect for him to be normal.” It's impossible to discuss things with you when you contradict yourself like this.

Human memory is very relevant to our discussion. People get sensory input from the world, which is then processed by the brain before it's stored as memory, then those memories are acted upon. Aside from instant reflexes like pulling away from something hot, we react to our processed memories, not directly to sensory input.

I really recommend reading up on this before trying to present yourself as an expert on psychology. Don't worry about reading the wrong thing. If could hardly be less useful to you than TV Tropes.

There is a difference between short-term memory, and long-term memory. What I am currently aware of regarding unreliable memories is that long-term memories are prone to distortion though time (which is also why witness memories can be inaccurate or straight wrong). What I /haven't/ heard of before, is for short-term memories and / or direct eyesight in the here-and-now to be affected by the person's conceptions. Which is partially why I was requesting for the relevant corroborating article from you, because it would've been an interesting thing to read about.

I'm also not sure that visual perception and visual short term memory are the same, but I don't want to complicate the discussion even more by going in that direction as well.

I've conflated "normal" and "reasonable" in my initial comment, that was my fault. I don't expect main characters to be normal, but most of the time I want them to behave reasonably, because otherwise they (and the story) can quickly become very frustrating in terms of both plot design solutions and local scene developments. Having an unreasonable character as a protagonist gives a carte blanche to the writer to use any number of Bad Writing tropes with a convenient excuse at hand. That was what I was trying to convey. And I would've argued that even a character like the T.R. Snr from that story should've been reasonable enough to have the sense of showing her the magic wallet in a much more obvious way, but then you'd likely have used a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod][Word-Of-God]] to say that no, he actually wouldn't have (which was partially why I was putting that disclaimer about the reader-v.s.-writer dichotomy [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ecaypx/what_do_you_think_of_intentional_inconsistencies/fbbc4z9/][in my first comment]] in the first place, but I guess I should've known better).

That's not a justification. That's a "yes, I know. Just wait for it!". In the case of this story, Hermione made an incredibly stupid mistake that was blatantly out of character. She should have known better, and its one of those things where you aren't sure if its the author being retarded or what. But, it was a plot point that came back to haunt her later and I doubt I would've given the story a chance without those fourteen words from the author.

I absolutely agree with you tho: if author notes are more than one or two sentences long, I'm not even going to read it. And I would've missed out on an amazing story by putting down One Hundred and Sixty Nine after chapter two.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.

** The story has to be written well and the writer has to be qualified enough to make it work. There are several hazards that make this a dangerous writing device to use:

- if the story's generally badly written, --- or even if it's ok by fanfic standards but still has some problems (typos, errors, idiot ball moments, etc), --- then some of the readers will think such twists are just more examples of how bad the story is, and drop it without waiting for the reveal to have a chance to happen. To use an analogy, if I'm watching a film by a master filmmaker with an already established reputation, and notice an inconsistency, I'll be more likely to give it the benefit of the doubt, and build my predictions about further plot developments around the idea of that inconsistency being a hint, foreshadowing, etc. But if I'm watching a B-movie or a money-maker, no-soul blockbuster, then I'll more likely just treat it like a [[https://help.imdb.com/article/contribution/titles/goofs/GFDUF27RBTQGS8UZ?ref_=helpart_nav_42#][goof.]] And in the latter case, that will drop my movie-watching experience regardless of whether or not it actually turns out to be a foreshadowing or not.

  - Also, the further to the left on the sliding scale of average quality the story is, the more readers will end dropping the story like this.

- often when trying to design such twists, the writer will fail to maintain the genuine development of the story. Characters won't be noticing and pointing out some pretty obvious things, or just acting incongruent in general to make it possible for the "hint" scenes (and "twist" arc) to happen.
- if this trope (the unreliable narrator device) gets used too much, it can become annoying enough to make the reader not care about the story at all, any longer.

  - Even without the hidden-clues trope, the unreliable narrator device already requires exceptional writing skills from the writer to be pulled off successfully. Using both at the same time... well, either the author knows what they're doing, or they're practicing their skills with these two tropes at the expense of the story, or just setting for their story to fail without any conceivable benefits at all.

I think one thing that can help is when there are hints to the hints: i.e. when there are some other (subtle) plot-elements that point towards the twist besides those intentional inconsistencies. And to expand on that, it helps when all the inconsistencies are /consistent/ with other elements of the global setting (however contradictory it may sound), and / or are part of one single consistent overreaching plot-arc (instead of the plot device being used for several completely different situations, making it repetitive and overused).

p.s. Great question, OP.

** I love them. I also know that a lot of people are really stupid and miss stuff like, constantly. I'm eternally appalled by comments I read on fics that I follow. Other people will make really, really ridiculous assumptions, miss things the author has openly stated.

Comments; I wonder if that was Daryl's bike.

Me: Is this a joke?

My point is that, authors who choose to use this technique should be aware that if you cater to the lowest common denominator you can't do anything subversive or clever because the lowest common denominator won't get it and will be angry they don't get it. Then again, I hate things that are aimed at the lowest common denominator because I find them boring. Pick your audience based on what you want to write. Want to write something subversive and clever? Then make sure it doesn't bother you if stupid people get pissy that they missed clues or misunderstood something.

** About the pacifism bit. There are many shapes of pacifism, from rejecting every kind of conflict up to pacifism through might of arms. And while that might sound contradictory, that's basically Switzerland, a nation trying to stay out of wars by being armed to the teeth, borders rigged to explode, state of the art equipment and terrain making invasion a very unattractive option.

Another example would be Prussia under Frederick William, who spent up to 85% of his kingdom's budget to maintain a standing army which could rival anyone in Europe without the intention of ever using it. The man was a die hard militarist, but also a pacifist.

But to get back to your question, inconsistencies can be what makes characters. For example, someone claiming to be a pacifist but also enjoying battle. They struggle with their nature, believe themselves above their basic instincts but failing to keep their thirst for blood at bay. Or going full tilt after something bad happened (eg Anakin Skywalker butchering the tribe which kidnapped and murdered his mother).

If you intend to revel them as an imposter, well, it depends how invested people were in your character. I would advise against revealing a fan favourite as imposter because people were enjoying the imposter and will probably like them more than whoever they were impersonating.

*** Yeah, no that's not what pacifism means. Pacifism is "the belief that any violence, including war, is unjustifiable under any circumstances, and that all disputes should be settled by peaceful means."

Or the "opposition to war, militarism or violence." The examples you cited just don't work. Switzerland is "neutral" not pacifist. If you're referring to Frederick William I then you're just making a non-sequitur, he fought offensives wars.

"Pacifism through might of arms" sounds like a rephrased "Just War" which is literally the anti-thesis of pacifism in Western thought. You're right that a pacifistic character might struggle to keep to their ideals which is an interesting character arc in the making but please know that while there are variations within pacifist thinking, whether police violence is permissible, or how resistance movements ought to work, vandalism vs protest vs non-resistance etc.

**** Switzerland was not involved in any wars for many years. They have long ago rejected waging war. That is pacifism. Their militarism was necessary to be able to stay out of wars because they didn't want to fight.

Frederick William participated in one war, where he annexed Swedish Pomerania after Sweden had amassed 15000 men there and peace negotiations broke down. He didn't want to fight, because he saw the army as his "toy" and didn't want to break it. His son made extensive use of the army he had created, but he himself didn't. He was a militarist, but not a warmonger. Also keep in mind that the 18th century was a very different time compared to today. The liberal thinkers of that time would be seen as diehard conservatives by modern standards.

Neither Frederick William nor Switzerland are in any way or form related to the concept of Just Wars. They built up armies to ensure no one could invade them without horrendous cost. That is one way of ensuring peace, making war too unappealing. Kinda like MAD.

***** MAD just simply isn't pacifism no matter how you stretch it. Switzerland avoids wars and avoids making alliances that will lead to wars but they keep an army and armed citizens, that fits no standard definition of pacifism even though its more "pacifistic" than most other nation states.

You're saying Frederick William "didn't want to fight" but what does that mean? He conquered territory and loved his army. And no the classic "it was different back then" doesn't count. There are ancient pacifist traditions from around the world and some major pacifistic teachings that came out of Christianity and led to the formation of groups like the Amish, Quakers, and Mennonites who famously are pacifistic and refuse to participate in war and date to over a hundred years before Frederick William was /born/.

Nah, I didn't say they believed in Just War Theory (although if Frederick William took land he must have thought it was Just... right?) but instead I was just saying that the phrase "pacifism through might of arms" sounds like a cheap excuse for how to go to war even when you "don't want to" which is the oldest trick in the medieval book: see casus belli, "oh I don't want to go to war, but I /have/ to"

****** Your last paragraph is simply wrong though. Neither example I gave were interested in waging wars. That is pacifism, even if it doesn't fit your ideological definition.

Frederick's invasion of Pomerania was the result of repeated violations of Prussian neutrality. He wasn't waiting for a pretense, he watched foreign armies march through his Kingdom for over a decade and wanted to put an end to that, resulting in a very short campaign. He had many opportunities or casus belli later on, but refused to use any of them. You dismiss his branch of pacifism even though he was considered a joke by other monarchs because he was not interested in wars once the Swedish army on his doorstep was dislodged, and that was a conflict he inherited from his father in the first place.

By his own admission, he didn't want to fight because wars cost money and and destroyed the army he painstakingly created. It might not be the pure motivation you'd expect nowadays, but his rejection of warfare is pacifism nonetheless.

On the other hand, too many writers treat foreshadowing like it can be used as an excuse for whatever they want to come up with. Just because you have foreshadowed your bad plot development from Chapter 3 doesn't by itself somehow make that bad plot development into a good one.
