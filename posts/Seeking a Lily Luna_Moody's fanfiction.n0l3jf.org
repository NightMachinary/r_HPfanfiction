Hello,

I am searching a fanfiction I read a few months(years?) back but I can remember the name of it. Here the story: Lily Luna Potter can travel back in time for few minutes. Each time she met Moody at different age (child, teen, young adult, adult...) and they fall in love.

Is there someone who remember reading this fanfic ? Please I really want to reread it!

Thank you
