So, I've noticed a lot of links for things these days are on mobile FFnet. I mean, obviously this fandom is older than smartphones, so the earlier fics were never going to be on mobile FFnet, but it's gotten me curious how prevalent this is these days. Do you read your fic on a computer, or on some kind of mobile device, and why do you favour that device over any other?

I'm a laptop person myself, because my eyesight is shit and phone screens are small.


** Almost exclusively on mobile or tablet. Saving how far I got is very convenient and when browsing, it also shows if I had already begun to read something and ditched it.

I also write on mobile for the most part via GDrive, only using my desktop for spellchecking with Grammarly and to upload stuff.

** Started out reading on my laptop, but for the last couple years I've read exclusively on my phone. It's handy for surreptitiously reading stories at work without using company internet.

** I usually read on my laptop. Sometimes I read on mobile when I"m lying in bed, but like you, my poor eye-sight prevents me from reading too much because I get a headache after a while.

If anything I wished I could just have it all printed on paper, but that would also be a waste of paper.

***** You can use something like [[https://ficsave.xyz][ficsave.xyz]], or if someone links to Reddit using the bot, there is usually a download link that will allow you to save a file directly from Reddit.

***** Heh. Nice.

I will take this opportunity to rec my favourite book-publishing service, Inkshares. It's like kickstarter for books. They run competitions sometimes, too. All you have to do is get a certain number of backers, a lower number to get a paperback publication and a higher number to get hardbacks. Apparently there are also some media types trawling through, so it's possible for stuff to get optioned there as well (selected to maybe be made into tv/movies, etc).

** I use [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (also available as the Calibre addon, if the command line utility is too much) and download everything as EPub. First it makes me automagically archive of plenty of good stories (and some of them are not available in their original location anymore), and second I really don't care where I read the stuff. Surprisingly (to me) I read mostly on mobile (because it is just available everywhere), often using text-to-speech functionality to listen to the story while working. I bought couple of standalone LCD readers (and again, read using EPub reader), but in fact I don't use them much, phone is just more available. Sometime I read on the computer (nothing can beat 21" display), but not as much as I would expect it to.

** I use mainly my phone, but every little once in a while I read on my computer, because I keep my studio headphones there, and they're great for when I want to listen to music when reading.

On my phone I use the official ffn app for reading ffn. For AO3, I generally download the fic as an epub and then I use an epub reading app.

I wouldn't mind having a laptop, but a good one is expensive and I already have a pretty good desktop computer.

** I usually read on my e-reader (sony 2012, an investment I can recommend to anyone). However, I search for all my fics in the mobile app, because the mobile app for FFN has just way more options than the search on the website. Then I use Calibre and the FanFicFare plugin to download and manage my e-books, including fanfiction. It also automatically updates fanfictions with a few clicks.

I connect my e-reader to the computer every 2 weeks of so, which usually is more than enough.

** I bought a kobo clara and it's amazing for fic. I do have to download the fics but AOOW has that function anyway. The device is super light, lasts forever and I can read in bed at night with all the lights off and set the night filter on with 2% of glow filter. I dont get distracted by anything on my phone or have to deal with my heavy laptop.

**** I download them in epub format and drag them to the main drive. When I put them in a folder (which made way more sense) the ereader didnt read the files. So I downloaded a book on it, connected it to my pc and checked where the book went and it was the main drive.

** These days, generally my tablet cuz I like to read in the bath. Soaking with a good fic and a glass of wine has become one of my favorite end-of-day rituals. It's something like a 7" screen and I can adjust text size, so it's not nearly as eye-straining as my phone.

I still use my laptop to write, but I don't read on it nearly as often as I used to.
