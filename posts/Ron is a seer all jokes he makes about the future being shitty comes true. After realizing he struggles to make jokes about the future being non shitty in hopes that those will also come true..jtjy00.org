** Not the prompt, but reminiscent of my absolute favorite prank of any story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001792/1/All-According-to-Plan]]

In which 13 yr old Bellatrix Black has been brought to 1990's. After Trelawney predicts Harry's death at the beginning of the year, Bella begins a year-long campaign of making Trelawney's lesser predictions come true. Lav's rabbit dies, Snape's robes are vibrant, and the entire school catches a cold... all correctly predicted by the divination professor. Finally, at the end of the year, Bella removes Dumbledore's tracking charms from Harry, and they go on vacation in America. The wizarding world thinks Harry's dead, and Trelawney literally goes mad.

** It's not a focus of the fic by any stretch, but in linkao3(9821300) Harry notices that Ron keeps making throwaway comments that predict something six to eight months out. Trelawny, of course, doesn't notice this at all.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** “Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer” by Sarcasm Dragon on FF.net is sort of like this, but it starts with Ron bs-ing his way through divination and ‘becoming' a seer under Trelawney's wing
