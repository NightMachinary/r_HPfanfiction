*The Premise*

The main idea of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630/chapters/14514247][The Sum of Their Parts]] is to ask what it would take for Harry Potter to decide to be a Dark Lord and how he would go about establishing himself without sacrificing the depth of his bonds with Ron and Hermione. Fed up with the Ministry of Magic priming itself to repeat the mistakes of its recent history, Harry decides to take the fate of the wizarding world into his own hands again -- this time by force. The story begins in September 1998, 4 months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and is canon compliant apart from the epilogue.

*The Writing*

Mostly the writing is pretty solid. It is 143,000 words and was published over the course of about 3 weeks in 2016, however small indications from the author's notes point to it having been written in its entirety before any of it was published, and it has evidently been reviewed as it reads quite cleanly. There are a few grammar mistakes here and there, but most of it is small, isolated stuff which is easy to miss and doesn't interfere with the reading of the story. The only thing which is reoccurring is that the author will sometimes write an adjective in the place of an adverb, such as “particular” or “proper” instead of “particularly” or “properly”. As it's a common Britishism I thought it was a deliberate addition at first, but then I saw it occurring outside of dialogue as well, so the author may very well just be British.

On that note, the fic does do very well to paint a British context. There's no coffee, but tea and biscuits all round and not a hint of Americanisation to be seen. More so than usual, I noticed a lot of British phrasing and speech tics amongst the characters, making it easy to ‘hear' a British accent when many of them spoke. Molly Weasley came through very well, and there's also a particularly well-written scene in which Harry talks to a hag with a Cockney accent in Knockturn Alley.

Rating-wise, violence occurs in the fic but mostly off-screen, and there is no sexual content in the fic at all.

​

*The Plot*

​

Whilst I do think that it's an interesting idea to see what it would take to make canon Harry decide to become a Dark Lord, it isn't something which can be done believably in the first few paragraphs of the story the way it is here. The inciting incident is Harry reading an article one morning which gives him such outrage that he decides he needs to become a Dark Lord and personally take down the Ministry. What made the article so offensive? It's not clearly stated, but we are eventually given the impression that there is some sort of bill being put to the Wizengamot which would restrict the rights of ‘dark' creatures such as vampires and werewolves. Harry sees this as a threat to Teddy Lupin as a part werewolf, even though ultimately the bill is not passed. After careful convincing, Ron and Hermione agree to support Harry in any way they can, including binding him with an unbreakable vow so that he will always have limitations.

In this story, Harry has been living alone in Grimmauld Place since the Battle of Hogwarts. He has not joined the Auror Program, or gone back to Hogwarts to finish his schooling. Up until the opening scene, he appears to have decided to turn his back on the wizarding world and say “screw you all, I've done enough.” I don't really see an issue with taking this tact -- J.K Rowling's version of what happened after DH is not for everyone and I think this is a pretty valid interpretation. The problem is that a Harry who makes a snap decision to become a Dark Lord and take over wizarding Britain cannot spring fully formed from a Harry who has no interest whatsoever in being involved in world affairs anymore.

I can certainly understand to a degree the feeling of hopelessness on Harry's part that the Ministry will ever change its stripes, and the author leans into Ministry corruption perhaps more than was strictly likely, but it's not outside the realm of reasonable expectation. Death Eaters are still bribing their way out of Azkaban, Lucius Malfoy is somehow still gaining influence again and the Wizengamot is pretty much just made up of the Sacred Twenty Eight and pushes bills according to pureblood ideals.

Even so, there's no reason why Harry should be so desperate at this point that he would turn dark to change things. He canonically has the single most influential voice in all the wizarding world at this point, not to mention the trust of the Minister for Magic. The tools to make sweeping changes in the Ministry are already at his disposal, and in J.K's canon, this is exactly what Harry does with the help of his friends. A Harry who is willing to jump into extreme violence and another war to fix things should at the very least be a Harry who has tried using these other, more obvious and less painful avenues available to him and found them to have failed his best efforts. Even then, the inciting incident probably needs to have tangible consequences on someone Harry cares for before becoming a Dark Lord is the only conclusion left to him.

Premise aside, there are two main themes running through the course of the fic. The first one is the process of how to become a Dark Lord, and this is done quite well. I was impressed by the care the author took in the writing of the mechanics of magic - particularly soul magic, blood magic, the unbreakable vow and veritaserum. All of it is canon compliant and care is taken to ensure that the magic Harry learned developed slowly, and with limitations. For example, Harry spends a year training to resist veritaserum, has a lot of trouble with it, and never becomes perfect at it. It is also established that Harry does not have a natural affinity with Occlumency and will never gain any real skill in it. Harry's magical abilities, though considerable, never feel overpowered or out of place. Lots of time is devoted to the trio planning for all scenarios - Ron proactively learns healing magic in anticipation of Harry not being able to go to St Mungo's for example, which I thought was quite clever. It is a meticulously logical story, and this is a great world building feature.

There is a heavy emphasis on preparation over action though, and this is apparent both within the narrative and when the fic is looked at as a whole. Whilst there are a scattering of action scenes when Harry and George Weasley carry out vigilante justice on acquitted Death Eaters, far more page time is devoted to Harry studying, practicing magic, and going over plans and contingencies with Ron and Hermione. You get the sense that very little goes wrong for Harry because he is so careful and so prepared. Without providing spoilers, the fic itself takes a similar tact of focusing largely on Harry's preparation to take on the wizarding world rather than how he actually carries it out, which can feel like something of a cop out if you were looking forward to seeing a Dark Harry in action.

The second running theme is why a good person would become a Dark Lord. Harry spends a huge amount of his page time justifying becoming a Dark Lord to other people, and it is entirely too much exposition. Whenever some old friend or acquaintance meets Harry and suspects he's going dark, they inevitably ask why, and instead of this being narratively brushed over, we get the full spiel every single time. It amounts to “the Ministry needs to change and only Dark Lords ever manage to enact real societal change, so if I have to dirty my hands and my name to make a better world for Teddy then so be it”. The Gryffindor idealism used to justify a Machiavellian approach reminds me a lot of [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwinzs3_uqzjAhWLaCsKHfG1DksQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deviantart.com%2Fquicksilver22%2Fart%2FDemotivation-Lawful-Evil-109579986&psig=AOvVaw04BTal98wyyH-qXQ-FmIOx&ust=1562920460651072][The Operative from Serenity]] actually. But aside from the speech becoming repetitive, it becomes apparent that the story treats Harry's reasoning -- if not always his methods -- as morally watertight. I'll go into this further when I talk about characterisation.

The concept of a Dark Lord is strange in this story. The below description is given in the first chapter:

"/Dark Lords had some specific requirements to properly claim the title. Magic -- powerful, skilled magic, preferably Dark, and an abundance of it -- followers, and money./ "

Harry uses this as a framework for his campaign, deliberately learning dark magic and planning his resources around this definition. He could have publicly opposed the Ministry and performed many of the same actions under the label of “vigilante” or “revolutionary”, but he deliberately chose a to push a term which was synonymous with evil, because he is convinced that he must be a Dark Lord to get anything done.

History called Grindelwald a Dark Lord retrospectively, and Voldemort's followers called him the Dark Lord at his own behest, but this fic treats it like an official title that you just choose to wear or not. If you do choose to wear it, then everyone else needs to refer to you as “your Lordship”, etc, which is a bizarrely validating way of referring to a criminal.

​

*Characterisation*

​

This story very much centres on Harry, Ron and Hermione, who not only stick together through Harry's choice, but move in together and commit to his cause entirely. It is one of the most heart warming things about the story, that no matter what, Ron and Hermione do their utmost to stay by Harry's side and support him, and to see how much Harry loves them for it. Hermione also acts as a check to Harry's power as a condition of supporting him, which involved some very good scenes.

It's a bizarrely asexual fic. The Harry/Ginny pairing is dismissed quickly and quietly (more so than I feel canon Ginny would allow), and Ron/Hermione is shortly after revealed to only be for show at this point. There are no other romantic interests or entanglements for the trio through the story, and the only pairing going on at all is a bit of Neville/Hannah, far in the background. If you wanted a fic with no focus whatsoever on pairings but a heavier focus on friendship, this will work very well for you. In place of romantic comforts, the trio take a deep but platonic comfort in each other.

One interesting aspect of the story was that the trio elect to mark themselves in a functionally similar manner to the Dark Mark to link themselves together. They use Borromean rings as the symbol to represent a sort of “all for one” bond, and it because it is soul magic at work it makes them all heavily reliant on and sensitive to each other. I wondered briefly if the author was going down an OT3 road when the three of them started sleeping in the same bed together, but this is never dwelt upon and always remains platonic. Largely it seems to alleviate their PTSD, which not just the trio but every character seems to have in this fic.

Although not much focus is given to Ron or Hermione as individuals -- they are both entirely devoted to Harry's cause throughout -- they are largely kept in character. Ron's personality and strengths are especially well-written, and you really get the sense that the author appreciated all Ron has to offer as a character and a friend.

My problem with characterisation is mostly with Harry. A fair amount of the issue is covered in the plot section, but there are other things which feel jarring because we're supposed to be dealing with canon Harry, not an AU Harry.

We need to talk about house elves.

Near the beginning, there is a flippant reference to Kreacher having killed himself after the Battle of Hogwarts, and Harry's delight at his demise. Whatever happened to the poignant lesson Harry learned through Kreacher during DH about the need to treat house elves with kindness and respect, and the effort Kreacher went to afterwards in order to make Grimmauld Place welcoming for Harry? What happened to “/Fight! Fight for my master, the defender of the house-elves!”/ during the Battle of Hogwarts? This Harry doesn't seem to remember that.

This Harry decides that doing the menial upkeep of Grimmauld Place himself is too much work, and anyway he wants a possible in for learning more about such dark families as the Lestranges, so when the Lestrange family house elf is abandoned to the House Elf Relocation Office, Harry decides to go there and get himself a new one. This scene is written a lot like you might write someone examining dogs on a visit to the pound. Harry thinks about their ‘big sad eyes' as he inspects the line-up, and how he just wishes he could take all of them home. His heart breaks for the elf he actually came for, who has been nicknamed Mute because the Lestranges cut out her tongue. We never learn her real name. She is never offered a wage. She never serves any purpose in the story other than to cook, clean, and disappear before she is noticed -- she doesn't even give Harry insights into dark wizards, which was half the excuse for buying a new slave in the first place.

I really needed to bring this up because not only is it very out of step with post DH Harry, it's also quite telling that neither Harry nor Hermione see the irony of campaigning for creature rights whilst being actively involved in the house elf slave trade, showing a certain selective blindness to the ways in which they contribute to the poor way other creatures are treated by wizarding society.

Harry's self-righteousness is a very Gryffindor and in-character quality, as is his terribly naïve impression that taking over the Ministry is something that he can do with little help from anyone else. But despite his “I'll put the world on my shoulders” attitude, he's also deeply resentful at everyone else that he ‘has to' do it. He often complains that not just the Ministry, but every adult in his life failed him, failed to fight for him, expected him to face Voldemort, etc. When you think about Umbridge and the DA in Harry's fifth year then you can certainly understand Harry's anger, but when he has this tantrum in front of McGonagall and Shacklebolt as well, who in fact never failed to put their lives on the line to protect him, it felt like he really needed to look at the sacrifices that were made on his behalf and stop acting like such a martyr.

Instead, the fic suffers from its fairly singular agreement with Harry. No one points out that Harry's crusade for dark creatures/part humans/muggleborns is exactly the same as Hermione's crusade for house elves -- acting for oppressed minorities without ever consulting them to see what they want. Or that killing in the name of minority rights only ends up associating those minorities with violent extremism and setting their movements back decades. No one even points out that Harry has no idea what his goals are. Does he want to remove the Wizengamot? Become a dictator? What kind of legislation is he going to set up that will somehow fix all of the Ministry's failings? It's all well and good to point out the problems, but you need to know what the new system is going to be before you go tearing down the old one, and no one seems to think that this next step is important enough to ask about.

Whilst some people he explains himself to respond with a vague “well okay, but once you cross a line I might have to fight you”, nearly everyone just ‘tiredly' sort of agrees that he's got a point. I'm not kidding about the ‘tired' part either -- that word is used to describe character reactions in this fic no less than 61 times. I desperately needed one character -- just one -- to laugh their ass off at how stupid the title “Dark Lord Potter” sounds instead of taking it with such grave seriousness, and tell Harry he's being a wanker. It didn't have to change Harry's mind, it just needed to be said.

​

*The TL:DR version:*

This story needed to be longer. It had a good premise, world building and trio dynamic, but the set up was too weak for the premise to be executed effectively and believably. I do think there are solid elements to this story that make it worth reading and enjoyable (such as the trio's bonding and magical research), and I'm unwilling to overall call it a ‘bad' fic, because I don't think it is. However I can't really call it a good fic either, because the main purpose of the story was to show what it would take for canon Harry to become a Dark Lord, and I don't think it managed to really accomplish that.

100% agree. I like what is there of the story, but it seems more like a large snippet or premise than an actual complete story arc.

** I was intensely underwhelmed by this fic considering how often it's recommended and touted as a top tier work within this community.

I feel it's only well regarded because of how often it's recommended, and it's only recommended because of some fortuitous feedback loop. Members of the sub see it being recommended so often they understandably assume it must be good.

** I enjoyed it.

That said, I've never understood why Harry's first reaction to seeing that newspaper article was to immediately assume that he would have to become a Dark Lord or else everything would stay the same. It felt so very sudden that I had a hard time getting into the fic for a while, but then it started to get better I suppose (really liked the trio's interactions).

I agree with you that if it were longer, it would be a much improved work. I imagine that we would see Harry fight from the inside to make things better, then become jaded after some time with no real changes, and only then he would consider turning dark to save Teddy. For that reason, I like linkffn(Made of Common Clay) a little bit better - we don't exactly see Harry going through this process but by the time the fic starts he's 30, bitter as hell, and willing to do what it takes to force Wizarding Britain to just be better.

*** Yeah I think one of the reasons a deeply jaded and Machiavellian Harry didn't work here was that it was only set a few months after the end of the books, before Harry could possibly have made an honest attempt at anything else. Starting the fic when Harry is 30 is already far more plausible.

** Hello OP. Your review was really detailed, comprehensive and well-written. I'm actually on Chapter 3 of 'The Sum of Their Parts' after somebody recced it on r/ Fanfiction. I enjoy the story and I like the writing style, though I didn't know this fic might be polarizing to some. I'm not really an HP fan though and I only read HP fics sporadically, but after people mentioned post-war Dark Harry on r/ Fanfiction I actually started looking through this subreddit and tumblr for other such fics. Most of the ones people rec are incomplete, abandoned, or usually /insanely/ long, which I have to admit isn't really all too appealing for a casual reader. So I'm just wondering if you have any recommendations for Dark Harry or any good post-war fics with a much more believable plot?

Thank you.

*** Firstly thank you very much for your compliments on the review! If you are enjoying The Sum of Their Parts there's no reason why you shouldn't continue on it either.\\
On the second point, unfortunately no I don't have any recommendations on a Dark Post-War Harry. I started on this subreddit as a way of filtering to some of the better fanfics out there, and a lot of what I've been recommended has been great. I enjoy fanfiction, but I haven't read the same sheer bulk of work that many redditors here have. My schtick is that I like to review the fanfictions I've been recommended, and I've only gone through half a dozen so far. I do hope that as I go through more people will be able to use my reviews for recommendations, but at this point the only other one I've looked at involving a Dark Harry was the Downward Spiral Saga, but that one isn't post war and might be too dark for what you're looking for.

I'd suggest you make a post using the request flair, stating all of your preferences in the description (genre, length, time period, etc) and see what comes up. You'll probably get a really good response, because loads of people are happy to share the stories they've read and enjoyed, and have read prolifically across the internet. I hope you find something you really enjoy.

**** Hii! I binged a little last night and I'm already at Chapter 8. Just a few more to go.

Looking back, I can definitely see where your comments and reviews are coming from. I definitely read a lot of 'looking tired/tiredly' and 'Teddy becoming a second-class citizen' among other things. After reading those quite a number of times last night, even I got /tired/ of it. (Excuse the pun.) Still, there's a lot to admire about the story, especially for someone like me who's not in the fandom and can't write anything as detailed and thought-out as this. As you said, the St. Mungo's thing and the mentions of PTSD and both Ron and Hermoine being quite fleshed out were all good points.

The HP fandom remains intimidating and confusing to me, but there are kind and welcoming readers so I will definitely consider posting a request here. Maybe after I finish reading The Sum or after I check out what AO3 has to offer.

Thank you very much!

***** I hope the fandom isn't too intimidating. It's probably the largest one on the internet, but the greatest thing about that is that you can pretty much express any taste you want and someone has written about it. Dark Harry is fairly popular as I understand it, and people are always keen to share fics which have made an impression on them.

There's a lot of really great stuff out there, and I find going through reddit is a good way to find it, because with the sheer amount of fic there is to wade through, you'll have a hard time finding the good ones without recommendations.

Thank you again for your comments on the review. If you ever find a fic you think could do with a review itself, let me know. I'm always on the lookout for more recommendations - just be prepared that I'll give my honest opinion on it! :D
