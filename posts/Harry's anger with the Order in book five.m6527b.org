In book five and in a lot of fanfiction happening at the same time, Harry is angry with the Order for not getting him out of Dursleys' house sooner and not telling him anything. I understand his frustration, but the fact is, Harry was receiving the Daily Prophet. If he had read each paper thoroughly and had bothered to use his brain he would've noticed that Voldemort was laying low and there's nothing to tell him anyway. He was always lazy and expected everyone else to do the work for him.

Also, he should've realized that now that Voldemort was around he was a target and bringing him to the Weasleys' would've been dangerous to them. But he was too self-observed to care about it.

Finally, the Order was made to combat Voldemort. It wasn't a baby-sitting agency. Despite the danger Dumbledore hadn't limited him to the house. He could've got out and found some way to entertain himself. I'm sure if he had asked for some of his money to be converted to muggle money and sent to him Dumbledore would do it.


** You sound like every fanon Snape bashing fic put together, you do get that right?

He was a kid who got kidnapped by a psychopath and watched a friend get viciously murdered in front of him. Any idiot would know that with someone in that kind of situation leaving them alone with people who actively disdain him is about the worst way to handle this possible.

As for making the Weasleys a target, no he would not have. It was already easily common knowledge that was extremely close with the Weasleys so it would hardly draw new attention and this was the summer that Voldemort was trying to lay low to capitalize on Fudge burying his head in the sand. He absolutely would not have risked a full on assault of a well known Wizarding family to take a potshot at Harry that had zero guarantee of success.

As for the baby sitting remark, funny how they seemed to have no problem with having Ron and Hermione chilling at Headquarters then huh? It's pretty much all or nothing kind of deal, either they aren't a babysitting service and the Weasley children and Hermione should be at their respective homes or they should have brought Harry there at the same time so he could be with people who gave a shit.

Lastly, if you actually bothered to remember instead of indulging in your weird counter bashing rant Dumbledore was for all intents and purposes ghosting Harry that summer. I doubt he would have even responded much less done it.

*** Plus the Order's headquarter is Sirius's home, so while the Order isn't a babysitting agency, Sirius's being his godfather I say it would be pretty normal for him to be there, even more secure than Privet Drive since Grimmauld Place is under a fidelius

For the Weasley though, yes everyone know he is friend with the Weasleys, but it's Harry who is the target of Voldemort, so while they are targeted too, Harry going with the Weasleys would make them even bigger targets and thus endanger them. Doesn't stop him from going to Grimmauld Place where his only remaining family lives though

**** After Fifth year yes it would but that summer, no. Even the OP admits that this was when Voldemort was laying low, he wouldn't risk a full fledged assault while the Ministry still had the vast majority of the population that he was dead and he had the freedom to move however he wanted. So Harry being there wouldn't have placed the Weaselys or Headquarters in any more danger than they were already in.

***** True, either way the headquarter is under a fidelius, and with Dumbledore as a guardian, that make it the safest place in britain

** The whole point of the Order of the Phoenix is to have more information than the general public. If they have just as much information as a biased newspaper, then they're obviously doing something wrong. Of course, they are under no obligation to share such information with Harry, but that isn't the point.

Ah, yes. A teen who just saw an acquaintance murdered and was tortured by a dark wizard craves for the company of his two best friends (who are obviously together, without him)... So self-obsessed.

One of the main priorities of the Order was to keep Harry safe. Even though Voldemort was lying low, they only went to Platform 9¾ with "security". IIRC, Harry didn't even go to Diagon Alley to get his stuff, Mrs. Weasley did. Going out in the muggle world is the exact opposite of what the Order would want him to do. They practically took on the role of "babysitting" Harry themselves.

Canon Harry clearly didn't hold Ron and Hermione's "useless" letters against them. He gave up on it in a space of 3 pages, got off of his capslock-screaming high and let the topic die.

Now, if you want to call out fanfic authors for their needless bashing, sure, go on. The whole "Harry is a selfish, lazy, over entitled brat" is counter-bashing of the worst sort.

** There is a fanon that launched a thousand bashes: that Harry was kept incommunicado. Whereas, his friends did write to him, just not about the things he wanted to read about.

Now, to add to the OP, it was, in fact, a bad idea to put information about the Order into a medium that could be intercepted by a delinquent house-elf, precisely when the Ministry was looking to find dirt on Harry and Dumbledore both.

That said, I do get the sense that nobody properly explained this to Harry. A "Sorry, Harry, but we don't know who is could be reading these. Remember Dobby?" would have gone pretty far. (Or, maybe they did write that, and Harry was just being a self-obsessed teenager.)

** Well at this point Harry is suffering from PTSD evidenced by constant nightmares of Cedrics fate on top of being a moody teenager. I mean from an unbiased perspective ofcourse noone will give a 15 year old with a short temper information on a secret organizations goings, but we look at it from Harry's PoV.

Another point I have looked at lately is that Harry is very very selfish about the war in his cannon portrayal, going "noone else will die for me" etc. And constantly neglecting the fact that noone is fighting for him, but rather the future he stands for. Which ofcourse given his story isn't surprising but when you look at it like that it makes sense for him to be annoyed.

** Another thought that occurred to me as well that I can't believe I skipped over, The Daily Prophet? Are you joking? It's a blatantly biased rag that is completely and totally under Fudges thumb, they don't print a word he doesn't tell them to and at that point the official party line was “Potter and Dumbledore are crazy lying famewhores, don't believe a word they say. Voldemort is dead and never coming back.”

What exactly was he supposed to draw from that? Voldemort could have incinerated fifty muggle villages and they still would have stuck to the party line and blamed it all on Sirius.
