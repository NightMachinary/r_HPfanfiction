I'm looking for a fanfiction that is set in the summer after Sirius's death. Harry gains his inheritance from him which includes a black/dark mark on the side of his face ushering him into the community of dark wizards. He is apprenticed to an a man in an apothecary in knockturn alley, under his alter /something/ black. I can't remember the name he chooses for his Lord Black Identity. I also remember that because the potter family is light and black family is dark his alter literally has a separate appearance and everything. If anyone has any idea what piece of work I'm referring to I'd be extremely happy. I've searched just about every pair of key words I can think of to try to find that story. Also last I saw it was on fanfcition.net and I assume its still there!

*Edit: After having searched all night, on the last random search I did I found it. And rather then the black inheritance its a Peverell inheritance and the story was adopted from the original author by someone else! for anyone interested here's a link!*

** Its a good story, which was unfortunately abandoned by both its original author, and the author who adopted it.
