Are there any fics where Harry gets raised in hogwarts like that has to be the best idea ever just imagine baby Harry playing with a basilisk or pretending to be lie a house elf or whatever cute ass stuff would happen just imagining the possibilities give my cuteness radar a headache AAEEEEERRRIIOOOOOPLAAAAAAAAAANES


** Wow. I just read that yesterday.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][No Place Like Home]] has Petunia refuse to raise Harry, so Harry is brought to Hogwarts and details the alternate timeline resulting from that. There's an adult content warning, but I can't fathom why unless it's because it's part of a 'what if' series and one of the other parts might go somewhere more adult?

[[/u/EternalFaII]] can also take solace in the fact that Hogwarts herself DOES play a role in Harry's upbringing in subtle little ways.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

** Man, I read that as Harry is raised /by/ hogwarts and I was confused af. Your idea sounds nice though. A bit of light-hearted fluff.

** I started reading one but harry basically was a normal student and it began at his 11th birthday; how did he not sit in on classes or get taught how to do spells by older students? The whole thing made no sense. Sure, he shouldn't be as knowledgeable as a seventh year should be but he should have some pretty good basis of knowledge.

I think it's in my follows list, i'll check.
