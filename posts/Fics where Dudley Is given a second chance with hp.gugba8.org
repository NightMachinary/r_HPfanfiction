** What do you mean? Some post-war reconciliation? Those I could offer:

- linkffn(6142629) and its (slightly less perfect, but longer) sequel linkffn(6329597).

- [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]] and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=260207][Harry Potter and the Winters After the War by Mrs_Granger]]

- rarely mentioned but still lovely linkao3(This Calls For A Toast, So Pour The Champagne by tinyporcelainehorses)

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

#+begin_quote
  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

#+begin_quote
  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

*** You say it's rarely mentioned but thank you for fighting the good fight and recommending my fic once again! Pretty sure I owe you a substantial chunk of my readership.

Worth mentioning it's also on FFN, although not yet finished there - I'm uploading a chapter every couple of weeks.

*** I love this one and highly recommend it. It's a little bit of a canon retread but i think is still really interesting. There's a sequel that diverges a lot more and brings in plenty of interesting ideas - sadly, as is the way with such things, it's abandoned.

**** While it has been abandoned, did the author add a few chapters in the last year or so? I found /a lot/ more stuff compared to my last read through, but maybe my original memories of the fic were too hazy.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley, 37, has only just put his daughter on the Hogwarts Express and said goodbye when Platform 9 3/4 is attacked. In the ensuing explosion, he blacks out - and wakes up as an eleven year old back in Privet Drive. Confused and wary, he finds himself blundering through his life all over again, and unfortunately, being eleven isn't the only surprise in store.

** Kindness and remorse linkao3(21579097) is a new fic with time traveling Dudley but being a wizard this time around. I think maybe he was a wizard originally (in the fic) but his magic died out because of the original time line upbringing, but going back in time, the magic stayed with him. at least it looks like the author is going that way.

#+begin_quote
  Dudley Dursley lives with the guilt of what his family had done to his cousin, which can never be forgiven. He resents the person he used to be and tries to live as a better person, but a part of himself can never truly get over how cruel he had been to the kind-hearted Harry. After a car accident, he wakes to find himself a child all over again.He sets out to make Harry's childhood better, as much as he can. All the while he must hide the fact, he too, now has magic as well. It shouldn't be too hard, should it?
