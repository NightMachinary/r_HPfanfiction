** I do remember one where Luna had a platypus. Don't remember the fic, and it wasn't more than a paragraph spent on it. Harry was teaching them in the DA, and he thought it a very Luna thing.

On the whole, the animal doesn't affect the patronus and it's function. A corporal patronus is patronus, regardless how it manifests through a person's magic. As amusing as the idea of a slug moving as slug speed to deliver a message or chase dementors is.

** Not sure if this counts as incompetent, but I believe there was one where Lucious Malfoy had a white peacock as a patronous. He was embarrassed about it so he told everyone that he couldn't make a patronous. I think there is also one where Draco had a peacock as patronous. I always thought the idea of the Malfoys with peacock as their spirit animal pretty funny.

** ...I would personally /love/ a platypus patronus.\\
In regards to incompetentness, I think a better question would be if someones animagus form was one of these. A patronus is a patronus. Regardless of what form it takes. be it a tiger or a snail, it's still gonna chase off dementors. The strength of the patronus is related to how well its cast, and even then, better casting won't give you a better form, it'll just be a bit more solid/corporeal/whatever.\\
Although...if the snail was actually snail size, i could see how that'd be a problem.
