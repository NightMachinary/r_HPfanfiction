:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Was a fanfic where, somehow, Gabrielle ended up at Privet Drive during the summer. She then got kidnapped and in the process of saving her, Harry became a vampire/dhampir. Dumbledore then let him join the Order (in a similar role to Remus).

Any help would be appreciated x

** ...You can't become a Dhampir, a Dhampir is born because a Vampire and a Human had a kid, it's literally a half-vampire.

NItpick done I'll have to look for the fic though

*** I'm aware of that, but I'm fairly certain that was the terminology used in the fic itself, as Harry was able to go out in the sun and eat food

**** That's...weird, like the author could have just called him a vampire, Vampires in certain lore do that
