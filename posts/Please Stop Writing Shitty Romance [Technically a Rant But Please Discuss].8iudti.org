Every so often (read: once a week) I want to find a decent-ish story to get my mind off things after work stresses me out. I'll grab a coke (alcohol and Crohn's Disease don't mix well), tell my friends I'm tired and chill with a nice story on my phone or tablet, usually short to medium length (tops 50K). Inevitably, it seems, I end up on a romance story; my fiance says I'm hopeless sometimes.

And the rate at which I get irritated by these has gone up, leading me to accept her words. And that's because the romance is shitty (shocker, I know). Lots of reasons can be given (apparently hands "fitting together perfectly" means ... something (how the hell do hands fit together, much less perfectly??? No, this is not about my small hands, screw you)), but in the past few months one issue seems to plague whatever I try out: Treating the pairing as the reward.

I haven't been in ton of relationships, and I'm no great romance writer, but for the life of me I can't get into stories where the pairing is at the end and BAM!, that's it. Most especially since I seem cursed to find stories where the author plays with the reader despite, even to the characters, the feelings being obvious. The story meanders - with angst and misunderstandings galore - until finally the ending comes and then it all goes right... or even then sometimes these things persist.

And I wish more romance-focused stories would spend time on the parts of a relationship that are more realistic and meaningful. What about how you grow together as you intimately learn the ins and outs of how your partner operates day-today? Or when you know there's something you do regularly which bothers your partner and you work like hell to improve because you see what you have built with each other as worth it? There are days where I don't want to care about nothing and nobody after work, but I eventually (not telling how long it took) worked out that's it's a good idea to help the missus vent and de-stress from her own day beyond the usual "How was it?" She also quickly figured out that, given my meh dress sense and laziness in that area that putting good outfits at the front of my side (corner) of the closet forces me to be presentable.

I could only wish (but not really) that the fun and important part of romance was just getting together. That's fine for stories of course. I just wish that wasn't the "reward". It's not even about slow-burns (those have a similar issue for me, unless the intended pairing are actually growing closer, but I still wish things would /move along/ because the active part of romance is really interesting and provoking as well).

Oh yea pretend this is a discussion and say some insightful things so I don't feel bad about making this thread.


** I would once more jot this down as a problem of the general age of fanfiction writers. They're young. Teenagers to very young adults. To a lot of them the relationship *is* the end goal. There is no comprehension in a lot of them for the, sometimes horribly banal, woes and trials a true relationship entails, further diluted by their own utopic wishes for their prince/princess. They still see a relationship as a symbol of status, rather than their own romantic homecoming that is stretching over decades. They still have thresholds to overcome. Breakups, Sex, Living Together. You write what you know. And all they know is their weekend and school-hall romance, which in its existence itself is their endgoal.

I agree that the details of a relationship - especially the start of one where people start realizing the negatives of someone else and either swallow it, embrace it or ignore it, each course of action having their own sort of consequences - is incredibly interesting. There is also the realization sometimes that they may be even better than expected, and you find yourself lacking, undeserving. This and a million more situations. However, this is an incredible /adult/ thing to realize, and to crave in a fic.

*** I disagree. I'd rather not read about how Hermione has to get over the fact that Ron leaves the toilet seat up, or other piddly shit. Especially not in the middle of a civil war. or a similar plotline. If you have to make the existing relationship into a problem, at least make it a problem that can't be overcome with a little tolerance or some perspective, or a session at the therapist. If I'm reading a romance, I want a romance, not some depressing script from a German indie movie which the director uses to get over his breakup with his wife. Give me emotions, love, passion, uncertainty, adversity - and a freaking happy ending, not some examination of real life couple's problem.

**** Thats completely up to you to like or dislike.

I'll say that while wild whirlwind romance, and sappy first kisses is all fine and dandy, the complexity of a long-going relationship is something that holds a lot of potential for stories with its own interesting depth to it. The banality of conflicts in it is often just the symptom of deeper conflicts which are worthy of being explored.

I'm not sure how old, what gender, which nationality... I'm not sure /who you are/, but I am not suprised that some or most people would not enjoy such a story. The more complex we humans become through our experiences, the more complex our appreciation for stories becomes. Especially when it comes to such /adult/ topics as the maintenance of a long-term relationship, many of us will turn away from it (and I personally couldn't stomach more than a ~3 chapter fic about it either), because we either do not identify with it, or the identification is way too close for comfort.

What I'm saying is: The pink-hued, sappy, happy-ending romance has as much a place in fiction as the depressing, realism-to-the-bone, everyday-grind "German indie movie script" (even though I thought the French were the ones with those, but anyway).

***** Indeed, it has. What prompted me to counter-argue is the idea that such romances are, to quote the OP, "shitty". He could have written "Write more realistic relationship stories" or something equally positive, and I'd not have argued.

That, and the underlying shitty attitude that only teenagers would like a sappy romance with a classic happy ending, and anyone over thirty would want to read about some "realistic relationship" instead. That kind of arrogant drivel creeps up a lot of the time in threads where people tell each other that they are the definition of taste and sophistication, surrounded by a crowd of peasants - usually described as "teenagers".

And my "German Indie Movie" comment is rooted in some 80s clich√©e about depressing German movies. It was a thing at the time - even Mad Magazine got into it. That should tell you at least a little about my age.

I understand that people don't always want to see a romance end with the coming together. But it's a classic happy ending for a reason: It works. It has stood the test of time.

** Yeah, I'm not a fan of those at all. Most authors seem to be unable to come up with believable problems so therefore they resort to miscommunications to add more "drama". As if Voldemort breathing down his neck and an assassination attempt on Katie wasn't enough, lets have his girlfriend give him shit for performing CPR on a dying girl because he touched her tit in the process...

I don't claim to be a great romance author or an expert on relationships, but I definitely try my best to write believable relationships, even if it ends up going against common literary standards. "Them against the problems" is a lot more interesting than "Will they, won't they?" Because really, a civil war doesn't need more teenage drama.

**** Well, besides my own "Dawn of Darkness", which is centered around the premise of Harry and Tonks being stuck in the middle of bad events and only slowly understanding what is even going on, there is "What's a little Death between friends", which is a Harry/Tonks time-travel fic looking to end up being Harry/Tonks/Bellatrix/Lily. Despite sounding like high-quality crack, it is rather serious and has the potential to actually become a decent Harem fic (could be the first one). There is also "Call Me" and its sequel, but I am not sure how well those fit into this request since they are a little heavy on the interpersonal stuff and light on the plot.

linkffn(12774582; 12101842; 10751741)

If you are into crackfics, there's "The Silent World of Cassandra Evans", which has a hilarious fem!Harry interpretation while avoiding the common tropes. The first 5 or so chapters are not that good, however.

** I couldn't agree more.

Sure, if the story is meant to be pure fluff, then having that first kiss as the climax is fine. But too many authors - and reviewers - are obsessed with the "pairing" of a story, and consider plot to be secondary.

It's even worse on this sub, where we have to endure endless requests for "Harry/X" stories, as if the person Harry fancies is the be-all and end-all of the story.

Write a story. If the plot would be better or more realistic if two people got together, then do that. Otherwise it's not important.

** I agree with [[/u/undeadbbq][u/undeadbbq]] in that most fan fiction writers skew towards the younger end of the spectrum and just don't have that much relationship experience. I think you can also take into account what they're exposed to. Most YA literature is focused on the getting of the relationship, not so much the maintaining of one and that's a likely influence. Mass-market romance books such as Harlequins are also focused on the chase with the happy couple riding off into the sunset. I don't know so much what the kids are watching or streaming these days, but I doubt it's shows about people who can make a relationship work long-term.

I've been married for 20 years, so I feel like I have a reasonably good handle on what it takes to keep things going. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to write romance in the same way a person in their very first relationship would. I think I do a pretty good job of keeping things realistic and fun in my own stories, but again, I'm old.

*** The thing is, just as with the military, realistic doesn't mean fun for the audience - or at least not the vast majority of the audience. As anyone who has been in the army knows, army life doesn't mean constant action. It often doesn't involve any action. It involves paperwork, waiting, training, mistakes, missing gear, friction, more waiting and training, human stupidity in all its glory, and occasionally some action. But a story focusing on such a realistic portrayal of war isn't very appealing, even though the author knows exactly how to keep a company supplied and going. Same with romance.

Yes, there is a niche audience for realistic war and romance stories. But it's a niche. And with good reason - it usually doesn't lead to an engaging story.

Just as HP would have been a rather shitty series if it had focused on a realistic portrayal of a magical boarding school's daily life.

****** If that's the sum total of the story, then no, it's not very interesting. Now, using the war story, if you have the struggle of trying to keep the APCs in good repair in the background as a complication to the action, then you have something interesting. Same thing with romance. Two people looking into each other's eyes is very dull (I love you because you're beautiful! No, I'm beautiful because you love me! Barf), but two people trying to find the time to look into each other's eyes while avoiding getting killed is a lot better as Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series has shown. Voyager is my favorite in that series because you have Claire and Jamie getting to know each other again and getting down to the nitty gritty of how this relationship is going to work going forward against the backdrop of rescuing Young Ian.

You're wrong here. Most readers like good and interesting stories and romance story can be interesting if it's written good.

Unfortunately fanfic authors /just can't write/ good romance, because they see their characters as idolized heroes, not real people; and/or don‚Äòt have any relevant knowledge about real life.

******* A romance story can be interesting even if dealing with the daily grind of a relationship - but most authors will fail at that because there's only so much you can do to spruce up what their audience knows from their own lives. The target audience of romance novels generally doesn't want to read about a forty-something housewife dealing with a stressed husband and 2.5 kids. They want the fairy tale with the happily ever after.

And there's nothing wrong with that. Especially in the context of a story where the main plot centres on a group of children saving the country from wizard Hitler.

**** You seem to be missing the point. Lots of romance stories end with the relationship, sometimes forced so that is the reward, the end goal. That's what makes it unrealistic. It's the reverse of what you're saying. It would be as if the author makes the end goal of a military story to be the guy entering the military.

***** Lots of romance stories end with the relationship because that is what people want to read in romances. And lots of war stories end with the war won, because not too many people want to read about demobilisation, occupation hazards, and reentering civilian life with a side order of PTSD when they read a war novel.

****** I don't know what that has to with what I said. I know people do it because it's what they want, I'm saying it sucks for the same reason a hypothetical story where "I entered the military" is the ending of a story about military life. It's probably empty of whatever is interesting about that premise.

******* My point is that the vast majority of romances end with the wedding/coming together because it works.

******** As I said, if you want to read nothing about a relationship, sure. But, I'm pretty confident my OP was about me not liking that so ok. "It works" if the romance angle is mostly vacuous.

**** u/DrunkBystander:

  The thing is, just as with the military, realistic doesn't mean fun for the audience

‚ÄúG.I. Jane‚Äù doesn't agree with you.

It's all about writing skills. If you can't write a good realistic military stories, it doesn't man people don't want to read them.

***** G.I. Jane is the tale of how the main character ends up a special force soldier and adds a mission at the end. It doesn't detail how a special soldier lives once they have achieved their goals, or how daily life is during a war. If it were a romance, it would focus on the getting together and end with the wedding, or the first child - pretty muh what the OP doesn't want.

****** The OP wants a good romance story first of all. It doesn't mean ‚Äúslice of life‚Äù without any action, drama or angst.

As any good story it should contain a proper plot. But instead of action it should focus on relationships and communication between characters including secondary ones. Each should look like a real person, not one-dimensional supporting cast.

Unfortunately mist authors are too focused on the pairing characters and don't develop others.

** It's a good wish. But unfortunately the impossible one.

Most fanfic authors are girls under mid 20s with dreams about Knights and/or Doormats (who accepts any shit the heroine (or hero) throws because he is ‚Äúin love‚Äù with her).

Also Romance is a complex thing to write as any serious relationships between real people. It doesn't help that authors usually idolize canon characters and in their stories they select the traits they like and ignore others. As result new heroes aren't real.

And if an author can't write a real and alive character there's no way he or she can write a good romance.

The last is that good writers rarely have anything to do with fanfiction. They write originals and make money from them.

** Ooh, a chance to link an After Hours video!

Cracked did a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMsp9O0E_jE][great video]] about Rom Coms that hits on part of what you complained about: that all Rom Coms focus solely on the establishment of the relationship and the story ends once the couple gets together, which ignores the majority of time in a relationship, when the two (or more!) people are actually together.
