I am simply searching for a fanfiction where Harry is /popular/ in the entire sense of the word. I /do not/ want him to be snobbish or to arrogant, but would love if he is sarcastic and/or witty. Really, it doesn't matter, as long as Harry is popular and preferably older than he is in cannon and if WBWL fics are recommended or even if Harry is born as Sirius' brother that would work too.

All bashing and no bashing is welcomed as well and all ships are welcomed (including Harry/Fem!Harry) besides Tomarry and I would prefer it if Harry wasn't a female in anything you recommend, but that's okay too.

I am not looking for a Cross-over fic either unless it crosses over with the PJO series, and I want it to be while Harry is still at Hogwarts so no Post DH.

This is quite a hefty order, but if anyone knows a single book that matches anything of what I have just said, I would greatly appreciate it! To help recommenders along, I'll list some fics that I've already read:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068063/1/Of-Quidditch-Pants-and-Persuasion][*/Of Quidditch Pants and Persuasion/*]]

These are just a few that I've saved to my favorites and if anyone can recommend a fic remotely similar, I will say it again, I would greatly appreciate it!

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
