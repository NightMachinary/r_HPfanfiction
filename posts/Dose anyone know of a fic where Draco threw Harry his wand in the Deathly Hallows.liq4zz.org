** Just to clarify that for the deleted scene Draco still does go over to his parents and only breaks away after Neville's bit and Harry 'coming back to life' (Narcissa and her hair are easily visible when breaks away in the deleted scene). That's actually important because it clarifies why Harry needs a wand and how he gets one he can use effectively in a fight against Voldemort.

In the final cut the Death Eaters just let Harry keep the wand he was carrying even though one of them would surely want it as a trophy. In the alternate version Narcissa, who checked if Harry was dead, presumably took back the wand he had since she would recognize it as Draco's unicorn hair wand, the one whose loyality Harry won during the fight at the manor. When Draco comes over to his parents she gives him his original wand back but then he throws it to Harry only a few minutes later.
