Abraxas Malfoy wanted to rule Britain but didn't want to do any of the dirty work. He finds potential in Tom and controls him.

Abraxas dies from dragon pox and Lucius continues his legacy. He kills Narcissa and Draco doesn't even care.

Harry later finds out that the Malfoys were behind everything and that Tom Riddle was just a puppet.
