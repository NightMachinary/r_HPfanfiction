AU's are /especially welcome/. Stories where protagonist ramps up into godhood are best. (aka they dont start out all powerful)


** Well, since nobody recommended it by now, I give you “Hell Eyes” (linkffn(2686394)).

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse linkffn(10685852)]]: The Order summons a MoD Harry who was basically a god.

That was the only HP story I can remember where Harry is god that isn't a crossover. For the crossovers most of these don't actually need context to understand.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9586702/1/Fate-s-Gamble][Fate's Gamble linkffn(9586702)]]: This is Harry ramping up into godhood, it's pretty long at 900k+ words. There's also an incomplete sequel which is basically Harry fucking around in another universe where he was summoned to kill Voldemort, it's pretty entertaining. This is a crossover with Fate, context is useful, but the author explains everything.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10067222/1/Black-Blood-Wizard][Black Blood Wizards linkffn(10067222)]]: This is technically a one-shot. Harry isn't a god in this, but he's the closest thing there is to a god in the soul eater universe. If you know soul eater this is a pretty good read since literally everything in the fandom is a soulxmaka story and this isn't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/1/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not family linkffn(11589304)]]: Again Harry is not a god, but basically is; also still technically a one-shot, just multiple endings. This is a F.E.A.R crossover, I'm pretty sure you don't really need to know F.E.A.R for this as it's a video game and I read this without knowing anything about F.E.A.R. If you do know F.E.A.R then Harry is literally just a second Alma.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10596643/1/Harry-Potter-God-of-Gods][Harry Potter: God of Gods linkffn(10596643)]]: High School DxD crossover. Harry is literally the biblical god. I feel context is probably necessary here unless you can make sense of convoluted anime plot lines without actually watching the shows.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

  Left a Squib when Voldemort was vanquished, Harry Potter is left with the Dursleys with a letter stressing he cannot use magic. However, things go awry and he finds himself with another gift, and abandoned. Found by Harlan Wade, what will happen now? Graphic content, you are warned!

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What if that meant Harry was the new God... we're all f*****! Crack fic. Slightly OP Harry.

**** A few older stories:

I find them incredibly boring, but the million-word [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunrise Over Britain]] and sequel fit what you requested. A shorter piece by the same authors is /Parallels/.

Pretty much any novel-length story by [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] on the same site evolves into God-like Harry.

Also, linkffn(The Awakening Power by sib-ff).
