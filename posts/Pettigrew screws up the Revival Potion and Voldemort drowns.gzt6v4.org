Harry wanted it to happen, and luckily for him, that's exactly what happens. How much havoc could this cause?


** Well, the Death Eaters wouldn't know be called, so they'd be confused about the their Marks.

A lot of it comes down to what Pettigrew does. He might try to kill Harry to cover his tracks. Or he might try to pretend he'd intended it that way all along to ingratiate himself to Harry.

It also depends on what it does to Voldemort. He still has horcruxes, so he's still able to come back. Would he pop up somewhere else or would Harry and Pettigrew see him fly off in some direction? Pettigrew probably at least knows that there's a possibility of Voldemort coming back, but he may not want to follow him after botching it.

Both Snape and Karkaroff noticed their Marks getting stronger, so we can assume other Death Eaters, if not all of them, noticed too. That might make some of them start looking for an answer. Lucius and Bellatrix (who'd have to escaped from prison) are the ones most likely to have more of an inkling of what's going on. Or at least a better starting point.

***** Another soul piece would need to split from him for that to happen, and he hadn't committed any immediate murders at that point to facilitate that. Spirit Voldemort would likely just up and leave like what happened with Quirrel.
