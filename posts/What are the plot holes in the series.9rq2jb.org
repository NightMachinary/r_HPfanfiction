These can work as possible points of divergence, too, so comment anything you can think of!


** Actual plot holes:

- Fake Moody borrows the Marauder's Map in GoF, is never seen to give it back, somehow Harry has it in OotP.

- Marcus Flint sticks around for a year longer than his supposed graduation date. JKR says he failed a year and was held back in a later internet comment, if you take that as canon. But how does someone fail Hogwarts? Fred and George got 3 OWLs apiece and skipped their NEWTs, and as long as they're not signing up to be an Auror, no one cares.

- Lily and James die on the night of Oct 31. Vernon Dursley sees weirdly dressed whackjobs on the street celebrating on the morning of Nov 1. Baby Harry is dumped on his doorstep that night. Where was Harry between Sirius leaving, Hagrid borrowing the motorcycle, and Harry being dropped off?

*** I could kiss you.

Plot holes are not:

- Events and aspects of the world which were unexplained but are explainable (e.g. "why don't wizards use veritaserum/memories in trials?).

- Coincidences which you consider unlikely.

- Characters being stupid.

- Something not being mentioned until it is plot-relevant.

A plot hole is a genuine unsolvable inconsistency.

#+end_quote

I strongly disagree with this narrow defintion of a plothole. If all possible explanations come down to "they are all retardation levels of stupid" or "I'm making up random stuff that's not even hinted at in the source material to invent an explanation" it's still a plot hole. For example all the explanations for why Crouch Jr. doesn't just kidnap Harry in the first week of school and instead tries to enact a complicated plan to have Harry win the Triwizard Tournament are either convoluted or ridiculous and most importantly have no basis in the story. "Yeah uhm, you know, Crouch Jr. prepared meticulously and took acting lessons, to become a really good Moody double, so he could be absolutely sure to never be discovered in months and months of impersonations and having Harry win the tournament is really easy for anyone on staff so this was in fact the safest and best plan he could come up with and not just a plot contrivance"

  Characters being stupid.
#+end_quote

There is a strong and usually very clear distinction between characters being intentionally written as stupid (Grabbe, Goyle) and plot-induced stupidty, which *is* a plot hole.

***** I think we should differentiate between something being a plot hole versus just being an example of poor writing.

Plot holes are outright contradictions in the story which the author didn't try to fix. Plot holes are (almost always) a result of poor writing, but not all examples of bad writing are plot holes

Crouch Jr. having a contrived and poorly explained plan, or certain characters acting stupid to move the plot forward are certainly examples of poor writing, but they aren't by themselves plot holes. In order for it to be a plot hole, there would need to be an actual unexplainable inconsistency.

You yourself used the phrase "plot contrivance", which I think is a much more accurate descriptor of the sort of plotting flaws you are bringing up than "plot hole".

Imagine Crouch Jr. sitting down and trying to come up with a plan on how to kidnap Harry Potter from Hogwarts. Remember he's not trying to write an exciting Harry Potter novel. How does he come up with anything even close to what happens in canon? Hint, he wouldn't. It's an inconsistency, aka plot hole, because human beings who are thugs of a Dark Lord do not think like that. Authors do.

But I don't think we have any large disagreement. This is going to delve into semantics. "Plot hole" for me is a very general term, with a "plot contrivance" being a subset and particular form of a plot hole.

******* We don't know much about the resurrection ritual in harry potter. Reasonably it would involve a lot of preparation, perhaps rare ingredients (as powerful magic usually does). So they needed a date and time so Peter could get it all ready in time for harry appearing. But what if they set it at the start of the year, and Crouch couldn't grab harry? Even if he knew about the opportunity in advance, would he be able to contact Peter in time? Eventually he could have come to the conclusion that modifying the port key, and stalking the maze, would have been the best time to do it.

******** I'm happy to elaborate, maybe you can explain your perspective on things as well:

I agree with your previous definition on how a plot hole is an inconsistency that is not explained by the text.

A plot contrivance is a character acting in a particular way out of character or the mechanics of the world suddenly changing/appearing in order to move the plot along (both of which are inconsistencies).

Other types of plot holes that aren't plot contrivances (which means that plot holes can't be a subset), most of which are mistakes: An already dead character reappearing, characters knowing things that they couldn't have learned, logic errors, contradictions to biology/physics (unless there's a reason why those aren't valid in the fictional world - like when magic exists).

That's easily explained. The kind of magic Dumbledore protected Harry with couldn't be easy to cast. Add that time to the time deciding what they were actually going to do with Harry.

** Harry's escape to the Burrow in DH. The entire idea is flimsy and sometimes I wonder if JKR wrote it while imagining what the fight would look like on screen.

Three other options that would have worked better:

- Harry goes straight to the Burrow after sixth year.

- Harry uses polyjuice to look like one of his relatives.

- Harry asks either Dobby or Kreacher to take him to the Burrow.

Another problem I've mentioned before is when Voldemort revives. He uses Harry's blood so, theoretically, Voldemort should have been able to waltz into Privet Drive anytime he wanted. My only comfort for this /not/ happening is a throw-away line by Dumbledore in HBP: "The protections I erected on this house" or something like that.

Methods for Harry to escape from Privet Drive in DH.

1.  Moody says: "A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out.". They think the Minister is loyal to Voldemort and they are worried to commit an imprisonable offense? WHO CARES AT THIS POINT?! Just make a portkey. They are out to kill you and subjugate all of your loved ones, it literally doesn't matter if they want to imprison you too.

2.  Invisibility Cloak: Harry just walks out of the House on a random day and takes a bus to anywhere. Portkey from there.

3.  Polyjuice/Animagus: McGonagall walks in to visit Harry and leaves an hour later. During the night a cat jumps the fence.

4.  Polyjuice/Metamorphagus: Nymphadora visits Harry and leaves an hour later. No one takes notice of "Petunia" going on a shopping trip she never returns from later.

5.  Polyjuice: Dudley Dursley takes a ride on a bus. He never returns.

6.  Harry takes off his glasses and wears a fake moustache. Leaving the house in broad daylight he takes the bus to the next town. Or just takes a long walk.

7.  Polyjuice: Order members take polyjuice and get their pictures taken anywhere outside of Surrey pretending to be Harry. Leak picture to the daily prophet. If you want be really elaborate get seen in Hogsmeade or somewhere else. Be real Harry: No one care about Privet Drive anymore

8.  Vanishing Cabinet: Acquire a pair.

9.  Dobby or Kreacher take Harry to the Burrow (thanks [[/u/abnormalopinion]])

10. Build a giant wooden horse with a garland that spells in huge letters "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY!". Roll it in front of the entrance of the house. Roll it away a day later. [still makes more sense than that Seven Potters crap]

--------------

Edit: The whole sequence wouldn't be as bad if there weren't so many people involved, considering each one of them should be able to point out what a stupid fucking plan it is. Harry on his own deciding to try to make a run for it on a broom would be perfectly believable and in line with his short-sighted hot-headedness.

**** Lol at the reverse trojan horse idea!

But yeah surely the invisibility cloak thing is the obvious way to go. Plus, both the books and fanfiction make it way too easy for Death Eaters to find people in the Muggle world. E.g. Ron walking straight into a bunch of snatchers, odds of that are crazy low considering that it's thousands of wizards vs. millions of Muggles. Harry could literally just walk out of the house with the Cloak and make his way to the Burrow by train/bus. Even if he then spent time running naked all around Leamington Spa or some other random place it's not like Death Eaters are likely to hear about it.

**** Talking about point number 1, presumably committing an imprisonable offense allows the minister to legally send his imperioused/death eater aurors to the end-point of the portkey or the endpoint of any Floo travel or whatever to arrest everyone there and then throw them into Azkaban. Doing it legally means the death eater's hands are stayed by their need to keep things mostly legal to keep up the flimsy pretense.

IDK about the other points though, and I agree it was needlessly dramatic. I think the sequence was there to give more credence to the Order and make it seem like they were a somewhat capable organization by giving us an example of an op they pulled off which isn't A) Fletcher going off to buy cauldrons when the Dementors show up B) Mr. Weasly getting bitten by a snake or C) them arriving late to the ministry and that whole catastrophe. While this thing was a bit of a catastrophe as well, it shows the Order being proactive instead of reactive.

That makes no sense. The Op is stupid. The Op is also a failure, they lose one of their most important members (a war veteran and former Auror), George gets maimed and Hedwig also dies.

It's not a successful operation at all. It makes them look bad for (a) trying this idiotic plan to begin with (b) then not even pulling it off... unless you'd characterize anything as a success where Harry survives in the end.

The Order of the Phoenix is a terrible organization. They do nothing and when they do something they lose. They lost the first Blood War and only prevailed because of a literal fucking miracle (Harry). They are a complete joke.

Hehehe...

Seriously though, I sometimes wish JK Rowling would stop churning out more HP related content (I.E. Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts movies) that muddles the story further.

(But I did enjoy the first Fantastic Beasts movie, as a stand alone movie.)

I feel like Dumbledore is the biggest inconsistency/plot hole in the story. He started out as a plot device, the wizard who just appears in the end of the story to explain stuff. But as he was given a larger role to play and a backstory, a lot of the things he did seem weird. Like why not act on his hunch of Horcruxes earlier?

This has always bothered me because while JKR uses a lot of situations and items as plot devices, they are usually supporting elements to the entire plot (one example you mention is Felix Felicis - only mentioned to get the memory) but this one is a complete game changer. Changing timelines is a big thing and McGonagall and Dumbledore are okay with having a student use it to take extra classes (half of which she ends up dropping later). Then Dumbledore is again okay with kids using it to save a Hippogriff and a convicted murderer. I am sure saving the Hippogriff would not have been such a big deal for Dumbledore. The more annoying part here is why not let this be a chance to clear Sirius' name? They have memories, and they can use Veritaserum to verify his claims. This could also have led to the Ministry being aware that Peter Pettigrew is out there and they could have aurors on a look out.

#+begin_quote
  Harry & Ron missing the name "Peter Pettigrew"
#+end_quote

Another one that is a gaping hole. Maybe (but still stretching it) they did not pay attention earlier but shouldn't it at least have struck Harry /after/ he found out that Sirius had killed Pettigrew? Also didn't Lupin take the map from Harry for a while? He did not see one of his suposedly dead friends on it?

One I am not sure of is who cast the Fidelius for the Potters' household? I remember it being Dumbledore but I may be wrong. However, if it was Dumbledore then how could he not know that Sirius was not the secret keeper?

***** Time travel in the Harry Potter universe, at least through the use of time turners in the main series, uses the Fixed Timeline, where you can travel back in time but nothing is changed because from the universe's perspective, you already existed then and there because of time travel before traveling back in time. This is different from the two most common uses of time travel I see in fanfiction, which are the Dynamic Timeline where going back causes changes and the Multiverse where you either create an entirely new timeline by going back without erasing the existence of the previous timeline (sometimes multiple parallel timelines already exists and "time travel" is actually just travel between them).

​

I feel like I struggled with my explanation but I'm sure googling Fixed timeline vs dynamic timeline will yield helpful results explaining it better.

What if Dumbledore had seen Sirius escape with Buckbeak and not sent the kids back in time (since there was nothing to fix)?

And what happens to free will if everything you do while time travelling is predetermined? What would actually happen if you decide to travel back in time and do something that contradicts your own knowledge of what happened? Like going back in time and doing something which you previously knew didn't happen. What if you cause an outright paradox, like going back and stealing your own time turner, or stunning your old self and making sure it can't travel back in time?

This cannot happen, because it would change the timeline. Changing the timeline is impossible in canon.

There is at least the illusion of free will, which is enough for most people. I can decide to do something, or not do something, and even if my thoughts are just a consequence of electrons moving in my brain and could theoretically be computed in advance (ignoring quantum indeterminacy), it is still my decision. But with a fixed timeline, people who have the means to fuck up the timeline literally /can't/ decide to do that, or if they do something will stop them. That almost implies a higher power that ensures the safety of the timeline.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe they are worried about their universe going "poof", instead of making changes.
#+end_quote

If the timeline is fixed, then literally everything they do is already predestined. They can't move a single millimetre away from their path, they can't do anything that would lead to the universe going "poof".

On a side note, while I personally only consider the books to be canon, many people (including JKR) consider Pottermore to be Canon as well. The article about time turners on Pottermore describes an incident where the Unspeakables sent one of their own a couple centuries back in time, which led to a change in the timeline (however they detected that).

so the universe in fact depends on people going back in time at exactly the right time and doing exactly what they have already done before to ensure that the timeline remains consistent and things that have already happened, happen. which is fine in absence of free will because people have no choice but to properly play out the timeline, but it's still virtually incomprehensible to me and, i'm sure, to many others.

**** I like to go with that explanation myself, but it doesn't make it any less of a plot hole, because it is *clearly* not what Rowling intended and definitely not the canon explanation for these events.

It's a really interesting thought exercise in terms of fanfiction and leads you pretty directly to "Dumbledore is really fucking evil" (and everyone else on staff is retarded levels of stupid for not realizing that their traps can be beaten by 11 year olds). We know that this conclusion is not what JKR had in mind, so it remains a plot-hole.

Same goes for HP and RW, but at least they have the excuse that Peter had already run away and was hiding elsewhere in the castle when they get the map.

HP tells Lupin that he saw Pettigrew's name on the map, which Lupin conveniently ignores until the End of Semester trope.

Crouch Jr says that the Unforgiveables are unblock-able and instantly results in domination, pain or death. However, previous records of the TWT have a very high death toll - but if these three curses are unblock-able and act upon everything, why is there a death toll in the first place? The Durmstrang profssors and students (who are all Evil Practitioners^{TM} of the dark arts) see a cockatrice about to go on the rampage and kill everyone in the area (in the previous tournament) but decide to not use those very useful curses and save themselves. Very interesting.

Umbridge uses an Unforgivable on AD's number one fan, but is not thrown in Azkaban.

In fact, Voldemort uses some pretty sweet magic against Dumbledore in their fight. It was so awesome that he decides to never use such magic again.

You're not understanding what I wrote. The previous tournament was held in 1792. If Durmstrang has a dark reputation now, it would have been quite worse 200 years in the past.

Hogwarts under the Dark Lord's reign was enough to have Crabbe successfully cast the Fiendfyre curse, albeit without control. HP can cast the other two unforgivables with pretty much minimal practice, and he's a mediocre student, at best.

Combine the two, and it ought to be logical that Durmstrang students (especially ones in 1792) would be quite adept at casting them. In spite of this, they and their professors (who should have no trouble with these curses whatsoever) still die like Hogwarts & Beaubatons students, staff and spectators.

If you're going to be going the "it's illegal" argument, that kind of goes away when you're looking at something like a cockatrice or dragon going on a rampage and killing hundreds of other people.

#+end_quote

Even the professors need not necessarily all be skilled at casting the killing curse. One or two probably are but I find it unlikely that the whole staff is. In any case, there is no indication that the tournament was held at Durmstrang so it is quite possible that only the headmaster of the school was present.

No it's certainly not illegal, since the Unforgivables are only illegal to use against humans.

However, I could find no sources that the cockatrice killed hundreds of people. The references to the event that I was able to find only mentioned that the headmasters of the schools were all injured.

Neither Harry nor Dumbledore are the minister. She was investigated and then got her office back anyways and no punishment, so it was probably corruption.

   *Divergence :* Voldemort now has to deal with a lot more people knowing his existence and thus the cat and mouse like chase would be awesome. Or a important member dies very early and now, Harry has to up the game and actually start to get more pro-active.

2. Second book. The classic "A muggleborn girl was able to deduce a basilisk roaming around and not teachers who are experts". And the same again, cursed game object chasing a kid and no one giving a rat's bum about it.\\
   *Divergence :* Have Harry die during the match. Or a teacher deduces it's a basilisk. Either way, no harry. Canon goes bam!

3. Third book. Hogsmeade permission slip drama. Like kids can fall from brooms and no one bats an eye but noooo, you can't go to a village where Teachers are on guard and patrolling. And it's here, that Hermione didn't have Harry's Cloak confiscated. Like, he keeps his cloak in a room full of teenagers who could have abused it to some not so noble purposes. Or the time-turner.\\
   *Divergence :* Just think of all ways the story would change without a cloak. Or the time-turner. Or if Harry freely goes to Hogsmeade. You can have Pettigrew terrified of Sirius, kidnaps Harry during a visit. Now, it'd be like Pettigrew running away with hostage Harry and we'd get a real great Pettigrew story where he shows some sympathy to Harry.

4. Fourth book. The very idea of Barty Crouch JR. This damn fellow got a drop on the paranoid ex-Auror. Managed to teach children about the horrors of war. Actually helped the Dark Lord unlike a Blonde who just gave a dairy to a 11 year old girl hoping that bad things would happen and his master won't ask it back.\\
   *Divergence :* Barty Crouch lives on. And thus, Every other plan of Voldemort from now on, doesn't let Harry win because the dark lord turned mad. But now, a really really sneaky second-in command is making it foolproof. Or have Harry die in one of the tasks. Or he fails to save his hostage in the lake.\\
   For fifth book, no plotholes from me but maybe have diadem discovered and now a diary style possessed student is now within the school who could help Draco kill Dumbledore the following year. So, no one knows about Horcrux now...game changer! That's all, I can think of now.
