I'm sure it's been asked a lot of times but is there a thread or doc/list of the Gold Standard of HP fanfics? I'm new to HP fanfics and I don't want to simply read overpowered and ultra Harry fics.


** linkffn(Stages of hope)

One of the best there is.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] - A time travel fic Harry/Bellatrix fic set in the 70's with a Harry from a slightly darker future where the Order lost. As a result, he's more skilled than canon and knows more, but it's not overpowered. Good stuff! Probably my favorite fanfiction of all time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de Sangre]] - A truly fascinating story depicting a unique relationship between Harry and a female Voldemort that takes Voldemort from canon and completely turns the character on their head, turning them into a truly sympathetic character. I will tell you that this story broke my heart, but I'll always recommend it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] - A very well written take on a post-canon story wherein Harry becomes a Dark Lord (by Ministry standards) with Ron and Hermione backing him. The story is well written, but the gem is easily the depiction of the Golden Trio's relationship. It's great!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] - The story that made me a Harry/Ginny shipper. So well written and very relaxing. If you're looking for excitement and action, this isn't for you. It's a very easy story told primarily from the perspective of the Potters new Muggle neighbors who befriend them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497/chapters/45627454?view_adult=true][to refuse the givens]] - A very well written Harry/Daphne story (one of the best in my opinion) set in sixth and seventh year that leans into the “they're teenagers let them be teenagers” schtick. And it does it very well. This one's great.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150/1/Like-Grains-of-Sand-in-the-Hourglass][Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass]] - Another time travel tale, although this one is pretty unique. Tonks gets thrown back a year during the Department of Mysteries battle and takes the form of a fifteen year old transfer student to befriend and protect Harry. It's also one of the best written Harry/Tonks stories out there.

If none of these interest you, you may also peruse my [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13GX6b2aDGhJSoiwSgj9fqiK2zSstcTifthl8CYWxSQs/edit][Google Doc]] for other options. I have not listed any of my recommended oneshots for example.

*** Not only “Strangers at Drakeshaugh” but all stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] are considered by many to be exactly the gold standard of fanfictions. Mostly canonical, preserving the spirit of the canon, and well written.

*** Not to nay say you, but I would argue that “stepping back” by the TheBlack'sResurgence or “wind shear” by chilord are FAR better time travel story's which feature Bellatrix. Delenda est is good, but I feel it shows it's age.

**** While I will give you that Delenda Est has certainly begun to show its age, it is still leagues better than most fanfics of that era which entrenched themselves in the “Lord 100-Names” trope and made Harry a God, a sex fiend or both. This fic avoids that. And while Wind Shear is very well written (it's on my Google Doc), it is not a Harry/Bellatrix story. There are very minor allusions to Bellatrix's desire for a relationship but that is as far as it goes. And as for Stepping Back, I'm sorry but it's my opinion that it's terribly written. But that's just my opinion. I understand why some people do not prefer Delenda. I just personally do.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  Still struggling with the aftermath of the war, Hermione decides to leave everything behind to go find herself. She travels further than she could have ever imagined without going anywhere at all. Along the way, she discovers someone she mistakenly thought she'd known... AU, M.

**** I kept seeing the Green Girl recommended and thought it looked too dumb for words. Until I caved and read it. I loved it and recommend it highly!

My absolute favorite fic in all the fandom is [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]]. I keep it open on my phone so I can easily link to it because I recommend it so frequently. I love everything by this author, but start with this one. Another favorite is [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]. This one made me understand Hinny for the first time in my life
