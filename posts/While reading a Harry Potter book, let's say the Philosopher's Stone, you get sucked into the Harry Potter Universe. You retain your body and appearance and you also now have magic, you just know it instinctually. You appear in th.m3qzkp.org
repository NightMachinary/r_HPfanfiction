** Tbh

Leave Britain

I know already that everything works out fairly well, with minimal deaths to boot. I see the outcomes as

A. Try and help, succeed, and save a few people.

B. Try and help, fail, and doom everyone.

Maybe if I had Indy!Harry super powers or something. I might send a couple letters if I felt like I could, but I'd be too worried about fucking with the timeline and making things worse.

** That's a pretty bad situation to be in, but I gotta try:

1.  Verify this is the CANON world

2.  Meet Dumbledore and tell everything about Horcruxes and other secrets

3.  Out Wormtail, exonerate Sirius

4.  Out Barty Jr and Sr

5.  With the above track record, get him to raid Malfoy Manor, get the Diary and put an end to Lucius's corruption of the Ministry

6.  Devise a way to capture Voldemort's wraith and save Quirrell. *If not possible, sending Voldemort back to Albania is still better than let him carrying out sabotage at the school. Because my presence already changed the timeline, I would rather not leave things to chance.*

7.  Push Wizengamot for confiscation of Lestrange and Malfoy assets, in order to compensate their victims and to obtain the Cup.

8.  Open CoS, bring enough roosters along to kill the Basilisk, harvest its venom, sell its body parts for Galleons.

9.  Sirius should bring along the Locket, and talk to Kreacher about Regulus.

10. Get the Diadem from the RoR, destroy that Vanishing Cabinet.

11. Place all Horcruxes at the Gaunt Shack, burn all of them down with Fiendfyre, which Dumbledore should be able to control.

12. Now that we have created some breathing space, Dumbledore can work on getting rid of Harry's scar and bringing all inner circle Death Eaters to justice.

13. I will make some serious money by investing in AOL, Cisco, Dell, Microsoft, and Yahoo stocks. I will also advise Harry and Sirius to do the same.

14. Maybe it's possible to get Snape to search for Voldemort in Albania. Once Voldemort is in that weak homunculus body, a stunner in the back will see him finally captured. Then thoroughly interrogate him, find out where Nagini is, find out all his secrets, obliviate him with the Elder Wand back to his infancy, dose him with Drought of Living Death, and lock him behind protections stronger than Nurmengard. Even if Voldemort gets away in some very unlikely fashion, he will wander the mortal plane as a confused wraith until the end of times!

15. Scum like Umbridge still needs to be taken care of, but that can wait. now it's finally time to learn magic and make friends!

But either way, real early on my list is going to be a trip to the US to see if a 7-year-old me exists in a world with magic.

And Umbridge dies as soon as I can pull it off.

** 1.  Acquire some funds by hoodwinking muggles. Use said funds to place bets. Earn loads of money.
2.  Buy and prepare several safe houses protected by a fidelius charm.
3.  Acquire muggle weaponry and add enchantments to it.
4.  Sneak inside the Department of Mysteries and procure a time turner and probably an invisibility cloak.
5.  Assassinate Dumbledore using an enchanted sniper rifle and the time turner I procured earlier, while hidden by an invisibility cloak.
6.  Rescue Harry Potter.
7.  Raid stuff from the Room of Requirement (the room of lost things is the one I'm wishing for to appear)
8.  Hire a psychologist for Harry.
9.  Hire tutors for Harry (magical etiquette, basic spells, magical history, and socialization)
10. Assassinate Lucius Malfoy and take his books (accountings, dealings, you know, THAT book).
11. Hire several groups of cursebreakers to hunt down Horcruxes.
12. Hire an expert in Soul Magics or Necromancy to have Harry's horcrux extracted. If that doesn't work, look for Nicholas Flamel for assistance. Dude is 6 centuries old and is most likely knowledgeable about loads of things.
13. Form a special team consisted of a hitwizard, an enchanter, a cursebreaker, and a necromancer to hunt down Quirrelmort.
14. Assassinate Snape if he hasn't fled Hogwarts yet without Dumbledore to protect him.
15. Buy Scabbers the rat from the Weasleys and lock it in an enchanted cage.
16. Allow Harry to experience Hogwarts School without danger.
17. Hide Quirrelmort in a safe place until Harry is of age and is ready to finally off Voldemort, thus fulfilling the prophecy. (This is optional if Voldemort hasn't been killed yet in number 13 and the prophecy is real)
18. Arrange for Umbridge to have a fatal accident.
19. Expose Fudge for corruption and Crouch for harbouring his criminal son under imperius curse.
20. Make an appeal to have Hagrid's name cleared and get him to have the permission to have a wand again. This will effectively transfer his loyalty to me.
21. Ask Hagrid to harvest acrumantula silk and venom weekly and give them to me. I will then sell the stuff and become richer.
22. With me becoming richer, I will now have enough power to arrange a trial for Sirius Black and condemn Pettigrew.
23. Hire doctors and psychologists to nurse Sirius back to full health and hope that Sirius gets over his Dumbledore worship and moves on by cutting ties with Lupin.
24. Introduce Harry to Nymphadora and pray to Merlin that they fall in love with each other in the future because I hate the werewolf and the walking pity party does not deserve someone like her.
25. Make investments in the muggle world to become even more wealthier.
26. When I'm stinking rich, I'll buy off the Hogwarts Board of Governors and improve the quality of education. I'll have Binns and Peeves exorcised first thing. Relieve Hooch and Filch. Hire competent teachers and introduce more subjects. Add something equivalent of a Masteral Degree offered by the school. Appoint someone (newly hired and very worthy) as Hogwarts Headmaster. I just don't see anyone from the old staff becoming worthy of the title. McGonagall is a Dumbledore follower and does not have the best interests of students at heart.
27. Earn more money, and work in the shadows to get the Ministry of Magic become competent and do great things that would benefit wizardkind. Perhaps, in the future, the Statue of Secrecy won't be needed and muggles will be at our feet. Imagine, a world where muggles stop polluting and destroying earth and killing off animals into extinction, because wizards protect the environment.

** Step 1: Get money, the how doesn't matter too much assuming I don't screw things up for people that don't deserve it. At some point invest in the soon to be Silicon Valley giants.

Step 2: Get a wand and owl in Diagon and theoretically meet Harry and Hagrid in the process. Get a letter to Dumbledore ASAP requesting a meeting(preferably via Hagrid after meeting him in Diagon, but by my new owl works also).

Step 3: After preforming an Unbreakable Vow(preformed by either Fitwick, Sprout, Aberforth, or a non active Order Member of the Hogwarts staff) that ensures Albus is both a good person not out to do anything that would hurt innocents and not going to pull a “Manipulative!” Himself and steal from/weaken Harry just in case and ensures that whatever I have to say is the truth as I know it and I genuinely want to save the world/stop Voldemort unveil the events of the books/movies/certain fanfics if he's got questions on why I did the vow/certain SCB and Seamus Gourman videos that either of us are curious about sciencing. With this evidence and the prior Vow I'll see about limiting Snape's ability to torment students and getting Harry away from the Dursley's(and do what we can to get them in Jail once Dudley's grown up enough to prevent him from going to Marge/entering the system).

Step 4: Once the school year begins spring an ambush on Quirrelmort and get him on the DoLD, and soon after organize a capture of Pettigrew to get Sirius a trial. Once freed get Sirius some therapy so that he can theoretically take care of Harry and allow us legal access to the Locket and Cup(the Diadem and Ring will be retrieved by Dumbledore and either myself or others ahead of time, BTW the Borgin cabinet will be purchased by me once I've got enough money to afford it to prevent any gaps in Hogwarts security).

With Tom unable to make Nagini a Horcrux and all others destroyed or in the process of being stripped of essence of Riddle save Harry all that's left is to get rid of the corrupt members of Wizarding society which the Aurors with some help from Albus should be able to pull off without a war/targeted politics to distract them, and potentially eliminate the Scarcrux without killing anyone except the Voldemort chunk. I am now free to learn more Magic and do what a proactive rich Wizard who has future knowledge and is friendly with the Supreme Mugwump can to limit any known atrocities of the 21st century so far and prepare the Magical World for the inevitable breaking of the Statute of Secrecy. Also write the books with some alterations(and permission from everyone involved who isn't in jail/dead, and give them a cut of the money which will hopefully put the Weasley's in a better overall financial situation) and do what I can to save certain people and the Star Wars franchise(The sequels have many plot issues that can be fixed with a plan and hindsight, Clone Wars should have gotten the chance to finish properly and include unused arcs which can be done due to not getting cancelled, Rebels has quite a few tonal problems that can be fixed by not being Disney ran, and rework/reincorporate currently Legends material). From there I'll just live life and maybe at some point along the way reconnect with my family.
