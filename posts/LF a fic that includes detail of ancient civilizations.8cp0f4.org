Like the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Aztecs, Mayans, etc? Anything that delves deep into thier cultures and deals with the magical side of them. How did they treat magic? What odd things did they do? The ancient magical artifacts they stored. Their legends and mythologies and what's real and what isn't. You know, that kind of stuff.


** The definite, and uncontested best story with that is linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh). If you're at all interested in this premise, read it - even if you dislike fem!Harry. Trust me.

Other than that, there is /kinda/ linkffn(Basilisk-Born), but it can't match in quality or worldbuilding of the ancient cultures, and there is also linkffn(The Wizard of Earth).

Additionally, if I may recommend something that isn't a fanfic: [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/][The Man from Earth (2007)]] is the basis for the last linked fanfic, and it's really good, especially after reading ALJH.

*** I always see A Long Journey Home recommended around here, but what does it deal with exactly? I've always been reluctant to start it and then get bored with it midway through.

Thanks for the suggestions and I'll definitely see The Man From Earth, it looks like some of the stuff I like! =)

  but what does it deal with exactly?
#+end_quote

fem!Harry is immortal for some reason and sent back in time thousands of years to ancient Egypt. She lives through all of it.

There are parts that deal with her "arriving" back in the modern time, but the best parts are set in the past. For example in the first arc, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/4/A-Long-Journey-Home][forging a legend]] it's about how she meets Merlin and their relationship. It's very well written, seems to capture the time well, and has interesting and authentic characters. Basically, it's exactly what you asked. There is a second big arc (that's unfinished), but that also seems to capture an entirely different time and culuture.

If you don't like the first three chapters, that's fine - try starting with the linked chapter, you don't really need the stuff before. I can promise that the first arc also gets much more action in the last two of the five chapters.

If you still find it boring, then it seems that it just isn't for you, but this fic seems to capture old periods better than any other I know of in the fandom.

It falls in my "Good and enjoyable, but not amazing" category.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
