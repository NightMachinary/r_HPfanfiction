I think this was either time travel or dimension travel where Harry ended up as his younger self. He stayed or worked at a bird sanctuary I think, that bred post owls. I think there were two women that kept an eye on him? And i remember Remus visiting him.


** I know of one that's similar but is a crossover with the Avengers but I don't have the name on hand, if you find the story your looking for please tell me!
