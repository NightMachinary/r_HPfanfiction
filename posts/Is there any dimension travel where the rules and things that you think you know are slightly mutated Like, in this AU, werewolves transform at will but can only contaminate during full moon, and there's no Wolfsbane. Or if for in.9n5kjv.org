#+TITLE: Is there any dimension travel where the rules and things that you think you know are slightly mutated? Like, in this AU, werewolves transform at will but can only contaminate during full moon, and there's no Wolfsbane. Or if for instance, everyone used staffs instead of wands.

I'm not asking for personality swaps, like Dumbledore being the Dark Lord, or Riddle being Headmaster. Potters alive and such. I'm looking for something where the rules of magic as we know it are different, so the universe itself is different, like, 2 Houses instead of 4, Merlin not being anyone important, Hogwarts being called something else.\\
I'm not giving good examples, but I think I got my point through.

But still with a similar plot to canon, with Harry as MC.
