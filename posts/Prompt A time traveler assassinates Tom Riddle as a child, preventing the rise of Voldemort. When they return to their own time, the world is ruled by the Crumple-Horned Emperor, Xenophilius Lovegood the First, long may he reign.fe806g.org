Without Voldemort, Xeno was able to discover the whereabouts of the Crumple-Horned Snorkack and claim its powers as his own. Now he rules with an iron fist and an army of hybridized Nargle-Wrackspurt-Heliopaths.

** 1984 Orwell vibes, anything that contradicts what great leader Xeno has said is publically executed.

And heliopaths are the only people accepted into Hogwarts, where they are trained to go to foreign Ministers and work their way to the top and create and alliance between them to create only one magical state...

New Snorkack with its capital being Pandora named after the Emperor's dead wife who's birthday is a national holiday... anyone who works is also executed.

And the emperor invites all rebellions as it's fun.

** Dumbledore created Voldermort so He could be hailed as the greatest wizard since Merlin.. I wonder how Riddle would have turned out had he been adopted by a wizarding family. Shone love and acceptance instead of hate and bulling.

*** Number 1, this has nothing to do with the prompt. Number 2, every bit of that was fanon. There is no canon evidence of Dumbledore making Voldemort intentionally. On top of that, Tom Riddle needs more than some love. He hanged a rabbit and tortured other children into personality changes.
