  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** linkffn(looks can be deceiving)

I just started reading this this morning, and so far I like it. Not sure yet what to think about the rather unusual pairing since he hasn't appeared yet though.

  What if Severus Snape had taken Hermione Granger under wing secretly during her time at Hogwarts? What if Draco Malfoy really wasn't the bigot he let everyone think he was? (Follows canon mostly up until the end of GoF, and then detours off into AU territory w/Severus as father figure)
