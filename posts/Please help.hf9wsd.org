Dose anyone know a fanfic were Harry is handsome and outgoing, instead off being awkward and shy. I have read quite a few of the later and starting to get tired of the angsty teen, not that I didn't live it I would just like to see him in a different light.


** linkffn(Unexpected by Comet360) gives you the confidence part, and Harry's always been(IMO) handsome in canon. I mean, he's a mini-James Potter with green Avada Kedavra oRbS, he has to be at least a little good looking.

#+begin_quote
  Expectations are funny things as the Wizarding world learns when introduced to a Harry that has inherited James' confidence and Lily's charm and a complete disregard to anything that doesn't affect him. Who cares about rocks and stuttering professors when they've got dragons and godfathers who didn't wait thirteen years to break out of prison to play with?
