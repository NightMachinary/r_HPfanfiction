:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry has his own house above a shop that Flitwick helped ward and that the twins come over and experiment in until the shopkeep is really annoyed. Hermione doesn't approve of the relationship Harry is in and i think they stop being friends? Also i think this is the one where Harry can't keep a snake because he feels sorry for them and lets them go?

Possibly helpful: I only read slash so.. most likely slash. also I only read completed and longer than 40k words.

Sorry if this is multiple fics in one I've just been looking for this fic for about 6 months and I can't find it.


** Oh, I know this one. Death Eater Takes a Holiday maybe? Let me look.

ETA: Yep, that's the one I was thinking of. It's mentioned in Chapter 38 that he's letting the twins use his kitchen because Molly got upset at too many explosions. In Chapter 59 he mentions the landlords not being happy about the plaster dust.

Edited again to put in the CORRECT link: linkao3(17989165). Copy-paste error removed.
