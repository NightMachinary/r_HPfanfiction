...for listening to Dumbledore and not writing to him (or picking up a phone in Hermione's case or using muggle-mail!)

Hey guys,

so I've recently read some GOF fics (with Dobby stealing Harry's letters!) and I remembered that Harry was kept out of the loop, not only by the adults (who had their reasons, despite the fact that in the end Harry and company always ended up in the thick of things!) both in 5th and 6th year (well: The holidays before those respective years)! So I'd like some fanfictions where that blows up spectacularly in their (and Dumbledore's) faces and where Harry isn't his usual forgiving self (IMHO he simply is too forgiving, too used to people using him as a doormat they can walk all over and totally unused to standing up for himself!)! Can be anything from Harry leaves (because he feels so unwanted!) to Harry throws himself into learning or Harry switches friends etc. etc.

As always: No slash (not my cup of tea...screwing with a characters sexuality violates them too much IMHO!) and H/G only if the story is really good (great writing, great plot etc.)

Stage is your's, I am signing off :)

ps: Almost forgot this (damned!): Thanks in advance for your recommendations!

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

** Sigh... If this is about the summer before OotP, his friends wrote to him. They just didn't write to him about things he wanted to read about it, but that's basic operational security.

**** Fair enough. But, the whole "they didn't write to Harry" fanon underpins a thousand bashfics and needs to be called out. Also while what you describe is a valid reason to be annoyed, it reduces to his friends having an overblown sense of self-importance, rather than Dumbledore's "manipulations".

***** I'm laughing so hard at his response. I answered the way I did because you could go to FFN, close your eyes and throw a dart at your internet-capable device's screen and probably hit a story where Harry is angry at his friends.

** This is basically the premise of any post OotP indie!Harry fic. Just look for some fic lists or C2 on ff.net.

Always goes like this: Harry gets really mad at his friends. Depending on who of them the Author likes/tolerates they are allowed to get back into his good graces after accepting him as their new leader through some act of submission (often coupled with humiliation).

Always felt the way these stories go shows aspects of a somewhat disturbed psyche.
