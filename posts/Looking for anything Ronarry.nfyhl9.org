Just need a bit of a pick me up and want some recs of your favorite Ron/Harry fics. Preferably but not too angsty but if it has a happy ending I'm not too picky.

Maybe with a focus on Seamus, Dean, and Neville too since it's a dynamic I always love seeing explored. Seamus/Dean is completely fine if it's thrown in.

  Ron is head over heels in love with his best mate, but it's going to take more than a horrendous orange sofa, painted pornography, and opening a shop together for him to let Harry know. Written for the prompt: Best friends since day one, they decided to share a flat after the war. Can I ask for oblivious idiot(s) and mutual pining?
