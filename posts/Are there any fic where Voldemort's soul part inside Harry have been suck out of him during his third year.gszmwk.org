** The story No Competition by Evilgodss has dementor remove Voldemort's soul from Harry's scar before his third year.

linkffn(11126195)

Of course there is the story that many like to hate called Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart that has a Dementor remove Voldemort's soul from Harry's scar but his memories/knowledge remain behind.

These other stories have a Dementor remove Voldemort's soul from Harry's scar but that happens well after the third year.

Never Leave by by Rihaan

linkao3(1819165)

A Collection of Harmonious OneShots by Seel'vor has a short called Open Wide the Gate of Time: Normal Life (chapter 15) that has Harry use a Dementor to remove the souls from the horcruxes including the one in his scar).

linkffn(4780695)

When Plot Bunnies Attack by Ares.Granger Harry and Hermione use a dementor to get rid of the soul in Harry's scar. (I believe it's the 6th story).

The story Partially Kissed Hero is the only one that I have read that has the dementor remove Voldemort's soul from Harry's scar on the train

  After Ron's second and final betrayal, Harry looks at Hermione and sees her in a whole new light. He reacts in a way neither of them expected him to. Light and/or Dark!Super!Harmony. Rated for sexual situations and non-graphic violence.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
