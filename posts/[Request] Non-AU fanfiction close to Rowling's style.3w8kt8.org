I have just finished MoR and for all that is good about it, now I just want some fanfiction that doesn't ignore the original left and right and doesn't have a completely different style to it.

Basically something that expands on what Rowling created, preferably with the same progression of narration from whimsical adventure to rather serious thriller in the later books. I've been eyeing the Albus Potter series for a while now, simply on the premise that there are seven more books out there of the length of the originals which might bring back the wonder of reading the original series for the first time. Until now I've kept to more comedic fanfictions like Natural 20 to not end up disappointed.

Are there some fanfictions out there that capture the style of the Rowling books and have the same addictive writing?


** Inverarity's stuff is very "original flavour" - both the /Alexandra Quick/ series and "Hogwarts Houses Divided". They're both also incredible in terms of the writing; it's nearly professional quality.

I guess I'll have a look at the Alexandra Quick series soon after that, even though the premise sounds like it could also be a horribly bad fanfiction.

Some people have it in mind and never get that out of their head while reading Alexandra Quick, and it basically ruins it for them. The way to approach the Alexandra Quick series is to honest-to-god treat it as an original series, and not as a fanfic; I adore it because of how far removed it is from canon. I hope you have luck with that.

And I wish I knew of more series in the vein you ask for... sorry.

** It can be tough to find what you're looking for. The only author I've come across who talks passionately about canon is Northumbrian. His fic /Strangers at Drakeshaugh/ is a favorite with many. It is post-war (after book 7) and follows Harry, Ginny, their kids, muggle neighbors and has a bit of action/mystery as well. linkffn(6331126). Also, if I'm not mistaken, his dozens of stories all occur in the same universe, all working off the same timeline. So you may read a oneshot of his and it contains a tidbit of information that reveals something in a larger work he is writing. Also, he's British, so no bothersome Americanisms.

 

For posterity I have included a large part of his bio in this post. I appreciate his ending comment /"My point wasn't that you shouldn't re-imagine, but that you don't need to re-imagine, you can simply imagine."/ In other words, you don't need to disfigure canon HP when writing a creative story, there is plenty of room inside canon to play.

#+begin_quote
  I'm only just an Englishman; from North of "the Wall," but South of "the border." The bit that most of England doesn't know is theirs.

  I've been a fan for years, ever since I read book one, which is also when I suspected that Harry and Ginny would, eventually, be a couple. This was confirmed to me in the opening Chapters of CoS. I like action, rather than fluff, though I seem to write a lot of fluff. I cannot read Dramione, Drinny, slash or, for that matter, any major non-canon pairing. If JKR says that's what happens, that's good enough for me. Why bother re-imagining?

  Over the past couple of years a few anonymous reviewers have told me that my “why bother re-imagining” statement (above) means that I shouldn't be writing fanfiction. They are, of course, wrong, but the fault is obviously mine.

  It appears that they have misunderstood what I was trying to say, and that can only be my fault for not making myself clear.

  What I was trying to say was that, if you do re-imagine, you have to look at ALL of the consequences, not simply find a feeble excuse to glue your favourite couple together (or resurrect Voldemort despite the fact that JKR says “dead is dead”, or give Harry a twin, etc.). Re-imagining this seven-book epic properly would take a lot of work, and I simply don't see the need. I've managed to write over eighty stories almost all of which fit in with book (and post DH interview) canon and with each other. My point wasn't that you shouldn't re-imagine, but that you don't need to re-imagine, you can simply imagine.

*** Thank you, this sounds really interesting. I am not far into the whole fanfiction scene, but I always though that it would be kinda frustrating to get invested in an universe only to finish the story and after that read another fanfiction which handles everything completely differently. I'd say he sounds a bit condescending, but I also agree with him on many points. (Mostly about fanfiction writers often blatantly ignoring part of the books and characterisations just in order to make their favoured pairing or story work.)

Fair point about the condescension. I take it not so much as a rejection of "re-imagining" but a rejection of people poo-pooing the source material. And on the scale of condescending fanfction authors, he ranks low in my experience. Also, I happen to agree with him. I still like well done re-imagings though, /Ectomancer/ linkffn(4563439) is a good example. It's unfinished but I've never seen anyone say it wasn't well worth the read.

** I come back to this, over and over again. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1038392/chapters/2071555][Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard]] by Fernwithy. This is the link to the 1st year, but it's a complete series -- there's three other fics, one for 1st year, 3rd year, 5th year and 7th year, all complete. The author put a lot of thought into the story of Teddy Lupin and the world after. I know I'm spoiling a bit here but I really want to give the story the exposure it deserves -- for example, Teddy of course inherits the Marauder's Map, but when he opens it for the first time in Hogwarts, to his dismay the map is out of date as of course Hogwarts has been rebuilt. His year is the smallest class (due to the war). The world is very, very believable..

I don't think it has its own style but it definitely is the closest to Rowling's for me.

It parallels the original books too -- 1st year, Teddy gets into a bit of trouble where he finds a certain stone -- 3rd year, someone breaks out of Azkaban, etc, 5th year he has a massive struggle and fallout with the unfairness of his situation (though not quite caps-locky like Harry, it's more quiet Lupin intense anger really). I won't spoil anymore, but it's great, and you'll feel everything reading this - crying, to laughing, to wishing this was completely canon.
