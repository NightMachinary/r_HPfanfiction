So a Haphne pairing fic that has the relationship progress believably and is like 100k+ words

If there happens to be these could be in the fic but NOT mandatory

-animagus

-escape from dursleys

-op

-Smart harry

Again these are NOT NEEDED but would be nice if there happens to be a fic that has even one of those additions but the main point is a believable haphne pairing story that's over 100k words

Thanks!

But, seriously, why is it hard to use the bot? Seven extra letters, and some parentheses.

It's even worse in some other fanfiction subs- [[/r/NarutoFanfiction]] drives me batshit because WHY WOULD YOU NOT USE THIS RESOURCE THAT YOU HAVE FREELY AVAILABLE? I have to keep myself from calling the bot in every thread.

***** lol, that sub banned me for absolutely no reason.

[[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] might be an uber PC place, but at least you're told what you did that the mods don't like, and aren't instantly perma'd without any reason.

Unlike Naruto sub, which is apparently run by a crowd of children where modding a small sub is the greatest amount of power they will ever acheive in life - ergo, get banned for saying "I don't like canon" (my last post there).

Like yeah, holy shit, I don't like the absolutely retarded (from an adult perspective) fiction of Naruto and HP. Yeah, I don't like to keep reading about a literal idiot scream the same asinine catchphrases, or read yet another dull HP canon rehash with the same exact characters doing largely the same things in the same way.

That's why I'm on the fanfiction forums, not the fan forums. Apparently some people aren't mature enough to respect that.

** Three Black Birds by Excited-Insomniac is a fairly while written story.

To highlight the general tropes of this fic are that it is an eventual Haphne, with the relation progressing fairly believably. This is also a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived with James and Lily Surviving and does include everything you listed other than escape from Dursley's.

** Got a few for you.

One would be Novocaine linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine]]) I like how the relationship developed in it and thought it was well done.

Two would be linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent]]) The same could be said about this fic, it falls just a little short of 100k words but its sequel makes up for it if you like it.

Sadly these don't have the extra things that you are looking for.

Just as a personal recommendation for nice and fun Haphne story Dancing in the Green, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11703507/1/Dancing-in-the-Green]]) is a shorter (35k words) but its a story worth the read. Also doesn't have all the other extras you want.

I know a lot more Haphne stories that are good, but are shorter than 100k. If you are interested just send a message or reply to this post and I can link you to them. Hope you enjoy these.

*** Wow well I truly didn't think there were so many fics still left to read,I've read almost 30Haphne fics and I somehow haven't even heard of Novocaine

The importance of intent I have read

The same can be said for dancibg in the green

Rn I'm reading 'the legacy preservation act' which is actually pretty good and all along with 'the three black birds' which is being updated every saturday and is pretty good

Also re-reading the accidental animagus although I don't remember if it (or the two sequels) had any pairing but it still is a good fic

Oh and I would love to learn of some shorter stories

Thanks for the recommendations

And sorry for the novel I wrote for the reply

**** Lol no problem with the length of the reply and happy to share one you haven't read yet. Prepare for a long list of other stories then. I try to make sure the relationship seems realistic. I be off remembering some as I tend to like fluff stories.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13304599/1/An-Ordinary-Magical-Couple]])

My memory is poor and all I remember is liking this one. But I thought I suggest it anyways.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275504/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Vanishing-Princess]])

This one has a lot of fluff, so it might not be the most realistic, but I also don't think its the worst unrealistic relationship either and is a good fun story.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12300252/1/From-Southampton-to-New-York-and-Beyond]])

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357903/1/Marry-You]])

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243494/1/Trapped-in-a-Broom-Closet]])

These three contain a fair amount of bashing, as a fair warning. But each of them have a good development of the relationship between Harry and Daphne. However how the relationship starts isn't the most conventional of things and could be unrealistic, why I didn't suggest them in the first place even if the relationship is good.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12557197/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Unexpected-Friend]])

I re-read this one recently, and the relationship that is built is very realistic. Though it is an older one so you might have read it.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12414949/1/Black-coffee-with-sugar]])

This one is a decent story that is actually somewhat believable. I just thought I put it out on the table at least.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/1/Ice-Cream]])

This one is just a sweet one shot that I liked and found sweet. And I thought it was somewhat realistic.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12698488/1/Good-Days-and-Bad-Days]])

This one is also believable relationship. However this Daphne is different from fanon as a fair warning. Though the same could be the said of Vanishing Princess. So what ever you like.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11002763/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magic-of-Life]])

This one is a fun one and I thought it was well done. Though its got some grammatical issues so beware of that. Otherwise I think the characters and plot are interesting enough if you can get past that.

And that's enough from me and my ramblings. Talk about a novel of a post, lol. I hope I suggested some that you haven't read yet. Hope you enjoy and if you want I can point you in the direction of more. Just send a message or something.

Happy readings!

  Harry is just this eleven-year-old trying to cope when Hagrid shows up. Daphne Greengrass is smart, plain, hardworking and a pureblood witch from a family of very modest means. They aren't rich or prominent among the wizarding social set, but they are full of guile and learn fast. Of course they're underestimated, until it is too late.

  Harry gets an unexpected date to the Yule Ball during the Tournament. Or rather, he gets ordered to be a girls escort...

*** Is Stardustwarrior even still around? Novocaine was updating fairly regularly and then just stopped. It's been nearly a year now since the last update which is a shame.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.
