For example: occlumency/legilimency, arithmancy, ancient runes, etc. It doesn't necessarily have to be the main plot as long as it's interesting. I don't mind any genre or pairing, but I would prefer fics that are not next gen and are completed.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What you Leave Behind]] has some- just 'finished' (-edit WIP) and I only noticed bits and pieces until it grew quite prevalent in the last couple chapters. But I liked it for the most part and shares similarities to what is brewing in my mind.

This reminds me I should really be taking notes of stories that have fed into my, particularly magic theory, head canon (or whatever it would be termed).

** [[/u/Taure]]'s '[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]]' goes into a lot of detail on magic. Somniamancy (dream magic) is a major part of the plot.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Forests-of-Valbon%C3%AB][There's this]] which explores warding, though it gets kinda weird near the end.

*** That's not the fic where they decides to casually bomb turkey near the end is it?

**** I wouldn't know, I didn't get that far. I mostly gave up at the voldemort encounter, but the warding and all before that is interesting

** It was never finished, but the Oath Breaker series by KC went into an incredible amount of detail on some very interesting theories of magic different than we saw in HP: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2473502/1/Oath-Breaker]]

** When A Lioness Fights had some interesting things done with Occlumency and Legillimency, and they're really important to the story.

I'll dig through my list tomorrow and see if I can find another- I know there's a story where arithmancy is extremely important to the war and is used to help strategize the Order. I'll add it to this post if I find it. I only read it once though, but I should be able to.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][a second chance at life]] features blood magic in detail. It has a sequel but the third one is abandoned. It's definitely worth reading even if it's a bit ridiculous at times.
