I actually like Snape's character... (controversial opinion, I know) his personality on the other hand is just a lot of yikes all around. Character and personality are two different things, you can like one without liking the other.

It does not have to be called out all of the time, just more in general than it was in canon.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New/Completed or not

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc. Does NOT have to focus on pairings

Am NOT looking for a bashing story. Am looking for more of a character growth type of story

  Severus Snape was discovered as a spy mere days before the start of the school year. Thankfully, Albus had been working on a vague contingency plan for this possibility. It had been inspired by the question, “What would it take for Severus Snape to see that he was wrong about Harry Potter?” The answer? Force Severus to go undercover as Alfonse “Eli” Hopkirk, a sixth year Gryffindor.

** Dumbledore gets fed up with Snape's actions and causes him to 'walk a mile in Harry's shoes' as it were in this story:

Also, Snape gets a serious heel realization about his treatment of Harry in this story (not the main focus, as it involves time travel, but it does come up):

** "I've had it with this dafty numpty, Albus. I can't be bloody arsed with this bawbag anymore." Minerva said.

"If I may--" Snape started, but Minerva cut him off.

"Will you shut yer puss, Severus? You're a ruddy glaikit, and your cow momma smells of elderberries!"

"that's very rich coming from you Minerva"

"Yer bums oot the windae! You greasy unfair crabbit git. You're like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle!"
