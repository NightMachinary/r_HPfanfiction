** I have no idea where people come up with these concepts. I mean I can't even imagine the state of mind that says 'what if Hoth is actually a future earth...and what the hell Harry Potter is there too.'

It does raise the question- what is Potter's midichlorian count?

**** If I were to put on my SW geek hat I'd say that 'Hoth' was the 6th planet in the system and had numerous moons, which means you'd need a lot more than just an ice age for earth to change into it.

******* If magic can manipulate energy- which it can, then it can manipulate mass aswell. Though I don't think there's a gas giant inward from Hoth, anyways. So moving earth outward, or Mars, Jupiter, Saturn inward wouldn't help much. Is Hoth's home star an average midrange like the sun?

******** Saying it can manipulate mass is one thing, actually manipulating /that much/ is something else. Unless we assume that since there's a SW crossover that means magic now works under the jedi rules of you can move it so long as you believe you can move it...

********* Or maybe a few stray planets got picked up by the sun in the several million years of intermediary. It wouldn't be all that likely, with only a few million years for something as rare as that, but it wouldn't be impossible either. And if a sufficiently massive planet passed Earth the right way, it could gav-assist to a farther out orbit.

If given enough time, and a stupid amount of luck and Magic to bend the rules, it CHOULD happen.

******** Nevermind. Hoth is only about two thirds the size of Earth anyways. So, if you read the story above, you can assume that Magic as a whole teleported all the muggles, and wizards in stasis and MoD Harry and all there stuff, to Hoth from Earth, within ten million years of the end of the first chapter.

Even if it had to cross a dimensional boundary to do so. Because if given enough time everything will eventually happen by random chance. And the story just happens to be the one time it worked out like that.

********* I suppose if something happened to deorbit the moon in the right way, it could pull apart a large piece of the earth, aswell. Though that something would need to be moving quite fast to manage that, and it would probably reduce the Earth to a ball of lava, which would greatly extent the amount of time between chapters 1-2.

Rather then millions we'd be talking tens or even hundreds of Trillions of years. The sun would probably be nearing the end of its life cycle, it'd be close. And the likelihood of and of that cryogenic-vault surviving would be astronomical. Well, unless its Unplotable.

Though I doubt even that would help then. But Maybe with all the magic of earth devoted to Only the survival of that One Place, it may work.

And, though astronomical, it wouldn't be IMPOSSABLE for Harry to find himself still buried near by.

With Earth in a farther orbit you wouldn't have to worry about there not being ice, if there was atmosphere at all.

I think I may be over analyzing this now, though. And that's a lot of What ifs. I prefer to just say "It works because it's Magic!" And be done with it.

*** I don't know off the top of my head how you gauge the midichlorian count, but if it's in Parts Per Million, then Harry's would have to be 823,543ppm. Seven to the power seven.

**** Midichlorians are force-mitochondria right?

The amount of mitochondria per cell in humans varies, with up to two thousand or so in every liver cell (about 1/5 of the volume) and less in others. So I would assume he'd be less than 10 percent or so mitochondria by volume in the average cell. (I am pulling these numbers out of my ass and I don't actually know any biology so don't quote me on that)
