:END:
I remember reading a story i think its about harry goes missing and people think hes dead but somehow he time travels a few centuries in the past with someone else. They get the help of a veela enclave or something when they first get sent to the past and the current veela group are descendants of harry that the veelas requested for helping them. The story mainly focuses on other characters reactions of voldermorts takeover of England and the surrounding country's. I think Draco gets cursed earlier on by a someone after they get information about voldermort that turns him into a girl and he escapes to canada.
