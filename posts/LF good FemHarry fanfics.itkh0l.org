I was reading a story on ffn "Archaeologist" I think, an older Harry got sent into the body of his younger sister. I was wondering if anyone knows of any similar FemHarry fanfics? They seem to be pretty thin on the ground. By similar I mean that a female Harry gets resurrected or something like that.


** Not the ressuracted thing but if you're looking for an decent fem!harry fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4606270/1/][effects and side effects]] is pretty good but unfinished sadly

Not sure if you'll like it or not but [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11268925/1/][Harry Potter and the Gang of Giggling Girls]] is good. Adult harry sends his memories back to 5th year and due to the timeline changing has to spend the year pretending to be a girl. Not exact but it's a fun read

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
