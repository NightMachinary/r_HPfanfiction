Lord Voldemort reluctantly admits that he is incapable of defeating Harry Potter after the graveyard fiasco (and also knowing about the Chamber of Secrets via Lucius Malfoy who was thoroughly punished) and having admitted that he conducts a ritual to summon someone who has successfully killed Harry Potter in another universe.


** "Oh? So you are approaching me? Instead of running away you are coming right to me? Even though the old Harry Potter has told you about the secret of my power like a student trying to finish his answer right before the end of the exam chime?" The Voldemort that wears a heart shaped headband and yellow suits said to Harry.

"Well, If I don't come closer how I am supposed to beat you up?" Albus Potter said.

"Then come as close as you want..." Voldemort said.

"Avada!" "Expelli!" Voldemort and Albus Potter simultaneously fires a spell at each other.

"So you want to compare the speed of attack then..." Voldemort scoffed, and Albus Potter gripped his wand harder.

"Avada avada avada avada avada avada avada avada avada avada avada avada"

"Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli Expelli"

Red and green spells were firing at each other at inhuman speed and splashed everywhere.

Meanwhile, the original Voldemort and Harry were facing their summoned fighters and feel like they were seeing something very bizarre happening...

The pile having Doctors who botched surgeries, drunk drivers, Teenagers who in fist fights hit him wrong, multiple Vernons, Petunias, and Dudleys.
