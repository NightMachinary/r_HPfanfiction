To clarify, I am not asking for crossovers where Harry or someone else goes to Middle Earth or someone from Middle Earth comes to the HP universe. I want ones where LOTR is still a work of fiction but influenced the way Harry or another character thinks and acts greatly.

An example is linkffn(Force sensitive by LunaStorm). In this one, young Harry thinks that his accidental magic is a sign of him using the Force, because of his fascination with the original Star Wars trilogy. But no Jedis actually appear and Harry does not go to space.

Another example is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Avatar's Return by PristinelyUngifted) where this time, Harry thinks he is the Avatar because of the Nickelodeon show and comics.

Also, if you have any other suggestions for other works of fiction that could have influenced Harry or another Muggleborn, without it becoming a crossover, please suggest them, too.

Thanks in advance.

  At age eight, Harry Potter had an epiphany. He realized, with the utter certainty that only an eight years old can have, that he was a Jedi.

  After finding a torn comic in the trash when told to clean Dudley's room, four year old Harry Potter puts it together with some odd things that have happened around him, and concludes that he's the Avatar. - Not a crossover so much as a fic in which Harry Potter is convinced that 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' is a historical documentary.
