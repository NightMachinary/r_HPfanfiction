A Different Outcome...

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/6rr3xt/a_different_outcome/]]

Inspired by this adorable comic, are there any fics that have this concept?

Also because this is kinda adorable and I wanted to share.


** [[/u/Starfox5]] wrote this prompt on Space Battles:

Valley of the Kings, Egypt, July 30th, 1991

“It's a bloody Sand Drake's lair, Doctor! It can sense a mouse walking over the ground a hundred yards away; we can't get past that beast. Trust me, my brother wrangles dragons for a living.” The young man was whispering, his wand gripped tightly in his hand even though they were over five hundred yards away, in cover behind a fallen pillar.

She snorted, adjusting her binoculars, studying the painted mural behind the beast. “It's the entrance of the lost tomb of the high-priest of Ramses II. No mere reptile will keep me from making the discovery of the year.” And fulfilling her contract with Gringotts.

“My spells won't even scratch its hide! Sand Drakes are dragons, Doctor! It takes a dozen wizards to subdue one, and we just have one wand between the two of us!”

She lowered her binoculars and glanced at the red-haired wizard next to her. He must be really rattled - he usually carefully avoided mentioning the fact that she was a squib and not a witch. “I thought danger was part of the job, Bill,” she said, adding a slightly mocking tone as she quoted his favourite pick-up line.

“Danger, yes. Suicide, no. We can't take that beast. It's resistant to spells, and its hide is far too thick for your guns.”

She caught him glancing at the Glocks in their holsters strapped to her thighs and snorted. “Please - did you really think I wouldn't know how tough a Sand Drake's hide is?” She could practically quote Scamander verbatim these days.

She could see him blink, and grinned when he made the connection. “You knew...?”

She nodded. “It's dung was quite specific. And they are highly territorial.”

“You knew this is the territory of a Sand Drake, and you still entered it? You're crazy, Doctor!” He was shaking his head, his pony-tail swishing back and forth behind him.

She chuckled. “And what are you, following me?” Then she opened the long duffel bag she had brought along and pulled out the RPG-7 she had picked out a year ago from a soviet division moving out of East Germany. She held the HEAT-warhead out to him. “Duplicate this, please. Three times.”

“What is that?” he asked, as he was casting.

“Muggle anti-tank weapon,” she explained while loading the launcher and stashing the other two copies into her small backpack.

“What's a tank?”

“Armored car.” Normally, she'd have some fun answering his questions, yet leading him to a completely wrong impression, but she was already focusing on the beast that stood between her and another cover article in British Archeology. Not to mention another grant, as well as her cut from Gringotts.

She gripped the RPG-7 and started to crawl towards the Sand Drake, keeping behind toppled walls and eroded stones whenever possible. She needed to get closer to have a good shot at the monster. It was a sign of just how rattled her partner was that he wasn't making a crack about how he enjoyed the view of her shorts-covered behind.

After a hundred yards crawling under the Egyptian sun, her shirt was soaked through, and she rested in the meager shadow of a rock and took a gulp of water from her flask. Weasley, unaffected by the heat thanks to his spells, shook his head, but didn't comment. She sneered - she wouldn't beg him to cast a spell on her just to avoid getting sweaty.

Another hundred yards. They were inside the Sand Drake's range now. Just as she had planned. With a feral grin on her face, she stood up behind the remains of a wall and took aim.

“Doctor!” Weasley hissed.

“Don't stand behind me!” she said, not bothering to whisper. The beast had already noticed them, but drakes preferred to let their prey get as close as possible before pouncing.

Now, though, the monster was rearing up, its maw opening wide as it roared to send its prey fleeing in terror so it could run them down from behind. Scamander said that they usually roared for ten seconds.

It took her three to aim, and another for the rocket-propelled warhead to reach her target. Her aim had been slightly off, but all it meant was that the right side of the drake's torso exploded in a cloud of blood, meat and bones. The monster went down in a tangle of flailing limbs and tails, its roar replaced by screaming

“Merlin's Arse!” Weasley cursed behind her.

She reloaded the launcher and put the beast out of its misery with another grenade, then turned towards her partner. “Let's go.” There wouldn't be any other creature nearby; not near a Sand Drake's lair. And there wouldn't be any curses in the area either; the beast would have set them off.

They reached the entrance to the tomb after a few minutes, and she smiled when she saw the unbroken seal, and the fading but still potent runes that would confuse any muggle who had managed to somehow get through the Charms covering the entire area. An untouched tomb. Another feather in her cap.

“Charlie would kill me if he knew what we just did,” Weasley said behind her.

She turned around and raised her eyebrows at him. “What we just did? I do not recall you doing anything to the Sand Drake,” she said in her most upper-class tone.

He flinched, just as she had flinched when her classmates at the boarding school had first made fun of her Cokeworth accent, and she snorted. No spell had brought down this beast, but muggle weapons and a squib's skill. She pointed at the entrance behind her. “Start earning your keep, Weasley. You're the Curse-Breaker.”

He stared at her for a moment, then shook his head and aimed his wand at the stone door. She forced herself to watch as she drank more water. As much as she hated to see others work magic she could only see but never cast, she had long learned that as a squib in her position, she needed to know as much about curses as possible.

*****​

The sun had already vanished behind the hills, a red glow in the sky remaining, when they reached their camp. She was tired and dearly needed a bath, or at least a shower, and something more than an energy bar.

“Auntie! Auntie!”

And yet when she heard her nephew's voice and saw him running towards her, she forgot all about that. Smiling widely, she crouched down and opened her arms, and Harry jumped at her.

“Did you find the tomb? Was it where you thought it was?” He asked when she released him.

“It was.” She nodded. “You know what that means?”

“Hm...” He wrinkled his nose, and for a moment, she saw her sister there. Lily had had the same expression when she was thinking hard about something. Then he smiled. “We can celebrate my birthday without you having to work for the goblins?”

She nodded. “Exactly! We can visit the beach!” Gringotts had balked at providing Portkeys to Sharm El Sheikh, but she had insisted during the contract negotiations. Between her work and Harry's school, they had to make the most of his vacations.

“So, how much treasure did you find? And how many traps?”

“Well...” she stopped when she noticed a dark shape in the sky. In a second, she had Harry behind her and one Glock pointed at it.

“Auntie?”

“Shhh.”

He fell silent. The shape - a large bird - flew closer, and she tensed, ready to shoot. She hadn't heard of birds guarding tombs, but it was the unknown trap that killed a curse-breaker. Or an archeologist.

The bird landed a few yards away in the sand. It was an owl, she realised, and it was holding out its leg, to which a green envelope was tied.

A very familiar envelope. She felt as if her heart skipped a beat. She had known this day was coming ever since that horrible night, almost ten years ago. “It's your Hogwarts acceptance letter,” she said.

The way his eyes lit up and he broke into a smile hurt, but she didn't let that show. She forced herself to smile, forced herself not to think of her own childhood, her jealousy, and how she had lost her sister. Harry deserved to enjoy this.

But as he opened it, babbling excitedly, all she could do was hope that she wouldn't lose her nephew as she had lost her sister.

*****​

It's "Petuna Evans, Tomb Raider" - Petunia's jealousy of Lily drove her to excel in her studies, and she went to University, studying archeology. She never met Vernon, and wasn't married or in a relationship when Dumbledore delivered Harry to her. She's not a muggle, but a squib - so she can enter areas protectd by muggle-repelling charms. That allowed her to make quite a few finds her muggle collegaues couldn't even see, and she built up a reputation in her field. Which led to her working with gringotts, getting partnered with Bill Weasley. Harry went to Boarding School at an early age, but otherwise has a good loving one-aunt family. Petunia is still jealous of wizards and witches, and despises depending on them, but she's professional enough to work with them. The story would focus on her, of course, and how she deals with her nephew's trouble and her own issues. And the trauma of the events that cost her her sister repeating themselves. Harry isn't some pint-sized punisher, nor did he receive military training as a toddler, and he doesn't carry a gun either, but he's aware of the magical world, and knows the Weasleys through Bill. Hermione of course knows of the famous Dr. Evans, and has read all her articles, but wasn't aware that Petunia was a squib, and active in the magical world.

**** I just started a new story based on a prompt from last year, so there is a chance - but I need time to write it. Odds are, I'll do my "Grindelwald breaks out of prison after Albus's death to redeem himself by saving Briain from Voldemort for his dead love" crackfic first.

** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept": Petunia is a witch, but a late bloomer, so to speak. She's a good mother to Dudley and Harry, and despite her own problems, she often seems the only sane peson in her circle of acquaintances.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  When the letter arrives, Lily is almost as excited as Petunia. She writes Albus Dumbledore to ask if she can go to, and if she cries a little when the answer comes back no she doesn't tell anyone. Lily waves from the train platform, writes diligently, and listens with excitement whenever her big sister deigns to share stories of magic. --Anonymous asked for "what if Petunia was a witch and Lily a Muggle?"
