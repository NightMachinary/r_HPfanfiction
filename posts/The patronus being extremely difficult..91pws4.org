Hi, I recently had a thought about the Patronus charm. In almost every Powerful!Harry fic I've read (with a few exceptions) the Patronus charm is used as a major sign for Harry being extremely powerful.

This quote is taken directly from such a fic "Harry knew that he himself was powerful; after all, he could produce a Patronus at thirteen, (something many full grown wizards had trouble doing)."

My point, however, is that this makes no sense. Almost the entire DA could produce one only two years later... So obviously it's not so extraordinarily difficult as it just takes a lot of work and practice.


** I suppose a more accurate summation would be thus:

The Patronus Charm is a difficult spell to /learn/ to cast.

One has to learn from experience what sort of emotional state they need to keep in mind to cast the spell. This is more difficult than say creating fire or levitating a rock.

The difficulty lies in the additional emotional component, rather than merely the intent to create a guardian.

**** The key I think is experience. Th more practice one has with using a spell, the more easily they can cast it.

Eventually they find themselves at a point where they can remove elements of the spell but still cast it correctly. Words, wand motion, etcetera; they can be stripped away until all that is required is the intent behind the magic and a wand. And even the wand may be disregarded eventually.

** IIRC, the crux of the argument that Harry's patronus casting abilities made him magically powerful, was that he was able to fend off a huge group of dementors with it, in a life or death situation. There's no guarantee someone like Hermione or Cho would be able to replicate Harry's results in the same situation.

I have a feeling that, at the time of writing PoA, Harry's accomplishment with the patronus was an actual accomplishment. A lot of the earlier books hint at the series being a Hero's Journey, and that Harry was, at one point, designed to be genuinely powerful wizard who might one day be held in the same regard as a Dumbledore or Voldemort might. For whatever reason, Rowling fell out of love with the hero's journey and decided that Harry as an Everyman was a more appealing decision, which is why he struggles so much with magic later on in the series, despite seeming to have such an intuitive grasp of it earlier. I suspect part of Harry's rebranding as a more average wizard included downplaying his previous accomplishments.

** I think inability to cast Patronus as very mediocre skills in Defence of most magical population is related more with absence of good DADA teacher in Hogwarts for several decades, than with their real power.

The case when DA managed to learn it with Harry's help just proves this.

** Some thoughts about the difficulty of Patronus (based on my earlier post):

1. Patronus is not a spell that requires a lot Patronus-specific of skill or practice: it took a 3rd-year Harry months to learn, whereas DA students, about 2-3 years older, learned the basic form in two weeks. That suggests that the general magic skills acquired in those years help.
2. Environment matters: casting in a comfortable setting among friends (e.g., DA), or even in a neutral setting (e.g., outside the Diner, or at the end of PoA^{1} ), is much easier than casting in the face of a Dementor, because Dementors suppress the very emotions needed to cast the Patronus (e.g., Harry's training, Hermione in the Ministry, battle of Hogwarts).
3. When casting in a difficult environment (i.e., in the face of a Dementor), the caster's emotional disposition and ability to persevere in the face of adversity are the decisive factors. Harry is brave and stubborn to the point of recklessness and wears his proverbial emotions on his sleeve, so he can push aside Dementor's depression and /just feel/. A more cerebral character (e.g., Hermione) falters, because how can one be happy in a world where money and blood matter more than truth, where slavery is commonplace, and where everybody leaves their homework to the last minute unless you nag them?
4. There is a pretty benign reason Patronus has a reputation as an obscure spell that few can cast: it's pretty darned useless to the vast majority of the wizarding population. Unlike, say, the Summoning Charm or even a Shield Charm, the Patronus Charm is a very narrowly tailored spell only useful to those who either 1) interact with Dementors and Lethifolds in some capacity or 2) know Dumbledore's Patronus messenger trick. So, yes, it's not on the OWLs; that doesn't mean it's beyond OWLs, only that OWLs cover more useful spells.^{2}
5. A more conspiratorial possibility is that the Ministry has an incentive to promote the Patronus Charm as very difficult, so as to discourage people from learning it, because it makes their terror weapon of choice less effective.

^{1} Notably, when Harry repelled a hundred Dementors at the end of PoA, he was casting from across a lake, at Dementors who were going after his time-clone, and bogeyed by the realisation that he has already cast the spell, so he was casting on the "easy mode" as well.

^{2} A neat headcanon I've seen in several fics is that the Patronus Charm can also repel Fiendfyre, but, as far as I know, there is no basis for it in canon.

** imho:

Its not that he is powerful what makes him capable of casting a Patronus.It is his ability to fuel the spell with emotion. People have a hard time focusing on one specific emotion/memory. Now imagine having to do it under stress /in a stressfull situation.

The average person, until properly trained to do so, lacks the ability to focus on certain things that pertains their mind. If I told you to not focus on your breathing right now, you would most likely become aware of every single breath for a while.

And lets not forget the most simple fact: Wizard and Witches of Magical Britain seem to enjoy being mediocre at best. Why improve yourself when you have Magic?

**** Put one of your fingers on one of your nostrils, it will let you calm your breathing, and soon the situation will be forgotten. Sorry .

In the fanfiction I am writing atm, there are no magical cores, or oceans of power inside one Witch/Wizard.

Magic is like a muscle. If you flex it, you can train it. If you overuse it, you can suffer damage. However the ability to wield magic is similar to being able to focus. Some people are better, some not so much. The average Witch and Wizard are good enough to excell at school and in their jobs but the heavy Magicks, that require one to spend hours of concentrated casting, are beyond them.

I made it so, that Magic is not taught before the age of 11, because children need to have learned the basics of mental controls, in order to achieve proper spell casting. If a child is unable to focus they are unable to learn casting spells without exhausting themselves after a simple Flipendo.

Anyways,

If a famous person does something that seems out of the ordinary, they will naturally receive more praise than someone who does the same but has not the same famous background.

Um, no. Only a few are mentioned as being able to do it, specifically Ron, Hermione, Cho and Seamus in OoTP (Luna later, I believe, and maybe Ginny). JKR has specifically said that the ability to produce a Patronus is a sign of superior magical ability. That's why Hermione knew Harry was powerful, because even other exceptional wizards (save for Dumbledore) have never produced a Patronus that drove off hundreds of Dementors at once.

Just check out the Pottermore stuff on the Patronus.

** I'm just gonna copy an [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8a6deo/about_the_achievement_of_a_corporeal_patronus/dwwame9][older comment of mine]].

#+begin_quote
  Does the fact that Harry is able to effectively teach several members of of the DA how to cast corporeal patronae undervalue his own abilities and achievement or does it stand as a testament to Harry as a teacher?
#+end_quote

1. It shows Harry's chops when it comes to teaching the understanding of how to face the Dark Arts, dark wizardry and dark creatures.
2. A bunch of 4th years up trying to learn it in a nice, comforting setting with all their friends is no where near as impressive as a 13 year old learning it by going face to goddamn face with dementors for months (all evidence shows that the boggart as dementor is indistinguishable from a dementor (EDIT: actually, the boggart!dementor would be weaker, forgot about that) as long as someone hasn't cast Riddiculous or whatever the charm is both spelled and actually called) on end, culminating with the successful casting during time travel shenanigans while driving off a veritable miasma of dementors.
3. We don't actually know how many people achieved a full-on corporeal Patronus. I just checked my copy of that chapter, and it says "The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before." So, the only number we have for how many people were successful is "few." Now, as far as I'm aware, few is not an actual number, so we're going to need to ballpark it. We know it would be more than one, as few implies plural. It would therefore put two as the minimum. Which coincidentally is the number of people specifically stated to have a corporeal Patronus (Cho, Hermione) though Seamus had one very momentarily but could not hold it. So what would be the upper limit? The definition of few includes a component denoting that it refers to a small amount. So I would say the upper bound would probably be 5. So ~2-5 people actually successfully cast one. And I would argue that it is Hermione, Cho and one to three NEWT students based on how difficult we know the Patronus to be and how damn good Harry is at Defense Against the Dark Arts.

I blame the movie for people thinking that the Patronus isn't actually a difficult thing to do.

** The DA never had to produce a Patronus in front of a dementor. Harry at 13 was able to drive back lots. The other thing you can say is perhaps that the patronus is still very hard but Harry is a great teacher. Full adults did struggle to produce a patronus. See Harry's trial in fifth year, they're impressed. The DA produced patronuses in a happy controlled environment, surrounded by their friends.

Probably not.

In canon, Time Turners do not create stable loops. It's all in the execution. That's why Dumbledore and Hermione stressed how dangerous they were because you can unbirth yourself.

Dumbledore and Hermione make this explicit, and Pottermore goes further and mentions how time travel experiments were banned in 1899 because of the catastrophic results of tampering with time.

Basically, just because Harry saw himself do it didn't make it easy. To cast a spell, you have to have the skill and power to do so.

I've now gone back and checked PoA. Harry does not describe feeling any effects of dementors' presence from across the lake before casting the Patronus. He also figures out that it was him who had cast it previously, giving him a happiness boost. So, yes, it was an "easy mode" cast.

I still don't follow what this has to do with anything, especially considering that Harry had only become aware of Time Turners' existence a few hours prior, and isn't particularly philosophical in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, just because Harry saw himself do it didn't make it easy.
#+end_quote

Not just because of that, no. It did make it easier, because happy thoughts are important to casting the spell. What made it easy is that he didn't have to deal with the dementors' anti-happiness aura or imminent threat from them (except in a very abstract sense, and Harry isn't a very abstract thinker).

#+begin_quote
  To cast a spell, you have to have the skill and power to do so.
#+end_quote

There is little canon evidence that when it comes to spell-casting, "power" is a separate requisite from skill, circumstances, and various personality traits like self-confidence, emotiveness, stubbornness, self-control, and optimism. The closest we have is the boat in Voldemort's cave in HBP, but the thing about that is that it either just counts the number of adult wizards, in which case it's not evidence of a power scale, or Harry's "power" is not even remotely near Dumbledore's.

#+begin_quote
  No one besides Dumbledore was ever shown casting a Patronus that powerful, and Hermione states outright that Harry's ability to do so indicates he's a very powerful wizard.
#+end_quote

Hermione is a very smart girl, but after 3 years at Hogwarts, she is not qualified to assess anybody's "power" based on how well they can cast a spell she barely knows anything about, and that's assuming that she even meant "power" in some measurable sense rather than the way we'd use "powerful politician".

In this case, a Partronus is fuelled by positive emotions, and attacking dementors doesn't appear to diminish or exhaust it, so how many dementors it can attack before it runs out depends on the intensity and duration of the caster's emotions. This is hard to sustain when dementors are nearby, draining those very emotions, and easier when they aren't.

But, in particular, Harry's emotions and the personality that generates and sustains them---his stubbornness, his perseverance, his "wearing his emotions on his sleeve"---is what gives him a powerful Patronus and helps him resist the Imperius, but it also makes him incapable of following good advice, easy to manipulate for the likes of Umbridge and Voldemort, and probably cripples his Occlumency.

Harry taught most of the DA to do a patronus at around age 15-16 and that's about when high schoolers learn calculus. And the order is supposed to be on average smarter/better at magic than the average wizard and while calculus can be hard for some, a lot of college kids in stem learn to do it and master it in college.

** In my Potterverse, Harry takes his students out to the Golden Gate Bridge to practice their Patronus Charms on real (live?) Dementors. They must be able to at least cast an incorporeal Patronus and he uses the threat of the Dementors in a (minimally) controlled situation to see if the danger can coax a fully-corporeal one.

I think it takes a very grounded sense of self and maybe a sense of one's place in the world in order to summon the requisite happy memories in the face of very real, pants-wetting danger.

See Harry fly on a broom through the first task) The general public is impressed with the patronus at such an age (See Madame Bones at hearing. See OWL proctor). People ooh and aah over harry being able to make a corporeal patronus at such a young age. But then when it comes down to it, to reality, Harry is able to teach the entire DA patroni. People don't usually try to learn it, but if they do try, they'll find that they can succeed. It's an uncommon skill mistaken for an exceptional one. Just like Harry.
