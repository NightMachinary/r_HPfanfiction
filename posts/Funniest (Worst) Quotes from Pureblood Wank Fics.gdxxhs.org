We've all read hilariously pro aristocratic pureblood wank fics. Lord Potter to the 10th power threatens muggleborn Hermione Granger to an honor duel for referring to him as "Harry". "I swear on my magic" "So Mote it be!" "I, Lord Potter, accept your oath of vassalage Heir Longbottom."

What are some of your favorite "gems"?

*** If that's the case, then muggles shouldn't be aware of those people. If Shakespeare was a muggle born, for example, he probably married a witch, wrote at least a few direct references to magical affairs into his body of work, and was expected by the wider magical community to hide his magical nature from muggles. As such, I would expect the Ministry to go around "rescuing" his works from muggle hands after the Statute was signed. When Victorian romanticism came along, the muggle world wouldn't find any works by Shakespeare, but there were plenty of other authors and playwrights from the same time and place as Shakespeare. The Granger's might be giving their daughter a different name, sourced from a different literary work.

**** Shakespeare would have been pre-SoS, so he wouldn't have had to hide. There are references to magic and potions in his plays. Pretty much all pre-Enlightenment literature has references to magical things. People historically believed in magic back then, because they were superstitious as hell.

It is still a silly trope, of course.

** Since I'm currently /trying/ to read Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin

"You are gravely mistaken, Sentinel, especially in your assumption that I was making any sort of ... request. And what you call humility was meant to be simple diplomacy which I now see was wasted, and so I will be more direct. I am Harry Potter, Heir Presumptive of the Ancient and Noble House of Potter. I am a Speaker of the Founder's Sacred Tongue. I have quested throughout this castle in search of you and earned the trust and respect of the wisest of Hogwarts' serpents. Though I am young, I am no child, for my childhood was burned away by cruel neglect and brutality as soon as I could walk. I am not ignorant, for I was cunning enough to lay low a mountain troll despite my youth. I am not weak, for I have already crossed wands with my greatest rival within the House of Slytherin and humbled him, instilling in all my peers a fear of my power. Like a shadow, I pass unnoticed beneath the gaze of the most dangerous dark lord of our time even as I proudly aid those who seek his ruin. I have seen my heart's desire reflected in the darkest of cursed objects, and my will was strong enough turn aside from it. So, Sentinel, if these are not enough to earn my passage, then you will tell me what more I must do to satisfy you. Otherwise, serpent, you will obey my command and reveal to me the secrets of the Prince of Slytherin!" - Harry, 11yo

** Well, I've never seen your first example. "I swear on my magic" is one of the most common lines in all HP fanfiction. "So mote it be" is again, extremely common in any fic that has an element of ritual magic, because it historically has strong ritual connotations via the Masons. And honestly, I can think of far worse tropes than oaths of vassalage.

I'd say the worst sort of pureblood wank fics have things like "Lord Potter, your great-great-great-great-great grandfather signed a marriage contract with Lord Edward Selwyn, which neither family has acted upon yet, and the contract has a deadline which runs out next Friday at midnight. I'm afraid you'll need to marry an available heir to the Selwyn name by that date or forfeit your magic."

I could see that in a variation of canon, though less 'ward' and more 'vassal' - if we take pureblood nobility as similar to muggle nobility from earlier periods, it'd make sense to have a system of bringing in retainers like that.

The bad part is when the system is presented as fair and good, and whoever it is that becomes his legal vassal (eg, Hermione) is completely content in that role.

**** But it still makes little sense at Hogwarts. A vassal is someone who swears fealty in return for protection and possibly other advantages such as favourable business terms or marriage ties. Frankly, nothing of that would make sense until both sides are adults. Colin Creevy does not offer Harry anything and 14 yo Harry would be unable to protect him.

And if you want to include political marriages, Harry has to marry another pureblood because otherwise he gains nothing out of that marriage and loses that avenue for connections.

#+begin_quote
  content as a vassal

That is honestly the least concerning bit. If both sides are true to their word, vassalage is a fair, mutually beneficial affair.

***** Right, a vassal swears fealty in exchange for protection/patronage - and in such a more noble focused world, it could easily be setup such that the more powerful/wealthy noble purebloods would control things much more. A muggleborn might normally be harassed/attacked, since they have no wizarding protection/family - but by tying themselves to a noble, that'd put them under that protection.

In the case I was thinking of, it'd be less of a mutually benefactory setup, and more Harry extending protection to a friend (but in a way that then evolves into just actual/willing/happy societal submission, if that makes sense).

To me, a society that would have such power disparity that vassalage is good for them is going to be inherently bad - and should be /heavily/ reformed. For instance, one where Hermione, by virtue of being muggle-born, would be incapable of getting jobs, heavily disadvantaged, subject to repressive laws, etc, whereas Malfoy or Harry or any other high nobility among the purebloods, well that's not a good society.

**** Yeah, my issue with it is when Hermione, or whoever else, just accepts it and doesn't get angry about it.

I'd also say its a bit ridiculous in the context of a school. I'd accept such a tradition existing, but I think it would likely be governed by mores which say it should only be used for important things, not school yard squabbles. Likely on a basis such as "if a muggleborn can't even deal with a school bully, how would they bring any glory, honour, or other benefit to the House?"

***** I think in school, we could /maybe/ excuse it as the only place where the top purebloods might meet with the muggleborn - but yes, I'd normally expect it to be used after graduation (eg, once the muggleborn have proven themselves 'useful' and 'worthy').

For use at school, I'd picture it more of a loophole getting exploited.

** Two words: Slytherin solidarity. Every single fanfic with a Slytherin protagonist has Snape/the Slytherin prefects make the exact same speech about how you cannot let other houses see you disagreeing with other Slytherins because they all hate you and snitches get stiches, bla bla bla. Then the protag is bullied by other Slytherins, then they get their private, Slytherin-approved revenge and suddenly everyone respects them regardless of previous prejudices because /akshtually/ Slytherins value power, more than blood (and saying that makes them the good guys, somehow. Bullying the weak is ok, I guess). They also call each other allies instead of friends and love to talk about politics (because apparently every pureblood is trained to be a politician /eyeroll/). Did I already mention these kids are 11?

Where did this trope come from? Canon Slytherins aren't hated by houses other than Gryffindoor (they might be envied for winning the quidditch cup too often, though), and they aren't automatically distrusted by adults! Slytherin families often are the most influencial people around, their ideology is prominent and accepted by many witches and wizards, including the Minister for Magic himself (according to Dumbledore). While some people close to Harry are personally prejudiced against Slytherins, there is no proof of society-wide ostracism. Or a very specific speech at the beginning of the 1st year. Or 11-year olds prefering to make 'allies' instead of friends, because a hat told them they belong in the sneaky house or smth.

Stop trying to make all Slytherins misunderstood geniuses. This is the house Crabbe and Goyle went to, after all.

For the rest of the cast, like Ron or maybe Hermione, they dislike some Slytherin a lot (mainly Draco and his goons), but could not care less about the rest of the House.

*** I think pureblood children swearing oaths on their magic is what gets me the most. Honestly, I would avoid those like the fucking plague. What the hell is up with that? These kids were raised to their squib family members being outcast or killed, and they just willy nilly swear a completely spur of the moment oath that'll turn them into one?

It's especially grating when they do it to prove their innocence. Like, this is a world where any dark wizard can just say "imperio. Kill this dude. Obliviate." and you /literally don't know what just happened/. So then you go to swear an oath and it turns out - oops, you're now a squib. Tough luck. Better run before your dad drowns you or something.

Not to mention, magic is of the soul, and the soul is known to only be damaged when you kill someone in cold blood, and to actually take away a part requires ritualistic murder and like a whole thing and a ritual that was so disgusting JKR's editor vomited when he read it.

Honor today may be cheap for many, and people may go back on their word a lot, but this part is to symbolize how important oaths and your word are. This is a significant part of many belief systems, where making an oath willingly can be extremely binding, and breaking it is supposed to have grave consequences.

This was intended to make people more honest in their dealings so society could be minimally functional.

There's nothing flimsy about an Oath or Vow made willingly, the person offers it of their own free will, and chooses to risk whatever it is they want to risk. This is very different from the Horcrux ritual(of which we know little about) and the person has to shatter their soul forcefully and place it in an object, something unnatural.

Magic is definitely alluded to being a transcendental property much greater than mere biology. Souls exist and they can be magically interacted with. Additionally, Grindelwald says something to the effect of "Magic blooms in souls" in his movie. We've proved multiple times that magic can't be explained through genetics in this sub. It would need to be both a dominant and a recessive gene and be all sorts of fuckery.

That doesn't at all follow. An oath is a flimsy thing because soul manipulation in HP canon is intricate, complex and dark. Fracturing your soul takes an arcane ritual of unknown magnitude. For an oath to be able to surgically extract only your magic it would be at least on that level, but probably even further beyond.

And, as you say, Honor is cheap today. If it works like you say it does, then the oaths become meaningless because nobody cares like they did in the old days.

Not to mention, Honor is not enforced magically in HP canon. There are duels, but they serve as challenges. Honor itself doesn't get in touch with magic in any way. It's still a societal thing, even among magicals.

Yes there is. It's a single spell, vow, whatever. We know of one other magical vow, this one binds your life, and it requires a specialized binder and is a lot more intricate and ritualistic. The Unbreakable Vow is one such magically enforced contract, but it has NOTHING to do with honor. All it is is a contract.

If you break it, you die, it's as simple as that. Nothing to do with Honor.

For a person to just willy nilly do "I swear to tell the truth on my magic" is fucking ridiculous based on what we know about splitting the soul, extracting parts of it and other binding vows.

It's fucking lame, too.

An oath is just supposed to be another type of contract, and while I do agree just taking out your wand and saying a few words is a bit dumb, I am not averse to the idea of people doing it in similar way to what what Snape did, just that the contract is with themselves.

I also dislike it because it`s just a cop out to get characters to believe the others fast and without drama.
