  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** Yes! Absolutely; this fic is brilliant as for once it actually features everyone doing their jobs competently. It's wonderful.

**** Yeah it's amazing to see how the initial "small" change resulted in a huge domino chain of events. It's so refreshing to see the Ministry actually doing their jobs. And so much happens in 34k.

***** My favourite bit is when the aurors come across the room of requirement and they ask for backup. A lot of backup. Like, the entire department of mysteries sort of backup. Cracks me up every time.

****** I'd forgotten about that until you said it! Looks like I'm due for another reread. I also liked how they noticed Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys and involved Mind Healers for both him and Ginny.

******* Yeah, my other favourite bit is Hermione and the calming draught, specifically when her parents try and tell her off while she's under the influence of it. It's a funny story, but a good one as well.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
