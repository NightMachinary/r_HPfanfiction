A story I read in May/2019 finally got a update because of the sick quarantine! This is hands down my favorite Harry/Oc Muggle Story I have read in the last 3 years. Its cute and fluffy, a bit relaxing to see harry see the world through new eyes and think back on his life and try to fix what was wrong while still seeing the present. It hit me in all good ways 10/10.

  After the graveyard, the Dursleys leave Harry with a muggle Spanish family for the summer. There, he meets a muggle girl who thinks (British) wizards have no common sense, and turns his world upside down while helping him deal with his life. After this, Hogwarts will have to prepare for the new and improved Harry Potter. How will his new maturity and take on life affect the war?
