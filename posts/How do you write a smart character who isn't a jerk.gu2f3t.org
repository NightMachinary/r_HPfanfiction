** Two main things that everyone should remember about intelligent people (as written by myself, a dumb person lol) -

1. Really smart people know how little of the world they actually know about. For example, someone with a Ph.D. knows a *LOT* about their particular field. About any other topic, they know probably as much as anyone else. So don't make your character a genius about EVERYTHING, it is dumb and annoying.
2. Intelligent people aren't constantly showing off how intelligent they are. Have you ever heard of a show called "House"? It was on FOX a few years back, about a doctor who knew so much he could always figure out what was wrong with his patients. Like most shows that feature a 'genius' protagonist, they made him a huge asshole to everyone else, constantly showing off how smart he was and intentionally disrespecting his colleagues. Basically, watch a show like that and make your 'smart' character do the exact /opposite/.

Hope that helps!

*** Yeah, ^{^{100%}} agree. Usually you don't know someone is smart-smart or has done a big accomplishment until they reveal themselves. Ex: say something insightful, bring a new perspective, perhaps ruminate silently while others talk/not loud mouths. (But hey! There are of course variations like the loudmouth that's also a genius)

*** The first point is so true - in University it's interesting how many times you can ask professors questions that are just slightly outside their specialty, and they will refuse to answer. If you make them guess, chances are they'll guess right since they HAVE spent decades learning things, but half the time they will insist on calling up another professor who knows better than them. But they always make sure you know that they can be wrong if a subject isn't their area, even if to an undergrad it seems close enough

** Honestly the whole "I'm a genius so I'm actually a horrible person to other people" is perpetuated in so much media: big bang theory, bones, house, the cumberbatch Sherlock etc...

A good example I think is Charlie from Numb3rs who is a genius but still has good friends and good relationships with his dad and brother. Or Reid from Criminal Minds who is socially awkward but not mean.

Basically, just because someone knows things doesn't mean their character flaws is being mean to people. Think of other character flaws. Maybe they're insecure about their intelligence, or maybe they're smart but impulsive or won't accept help from others when they should. Or they're intelligent in one area but their passion is in another area.

** I think the key is to make their 'smartness' as implicit and understated as possible. Don't tell us (the readers) the character is smart through their words or classmates/teachers saying they're smart (and definitely don't put anything like 'smart!Harry' in the fic description). Show the character's intelligence through them being good at magic/thinking up a clever solution to a problem/etc.

** If you're talking about the anti-social factor (which I see you mentioned in another comment), a socially awkward or anti-social character doesn't necessarily have to be a jerk about it. Other people might see them as a jerk or a snob simply because they don't like to be social, but if you make the smart character's motivations clear, they won't come across as a jerk to the reader. You can avoid the know-it-all tendency that often annoys people by making the character less talkative and more internal.

** This is a rather odd way to give advice, but I'm gonna speak from my own experience. I am rather smart, (get good grades, pretty good at solving problems, etc) and I try to not be an asshole whenever possible. By the accounts of friends and family I mostly succeed. Here are three situations I've encountered in life where it is easy to be an asshole that are specifically related to being a bit smarter than other people.

1: Someone is doing something wrong, and you know how to do it right.

Ans: Unless its actually dangerous for the thing in question to be messed up, dont intervene directly. Offer to help once (only once) and if they say no then let them be and let them do the thing wrong. Chances are the person in question is also smart, (because few people are genuinely stupid) and will figure it out eventually. If they don't figure it out then they will either look up how to do it (if means to do so are available) or ask for help. If someone asks for help, help them but do not talk about their previous failure beyond contrasting the wrong way to do the thing with the right way. Do not do that more than once for any given step in the process unless asked for clarification.

2: Someone asks for a piece of information and you have said information.

Ans: Make the person asking aware that you have said information in a calm, reserved, or gentle manner. Do not begin telling said information unprompted, wait for the person asking to acknowledge that they would like you to answer. Do /not/ explain said information in a condescending fashion, or as if the information is obvious or plain to see.

3: when arguing with someone over something objective.

Ans: While still in the arguement, acknowledge the other persons point of view. When you are proven right, do not mention it or gloat. /When you are proven wrong/, acknowledge your error, and do your best to not repeat whatever it was you were wrong about. Most importantly, don't just admit that you are wrong, (do that) but also /acknowledge that the other person was right/.

In general avoid condescension, and always examine your own behavior to check if you have been acting with a sense of superiority.

I hope that's helpful to you, although there is a good chance it isn't. Above all I really hope I didn't sound like an asshole.

** Being intelligent doesn't make you better or superior to other people. The non-jerk ones realize this and don't show off. Make them helpful and generous without delivering multiple /well actually/ speeches showing off their big brain.

The current COVID-19 situation has provided a perfect example of this. Anthony Fauci is an extremely intelligent person and is not a jerk. His boss is the opposite...unintelligent and a huge jerk. Intelligence (or lack of it) doesn't breed people being jerks...hubris and entitlement do.

** Make them care about what they know. Have them really passionate in a subject and always wanting to learn more about it. (Put in scenes where they get really excited when they meet someone in a particular proffesion and ask them a bunch of questions etc)

A way to demonstrate this is instead of starting explanations with "fine, I'll dumb it down for you..." start them with "this is so cool..." or "let me tell you about..."

*** Test run for stereotypical house characters, do you think the Ravenclaw is too much of a smartass?

Four wizards, one from each house, go shopping together. After some time, they come across a most usual item: A knife enchanted to be so hot, it can cut through bread and toast it at the same time.

The Gryffindor immediately loves it: "Cool! Imagine /stabbing/ someone with that thing!"

The Ravenclaw rolls his eyes at the Gryffindor's reaction, carefully examines the red-hot blade and states: "Judging by the color, it's about seven hundred degrees Celsius. It would immediately cauterize the wound, and stop any bleeding. So it wouldn't be that good as a weapon."

The Slytherin smiles and asks the Ravenclaw: "True. But what if you wanted information?"

The Hufflepuff gives his friends a rather disturbed look, then he looks at the knife for a few seconds and finally asks the question: "Why would you want to /stab/ someone when you could have /toast/?"

** Remember that a lot of smart people (both the kind that are very intelligent/rare geniuses who think in a different way than normal and the kind that have been very well educated, smarter than average, and spent a long time improving themselves) will often be the first to say, "I don't know". They might speculate on something, but I find those of above average intelligence are comfortable acknowledging the limits of their knowledge on any particular topic.

When you get into a room with a bunch of the most senior researchers, globally recognized for their contributions to their field, I've noticed that when asked a question that's slightly outside their specific topic, they will be the first to say, "I'm not an expert on x/y/z. This is what I know about x/y/z based on x/y/z, don't quote me on that."

If you've written something that sounds mean, consider how the same information would be said or shared by a less smart, or nicer, character, and then see how it would fit for the smart character to say the same. Being smart doesn't mean correcting others all the time. Hermione is a good example of someone who is tactless with how she shares information, similar to Draco who makes fun of Harry for not knowing something about the Wizarding world.

** I think, firstly, what many fics with "smart" characters fall foul of is that they treat intelligence as though it's the ultimate virtue.

As though, if you're clever, you can get away with being selfish, thoughtless, spiteful, etc. Hands up who ever chose their friends based on cleverness?

There are far more important virtues in people - generosity, patience, charm (not as in the branch of magic!). Someome who's clever isn't immediately admirable or likeable just because of it.

The other feature people tend to use when they get it "wrong", in my view, is they have their clever characters simply (and often inexplicably) be very knowledgable. Clever people usually /are/ knowledgable, but that isn't all there is to it. People certainly aren't born knowledgeable, even if we accept that some people are naturally cleverer than others.

Cleverness that can make a character relatable should involve the character /learning/ information, and they can make clever inferences, ask clever questions, try clever experiments, to get there. That way the reader feels as though they're involved in the learning and can appreciate the efforts made by the character to be "clever".

** There's a common idea (I can't remember if there's a name for it; probably something like "the teacher's dilemma") that things that you already know feel obvious, so you are surprised that others are not aware of them.

For example, Hermione constantly forgets that no-one else has read "Hogwarts: A History".

When you show that character "A" knows something that character "B" doesn't, "A" can either be frustrated and snarky (as per House, Sherlock, etc), or they can talk too fast and bamboozle "B" but politely apologise and explain the missing steps/details when asked.
