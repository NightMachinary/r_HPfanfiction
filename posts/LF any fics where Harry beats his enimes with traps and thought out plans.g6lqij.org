Just like the title says I'm looking for any fics where Harry thinks ahead and plans every fight or at least most of them. Maybe he's a little good for his age power wise but not especially powerful

uses trickery and set traps ahead of time to win his fights where his enemies don't know what's going on /think they are winning, until they fall in in too far and can't fight back

thanks in advance

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

  Smarter Voldemort launches his conquest of Britain immediately after his resurrection. Smarter Harry, Sirius, and co. are the only ones who can stop him. Unconventional tactics. Begins after Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts.

  Follows HPB. A humorous 7th Year story as Harry takes creative, welldeserved revenge on Umbridge, Cornelius Fudge, Wormtail, Bellatrix, Snape, Malfoy, and Voldemort. Reviews appreciated.

** Okay so this Harry can not go anywhere but Slytherin.

Have you seen Wish Carefully? Most satisfying one shot in the world, shows Harry beating Voldemort and death eaters in the best way possible - Allowing them to keep britain on the condition they don't touch any muggles, and then leaving with all the light supporters and muggleborns, watching from afar as their misguided beleifs lead them to hell on earth.

So satisfying to hear how an Insane ruler screws up the country badly, with the mostly light middle class leaving, and the fact that inbreeding is causing most kids to become squbs.
