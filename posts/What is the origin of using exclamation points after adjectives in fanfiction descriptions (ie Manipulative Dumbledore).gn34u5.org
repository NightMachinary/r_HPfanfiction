** I believe it was from the era of Ranma fanfic before ffnet was a thing (fanfic were through email listing and fan sites iirc). Then the practice carried over. Not sure why they did it that way originally tho

Edit: quite a few theories proposed by fanlore

*** The editor parses exclamation mark in URL poorly, it should go [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/!][here]].

** Its an easy way to search for keywords. in the same way the Hash (#) was used as a tag for server names on IRC transitioned into being a searchable tag for twitter.

this way you can search for specific themes you want to see with the bang to filter out results that where the key you searched was in the summary or title.

** I believe it comes from how old email systems worked called Bang Path Notation, as they used to use ! to determine where to route an email.

For example BigUniversity!Phys!Chris is a different person to BigUniversity!Com!Chris.

In this way Manipulative!Dumbledore is different to Canon!Dumbledore, because they're not the same person.

** Doesn't that come from the factorial symbol, as in mathematics (because we fanfic readers are geeky like that)?
