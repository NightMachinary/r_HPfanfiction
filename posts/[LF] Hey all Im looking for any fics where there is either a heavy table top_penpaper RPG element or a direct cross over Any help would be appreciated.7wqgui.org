For example things like D&D, Shadow Run, Warhammer 40k, pathfinder ect. And yes Ive read Milo and the nat 20.


** You probably know linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 21). There's also the very similar and also excellent linkao3(Harry Potter and the Girl in Red). Both are highly recommended and feature a likable D&D character who finds their way to Hogwarts. In /Natural 21/ it's a Wizard, in /Girl in Red/ it's an Artificer. Both are, naturally, munchkins.

  After his self-sacrifice Harry is faced with a choice, stay in limbo or play a RPG game about himself. Enough to say that stories about a character that actually chose to stay in limbo would not be a popular one... Video-game fic.

** I'll see if I can find it in my Favourites, but there is one where Harry goes back to be the DADA teacher after the war and he ends up joining a student's D&D group - after a while the story becomes important staff room gossip :')
