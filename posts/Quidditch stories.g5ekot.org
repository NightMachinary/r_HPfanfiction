I am currently writing a quidditch story. Do you have any recommendations for other good stories about quidditch?


** linkffn(6864381)

I remember Quidditch was rather important in this one. Sadly, it isn't finished.

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD

** I've written....four? Four and a half?

Wait....[[/u/rpeh]] does the sequel to twelve days count or not?

Anyway

Vitam Paramus, Twelve Days, The Quidditch Workd Cup, and a fourth one I can only vaguely remember.

*** There's a sequel to Twelve Days? I thought you were concentrating on that immense Harry Potter / X-Men / Pokemon / My Little Pony mega-crossover.

** In addition to TE7's four, which you should definitely read (except Letters), there's also Paging Doctor Bell by zArkham, which I'm not allowed to link to because as well as Quidditch it also has underage people playing with long pointy things with a bristly bit at one end that are definitely not brooms. That one has some good bits but it's a bit patchy and also unfinished.

There's also linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality by BarneyXII ) which often gets suggested but I've never thought was particularly good.

There's also the set of stories starting with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse), in which Quidditch isn't the focus but plays a decently large role. The rules are also very different from standard Quidditch and arguably better than the original.

#+begin_quote
  From Hogwarts' historic pitch to the famous stadiums of Europe, Harry fights to earn his place amongst the all-time greats. The stakes are high, and sheer talent is never enough. It's more than just a game. A Quidditch story.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** How do you mean quidditch story? As in Harry goes pro in quidditch or just a load of quidditch games, also please link it here when you're done

Sorry I haven't even heard of a quidditch story before, I've seen quidditch in stories but not actual quidditch stories that are dedicated to quidditch, but I would like to see some quidditch action, so please link all quidditch stories, who doesn't love quidditch? I absolutely love all quidditch matches I've seen.

Yes it was intentional

*** I mean stories in which Quidditch plays an important role, be it at Hogwarts or after school. I haven‘t read any Quidditch stories myself, but I‘ve worked out a story I‘m writing now. However, I aquired a taste for it and would like to read more. My own story will not be finished until later in the year. It is only a side project of me
