This is a beautiful fic. It is incredibly well-written, thoughtfully characterized, and very thoroughly turned my emotions on end. I read it through in one sitting instead of working on my C++ homework.

It explores the Black family abuse and how it affected the entire family - builds up the relationship between Regulus and Sirius - and sticks to canon (for the most part). The ghost who becomes a major character is not canon. It's not full of action, it's very much a character-based story, but it is phenomenal. Highly recommend. It does seem disjointed at times, but that's explained. The unreliable narrator is Regulus.

TW: halfway through the fic Regulus attempts suicide (due 10000% to what his mother's done) and it's written off as the "Black family curse", vaguely referenced but never explained; drowning is occasionally described by someone who drowned, and someone who thought he had almost drowned; it's not pleasant.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)
