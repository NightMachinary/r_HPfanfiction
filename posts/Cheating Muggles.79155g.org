In Harry Potter it seems that the only metals you can't create is Gold or maybe silver. Then if that's true couldn't you just conjure a load of lets say copper and sell it for scrap I mean it high enough quantities you should make a good chunk of money. Do you have any was to cheat muggles.


** There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pxd4b/discussionrequest_wizardsharry_taking_advantage/][a similar discussion]] here a few months ago, and it seemed that nothing in the Canon prevented them from doing so. The exchange rate from Pound to Galleon also looked super favorable at 5:1 during the 90s.

My opinion is that they could easily memory charm their way to the top. For example, it should be quite easy to 'convince' the board of directors to grant you tons of stock options for your 'valuable consulting work' for the company. You might as well do something for the company after all, such as 'obtaining' lucrative deals, favorable court decisions, and easy government approvals/certifications.

Wizards casually memory charmed Muggles throughout the Series, and were never caught. I doubt the various Ministries would really care. After all, Oblivate and planting false memories were the cornerstone of maintaining the SoS. As long as they do not flaunt flashy spells in the public, they should be fine.

Beside memory charms, there are plenty other options:

- Reparo is a wonderful spell, opening a car repair shop could do. Or use it to fix up depressed real estate and flip it for serious profit, like what Bellatrix and Draco did in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]].
- Gemino is another great spell. You really don't want to use it on bank notes because even the largest one is only 1000 Euro and you end up with a bunch of identical serial numbers. No, you want to duplicate materials more precious than gold, which can't be duplicated according to canon. But there's nothing preventing you from making a killing with titantium, silver, platinum, and even plutonium!
- Legilimency and Veritaserum are excellent way to steal sensitive information. For example, you 'find out' that the FDA is going to reject a drug that most on Wall-Street expects to be approved. You take the opposite positions to them and watch your stock options increase in value by >1000 times.

Plutonium is a man-made element, so getting your hands on an initial seed would be difficult (assuming you weren't willing to steal from muggles). But you /could/ get a tiny amount of U-235 from a mass spectrometer, and duplicate from there. Of course, there's no way to sell it back to the muggles without attracting a ton of unanswerable questions, so the only real use is if you want to make an atomic bomb or a reactor.

** just use the imperius on a very rich muggle - nobody cares about muggles anyway - and get them to give you all their money. Or force the people in charge of fort knox or something to give you all the gold. Or sell them a hangover potion and make millions. Or at least make platinum since gold and silver are the impossible ones. Or make cocaine in huge quantities and sell it after magically sabotaging muggle smuggling routes. Apparate into a bank vault or set a niffler free like in Fantastic beasts, then shake it empty. Kidnap someone important by apparating in and out, then ask for money to release them. Obliviate the apparition, they'll explain it away by having been drugged. There are so many options, why would you settle for copper? Last time I took all the wiring out of a house I was renovating, it was worth like 2 dollars.

** If you were going to take this route, you'd be better off converting muggle money into galleons, which are made of gold but are hideously undervalued, then sell the galleons in the muggle world for the gold value. No cheating required.

Alternatively, if you were already inclined to use magic to rob somebody blind, why wouldn't you just... use magic to rob them?

*** From the fact that nobody does it, it is usually presumed that Goblins have found some way to prevent wizards from just melting the Galleons. Whether they be charmed against melting, or charmed to explode upon metling while releasing a Howler in Gobbledegook, or something.

*** I think that in cannon you are unable to do that, if only because wizard money (as are most rewarding artifacts) is spelled to look like trash to muggles.

also, I think gallons contain other properties that are not present in equivalent gold purity does not. (i.e. is tougher, less malleable, etc)

** That is true... but you could just use it to spend in stores by passing the banks altogether.

Alternatively, you could also put a confundus on a check or piece of paper or do something similar to what Dumbledore did on the orphanage matron when he went to introduce Voldy to the magical world for the bank to deposit a large sum of money in your account...

*** If you duplicated notes? You'd only be able to use one at a time in one shop/bank at a time, because the serial numbers printed on them (in the UK all notes have serial numbers) also duplicate.

***** You would need tons of different numbered notes to duplicate, is my point. At any given time, half of your funds in that strategy would be actual notes, which defeats the point of trying to get rich by duplication.
