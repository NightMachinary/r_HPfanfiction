So I had this idea.

- Set in goblet of fire.
- Harry's name comes out of the cup.
- He decides he's not putting up with this sh*#
- Gets up and grabs his bag and starts shoving some food etc in it. (packing up) all the while shouting at everyone about how he didn't enter and is sick of everyone's(Wizarding world) attitude.
- Eventually when he's packed, he looks up and says he's leaving and does anyone want to leave with him.
- Everyone looks at him like he's unhinged.
- He's about to leave when in the silence, one quite lone voice agrees, she will leave with him. (no idea who this will be. But someone different to the common fan on cliches.)
- She also grabs her bag and some food and goes to stand by him.
- No one else wants to leave. Hedwig flies in though and lands on his shoulder.
- Dobby also arrives and agrees to go with them. He promptly collects their trunks.
- They slowly walk out the hall to Silence.
- As Harry walks past the goblet of fire he kicks it over.
- During all this I'm sure Snape is berating him and taking points, while Dumbledore is assuring McGonagall that they won't be able to leave the castle.
- Harry and his collection of friends decide to leave via the side entrance and small boats to Hogsmeade train station, accidently bypassing Dumbledores locked front doors.
- as they are walking sitting in the boat, Harrys friend asks if Harry has a plan, because it's Harry Potter. He always has a plan. To which he responds in the negative.

So any takers?


** I feel like it would be a Hufflepuff.

*** Like I mentioned, like a Dorethy Boyd type character. I can see Ron asking Hermione, "who is that". So probably a quiet hufflepuff yeah
