Really want to read fics that re-create characters in ways large and small. Things like:

- Competent!Quirrell / Mentor!Quirrell

- Neutral!Snape / Positive!Snape

- Dark!Dumbledore etc...

- Creature!Harry

- Powerful!Neville/BWL

You get the idea...


** jbern's work, particularly his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]], is remarkable for its rethinking of canon characters.

*** Should also give particular mention for his fic [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] for characterizing Foul-mouthed!SortingHat.

** The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] has Quirrell as mentor. The story is abandoned; several additional chapters can be found on DLP in the story's Work by Author thread.

Perspicacity's one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] comes to mind as an original take on Hedwig.

#+begin_quote
  The real hero of Deathly Hallows was Hedwig; this is her story. A canon-compliant, Deathly Hallows era, spy/military/action/thriller with Hedwig as protagonist.

*** I think there's one where harry goes back in time, and now as an adult relizes that Lockhart is hamming it up the media. He then befriends him.

** There's this competent Lockhart story I read somewhere... I think it might be by rorschach's blot

*Edit:* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/145/Odd-Ideas][Link]], it's a oneshot

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9238861/][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk has a Lockhart who is still a con artist, but one who could credibly get one over the likes of Dumbledore.

** HPMoR has competent, mentor Quirrell and a very interesting Snape and Dumbledore.

EDIT: already mentioned! but seriously, that fic has the finest Quirrell ever written and it's not even close.
