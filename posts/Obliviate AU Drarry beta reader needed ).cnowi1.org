I am looking for a Drarry fic beta reader! I hate putting stuff into the world that hasn't at least gotten the opinion of one person besides myself, but none of my friends are interested in Drarry enough to read. :(

It's an Obliviate AU in which the only thing Draco can't remember is Harry. It's set at the end of fifth year (after the Department of Mysteries). I plan on having it continue into their sixth year. I don't need someone to read the whole thing unless they so desire, but advice on the first chapter or the first few would be greatly appreciated! Just to see if I'm on the right track. I don't want Harry and Draco to become too friendly to fast, and I really want to get their relationship right. I'm trying to stay mostly in line with the major book events/HP Universe rules, and only take liberties when I need to. If you even just want to talk and throw ideas back and forth, I love talking about my favourite ship of all time!

I already posted the first chapter in case anyone wants to get a feel of the fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7799188/chapters/17793487][Remind Me Again by triggerlil]]

Thanks so much! If you're interested comment/PM and I can hook you up with what I've got so far?


** Can I offer you a trade? :-) I also need a beta reader for the same reasons - I can edit it just fine, but I really would feel better with another set of eyes on it for plot, pacing, character development, etc (just anything that stands out as weird or incomplete). Mine's an 8th year drarry fic.
