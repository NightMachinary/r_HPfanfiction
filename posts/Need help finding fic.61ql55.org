I've tried looking myself multiple times but cant seem to find it T-T

It's a fic where harry has to live with snape for some reason or another. I'm pretty sure its when he is younger. All I really remember is that there's a house-elf snape leaves in charge of taking care of harry since he doesn't want to deal with the "brat" himself. But the elf mistreats him. I'd really appreciate it if anyone knew which fic it is

***** it was one of those Harry lives with Snape fics so the house elf was an old prince family one I think. I'm pretty sure it didn't like harry cuase one reason or the other and twisted Snape's orders around to do what it wanted
