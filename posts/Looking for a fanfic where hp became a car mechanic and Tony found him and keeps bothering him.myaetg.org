  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave.

**** CROSSOVERS MARVEL Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5366507]]) Phil Coulson/Harry Potter

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17983598]]) Harry Potter/Tony Stark

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]]) I think this one is a Loki/Harry really good

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17983598]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678135]])

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17121188][The Best Avenger, According to Teddy Lupin]] is a short sweet Harry/Clint fic. Highly rec. *Summary:* The only thing Teddy wants for Christmas, besides the new Cleansweep, is to meet Hawkeye aka the best Avenger.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13038294][Waiting]] short Harry/Loki soulmate fic *Summary:* Harry's soulmark words are not written in English. Loki's are. It makes things complicated for both of them. And it means a lot of waiting

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1272098][Your Soul is bound to mine]] is a brilliant series. Every work is Harry paired with a different Avenger (Soulmates) slash and het. Highly rec.

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  The new reality had no wizards or magical nations -- but it had a whole boatload of powerful and occasionally inept sorcerers. Who were usually semi-public and sometimes very popular in social media. How it worked, Harry had no idea.

  The Magical's were separating form the Mundane world. No longer able to ensure their secrecy with the advancing technology of the Muggles, they were leaving entirely.Harry wasn't going with them. Or, the one where Harry met Tony and the events of the first Iron Man movie mostly happen anyway.

#+begin_quote
  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

  Harry worked for W.A.N.D., the Wizarding Association of National Defence. He liked his job, and he liked being a lonely, miserable, old bugger. But when he's assigned to protect Tony Stark he's unprepared for what he'll have to face: a nosy, interfering superhero intent on getting Harry a life, or perhaps just getting himself one.
