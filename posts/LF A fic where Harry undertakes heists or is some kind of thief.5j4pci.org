Cos the premise sounds interesting. Bonus points if it's WBWL/Non-BWL.


** Obvious first runners:

linkffn(A Black Comedy) - Harry follows Sirius through the Veil to an alternate timeline. Hijinks ensue.

linkffn(Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood) - Harry discovers the Potter fortune is based partly on the success of their wards... and partly on the robbery done to make people want them.

**** It starts off absolutely hilarious, but eventually the humor starts feeling forced, which is unfortunately a pattern in that author's longer fics as he feels the need for serial escalation rather than keeping a more natural flow.
