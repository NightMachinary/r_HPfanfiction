Looking for stories where Sirius ends up being a Death Eater, he either believes in what his parents believed in, doing it to spy on the Death Eaters or had no choice but to join. Either way would be fine.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
