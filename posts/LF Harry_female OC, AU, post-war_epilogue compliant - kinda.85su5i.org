Fic starts with Harry/Ginny, but then a Female OC is transfered into the Canon or Harry gets transported into her Universe. The AU is a World in which the War against Voldemort lasted longer and destroyed great Parts of (magical) Environments/landscapes. Harry died in this AU and only going down in History as the Bow-who-lived (or maybe the Spirit of the Resistance is broken, since the "saviour" didnt rescued them against Voldy). Harry attempts to help her (much to Ginnys Chagrin, since Harry gained piece and "other Universes" Problems arent their Business...or whatever reason). The Travel between the Universes should be more or less easy, but limited to an amount of uses in a time period. Harry may be fascinated by her at first, later then finds her attractive and fall for her. She is a fighter type and has a high position in the Resistance.

Maybe the Horcruxes are kept more secretely hidden, since the Canon happenings affected the AU or the Horcruxes are other Items.


** Is this a story you've seen but lost track of it, or is it a story you'd like to have somebody write for you?

[I'm not volunteering; just trying to clarify your request]

*** seems a bit TOO specific to be a request, more like a search. He should flair it properly, if it is in fact a search tho,
