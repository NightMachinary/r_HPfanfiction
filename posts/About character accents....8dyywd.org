How do you feel about authors specifically altering words in dialog to reflect a character's accent? I haven't done that in one of my stories at all, even though there are several french and bulgarian characters that speak with accents.

I'm asking because in the books JKR altered Viktor's and Fleur's speech to showcase their accents but I'm not sure if it's good to do. Is altering dialog to reflect accents appropriate/normal/distracting/stereotypy/whatever?


** I keep canon compliant so I only do it for characters that have their accents described in the books. For others like McGonagall or Seamus, we can assume they have an accent but it's rather soft. I hate it when authors take a character like Seamus and try to write the accent they heard in the films.

******* I find this to be one of the most annoying ways in which authors try to assert a character's foreign-ness. Why would they use their mother tongue for, as you say, simple words which they learned in their very first English class? In spite of it being my first language, I can assure you that I don't respond to questions with the German "ja" or "nein" and don't know any foreigners who would and it therefore sounds really contrived when this is done in fan fiction. The only exception to this I can think of is where the character is surprised or shocked and reverts to their first language as this might be a more instinctive response for them.

One of the more natural ways I've seen for authors to get the accent across is to do the reverse: have the character (occasionally) struggle with difficult words which they wouldn't be expected to know. I think I've seen this used mostly in interactions between Viktor and Hermione.

******** I have friends who are french and even though I don't speak french very well when I talk with them we both use little french words here and there. To be honest I feel like there are only like five words you need to speak to have a conversation with a french person. Ouais, d'accord, ok, san marche, ouais.

********* That sounds like more of a mutual thing which seems fine. I could see this happening between Bill and Fleur for example or even Fleur and Hermione (maybe because she picked up some French when she was there on holiday). But I think it needs to be presented as a couple or friendship type thing rather than throwing in random foreign words because the character is an idiot.

Taking it back to real life, if I'm chatting to a friend and one of us says "ja" it's funny. If I do it with a random colleague or a stranger it's pretty stupid.

*********** Why would it make them seem comfortable? Nobody does it anywhere else but in jokes. Speaking Spanish to someone wouldn't make you seem closer to them and neither would be adding random words from a different language since most people who speak more than 1 language fluently try to avoid mixing them up.

******** Not really through, “ et” breaks up the story's pace, it's like adding a random word in a sentence that has no place there. Maman and Papa can be added when the French character is speaking to their parents but in a normal sentence? No. It's fucking annoying to revert to another language when talking to someone and I assure you nobody doesn't it willingly or even subconsciously.

***** I think they're referring to authors who take Oliver's quidditch obsession too far, to the point of mentioning it in every scene he's near, or having him speak only in quidditch terms. It's also possible that, seeing as this is a thread about accents, they're talking about his canonical Scottish accent. I haven't personally seen any fanfiction go overboard with phonetic spelling or slang, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happens; Scottish accents are rarely handled well by non-natives.

** I just don't do it, really.

Within my current story, Fleur being a main character presented this quandary and I decided that I'd just write her without an accent. I think using a dialect within speech often removes the value of the words themselves, or the value of the words is lost in the cumbersome writing, rather.

I think it depends, though, in a more general sense. As with all things in writing, does it serve a purpose?

Does writing in a dialect help with immersion? Does the use of a dialect help show a characteristic of a character? Do you change the 'thickness' of the written accent over time to show progression?

If so, then I would do so. But, if it doesn't serve a purpose, it feels to me to be a waste of time.

*** I think it helps with immersion, I just don't want it to be overkill when two Bulgarian characters are talking to each other and then a little farther down a French character is talking to them.

Basically, if I'm gonna do it I have to do it for every thick accent dialog situation and not just when the accented dialog has room to breathe. It's gotta be consistent

** It can be done well, but honestly if the reader wants them it's much easier for them to do it themselves.

About a third of the way through one fic (where Lucius Malfoy took over after Voldemort's death and forced the Order into exile in France) I realised that Harry, Ron, and the other second-generation exiles would all have grown up in France, so I spent the rest of the fic reading their lines in ridiculously over-the-top French accents. It was hilarious, but if they'd been written in it would have gotten old really quickly.

** I expect it to be done for Hagrid. It doesn't feel right otherwise.

I'll forgive it for the foreign characters, though it's difficult to pull off convincingly and a little goes a long way.

For any native English speakers, please no.

If you are trying to give your characters a voice, word choice is far more important than word pronunciation.
