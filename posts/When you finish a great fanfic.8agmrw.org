But then you can't find a new one to get into and it is 1:40 a.m.

normal person: ehhh I'll wait till morning.

Me: 20 more minutes must find fanfic to read!


** I have a reading list of over 200 stories I still want to read, the next 10 stories are usually already on my ebook reader. So there is no waiting time. The exception is when the last fic pissed me off, then I re-read something I know it was good, one of my safe haven fics. However, at 1:40 a.m. it'll depend on how full my glass still is or if I'm still thirsty, whether I continue reading or not. ;)

**** Criteria? I'm constantly looking for new fics, download them and put the title on a list. The new stories can also be very old ones I found by chance, or while browsing the favourites of others, or by a recommendation.\\
I've always a list of the next 10 fics I want to read. However, the list often changes when I find new fics, lol.

** Yeah, the issue is that I'll probably look for a new story basically exactly the same as the one I just read.
