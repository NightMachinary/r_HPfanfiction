I'm writing a fanfic where Harry transfers to Beauxbaton's and would really like names for OC students. Beauxbaton students hail from all over Europe (wiki mentions: Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium as well as France) and I was wondering if anyone knows a good random name gen that would take different nationalities into account or had any suggestions?

Please and thanks


** I thing most generic â€˜enter nationality' name generators will suffice.

Marie or Maria is very common for Portugal and Spain or Luisa

** Good place to start would be [[https://nameberry.com/baby-names/162/French-Names][here]]. Most wizard/witch names are usually normal to a bit unusual, but they almost always tie in to the ethnicity/nation-state/culture which they come from.
