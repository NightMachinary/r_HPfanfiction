I know that Harry and Hermione end up in an AU but how different is it from the regular one? What are all the little and big changes about the dimension they are transported to? I would read it but I only got so far before it became too angst filled however I'm still really curious about the parallel universe the author created.


** It's VERY AU. Sirius and Snape are best friends. Lily and Remus are married. They all hate James who is portrayed as a douchebag. I don't think Harry and most of the gang even existed in that universe or died? I think I remember something about the parallel universe Hermione dying early on.

*** Only Luna is alive in the alternate dimension, and she's regarded as loony and kind of broken.

** Anyone care to give me a little more detail? I read the first few chapters so I know the basics just not all the little things.
