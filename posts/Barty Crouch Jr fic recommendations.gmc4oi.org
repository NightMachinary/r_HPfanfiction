Ever since I first read The God of Death a couple years back, Barty has been one of my favorite death eaters. Sadly, it seems I can't find a story where he's either not used, underused, or just plainly badly written. I'm writing a fic right now that has him as one of the main antagonists, and I'd like to know if you guys have any recommendations on any well written Barty fics. If you recommend any Oneshots/Short Fics I can guarantee you I've not read any, so length is not a problem. Thank you in advance!!


** It seems to be dead, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][/The Well Groomed Mind/]]. Barty plays a major role in it, but it is a vast departure from canon.

#+begin_quote
  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

** I'm writing a couple? If you like him in The Well Groomed Mind, as recommended below, (+1 on that, it's excellent) you'll probably like mine as well. Not too far into them yet, but they're getting there.

**** I have an ancient account and should probably make a new one. Was planning to put them on AO3, but I should reserve the name at least. Nothing's up yet, I wanted to get a few chapters ahead first. I'll post a link when they are. :)
