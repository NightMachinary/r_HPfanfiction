I don't know if this already exists, so I tagged this a prompt. I'm thinking Harry is spending some time in Egypt after defeating Voldemort and is somehow sent back in time. He then ends up being the catalyst that causes the slave revolt in Stargate.


** Hmm... interesting. I would add one thing more, Harry, while organizing the revolt against Ra also educates the first witches and wizards and is actually the progenitor of the Wizarding World.

**** Shame there are so few good Stargate/HP crossovers. It works well enough in principle. By which, I mean, nothing is inherently contradictory.

Wish Dr. Snake was not abandoned.
