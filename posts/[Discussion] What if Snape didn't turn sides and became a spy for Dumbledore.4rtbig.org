#+end_quote

Your premise is flawed. He changed sides because despite being estranged his childhoodwas suddenly in real and immediate danger. He changed sides before she died. Whether she died or not doesn't change things because the catalyst wasn't her death.

linkffn(C'est La Vie) This is one of my favorite fics. It has some of the best characterization in the fandom and a particularly good Snape and Lily relationship.

Edit: You could make an argument that he goes back to Voldemort in '95 when he's resurrected but I don't buy it. Snape isn't a pureblood he can't care too much about the cause. He joined the death eaters to belong, he joined for power. He found the cost way too high for him. He was lured into something when he was still a teenager. That happens in real life too.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

***** Besides, I'm sure Snape is the kind of guy who would get angry for getting shit on after walking through a flock of birds.

He's not even that smart a fellow, really. When have you seen him being smart? He's a talented Occlumens and a hell of a Potioneer, not shabby with the Dark Arts either but he has never shown (in canon) himself to be some sort of mastermind. Rather he's shown as a petty, callous and bitter character with very little to redeem himself with.

He joined the Death Eaters to belong, indeed. This much is very well established in the canon Fall out -scene. Sure that's an inconsistent thing to do if his #1 thing is to keep Lily safe. However, I don't think he considered Lily to be in active danger at the time. Us humans, we like to disregard the blatantly obvious for as long as it is possible, only waking up to danger when it is slapped in our face. That's probably why we're mostly doomed to die in horribly silly ways.

******* Snape is not explicitly mentioned as being part of the Slug Club but he is present at the Slug Christmas Party in Half-Blood Prince. Still, being part of the Slug Club would hardly net him the kind of acceptance a young, bashed-on-the-head man wants: Acceptance and admiration of his peers.

Few late teens are really all that into going into influence peddling and politics, in the end.

Oh and in Half-Blood Prince Dumbledore does quite explicitly say that Snape's turn came about after he delivered the prophecy to Voldemort, when Voldemort decided on hunting the Potters.

  Isn't having an exceptional talent an invitation in itself?
#+end_quote

No. Potential to succeed involves three things amongst others: talent, attractiveness (largely physical, but not solely), and wealth. Snape had only one of the above. And unlike exceptional beauty and exceptional wealth, exceptional talent alone doesn't open many doors, especially when you bring no connections to the table. Sorry, that's the way the world works.

  As an example, Ginny Weasley got invited to the Slug Club because she was good at casting Bat Boogey Hex alone (it also helped that she was exceptionally beautiful).
#+end_quote

Are you even reading what you're writing? It's not that she could cast the Bat-bogey hex, it's that she could cast one /of such power/, in defence of herself - talent. And like you mentioned yourself, she was quite beautiful - attractiveness. She fails when it comes to wealth, but she is still a pureblood from a family with good standing and mild to moderate influence at the Ministry - connections. That's three out of four. How is it not getting through to you that /one out of four is not good enough/?

#+begin_quote
  And I'm sorry, but you seem to live in a different world than mine.
#+end_quote

Exactly - I live in the world that actually understands what Slughorn was doing. He was not building a club of "useful" people with "useful" talents, or a club of people he could employ. He was building a club of people he could /show off/, people he could /call in political favours from/. The Slug Club is a social club; have you never encountered or at least heard of the politics that goes into that? Being academically talented /isn't good enough/.

#+begin_quote
  There's no application, yes, but there certainly are requirements - you've said so yourself.
#+end_quote

For God's sake, how do you not understand this? "Trying" will get him no fucking where! Because it's up to /Slughorn/ and no-one else to pick the members of his club! How the fuck do you even imagine this going? "Oh Professor, look at my potion, please let me join your club"? "Let me join and I will brew potions for you"? He can literally order him to do that anyway, he's his teacher! What exactly is Snape's bargaining chip here, that would require Slughorn to admit him into the circle of people he wants to spend time with? Like I said, do you have zero experience with social clubs and societies or what? Did you not at least pass through college?

#+begin_quote

********* Please note that I'm not saying "Snape wasn't a member of the Slug Club." What I'm saying is "there is no mention of Snape being part of the Slug Club." That being said:

1. He's a poor half-blood, so no familial connections to work with (see the HBP chapter when Slughorn invites people to tea with him on the train). He only invited people off the bat because of who they're related to, with the exception of Ginny because he was /really/ impressed with her hexing someone whose identity I forget.

2. From Slughorn's memory of him speaking with Tom Riddle we know that Slughorn is uncomfortable with dark magic.

3. We know from Blaise talking to Malfoy on the train that Slughorn doesn't seem interested in Death Eaters or Death Eater affiliated students.

4. From /The Prince's Tale/ in /DH/, we know that school-age!Snape thinks dark magic is funny (page 569) and wants to be a Death Eater (page 571).

From this we can conclude that Slughorn probably wasn't that interested in Snape for his club, no likely long-term benefits from having him.

#+begin_quote
  “Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the backseat --- more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized [sic] pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office.”
#+end_quote

Slughorn wanted for his club the people who he believed would go on to have some degree of power (economic, political, cultural) through their talents, connections or ambitions while avoiding those who would not. And the latter category most likely included those who would go on to be terrorists. Snape may have been good at potions, and he may have been skilled at the dark arts, but he was never going to be a person Slughorn was going to get long term use out of.

******* It's not as simple as you may think. When London was bombed on Sept 7, 1944, Wernher Von Braun was quoted to have said: " the rockets worked perfectly, except for landing on the wrong planet." This was a man whose interest in rockets was for space travel, not as weapons. His relationship with the Nazi regime is complicated, much like Severus' is with the Death Eaters.

Being intelligent does mean you don't pull stupid shit, it happens all the time. Take a look at some of the most famous serial killers, some are very highly intelligent people. Severus is highly intelligent, HBP's potions book gives us a glimpse of it. He was a teenager who was tweaking potions and creating spells, most don't do this. Severus was also at Slughorn's Christmas party, so he might have been a member, a young Severus might have thought the club would be a good networking tool, but perhaps it didn't live up to his hopes.

**** I'm not sure it's ever made clear either way. When Dumbledore guilts Snape into pledging his life to destroy Voldemort and protect Harry, we have a distinct point at which he signs on for the long haul. The fact that he's in Dumbledore's office when he learns of Lily's death does imply that he's continued to keep the headmaster informed.

I think JKR does a good job of portraying Snape as an extremely talented, even brilliant wizard whose emotional intelligence hovers right around zero. He seems clueless about the things that drive him, and he radiates anger and self-loathing through most of the series, with only very fleeting glimpses in The Prince's Tale of other qualities. He's an absolute idiot with Dumbledore on the hillside when he goes to beg for Lily's safety. He clearly hasn't planned what to say, or how to present himself to win Dumbledore's trust, or given any thought to James and Harry's lives and how it might be diplomatic to fake concern for them. He's abrasively honest and one-track-minded and distraught, and he's weirdly naive. Ditto the scene after Lily's death, when he goes to pieces in front of Dumbledore and plays right into his hands.

However intelligent Snape might be, he's portrayed as emotionally stunted, and until the very end of his life he seems to have very little insight into his own soul. People who are emotionally blind to their own motivations often end up doing contradictory and stupid things.

Basically, intelligence isn't the deciding factor in why people behave the way they do.

**** Snape was a Slytherin. He's poor hes a half blood but he's intelligent and capable. He also has a fascination with the dark arts. His house mates are all on the track to deatheater-hood, we see him and Lily argue about this. Remember this is the mid '70s and we don't know what Snape knew. The ministry was probably suppressing reports to keep morale up.

Why would he join? Because terrorist organizations are good at recruiting. They target the young, the disadvantaged, they promise rewards, a future.

Similar to Draco Malfoy, Snape gets in then finds things aren't what he thought. /No one stops being a Death Eater/ Then Lily is threatened, not abstractly, but her life is in great danger. So he goes to Dumbledore. As another person responded, we know the timeline. Snape was Dumbledore's man before that Halloween.

#+end_quote

Second important quote.

#+begin_quote
  "Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?" Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. "Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know." And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. "But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?" "Your mother died to save you."
#+end_quote

Third important quote.

#+begin_quote
  “I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”
#+end_quote

It's a very specific set of circumstances. Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily, and he decides to. But once he is there, Lily refuses to live at the cost of her son's life. Voldemort kills her. Oh shit, Lily's love protection.

Voldemort gives Harry the option to flee, to hide, which is de facto a chance to live, but at the cost of the lives of all Harry's friends and allies. Harry refuses to live at the cost of their lives. Voldemort kills him. Oh shit, Harry's love protection.

All that gives us is that JKR used both Harry and AD as mouthpieces for her exposition. It doesn't explain why is there such a big difference, how aren't the two situations different (TMR's ultimatum to Harry said nothing about sparing him if he stayed out), and why weren't more people randomly triggering the love-bullshit defence during the first war.

Some fanfics explain this as Lily possessing enough esoteric knowledge to arrange the defence mechanism with\ after her death or AD orchestrating the situation. The problem with the 1st option is that HP didn't know any such magical theory,^{1} and a relative problem with the 2nd one is that no such thing was highlighted in the books themselves.

Part of that is probably my +shitty+ /stellar/ communication skills. The ultimatum wasn't "come and die, or we kill all your friends and you live." It was "come and die and your friends live. Don't, and they die, and I will hunt you down until I kill you." That leaves the "Harry runs for his goddamn life and gets away" option available. Certain death verse not certain death at the cost of his friend's life. It is the refusal to have the chance to live at the cost of the lives of others and therefore choosing to die out of love.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Probably because this is deep, weird magic. It isn't a "I'll go sacrifice myself to enact a ritual" type bullshit you see in those shitty fanfics. This is of a much more ancient, less rigid, free of incantation and wand movement, subtle magic. This isn't something you can plan. It has to be true. It didn't happen more often during the war because outside of the two times it happened, nothing about the situations, actions and motivations of the people were right.

#+begin_quote
  also, getting back to your last quote, how the hell did he know that that's what made the difference?
#+end_quote

Because, all of the things Dumbledore taught him, that allowed Harry to overcome Voldemort and live, were about the power of the choices one makes the actions that enact them. For example

#+begin_quote
  "Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know." "I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. "Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"

  It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise, they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life.

  “So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore's face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin's power in me, and it ---” “Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue --- resourcefulness --- determination --- a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” “It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .” “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”

  help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it

  “Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic....” “I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I'd already done it.... Does that make sense?” “I don't know --- Harry, look at Snape!”

  Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them ... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter.

  “So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius. “They will not work properly against each other,” said Dumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed --- in reverse. The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it....”

  "But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magi of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated --- to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative." "She doesn't love me," said Harry at once. "She doesn't give a damn --- " "But she took you," Dumbledore cut across him. "She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet she still took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you.

  "By an act of evil --- the supreme act of evil. By commiting [sic] murder. Killing rips the soul apart.

  "You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!" said Dumbledore loudly. "The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole."

  “Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you.” He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculabe [sic] power of certain acts.

  “No, it doesn't!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, “You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”

  “But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means ---”

  “If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”

  ...

  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---”

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

  Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat.

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”

  “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that ---”

  “That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry.

  “Yes.”

You know what would have happened if Voldemort chose the Longbottoms, and somehow Neville got all Boy-Who-Lived on us? He would have gone to his grandmother, same as in canon.

The only reason Quirrell grabbed Harry, and therefore got burned to death, was because Harry had the Stone, and they couldn't risk accidentally destroying it in subduing him (which means no Stunning Spell, no Incarcerous, no Body Bind, nothing that would make him fall over). But if it was Neville, and he didn't get the Stone out of the Mirror? Dead Neville. And there would have been no Blood of the Enemy tying him to life. There would have been no Voldemort's soul dying only because

only Voldemort killing Harry/Neville-in-this-nonsense-hypothetical would have the possibility of killing only the horcrux.

Voldemort most likely figures a way to get the Stone out of the Mirror. Voldemort gets his body back. Malfoy never slips Ginny Weasley the Diary. Dumbledore never learns about the horcruxes. Voldemort infiltrates the Ministry of Magic with his pimps, and the Ministry therefore can't do shit. Order of the Phoenix gets fucked five ways to Sunday. Voldemort wins.

Let's say that Voldemort can't get the Stone out of the Mirror. Lucius Malfoy slips Ginny Weasley the Diary. Ginny gets taken over/possessed by the horcrux. Since Neville is dead, Diary!Voldemort doesn't obsess over the Boy-Who-Lived, and Ginny probably doesn't start distrusting Tom until it is too late. Dumbledore gets removed from Hogwarts by Lucius Malfoy. No Parseltongue speaking Boy-Who-Lived to kill the Basilisk, destroy the Diary and save Ginny. Horcrux successfully drains the life out of Ginny, leaving a Voldemort soul enbodied and either

A. Becomes the primary soul of Voldemort, and restarts his reign of evil from the beginning, and most likely wins

or

B. Hunts down the major part of Voldemort which had possessed Quirrell, and gets that part of Voldemort a body back. Voldemort calls in his Death Eaters, and brings them back to his service. Voldemort infiltrates the Ministry of Magic with his pimps, and the Ministry therefore can't do shit. Order of the Phoenix gets fucked five ways to Sunday. Voldemort wins.

Prophesy is a verb, meaning "to predict some future occurrence, or to make a prophecy." A /prophecy/ is a prediction of the future.

***** It's a good refutation of the force of the prophecy view of the prophecy, but I think you're overstating the case with Neville, always choosing the worst case scenario.

Neville, supposing that he survives (since Voldemort does follow the prophecy, and therefore gives it power over him so he should, /somehow/), would be Boy-Who-Lived. No one, not even his uncle, would question his worth as a wizard, and, if anything, I'd be worried about him getting a big head. (Remember, Neville got a new wand /after/ he gained confidence and became a proficient wizard: his progress in OotP was entirely with his old wand.)

Assuming Quirrelmort's plan goes loosely as it does in canon, if Neville doesn't go after the Philosopher's stone, a more likely outcome would be Quirrelmort being unable to get the stone out of the mirror, likely ensnared by it, and stuck there until Dumbledore returns. Remember that Dumbledore showed up minutes behind Harry.

I am not saying that this is the only way it could go, nor even the most likely one, but probably about as or more likely than the scenario you predicted.

They might think, after seeing no signs of accidental magic, or very little accidental magic, that defeating Voldemort came at the cost of his magic. Perfectly logical since no one else had /ever/ survived a Killing Curse.

And yes, I did go with the more negative interpretation, /because that interpretation is the most likely/. Thinking on it more, it would probably take too much time to figure a way to get the Stone out of the Mirror. But it's no guarantee that Dumbledore would have been able to stop him. Likely? Yes. But Quirrell was in no way ensnared by it, and with Voldemort sticking out the back of his head it wasn't going to happen.

It's an interesting hypothesis, but I don't see why it's a likely one. For that matter, it might be moot: if lack of self-confidence was crippling Neville's magic (as OotP suggests), he might show accidental magic sooner if he is raised as the Boy-Who-Lived.

Even if not, this leads to interesting character development, not just a blanket canon rehash. Imagine: Neville is the beloved Boy-Who-Lived --- only kept from being spoiled rotten by the dignified hand of his grandmother --- but something is changing: nobody tells him anything, but he can sense the looks of pity and the sudden, excessive, gratitude of the adults around him. Sooner or later, the mystery is solved when he overhears a worried conversation between his grandmother and uncle, or perhaps Skeeter does, and he reads about it the Daily Prophet.

How does he feel about that? How does he react? Does he /volunteer/ to be put into danger to try to elicit his magic, becoming a life-long adrenaline junkie because he proves to himself that he is a wizard? Or something else? Is he put through some program for getting Squibs ready for the Muggle world? Does he meet other Squibs his age? And then, when his Hogwarts letter does arrive, how does he react? Does he commit himself to the cause of improving the Squibs' lot, and find himself in Gryffindor? Does a drive to prove himself send him to Slytherin?

The point is that either way, the Neville who shows up at Hogwarts will not be the canon Neville.

It's not an interpretation. It's a counterfactual and an extrapolation over a decade. Unless you have a line to JKR, you don't know what would be more likely any better than I do. However, I think I've made a pretty good case for why Neville would be rather different, so that part of your scenario seems pretty implausible.

Regarding Mirror of Erised, only a few minutes elapsed between Harry's arrival and Dumbledore's. Unless Quirrelmort was just about to give up and leave (which seems unlikely, since he hadn't even tried using magic to examine the mirror by the time Harry arrived), yes, Dumbledore would have caught him, and, grafted onto Quirrel's dying body, Voldemort would not have stood a chance. The only question is whether Voldewraith would have been able to escape unscathed --- and Dumbledore is nothing if not resourceful.

Oh my god, I am so tired of people treating prophecies as prescriptive rather than the descriptive sayings they are. You get this same shit in the LOTR fandom with people thinking that Eowyn was magically imbued with magical power to kill the Witch-King because she was a woman, or that the Witch-King was magically protected from the blades of men or some shit. No, you potato, she killed him because she killed him, and Glorfindel prophecied that he wouldn't fall by the hand of a man because he literally looked and saw a woman doing it (and decided to be cryptic about it because hey, he's an elf, it's what they do).

I mean, there certainly are questions of how much is inevitable in the HP universe, especially with how Time-Turners canonically work, but I'm very sure prophecies aren't magic. The art of seeing/making them is, but not the saying itself.

***** I completely disagree. Dumbledore says the prophesy doesn't matter because Harry would fight Voldemort anyway. I say the prophesy happened because Harry was going to fight Voldemort anyway. Divination is real in HP. Even Trelawney is right about most of her predictions. This can mean a few different things as I see it.

Seers and look into the future and know what happened. This seems very probable. Supporting evidence is the time travel in canon. Harry went back in time and in doing so saved himself, which means he always traveled back in time. This implies time is concurrent. Everything happens simultaneously.

Prophesy is a likely or inevitable outcome, and prophesy can change the world to come true. This is my favorite interpretation of prophesy, and not just in HP. This is supported by the amount of luck and ridiculousness that follows Harry. Prophesy changing a million tiny things along to way to see the outcome it desires.
