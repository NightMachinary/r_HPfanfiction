As the title says! But I prefer long fics (+ 100k)

/(If you can help me, I really appreciate it in advance.)/

(Please, no Harry/Ginny)


** What were fighting for actually hits this description fairly well. Pairing is harry/hermione

**** Haha it's a good fanfic. I wish it was longer, but I guess I can't complain with it being in the 200k+ range

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
