  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

** Ooh, I would read something like this. What a twist to the usual humdrum time turner fics. Reminds me of Dark, the new German series on Netflix, cool concept indeed.
