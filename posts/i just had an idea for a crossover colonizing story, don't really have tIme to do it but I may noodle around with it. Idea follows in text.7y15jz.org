A colony sized group of mages from HP end up in another dimension, like Westeros or Middle Earth or the Witcher!verse. These mages try to live by the statute, avoiding the others as they carefully explore. It would be akin to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, an alphabetical listing of the denizens of another dimension with sidebars of the mages' anecdotal observations of the people and animals.

Anyway, it's a writing prompt for those interested or a request for crossover suggestions for anyone else.


** You should check out esama - Island of Fire. Crossover with Temeraire. Harry and the others establish a colony that comes to be known as Atlantis.

** I think Westeros would be pretty great, since there is magic in the world, but it is subtle enough for the HP mages to think they're alone.

Not sure if i'd write it in a Fantastic Beasts kinda way, but it does sound fun.

*** It could be like my stranger in a strange land story, part diary entry, part narrative. Sadly, I don't know asoiaf but it seems like fhe only amazng creatures are white walkers, dire wolves, and dragons. Middle earth is rather close to hpverse too. The lands in a sword of truth have very different mythic beasties.

*** It... would be interesting if Joffery or one of his siblings had magic. And an owl comes to give an invite. I can't imagine the wizards living with the barbaric muggles, and continue to hide their nation.

** Ohohohohohohohohohohooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!

My friend - this type of story is my shit, and do I have one hell of a suggestion for you!!!!!!!! <3 <3 Sorry, this is just the first request for a /type/ of story (instead of a "I forgot this story title") that I can really nail.

The Difference On Man Can Make ( linkffn(11132113) ) is a story where, not to spoil /too/ much, Harry is thrown into the GoT universe. Instead of a normal crossover, however, where he is reincarnated as some lord, he's instead transported /directly/ as he is north of The Wall. Instead of going down to do some "southern" politics, he stays north of The Wall and builds an /entire fucking settlement/ for Free Folk.

It's abandoned. The writing isn't /really/ anything to write home about. But it's fucking beautiful settlement building and the concept is enough to make a re-read worth it, which is what I'm about to do now that you've reminded me of it. :)
