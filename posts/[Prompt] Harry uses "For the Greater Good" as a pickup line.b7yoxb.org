Bonus points if Dumbledore finds out.


** "Hermione, Ginny, Luna, we need to have sex. Dumbledore told me that love is the only way I can defeat Voldemort" Harry waited for the flinch at Voldemort's name to pass.

"It's for the Greater Good" He tells them, as they move to disagree. "Oh, that makes sense" Harry blinked at how fast all 3 girls agreed. He came up with this plan last night whilst drinking with the Twins.

As the girls head to Gryffindor Tower to prepare, "Harry M'boy, you finally learned what I wanted to teach you" Harry knew that voice. "Professor Dumbledore, sir" Harry stutters, shocked by his mentor's sudden appearance.

"I used that line so many times before defeating Gellert. I could regale you with my stories, but you have to go prepare for "Defeating the Dark Lord" right?" Dumbledore and Harry grin, before Harry heads to the Tower, ready to claim his reward. He feels like he earned this.

*** I like the response, but I was actually looking for where Harry just does it to troll Dumbledore. Taking some of his nuggets of wisdom and using it to help his game.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..
