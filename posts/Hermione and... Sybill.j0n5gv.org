** While not really a ship I'd personally care for, I'm of the mind that with enough work, there's few things that are truly unworkable. You simply have to twist the universe and experiences enough for it. There's plenty of fics with ships I initially don't believe in, but whose content managed to convince me that it could definitely work. Just the other day I read a Hermione/James fic, a ship I had no expectations for, but which made it work well in the end. I've also had the same experience with a Tom/Luna (the fic didn't actually ship them, but it did manage to make me want it in said fic).

*** I think basically anything can happen in the Potterverse. There is so much room to mold the story in a way that makes even the impossible believable.

Tom and Luna is certainly interesting.

** I mean, I firmly believe there are no bad ideas, but that might be a bit of a... longer journey than most to make it a good story. In terms of popularity... well, plenty of weird stories are popular and plenty of popular stories are in need of more work. So, y'know. It's possible. I think it could definitely be a good story though, if you took the time to set it up right.

Generally, you ask yourself the whys and hows beforehand and be sure to set up as much of that supporting internal logic as you can in the openers before you get into the weird. To take the pairing specifically:

- How would they get together?

- Why would they get together?

- What point would the characters need to be at to get together?

- How would the characters have to grow to get there?

- How could you make the audience buy into that journey?

- How could you make the audience 'ship' them?

Basically, start with the assumption that the pairing would work (both character-wise and narratively) and work backwards from there in planning, then write forwards to take the readers on a journey to the point where they agree with the first assumption. Maybe you'll like the story you write, maybe you won't, but you definitely won't be able to write something in a believable way if you come from a point of not believing in it either.

*** So this is coming from a place where he just wants me to write, I think, and it has sort of swelled into something he thinks I can achieve. He does accuse me of having no faith, so he'll agree with you there. While I don't necessarily agree or disagree with the ship itself, I suppose I could manage it well enough. I'm more shocked that anyone agreed with it, because my answer was a pretty instantaneous “no.”

**** I mean, there's a sizeable portion of the fandom that pairs Harry with people decades older than him who believe his mother is basically an animal or even murdered his mother themselves. If people ship what's basically Adolf Hitler/Joseph Goebbels and Randolph Churchill (Winston Churchill's kid), then they'll ship anything.

And eh, I'm just a random voice on the internet that doesn't know you at all, so I can't comment anything whatsoever on you personally. It was simply a remark that you need to come at a story from a place of believing in it, because it'll be harder to make it believable to others if you don't.

But yeah, like I said - I firmly believe there are no bad ideas, just stories that could use more work. :)

Of course, if you actually don't wanna write the story, this absolutely is not an insistence you should. Again, I'm just a random voice on the internet so you probably shouldn't listen if it was one, but it definitely isn't. You do whatever you feel is the right thing to do, I can't advise you on that. All I'm saying is that if you put the work in, you can find a way to make anything work in an interesting and believable way.

***** People will ABSOLUTELY ship anything, which were his exact words when he referenced “Drapple.” I will consider this, and I told him that if enough positive feedback comes in through FB and Reddit that I will, if only just for him, write his Hermione/Trelawney fic lmao.

Well, if you do decide that you definitely don't wanna do it, let us know and we'll manufacture some "You want to do /what/? Are you insane? It'll never work!" comments for you. :D

****** I've seen some truly strange and horrid ships.

Besides the obvious ones (Drapple, Draco/Ebony, Hogwarts/Giant Squid) there is Hermione/Sorting Hat, Hermione/OC Ghost, Hermione/Gwarp, Ron/Gwarp, Fem!Harry/Aragog, Luna/Threstal, Whomping Willow/Daphne/Luna/Hermione/Ginny + a few other girls, Harry/Norberta, Fem!Harry/Troll, Hermione/Troll, Fleur/Snakes (literal Snakes), Vernon and Dudley with Fleur and Cho, Harry/Hogwarts, Harry/Gringotts, Dumbledore/Voldemort, Dumbledore/Griphook etc.

In other fandoms there is Goku/Anne Frank (yes, the Holocaust victim) and Jason Grace/Brick among others

** I'd read it.

Love/hate relationship, time travel fic where Hermione goes back in time to stop Snape from hearing about the prophecy. It's done easily enough but in doing so she becomes the potions professor instead. Cue teacher hijinks and Hermione being eternally exasperated by divination and its professor. It feels a lot like shipping Hermione and Luna.

** Well, look at Sybil as she is at the time Harry Potter goes to school. A desperate lonely alcoholic, shut into her tower. Does she have a social life? Does Dumbledore let her out or is he that scared some death eater gets hold of her and her prophecies he keeps isolating her from the world outside Hogwarts?
