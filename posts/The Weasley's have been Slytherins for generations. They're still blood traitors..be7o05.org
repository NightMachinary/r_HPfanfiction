** I always wondered what "blood traitor" truly meant. I mean, in HP the bad guys use it against the good guys because "they don't agree with us". But is there clear definition of what a blood traitor is (no matter how biaised this definition is) or does a blood traitor do exactly what the name entails : betraying his blood.\\
For example : Harry Potter. His parents were considered blood traitor by terrorists. They refused to judge people by their blood and died for this. In the case of a Slytherin Harry that start to discriminate Muggleborn, does he stop being a blood traitor, or does he start being one by betraying his parents, his blood ideals?

*** I'm pretty sure the former, it's supposed to be purebloods who are pro-muggle and muggleborn.

*** My head canon interprets the term "blood traitor" as someone who places their personal interests above their family's welfare. Arthur Weasley can be considered one since his fascination with muggles kept him from working in a more prominent department in the ministry. He's head of a department but there's only one other person (Perkins) in it with him. He's obviously capable enough to work in more advanced positions due to his skill in magic, and connections that he gained through his tenure as head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts.

This was how Percy interpreted it and was one of the reasons for his fight with his father. Now, we can't say that he's right about this. But, he works in the ministry so he has an idea on how much other ministry employees are paid for their work.

I'm not saying Arthur's fascination with muggles was bad. But, his attachment to it and his job prevented his children from getting the most of their education and their stay in Hogwarts. Second hand wands, second hand books, second hand robes, etc. In the eyes of other purebloods who place family and blood above all, this lack of drive to do right for his family can be seen as being traitorous to his children (his blood).

** I can't think of any fics like that, but in linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19), the Weasleys are in the "Serpent" caste---the highest one in a society built by triumphant Salazar Slytherin---but they are still pro-Muggleborn.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
