Hi,

After the amazing success I had the last time, I'm once again looking for HP stories I've read some time ago and would quite like to re-read. I'm basically looking for two different stories:

A) Harry and Ginny learn about obscure magic from Lily and James Potter -- the cottage at Godric's Hollow looks destroyed to everyone else but Harry and Ginny. Possibly a soul bond / marriage story.

B) Dumbledore asks Harry and Ginny to keep the Potter line alive -- so Ginny gets to be pregnant at Hogwarts. Two things I can remember: Magical Robes that hide baby bumps, Harry forgets Valentine's Day and floods Ginny with Roses ... 

Thanks in advance and Dankesch√∂n,

FlawedSyntax


** Not sure B is what you think it is... but I think its Alpha and Omega by Imogen linkffn(363036) Its fits the two extra things but I do not remember Dumbledore asking Harry and Ginny to keep it alive. It has more to do with how Voldemort is to be defeated. I might be remembering it wrong though or I could have the wrong fic.

  Voldemort's grip on the wizarding world is tightening, and Dumbledore has a shocking suggestion for Harry. The seventh year sequel to 'Carpe Diem'.
