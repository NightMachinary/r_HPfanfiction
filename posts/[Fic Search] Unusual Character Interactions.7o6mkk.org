I'm looking for some fics that have unusual characters interactions. Truthfully, I'm not really interested in specifically romances (although it could happen in the background), just simple character interactions with the unlikeliest people. And I'm not talking about stories involving Draco and Hermione (which I don't exactly hate the ship, but there's a point where I'm just annoyed that I have to dig through those fics in order to find something new to read). I'm talking about character interactions that we don't usually read in fanfics.

Here are some examples of what I meant:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10605742/1/He-s-Still-Your-Brother][He's Still Your Brother]] by SadieAnnabethMellark shows really good parallels involving a conversation between Sirius and Bill. linkffn(10605742) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3624012/1/And-Things-that-Go-Bump-in-the-Night][And Things that Go Bump in the Night]] by The Treacle Tart is an extremely humorous story of Draco's interactions with Luna Lovegood. linkffn(3624012) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]] by The madness in me with a particularly unique conversation between Luna and Tom Riddle's Diary. linkffn(12407442) Status: Ongoing

Edit: * [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11857153/1/Unspeakables][Unspeakables]] by Ebenbild is definitely another fic that is highly amusing and surprisingly well written. Basically, Harry and Percy time travel. linkffn(11857153) Status: Ongoing


** Does Hermione befriending a Boggart, the Sorting Hat and the Basilisk count?

**** It's my own story. I darehope it's not bad, but I'm unsure whether it fully fits what the original post is looking for because it's mostly a humorous story in the vein of /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ --- the character interactions are meant to be fun, but, for the most part, not /deep/. Still, this humble author prays you give it a try: linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor)

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

*** Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary really is a wonderful read. And no problem, I sometimes like to read stories about Luna interacting with a variety of characters.

  Bill hated his brother. After all they had been through and with everything going on, he just walked out on the family. A late night talk with Sirius changes that.

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly looses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane.
