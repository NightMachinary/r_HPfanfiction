What he eventually finds is a small cube glowing with an inner blue light, a cube that Harry feels he /must/ take with him.

There is something very unusual about it, something almost /otherworldly/.

Unwittingly, Harry finds a Jedi Holocron.

It could go in different directions from here, either its Revan's personal Holocron, or maybe the date is later in time.

Maybe this Holocron would display Obi-Wan's mesage about the Jedi Purge and the Fall of the Republic, making Harry curious.


** Glowing blue cube and my head went "is that the tessarect?" From mcu

** Or, a Sith holocron. Welp, there goes the neighborhood.

Or, a certain Puzzle Box that he feels compelled to protect and pass on to "interested parties" (becoming the replacement for the Guardian Demon).

An artifact that has the voice of a long-vanished deity whispering into the back of his mind...

The horcrux or soul-jar of a long-dead witch that, while it cannot possess him due to his mother's protection and the Scarcrux, possesses one of his female friends (Hermione, Ginny, or some random girl that finds it/steals it), and thus the spirit must masquerade as her victim, stealing her life? Bonus points if the victim is trapped inside her own mind in a "I have no mouth and I cannot scream"/Goa'uld sort-of way.

...Actually, there being two stasis jars with two symbiotes in could go pretty dark, pretty fast: Harry is taken as a host, and the goa'uld using his body tries to find a "suitable host" for his queen trapped in the other jar -- could be anyone from one of his friends to one of the more attractive girls in Hogwarts. BY the end of the fic, the newly-freed hosts as traumatized beyond belief, but stick together out of necessity because they're now co-dependent on each other as emotional support.

Something eldritch that begins to change Harry into something straight out of a Lovecraftian novel?

Heck, a Corpse Bride (the movie, not the grim, origin story of said movie) situation could be pretty funny, too.

A monkey's paw with three, outstretched fingers?

This prompt has so many possibilities, it's hilarious. :)

  Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again.
