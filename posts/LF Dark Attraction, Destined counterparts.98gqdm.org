Although i accept Canon compliant stuff, i guess, there is only AU....if anything. So Harry represents the Light/good side, but there is a destined (or choosen through a Prophecy) female Counterpart that is the dark/evil side. Its said that when both come together and "reunite", their magical power rises to a very High Level. Both of them feel the attraction to unite with each other, but while the female one is just after the power, Harry might want to convince her to leave the Darkness so they can be together.

Maybe this is the Premise for a serious Fiction, but i would like it to have crackling erotic, potentially lemon. It doesnt have to be PWP and can indeed be part of a serious fic.


** hmmm that could be interesting if executed well.

** That sounds pretty interesting, don't think I've heard of a fic like that though. I know it may be heresy to ask this here but does someone know of any books that might have something close to this? As in two people from different sides fall for each other.
