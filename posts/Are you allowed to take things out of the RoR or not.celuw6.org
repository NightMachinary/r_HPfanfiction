Lots of writers say you can't but I'm pretty sure Dobby said Filch found the room when he needed extra cleaning supplies. Obviously, he wouldn't have needed it to clean the RoR itself, so he had to have taken it out of the room. But also, didn't Ginny try to take something out too and couldn't? So what gives?


** You could say that the Room can procure real items that Hogwarts has stocked elsewhere (like cleaning supplies, snacks, etc.), but that more obscure objects are conjured by the room and can't leave it.

*** I've always assumed that the room of hidden things is the RoR's "base" form and that the room doesn't conjure anything - the objects it "creates" are just the objects in the room of hidden things. The room's apparent ability to create anything is simply the result of 1000 years of lost property.

** I don't remember the scene of Ginny failling to talke an item out, but I would suppose their is a difference between the item conjured by the room, and the ones merely brought inside. So the items created by the room (like most of the items present when Harry summon a room to learn to defend himself) are stuck there, but I see ne reason why you could not take out everything inside the Room of Lost Item, including the HBP's book and Ravenclaw's diadem.

*** To be completely honest, I'm not sure anymore if Ginny ever tried to take anything in canon or if it's a fanfiction thing.

It would make sense to be able to take things from the Room that were put there by people, such as the diadem, but if Filch asked for, like, detergent, why would there be any in the room of hidden things? If that room is for things that are lost, left behind or simply hidden? It had to have come from a different room in the RoR.

*** Wasn't it destroyed inside the room by fiendfyre? Even if it was brought out, the diadem was brought in as well, it wasn't created in the room like Filch's cleaning supplies apparently were, so it's not the same.

**** It was destroyed by fiendfyre in the room in the movies. In the books, Harry found it and brought it outside, where he ran into Ron who had gotten some basilisk teeth from the chamber of secrets
