** I actually have been lucky enough to be treated very well by the community over that past year, but when I first tried fanfic at the tender age of thirteen (under a different penname that spelt fleurs name wrong), someone went through all 30 something chapters of my fic and left a review on each one. They didn't offer any help. They didn't point out any mistakes or poor writing. They just told me I was worthless and should give up writing, that this was the worst trash they'd ever seen etc. Made my little thirteen year old heart break. I still don't understand why they continued beyond the first few chapters if it was that bad.

****** Yeah, it did take the wind out of my sails a bit. The weird thing is, they got banned by the mods (it was on Mugglenet), and then like a week later they created a new account to send me a message apologising and saying they didn't realise how young I was. I accepted the apology at the time, but looking back I wish I hadn't because that's a horrible thing to do to anyone, no matter their age.

** Honestly, anonymous reviews tended to be fairly positive. I did have one reviewer who started off very complimentary, but he/she quickly soured on my story once it wasn't going in the direction of their preconceived notions. I looked at their profile, though, and saw a big wall of text about their Twilight pairing preferences. Felt loads better after that.

*** UGH I had this last week! Someone went through and left a bunch of guest reviews on Not From Others saying I had my timelines wrong, mixing up movie and book canon (like saying Tonks and Remus died together holding hands) and, bizarrely, saying they were disappointed that they never found out who the betrayer was despite the confession being a major aspect of one of the later chapters. I can't message them to politely correct them, and as it's a completed fic I can't add an authors note either!

** One of the blessings of being "under-reviewed", as many reviewers tell me I am, is that when I do receive a negative review, it's usually constructive criticism. Due to that, I don't think I've ever received a properly /hurtful/ review per se, but I have received reviews that infuriate me.

The most annoying review I've ever received, one that still rankles today, was a review left on my highest reviewed fic. The basic premise was that it was a buddy-cop comedy about Harry and Ron being wands for hire. About halfway through it, I suddenly remembered Hermione exists, and decided to widen the scope to a trio fic. So I started re-integrating her into the fic around chapter 10, and then there was an arc that was heavy on Hermione and light on Ron from Chapter 14-16.

I receive a review stating that the fic has too much Hermione and not enough Ron, completely ignoring the fact that Ron has been present in every chapter, and that Hermione hadn't even made an appearance in chapters 6-10.

But the part that still makes me froth in rage to this day, is the phrase he used to describe the fic: "it's like if the guy who wrote The Notebook tried to write Band of Brothers". Which is twofold spastic, because the fic is a /dark comedy/ about a mercenary turned government spy; how is that at all similar to a /war story/ about a Unit in the European Campaign of WW2? And if there's ever been a Nicholas Sparks protagonist who is as foul-mouthed and genuinely unpleasant as Harry in that fic, sign me up for a read, it sounds hilarious.

I know I shouldn't obsess so much over one review, especially one that wasn't even that hurtful, but seriously fuck that guy.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** I don't think I've ever had a really bad review, at least not that I can remember. My knee jerk reaction to any criticism tends to be "fuck you!" but that only lasts until I beat my pride into submission and consider their words more objectively, and most of them are constructive in some way at least, even if I don't necessarily agree with them.

The only one that I can recall as being particularly useless was a review I got that just said "Very, very poor choice of plot" which left me baffled more than anything. It was put on the first chapter of of 320k fic, and that chapter is 10k long and introduces a couple of plot points, and the summary alone has at least four things that the reviewer could object to so I really have no idea what they disliked so much.

*** Oh god, those people infuriate me so much. I have a fic labelled angst/tragedy, and from chapter 8 (out of 33) it was stated that one of the characters would die. Not foreshadowed or hinted, straight up and outright /stated/, and the last few chapters are pretty much his farewell to the world tour... and yet at least one reviewer still seemed annoyed that I didn't save him at the last minute, or write about him returning from death. Feeling sad about it, I understand, that's fair enough, but in those circumstances I don't get how anyone could honestly expect a happy ending.

Seriously, if you don't like unhappiness and terrible things, don't read angst fics!

** I've been really lucky in that most of my reviewers are wonderful. I always ask for constructive criticism and they can be so sweet and polite.

But....I once became the target of a troll in a fandom other than Harry Potter. I was writing a MimixYamato Digimon fic and this guy made it a point to insult, harass, and demean me on every chapter simply because I shipped MimixYamato and not their preferred MimixIzzy. They not only did this to me, but every other author who shipped that pairing. It was a joke really. And reporting them achieved nothing. So I learned to ignore them. It was simpler that way.

As they say, don't feed the trolls.

I try no to let bad reviews bother me. I know that I can't please everyone and that what I write isn't perfect. Even GRRM and JKR have their critics. So I just let it slide. Unless they harass my reviewers. Then it's on.

** Well, I've been incredibly fortunate in the feedback I've received. A lot of eloquent, generous readers have felt comfortable giving their in-depth opinions, mostly because it used to be common, once upon a time, to use comment sections as a springboard to wider character analysis or debates about plot. Also, I'm not a big name and don't attract a ton of readers, so (except for one instance, see below) I've avoided being a target. Probably the worst comment ever addressed directly to me said something along the lines of "what a waste of talent for such a nasty tale," which is almost a compliment. (The fic in question contained major character death, so I'm not surprised some readers were repelled by it.)

The most startling attention ever paid me occurred the day a familiar username went ballistic over our different interpretations of Snape's character and started spamming my journal with obscene, screeching, capslock abuse, including a threat to rip my nipples off. It was incredibly hyperbolic and a bit mentally unbalanced considering how trivial the disagreement was. After creating and deleting multiple pseuds for the sole purpose of berating me and the mod of a fic exchange, they closed their account. It's possible they're still out there under a different pseud, but after that meltdown they've had the decency to leave me alone.

He just feels like some shitty sidekick. Pretty much prefer canonHarry to this faggot. I am scared too see thedueling competition, since reading this I think Harry won't be the great dueler he was in canon, shitty spell repertoire or not, he was among the best, if not the best in his fucking school.

None are particularly 'hurtful'. I don't think I've gotten a review telling me to off myself or anything. But there are some that are 'hurtful' in a different way. Like 'Lego-land' asking if a story clearly makred Harry/Fleur would have a Harry/Ginny action. Do people really expect me to to out of my way to tell them information they have readily accessible in the story tag?

The most hurtful thing, to me, is when someone leaves a review, and I can tell they didn't actually read the text. And it happens way more often than you would expect.

** I reviewed a fanfic once about a scene that didn't seem plausible. Basically, the author was using the story to find closure about their experience with rape. Oh. Shit. Maybe MENTION that in the disclaimer so I'm not your worst reviewer ever. Never commenting on that again. I'm dumb. :-/

** I've never had like, a super hurtful review but I posted a chapter one time and I was pretty bummed at the hate for it. It wasn't the quality of the writing as much as people really didn't like that Harry and Ron got into a fight, and Harry won. I'd been particularly proud of that chapter, but hey, at least they cared enough to get mad and converse with me about it!
