I actually have one fic in mind that I can't find, but would also be up to reading anything with this general idea. I prefer over 30k words (shorted than that and I finish them way too quick) and either complete or recently updated (I hate abandoned fics... They make me sad). The one that I'm thinking of has Tom from an AU where he didn't go super bad because Dumbledore intervened. He somehow ends up in the regular HP universe where he see what he would have become, and decides to help Dumbledore kill his other self. He become the DADA prof, and one of my favourite scenes is when he decides to teach all the students Occlumency and uses the sorting hat as a test tool. Unfortunately, this fic was abandoned I believe, but still worth a second read. So if anyone knows what fic this is, or has suggestions for other goodish Tom fic, I'd be very appreciative. :-)


** I think this is the fic you're referring to: linkffn(2595818). Read it a long time ago, I thought it was really good, but it was last updated in 2013 so yeah probably abandoned, sigh...

Edit -- Also, even though you asked for 30k+ words, I've always liked this AU one-shot of a Hufflepuff Tom Riddle so I thought I'd share even though it's short: linkffn(5846518)

  Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that.

He's less good in this one, and more struggling to not become evil, but either way, he isn't outright evil.

  What if Tom met his match in his fifth year at Hogwarts? What if someone upset the power balance before he became The Dark Lord... And changed the trajectory of history? That person is Amalia Gray. (NOT a time-travel fic!) [Awesome]Fem OC x [Evil]Tom Riddle

  Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...
