:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In this one Harry is blind and not accepted into Hogwarts. Hermione dropped out First year cause of the troll incident, she is left traumatized and I think with a stutter. They meet, and eventually Harry goes to Hogwarts during 4th year cuz of Goblet of Fire.

If more details are needed, just ask and I'll try to remember

Found it thanks!
