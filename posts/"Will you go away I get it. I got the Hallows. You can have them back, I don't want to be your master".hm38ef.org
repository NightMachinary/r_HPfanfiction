***** That's.. actually a good theory. I even read one fic in which God and Death keep electing successors and then pass on when their Universe destructs. Like Chuck Shirley from Supernatural becomes the new God and Harry becomes the new Death.

** Post-war, Harry wants to live a quiet life but Death won't leave him alone. Before he knows it, she's crashing at his place, eating his food, lazing around, and being a total slob.

Edit:

--------------

The blaring of the TV and muffled giggles greeted Harry the moment he stepped through the Floo. Almost dreading what he would see, he made his way to the living room. On the couch before the telly sat the Ruler of the Underworld, the Weigher of the Souls, and the bane of his existence, her bare legs crossed and a tub of ice cream perched in her lap.

"Hi, master," Death chirped, waving a spoon. "How was work? Did you send any sinners to the Underworld?"

He winced as melted ice cream splattered off the spoon and joined the crumbs of potato crisps on the couch cushions. "No sinners. Just another boring day filing paperwork."

"Tell me about it. If I had to judge another soul, I'd go mad. It's just as well you summoned me to this plane." Scooping up a spoonful of ice cream, she stuffed it into her mouth and stared at the telly.

He sighed. "We've been over this. I didn't summon you, you came... Death?"

Death's eyes remained glued to the screen until she slapped her knee and erupted into laughter. Wiping her eyes, she glanced his way. "Sorry, you were saying?"

He took a deep breath. /Patience/. Despite her appearance, she was one of the cosmic powers. "I was thinking... Isn't it time you returned to your duties?"

"No worries." She stuck a hand under her oversized shirt, scratched her belly, and burped. "I foisted off everything on my subordinates. Try it sometime."

Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. That wasn't her shirt she wore but /his/, now stained down the front. Narrowing his eyes, he strode up before her. "That's my favorite shirt."

She leaned to see around him and gave a frustrated noise when he side-stepped to block the telly. "Don't be stingy. Do you realize how uncomfortable walking around in my gown is? If I don't use my powers to float, it drags on the floor and snags everywhere!"

"Did no one teach you not to take other people's stuff?" he asked, crossing his arms.

She snorted. "Rich, coming from a descendant of the Peverells."

He gaped at her, then shook his head and marched toward the door. "You're right. Let me fetch the Hallows, and I'll send you back with them."

"Waaait!" Bare feet pattered after him before a pair of arms clamped around his waist. "I'm sorry, master. I'll do the dishes and won't make a mess in the kitchen. Please don't banish me! There's nothing in the Underworld but sand and bones!"

Harry twisted in her hold and gave her a dubious look. Clinging to him with teary eyes, she did not look like much of a cosmic power at all. "If you don't nick my stuff," he said grudgingly, "you can stay a while longer."

She straightened up and bobbed her head. "Of course, master." Gripping the hem of the shirt, she began tugging it up.

"W-what are you doing?" he yelped.

She blinked. "Giving it back. I've got nothing else to wear."

"Seriously?" He groaned. "Let's go buy you something."

Death's eyes slowly widened until she let out a squeal. "I always wanted to go shopping in the human world. Let's go! Let's go right now!" Clasping his arm, she tugged him toward the Floo.

"For god's sake," he muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose. "At least put some pants on."

*** "Oh, Merlin," Harry said, gasping for air. He blindly groped for the bathroom door's handle, his eyes watering and burning. "It smells like something died in here!"

Somehow, as though he'd yelled at the top of his lungs, Death's voice carried through the cottage, calm and nonchalant. "Yeah, sorry," she said, "I ate a Death Eater last night. My tum-tum doesn't agree with pretentious fools suffering from delusions of grandeur."

"Light a bloody match in future, woman! Or at least do something to clear the air!"

"By the way," she called back, "your girlfriend will be here in five...

"Oh, Merlin!"

"Three..."

"Buggering shite!"

"Such wonderfully foul language, Master! Oh, and one."

There was a flash of fiery green and the typical whooshing of floo-travel.

"Harry?" Ginny Weasley took a step from the fireplace and immediately staggered, coughing. "Oh, Christ!"

Death, hovering behind Ginevra, laughed hard and loudly.

As usual, her master's girlfriend heard and saw nothing.

The tip of a femur, discoloured and cracked, bobbed up from the mess. Harry gagged again.

(It's the forth part in a series and definitely a big time investment, so the tl;dw is that Creepio is a mass murdering sociopath who had his memory wiped so that he'd be a bit less murdery, and the amnesiac version has no idea of what's going on, ever.)

** Kinda reminds me of a story by dirtyuncle on ao3. Lily made a deal with a demon to save harry and during book one he accidentally summoned said demon and made a deal with her that she came to collect after DH. But harry turned the tables on her and ended up enslaving her. Pretty smutty but still a good story as their relationship deepens. On hiatus atm because of the world but I'm hoping he comes back to it

** This prompt reminds me of Hellhole by Gina Damico.

It is not a fic but a publish book.

So basically the protagonist commits a sin and he accidentaly summons a Devil. The protagonist wants to get rid of him because he does nothing but laze around and is an avid lover of the protagonist's junkfood and TV.

I highly recommend it for those that want to enjoy a comedic angsty story with likeable characters.
