It seems like Daphne Greengrass Fanon trope is one of the most detailed parts of fanon. How the hell did we get from one or two mentions in the entire series to the current trope of the “Slytherin Ice Queen”, from a neutral family, whose best friends are Tracy Davis, someone not even mentioned in the series, and occasionally Blaise Zabini, And inevitably has either black or blonde hair?


** Because after Half-Blood Prince was released people found out Blaise was a boy and until then he was used as the usual female Slytherin pairing for Harry, because he was mentioned in the first book as slytherin without mentioning his gender.

Afterwards a new blankslate was needed and Daphne Greengrass was already mentioned in the books as a Slytherin without any mentioning of insulting either Harry or Hemrione.

** Back in 2005, Jeconais's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] is the fic that kick-started the HP/DG "Ice Queen" trope.

** She's one of the few really attractively casted Slytherin girls but she has no lines or any involvement in the books. That allows her to be a relateable blank slate where fanfiction authors who want to write a relateable Slytherin girl can do whatever they want with her. Similar to fics that make Draco less dickheadish than shown in canon. He's good looking enough that people like to write him more relatable unlike crab or Goyle or marcus flint. Similar with Zabini.

Rowling and the movie producers were basically extremely biased against Slytherin house. Most of the people from there were cast as ugly, dumb, and mean. That really didn't line up to how Slytherin basically had a monopoly on the house cup and would've won in year 1 if it wasn't for dumbledore giving out 150 whopping points after they already won.

I sometimes wear a Slytherin T-shirt, not because I think I would fit in the house, but as a conversation piece. Because canon really didn't do justice to a house that was called "ambitious" but was never allowed to display any ambition in the story.

** I'll just note that Rowling had made a list of everybody in Harry's year and it's been put up on the internet at some point or another. And that's likely where Tracy Davis came from. The same with Blaze Zabini, who also got a mention in the books. Probably still a handful or so characters on that list that's not been used yet.

** Someone did it once and other people copied. Same as everything else.
