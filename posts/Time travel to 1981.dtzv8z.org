Harry (or almost anyone so long as it isn't Draco Malfoy or Snape) travel back to 1980 or 1981. I want Lily and James to already be parents or to be expecting. Preferably. I'll go with anything, so long as the Marauders and Company already graduated Hogwarts.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

This one is a little weird in the beginning, but it's pretty awesome. Basically 8 year old Harry accidentally causes Karma to time travel to 1981 and change the war. Regulus Black becomes the main character and there's a lot of action involving the Marauders in the Order fighting Death Eaters. There's quite a bit of nested time loops in the same timeline later on, with weird things happening like characters saving their past selves after getting saved by mysterious people who look like themselves, so time travel mostly follows the same rules as in Prisoner of Azkaban but over much longer timespans.

Oh, and James Bond makes a small appearance helping in hunting down a Death Eater hiding in the muggle world. Pretty awesome chase scene.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Dumbledore concocts a cunning plan to travel back in time and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. His untimely death prevents him from going so Harry must go in his place, and take the one person whose help he really needs with him.
