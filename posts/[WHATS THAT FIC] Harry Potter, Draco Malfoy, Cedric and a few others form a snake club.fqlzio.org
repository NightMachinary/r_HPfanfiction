:END:
There were a few OCs too. They basically formed this snake club (pretty sure it was called the snake guard?) and Fred, George, Luna, Neville, Blaise and a few others were a part of it. They had meetings in a caved passageway. It was Drarry, and Cedric had a crush on Harry.


** I keep switching between remembering this and wanting to read this!

Did they make potions in the caved passageway? Was it behind a tapestry or illusioned or something? If so, is it the story that went like "Harry is terrible at potions but loves it anyway"?

Edit: nope, I found the one I was thinking of (Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste on AO3) and while it does have the caved passageway thing (and I think is Drarry) , it doesn't have Cedric in the Goblet-of-Fire-shooting-names-scene. If someone does find this fic I'd like to read it!

Hope that helps you out!

*** I have spent all night binge reading this (it's 3:18 AM) and am gutted to find that the sequel hasn't been updated since 2009. Pure disappointment...

I loved this, though...

***** How did you manage to channel so much of Luna Lovegood into that sentence

I hope goody wasn't a typo because if it was it would mean it wasn't intentional Luna channeling
