Draco enters the Triwizard Tournament using a few slick tricks for kicks but he doesn't really expect the Cup to choose him (because, honestly, that's preposterous). But lo and behold, the Cup's 4th champion is Draco Malfoy, to the incredulity of every person present and the muted horror of the boy himself.


** Dragon: "RAAWWR!!!!!!!"

Draco: "My father will hear of this!"

That was the very first thing that came to me when I read this prompt.

*** I hope he doesn't, but wishes he had.

As a consolation prize, I'd also accept him surviving the whole thing with his pride in tatters and a variety of minor injuries, but unwilling to take risks or spout his crap after a genuine, unforgettable, brush with death. He'd be a shadow of his former self, and a better person for it.

**** Draco rises to the occasion

and then surprises everyone when he humblely accepts him being last place

saying he put in a good effort, but everyone else was more experinced and just better on the day.

and then he drops out of school the next day to get into more danger in a rainforest or something

** Based on how our understanding of his canon abilities, I sincerely doubt he makes it through the dragon. Definitely not through the lake imo

*** I would love it that he survives but completely fails like he's covered in burns on like 70% of his body and only through magic he survived, due to the scar tissue he can't really swim and thus leaves Pansy down there till she is brought back up. Malfoy enters the maze and basically gets yeeted by the inversion patch breaks both legs and quits.

Malfoy is humbled

*** I think he'd definitely survive and may end up in 2nd or 3rd place because it's actually canon that he's only behind hermione in rankings. he definitely has the magical abilities and cunning for the tasks.

**** It's actually not. That's a misinterpretation based on the movies. In fact, canonically the only subject he did well enough in to comment on was potions.

** Malfoy finds out about the fake fourth school that Barty added when he confused the goblet. Malfoy has an older student put in his name as champion of the fourth school. The goblet decides that Malfoy is a worthier champion than Harry. Now Barty tries to cover his fuck up by giving Draco polyjuce potion to look like Harry before he enters the maze. Voldemort thinking that Draco is Harry, uses his blood to regenerate but since Draco is not an enemy, Voldemort comes out of the cauldron in the body of a ferret. Also Harry distributes "Malfoy stinks" badges.

** Of similar idea is: *Harry Potter and his Veela Mate*, by Ares.Granger -- linkffn(10633819)

Due to (Plot-ish Reason), Draco's name comes out instead of Harry as the fourth champion. It goes about as well as you'd expect.

It's not a full-on crack story, but it is definitely a crazy comedy fic.

  A Harmony story. Hermione is a Veela and discovers this shortly before their fourth year. What will Hermione's new powers do to alter Harry's fourth year? Warning- there's Ron-bashing ahead. If you dislike Ron-bashing, don't read.
