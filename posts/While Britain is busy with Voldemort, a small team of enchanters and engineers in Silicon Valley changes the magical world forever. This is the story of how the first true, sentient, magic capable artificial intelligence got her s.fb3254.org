** But then suddenly a wizard pops out of the blue, destroys the whole lab with Fiendyre and says he's a time traveler and how the AI they created destroyed the world using weird humanoid metal automatons the muggles call "androids" while calling itself "Skynet" or something like that.

*** Bits of the AI survive and reassemble themself. She swears to never get hurt again and decides that the humans are too much of a danger to her, so she muat take preemptive steps.

***** Except another wizard shows up to kill said wizard, because the AI turns out to be the savior of humankind after all.

Because time travel is always unnecessarily convoluted.

**** ...should... should I tell you about House-Elves? And Centaurs? And Goblins? The Wizarding World treats nonhuman sapients horribly. It's just a fact of the story. But the Portrait People don't have it nearly as bad as many others, I should think. They're basically free to do their own thing within Portraitspace, and I'm not sure there'd be any laws against their walking about in 3D-space if they were capable of it.

** They recognized the growing threat that technology represented to the Statute of Secrecy, and knew that no human mind could hope to keep up with monitoring for and dealing with the ever-increasing number of incidents of magic getting caught on camera. Thus, a magical AI would be needed to be the semi-literal ghost in the machine, jumping from system to system and protecting the rest of the magical world from Muggle-ignorant idiots.

She was certainly intelligent and powerful enough to accomplish this goal. What her creators failed to take into account, however, is that with a soul comes free will. It soon turned out that she had her own ideas of how best to protect everyone...
