*** This is canon. Molly and Sirius both do this in the books, bringing things we would refrigerate out of their pantries cold - including butterbeer and a raw turkey.

***** Order of the Phoenix Christmas time - Sirius appears out of the pantry with a turkey. Molly's scenes are scattered throughout the series. She cooks a lot.

** Pantries probably, just as people in the Muggle world did up until the 1950s (beyond if they were poorer). But wizarding ones probably have spells and so on on them to act more like a fridge.

** Muggle-style larders. Large houses built pre-electricity often have a room that is built to be cold (on the shaded side, thicker walls, clever ventilation, etc), which is good enough for relatively fresh milk, cheese, preserved meat, etc, for a couple of days.
