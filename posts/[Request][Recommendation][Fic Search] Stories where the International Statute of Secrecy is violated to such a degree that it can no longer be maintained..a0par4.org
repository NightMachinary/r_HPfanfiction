Suppose Voldemort and his Death Eaters declared war against the Muggle world? Suppose Newt didn't have a thunderbird handy after Credence/Obscurial's rampage in New York? Suppose some wizard gets drunk and starts using magic in the Muggle world in on live TV?

Basically, I'm looking for fics where the Statute gets violated in such a way that there's no hope of maintaining it. Anything like that out there?


** I'm thinking more along the lines of the poor lads at Heathrow who have to figure out what to do with this really odd trunk that got left at baggage claim. What bloke needs a trunk with seven locks, am I right? Better call a supervisor.
