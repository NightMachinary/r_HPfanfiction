** Sounds like an "everyone is Snape" kind of fic.

Suddenly, I want to read an AU where everyone is Snape.

*** There is no such thing as realistic in fanfiction. You don't look for fanfiction if you don't want something changed

**** Everything in that sentence is wrong.

There is an element of realism in all writing. Having human characters disregard basic human emotions and instincts always rings false and feels like bad writing. Having a group of human adults act like petulant children is so anti-human there's no way to do it and not have to spend thousands of words coming up with an excuse almost every reader will think is garbage. People don't hate a baby because the parents died trying to save it. That's such an absurd notion.

Also I've written a million words of fan fiction and never once done it because I thought something needed to change. I simply had ideas in universe that I wanted to explore and share.

I think most people get into it because they want to spend more time in that world, not because they want to change the world.

**** I actually find that there are two distinctly different groups of people who love HP fanfiction: 1) People who loved the books so much that they want them to carry on, unchanged (people who read/write missing moments like Not From Others and in-the-future stories like The Aurors) and 2) people who loved them but want to shake things up and change the way something happened.

The disagreements in this sub are usually between those two groups of people.
