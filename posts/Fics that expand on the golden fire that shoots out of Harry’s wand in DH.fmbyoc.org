In the actual books, it's just a contrived deus ex machina to let Harry escape Voldemort and get rid of the Brother Wands issue, and literally never comes up again.

I'd be interested to see fics where, say, it relates to a Power He Knows Not that's a bit less lame than “the general idea of love”. Or just uses it more than exactly once.


** All of Harry victory over Voldemort is a Deus ex Machina , Expelliarmus vs Avada Kedavra is quite illustrative of the gap between these two. And the golden trio proficiency with unforgivable another deus ex machina.

** The whole thing is deus ex machina. HP is a mystery story where the protagonist can /only/ win by contrived and or unlikely circumstances. There was no power he knows not, except maybe dumbledore's schemes.

** As Harry used the other two unforgivables during the war, I think it would have been fitting that he uses the killing curse to take out Voldemort.

*** Very but not Golden Boy of the Light. Theoretically his use of the two unforgivables would have landed in Azkaban if some others would have learnt of it as it is the law.

***** No Barty Crouch Jr did them on Animals only and did not explain the how do it and intent behind. Harry achieved the Cruciatus Curse only after Bellatrix Lestrange explained the intent behind. It is only when the DE were in control of Hogwarts that they were taught how and cast on the students.

****** i mean in 7th year. the death eater teachers taught the dark arts. so it was probably perfectly legal to use them at the time.

******* Ah on the legality we could argue that the ministry was in exile and that all laws passed by Puis Thickness Administration ans tenure are illegal and never happened. And so the laws prohibiting the unforgivables were still in effect. How justify their arrest of those using the unforgivables for that period that weren't in Azkaban before ? The victory rule cannot go ad Infinitum. And the Death Eathers imprisonnement is based on these laws as the membership of a terrorist group does not exist in wizarding Law !

** Dumbledore guesses that Voldemort transfered some of his skill to Harry via brother wand shenanigans after he came back. Could be something to work with. Granted the connection only comes up against Voldemort, but still.

** It's Harry the Horcrux defending Voldemort's soul shard. I'm not really sure it's all that interesting.

Unless it happens earlier and Harry tries to learn the spell, of course.

But why shouldn't there have been long term effects?' That seems reasonable?
