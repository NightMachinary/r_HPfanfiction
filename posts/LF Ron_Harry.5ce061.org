** I'd like to see Ron/fem!Harry. For being best mates there sure aren't many pairings with Ron, and Ron is very rarely portrayed as an actual human being instead of a caricature of one.

I'm not even sure if there is a Harry/Neville fic whether it's fem or slash. Really doubt there are good length ones though that aren't abandoned.

** I've not read any novel-length Ron/Harry without sex scenes (if that's what you mean by smut), but here are a few that are more than PWP - unfortunately none are very long.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5519225/1/The-Abysmal-Dating-Life-of-Harry-Potter][The Abysmal Dating Life of Harry Potter]] - A really sweet and funny Ron/Harry get together fic set a few years after the war. It is a Ron POV fic and this author writes a hilarious internal monologue for Ron. I was smiling the whole time I read it. Great fic.

- [[http://helenish.talkoncorners.net/closeenough.shtml][Close Enough]] - 30ish yr. old Harry and Ron who work in a department at the ministry similar to aurors. Good world building with the side characters and the ending of the war. This fic was really well written - especially the dialogue. But I found it pretty depressing.

If you'd like a non-graphic, novel length slash fic, there are some great Draco/Harry and Remus/Sirius fics I could recommend.

** *Weasley Girl* and its sequel *Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past*, linkffn(9932798;8202739): even though the author said there would be no romance, I definitely ship Harry with this "Ron".

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.
