How AU does it need to get for you to abon the fic? Most of the Harry Potter fanfiction are canon rehash with a few original ideas sprinkled in that aren't that original. It takes a lot of time and effort to make an truly original piece of work, so I feel like a lot of authors are content with changing Harry a little in order to get the ripples started.Harry is gay? Great. Harry is actually a woman? No problem. Harry is a restaurant owner? Sure. Harry has his mothers hair? Seems like fun. Different parents, different names, different worlds.

Some authors take it a step further and actually change the world in significant ways. Perhaps a few original adventures. Or stories that take pllace in a world where Voldemort or Grindelwald won? Some authors change up the whole magic system. Or worlds where Voldemort doesn't have horxruces but achieved immortality in some other way.

I feel like I'm pretty accepting about AU's, but I draw the line at different magical schools. I can accept that I'm still reading Harry Potter when he's a red haired guy that goes by Evan Peverell that was adopted by Ash Ketchum. But the moment Harry enters a other magical school, even if he goes by Harry, I feel like I'm reading a story about a bunch of OC's.

Where do you draw the line?


** When I started reading HP fanfics, I‘d skip everything that wasn't 100% canon, post-war stories. Nowadays, as long as magic exists in some form in the world, I'm fine with it.

** I think bigger problem is OOC characters than changes in the plot line. I remember (but I cannot recall the name) story, where Harry time travels to the alternative universe where all Marauders & Lily live and teach at Hogwarts, and I was very much disturbed with constant thought “why these people have names of people from the books when they have nothing to do with those people in the books?”. I dimly remember Snape and Sirius being the best buddies constantly cracking jokes and both in wildly coloured robes. If you want to have canonical characters, make them at least partially canonically behaving. Or you can make a story how they turned from their canonical ways to something else. If you want to write in HP universe but with different characters just use different names. I think that's the main beauty of Marauders-era and post-war (or next-generation) stories: author can have their own characters.

TL;DR: AU where Voldemort wins? Do you want to make Dumbledore the Dark Lord of the Prophecy (please, no lazy bashing)? Bring it on! AU where Snape wears pink robes and is happy drunk pranking everybody? why?

**** Well, if Sirius for some reason decided to not rebel so soon at his parents and ended up in Slytherin like Regulus, it could change everything: no Marauders, so maybe Snape wasn't bullied so much and he got Sirius as friend 'cause he wouldn't take on a fellow Slytherin and they would have got a common enemy, it kept him away from other Slytherins like McNair etc., obv he never fought with Lily and he never grow up bitter but on the contrary he was more relaxed.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

** I don't think I've ever really had an issue with AU. More often than not, it's something specific that causes me to quit reading a fanfic, like gratuitous violence, especially against people who've done nothing to deserve it.

I remember one fanfic(so far it's only one chapter) that just randomly has a bunch of kids beating up Luna on the Hogwarts Express for no apparent reason, among other things

Other concepts I find abhorrent can make me quit too, even if I was otherwise enjoying the story beforehand.

I remember one fanfic made me rage quit over them writing that magic punished women for infidelity. Not husbands using magic(which would still be bad), but magic itself. I was just that disgusted).

I don't mind other schools so much, as long as the Hogwarts roots are acknowledged. I mean, after being put into death-defying situations every year he attended Hogwarts, maybe Harry just wants a normal year of schooling without dark lords, abusive teachers, and staff letting students get away with murder.

** I mostly only read canon compliant stories - post war, missing moments, alternate POVs, what different characters were up to, that worth of thing. Every now and then I will dip into an AU fic usually a point of divergence, and will enjoy a couple of chapters around that point, but I dont think ever have gripped me enough to make me complete or avidly follow the fic.

I have a lot of respect and admiration for AU writers, it's not at all a problem I have with AU as a concept (indeed, I defend it rather vigorously on the main sub when people bash fanfic), I'm just particularly invested in the canon characters as a matter of preference. People have told me for years that eventually I'll drift towards AU but it hasn't happened yet.

** I can read pretty much any AU -- Voldemort wins, no Voldemort, non-magic, different era, different parents, different upbringing, etc.

What I can't stand is extreme changes to characters' appearances and/or names. Most characters in most fics all already basically OCs but changing their looks and names is going one step too far for me. It breaks the immersion way too much. I can read a story where Harry's a Snape's son or Hermione is Bellatrix's daughter. But as soon as Harry turns in a brown-eyed redhead, Ron in a grey-eyed brunette and Hermione in blue-eyed blonde that are now referred to as Hadrian, Ronaldo and Hermosia, I quit.

And even though I would read a muggle AU, I would drop a story where magic works in some way that was directly stated (or implied) as being impossible in canon.

** Now I prefer to avoid pretty much any canon compliant fics eg harry/ginny and Hermione/Ron because I could not see those ships happening. Now that's not to say I never read fics with those ships but they are few and far between.

So I prefer AU Fics. The question becomes does the fic require massive changes in how the characters interact or will lots of tiny changes get the character to where they need to go. While I don't mind the massive change I actually prefer lots of smaller changes (of course just like whether someone likes a fic or not there's a lot of variance in whether a change is "small").

As long as there is a decent tie to either the wizarding world or at least some of the Hogwarts characters I'm ok with the AU. But if it's just Harry by himself and completely away from the wizarding world then I'm not as interested.

For example, one story that is as close to that latter AU line as I would tolerate to go is Harry Potter x Anita Blake crossover. Hard Won Homes by Luna_sss. The trio Harry and Hermione/Ron leave the Wizarding world after Voldemort's defeat and end up in America in St. Louis. They start interacting with the different weres due to Harry's "saving people thing". Eventually, different ties start appearing eg the redhaired norse vampire Damien is related to Ron. And others show up like Andi and Teddy, Neville/Luna etc. This is set in the time frame just after Blue Moon but before Obsidian Butterfly (Anita Blake trying to "gain" control of her life).

Hopefully the link will work or it may bounce if you don't have an AO3 account (which I just asked for since I never needed one to access things before). Which means I really hope the story isn't gone.

*** Actually, more fanfic stories I've read more I prefer the Hinny ones. They are a way more fun, because they deal with flawed characters as we all are. Harmony (or Haphne) stories, where everybody is so perfect make me vomit. The biggest relational crisis in linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof)? IIRC, the only crisis of their relationship was when Harry didn't run fast away enough when jumped by naked (?) Cho Chang. He was willing to break engagement over it. Really?

In [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One by sovran]] we have Ginny blowing up faces of *both* her mother and Professor Dumbledore by the overpowered Bat-Bogey Hex half-a-year through their relationship. A way more fun. In linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) the beloved wife just dies, truly and really (in Notebooks and Letters in similar situation, the author was not able to let the person go).

** For me, when the entire story is filled with OCs, with just a mention, like maybe Harry being on a chocolate frog card once- if I do not recognize any of the characters save for one mention of Harry, that is it for me. I also don't like OOC characters, unless I can trace the change in character back to a moment or to a plausible butterfly effect. For example, in the Pureblood Pretense, a female Harry and her devotion to potions are possible, due to an immersion in the magical world since birth- and Lily was also very good at potions most likely, due to working with Snape. I would also say that this could have led to the Pureblood Pretense's Harry, because her father didn't exactly approve of her admiration of Snape, and having to sneak out to brew them, learning to be cunning. Harry also seems like someone, IN CANON, who to me would throw themselves into something if they found it fascinating for some reason. So I'm just gonna stop here- pretty much not OOC unless I can find a divergence point and plausible butterfly effect, and canon characters have to at least be secondary characters for some strange reason, even if I don't know anything about them.
