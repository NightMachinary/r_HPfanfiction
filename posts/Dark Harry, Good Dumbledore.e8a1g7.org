Looking for some good and realistic fics where Harry is morally grey or dark. (but necessarily not evil.) Without any Dumbledore or Weasley bashing. It will be a bonus if Harry is not too op. For example : A cadmean victory, the accidental horcrux, the prince of slytherin, Harry potter and the boy who lived, too young to die etc. Thank you.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/][Antithesis]] definitely works. Very tragic fic, also completed.
