I know there are plenty of other Remus Lupin fans out there, so I thought I'd link some of my favorite stories about him. But I'm always looking for more, so please feel free to share any you may have.

For each story, I'll follow it with the (#) of chapters, and (-WIP) if it's still a Work In Progress.

Anything with an (M) before it means it is for Mature audiences, containing explicit sex, graphic violence or adult themes, so fair warning.

Happy reading!


** REMUS' LIFE STORY

+[[http://paperclipbitch.livejournal.com/73251.html][And When I Have Lost Everything I Will Remember This]]+ (1) by paperclipbitch. A collection of insights into eight significant moments in Remus' life. edit: apparently the author took this one down. 2nd edit: I found it again, thanks to archive.org (love them!), so you can [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080513160246/http://paperclipbitch.livejournal.com/73251.html][read it here]].

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2312032/1/Random_Acts][Random Acts]] (10) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/718439/mercutio_rane][mercutio-rane]]. A look back at Remus' life through a series of acts of kindness towards him, featuring a few of the important people in his life.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2800596/1/Disaster_See_also_Remus_J_Lupin_lovelife_of][Disaster: See also, Remus J Lupin, lovelife of]] (14) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/937162/Lady_Bracknell][Lady Bracknell]]. Remus' life as reflected back through his relationships with women.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2598097/1/Moments_of_Bliss][Moments of Bliss]] (63-WIP) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/901944/moonymaniac][moonymaniac]]. This is Remus' story of his time at Hogwarts, and since it's unfinished I have no idea how far it will continue. There's plenty of Marauder action and Remus has a romance with an OC (Original Character). It's delightful. Well-written and riveting, with plenty of insight into his character and the people around him. Plus it's one of the best all-around Marauder fics I've read.

**** Damn. I'm really starting to hate LiveJournal. It was there before, but now I'm denied too. I found that link from [[http://www.coffee-and-chocolate.com/2007/11/05/and-when-i-have-lost-everything-i-will-remember-this/][here on Coffee and Chocolate]], and it looks like it's been a working link since at least 2007.

I tried to google it, hoping it was posted on another site, but found [[http://paperclipbitch.livejournal.com/][this from the author]]. Apparently she doesn't want people to read her stuff, for now, and says maybe it'll be back in a few weeks.

I wish these stupid sites wouldn't block/remove stories. I understand that fanfic sites are respecting the authors' wishes, but could you imagine if a published author decided later that they wanted all their books destroyed? You put it out there, it's out there, so let others enjoy it. Sheesh. /rant

***** As a writer and a reader, I agree that it's beyond rude to just take down your work. I hate when people do that. (My favorite writer, for instance, has a website and at one point, it had lessons for the language she wrote for her books, and then she arbitrarily decided that she didn't want to put it back up when she moved servers, and I actually get extremely angry at her for that because I was half way through the lessons. It would take her like two seconds to put it back up!!)

But, as a psychiatry hopeful and a sufferer of GAD, I have to make an exception for this person with my anger, because mental issues suck so completely. For both selfish (I'll admit it) and not-so-selfish reasons, I hope she feels better soon.

Thanks for posting the link anyway, and for taking the time to figure out why it went down. All of these stories are great, and I'm glad you recommended them! =]

****** Yeah, I'm not really angry at the author, I can empathize with her plight. Which is why I didn't email her as she suggested, but came here to get it off my chest.

I had a friend who was a talented painter, yet would continually paint over certain pieces that several friends had told her they loved. She'd paint it, show it to us, we'd gush, then she'd later decide it wasn't good enough and destroy it, and we'd be crushed. I've always felt that any art form is a purging, and once it's out there it's out there. Don't judge, don't second guess, just let it go, ya' know? Just a peeve of mine.

And heck, this story won some fanfic awards. Maybe that's not a big deal, but it at least means it didn't suck, as so many fanfics do. I can't remember the majority of that particular story, but I liked it enough to not only favorite it myself, but also to recommend it, and so did many others. It's a pity that isn't enough to make the author able to appreciate her own work.

I'm happy to hear you're enjoying the stories! I've waded through so much trash to find them, and while not all of the ones here are as good as I might hope for, I at least wanted to help some others have an easier time of it.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2665&chapno=1][Pheromones]] (1) by [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=profile&id=759][madame en]]. Author's tagline: "Tonks has a question. Remus has the answer."

[[http://www.checkmated.com/story.php?story=8251][Through Black-colored Glasses]] (1) by [[http://www.checkmated.com/authors.php?name=Ozma&cat=stories][Ozma]]. Author's tagline: "Sirius Black notices two Order members behaving strangely one morning."

[[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/viewstory.php?sid=1924][Perfect Pair]] (1) by [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/viewuser.php?uid=4539][mrstater]]. Author's tagline: "How had Molly missed all the signs? Had she been completely daft all summer?"

** REMUS AND TONKS GET TOGETHER

(M) [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2985.html][Consequences]] (28) by [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/][pandorajones]]. Super sexy, very flirty, yet angsty story. Tonks makes some poor choices, and seems a bit needy at times, but this is an excellent, well-rounded, well-written story that also showcases her Auror duties and the other Order members.

(M) [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=2626&textsize=0&chapter=1][Things I Have But Could Have Done Without]] (11) by [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/viewuser.php?uid=1204][modestyrabnott]]. This Tonks falls for Remus not because she needs him, but because she understands him. This is just a lovely story, and with only 11 chapters it will leave you wanting more. It's still well worth reading.

(M) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2577263/1/Moondance][Moondance]] (23) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/892951/KatieBell70][KatieBell70]]. Another excellent story encompassing their relationship, and features Tonks' parents. While this was published before DH was released, Remus has an illuminating conversation with Ted Tonks that almost foreshadows, if not explains, him later leaving her in DH.

(M) [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3477455/1/Foot_In_My_Mouth_Heart_On_My_Sleeve][Foot In My Mouth, Heart On My Sleeve]] (1) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1062330/Ms_Avi][Ms. Avi]]. Author's tagline: "Tonks, Master Bungler, thinks she should be quite used to making a fool of herself. So why does she get so flustered whenever she does so around a certain werewolf?"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540537/2/Midnight_in_the_House_of_Good_and_Evil][Midnight in the House of Good and Evil]] (2) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/225422/Wild_Magelet][Wild Magelet]]. Author's tagline: "On the surface, Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks don't seem to have much in common. But then, on the surface, number twelve Grimmauld Place is the least romantic location in London. In an unlikely setting begins an unlikely romance."

The Rookie Series (13) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1133405/jncar][jncar]] has Tonks and Remus meeting during GoF, while the new Auror is questioning the witness to Sirius Black's getaway, and follows them through DH. It's broken into 5 stories: 1. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3272821/1/The_Rookie][The Rookie]] 2. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3434239/1/Smoke_and_Wind][Smoke and Wind]] 3. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3499876/1/Drifting][Drifting]] 4. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3627652/1/This_Stony_Pass][This Stony Pass]] 5. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3754772/2/Choices][Choices]]

[[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/shiftstoc.html][Shifts]] (40) and [[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/shadestoc.html][Shades]] (42) by [[http://humongousbighead.homestead.com/hpfics.html][Fernwithy]] are each stand-alone 'novels' that correspond with OoTP and HBP, but with a focus on Remus' escapades working for the Order.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2511561/1/Of_Blood_Ice_and_Fire][Of Blood, Ice and Fire]] (20-WIP) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/718439/mercutio_rane][mercutio-rane]]. This is an older story that may well have been abandoned. The author wrote the last few chapters, but lost them in a crash and hasn't updated the story in years. AU, after the war, Umbridge has instituted some severe anti-werewolf legislation that forces them to undergo transformations at London City Holding, which is a brutal and deadly internment camp. NoblePrat!Remus risks his life to fight the discrimination. Even though it's not finished, it's a riveting story.

Adult Teddy has a chance to save his parents and bring them through time in a way that is believable and fully canon-compliant ('dead' Remus still sees Harry in the forest), but it has consequences for him with the Ministry. While I don't like the R/T dynamic (she is too bossy and he is too resigned to her), the story itself will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's well-written, and a wonderful look into the future of the Ministry with Kingsley in charge and Hermione and Harry working there.

A good writer can make any pairing believable. This author turned out a lovely Snape/Lupin short story that I adore, even though I'm not a fan of Snupin. Completely AU, after the war these two emotionally-battered survivors reach out from their isolation. Their communication is perfect.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865/1/Remus_Lupin_PI][Remus Lupin, PI]] (20) by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2062884/Larry_Huss][Larry Huss]]. Completely AU, Remus takes Harry from the Dursleys, changes his name and sends him to Hogwarts while everyone wonders what happened to the 'The Boy Who Lived.' I'm hesitant to recommend this because it doesn't resonate with me as others have, but it is an interesting premise, and well-written. There's a 'male-fantasy' storyline with Hermione, Luna and Padma wanting to have their way (at a much too young age) with Harry, but Remus' story is quite interesting.

EDITed to add UPDATE: This fic is now complete. I recommended it while it was still a WIP, but now that it's finished I probably wouldn't have. It was interesting at first to consider the different choices Remus made and how those changes affected the overall HP storyline, but the last few chapters were subpar. The overall story itself might be interesting for those who would like to see the characters meet different fates, but it's not one of the better ones out there.
