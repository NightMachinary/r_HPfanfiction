i dont know where to find official info as the movies ofc doesn't help at all w/ its inconsistencies BUT harry potter lexicon *dunno how reliable* says on harry's fourth year, he has:

- herbology w/ hufflepuffs,

- care of magical creatues w/ slytherins

while other core classes like transfiguration, charms, & DADA remains unknown

im aware that electives can be mixed, right? and that astronomy is w/ the whole year (60 students) and takes up one day of the week

â€‹

*can anyone fill in the gaps in harry's schedule (of which houses he has classes w/) that YOU or others use when writing?*


** There is a schedule I have a screenshot of that helps with making schedules

Filling in: the core classes are divided between the 4 houses so that each house has core classes twice with each house and the electives were as you said

I'm still trying to find a screenshot of the chart it's a lot better at explaining then I am
