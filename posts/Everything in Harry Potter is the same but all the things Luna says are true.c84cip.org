** EDIT: Sorry, didn't realize you were looking for a fic.

​

That's the real Harry Potter universe.

​

Corporate conglomerations ARE trying to take over the world by causing cavities - and being negligent towards our health in the pursuit of profit in other regards - and they have established a conspiracy to do so, a conspiracy which even involves government officials - as the Panama Papers clearly show.

​

Nargles and crumple-horned snorkaks might also be real, if you consider seeking freedom from nargles an allegory for seeking greater amounts of self-awareness over one's negative behaviour, as all people should, and if you consider seeking the discovery of crumple-horned snorkaks an allegory for seeking the discovery of a moral truth that most people will never grasp without it being proven unarguably for them.
