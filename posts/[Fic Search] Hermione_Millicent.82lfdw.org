It's quite a few years old but I remember Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode trying to uncover some murder mystery and ended up in a wizarding bdsm community that Professor McGonagall belonged to and they got an eyeful while hiding. I think there was also a house elf hiring service for freed elves and Hermione hired one for her business. I'm 99% sure this wasn't just a fever dream.


** Searched for the Hermione/Millicent pairing (which I didn't know existed) on AO3, and found "Unbreakable" by seedee. This looks like it's probably it:

  Why do elves keep dying? What's the secret of the striving elf agency? Where is Pixy? What do you wear to a Halloween party if your host is Millicent Bulstrode? Hermione's profession is to find answers; and she has the cloak to prove it.
