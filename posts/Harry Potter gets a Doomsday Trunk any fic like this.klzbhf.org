I figure that Harry learning about the prophecy around the time he does in canon would be more than enough to provide the impetus for him to spend Potter Family fortune plus what he got from Sirius to get this especially given the fact he had no training up to that point and was relatively caught off guard due to this. He needs time, safety, obscurity to train up, and study up to figure out what to do.

  One tiny change makes all the difference in the world. When Harry discovers a small box in his vault during his first visit to Gringotts, he is hoping for a memento of his parents. Instead, his discovery starts him down a path of intrigue and suspicion. Not sure who he can trust, Harry will have to learn to rely on himself. Book 1 of The Cry of Freedom. Updates every Tuesday.

**** Taken a look at the series and while interesting doesn't really count. A vanishing cabinet that allows one to enter a warded area that exist on land rather than in the trunk doesn't fit in with my question. Thanks for the suggestion though.
