:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfiction that I read years ago in which harry and Voldemort go back in time, harry was forced to take the dark mark and like a prisoners tattoo or something. I remember that he had the philosophers stone shards in his hand and that snape mentors harry before he adopts him back in 4th year
