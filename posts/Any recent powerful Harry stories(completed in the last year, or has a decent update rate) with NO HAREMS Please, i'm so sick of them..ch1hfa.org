  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Strong Harry and Ron as aurors after defeating Voldemort a bit early, easily become the two best aurors but are still seen as rookies but they hunt down the remaining death eaters pretty easily, just the mysterious night nargle always escapes them, it's as if she knew them really well....

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Hmm, linkffn(The Mind Arts), linkffn(Renegade by 1991Kira), linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage law Revolution) (this one is probably Starfox5's best fic), linkffn(The Sorting Hat's Stand), linkffn(The Lie I've lived), linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle), linkffn(Defiance), linkffn(Resurgence by Arcturus Peverell).

Some of these are bad writing, but enjoy!
