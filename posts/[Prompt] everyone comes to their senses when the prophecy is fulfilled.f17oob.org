So I know some of us find glaring horror in the way a lot of people in cannon act and we know it's just to drive the plot and it's basically JKR writing them like that.

So that got me thinking, I'd like to see a one-shot crackfic that basically makes it so that everything that happened so far was basically Fate and the Prophecy forcing things to go in such a way that the prophecy is fulfilled. Once it was, the moment Harry kills Voldemort, everyone just snaps out of it and they're like "WTF HAVE I BEEN THINKING/DOING FOR THE LAST 7 YEARS? I would never act like <example>" and then everyone just talks about what they did the last seven years.

Humor me, it's a crackfic prompt.


** Literally the only one not effected is Harry, and when everyone snaps back into competency and feels like garbage for their behavior, he's just completely fucking confused because everyone being an idiot or actively harmful is his normal. So suddenly dealing with reasonable human beings and adults that mean well befuddle and alarms him. He'd probably end up freaked out tbh because he's not used to others a). genuinely meaning him well and b). being able to follow through on that without it ending in disaster for either them or himself. :(

*** No, Harry is rather barmy himself too. I mean, it's to be expected since he's grown up unloved and uncared for (even people who won't accept that what the Dursleys did to him was abuse should be able to accept that they didn't love or care for him), but he's still just as affected.

** OMG the Dursleys, guys...

The amount of shame and guilt over their treatment of Harry, not understanding why they were acting the way they were acting, just sudden clarity out of nowhere that they were neglectful, abusive asshats.

Not knowing why they acted that way. It hurts my soul.

*** "FREAK!" yelled Vernon into the air for the umpteenth time, targeted at no one in particular. "Freaky freak with your freak tricks and your freakish face! Boy! /Freak!/ */Boyish Freak!/*"

The corpulent man continued pacing around the dilapidated house, ranting and raving with a mindless rage that merely intensified the nonsensical rambling spewing out of his mouth. His face was flushed to an unnatural degree, deep splotches of red contrasting with his otherwise unwashed and pale face.

The Dursley household was in quite the sorry state; stains riddled the carpeted floor, the windows were grimy and clouded with dirt, and a thin layer of dust had settled over the entire area, only disrupted by the trail Vernon was carving with his nonstop pacing.

In the midst of his obsessive shouting, without warning, Vernon froze in place. His legs trembled, not from anger, but from fatigue, the effects of which were finally being felt after months upon months of ceaseless activity. Then, almost like a puppet having its strings cut, Vernon collapsed to the floor. He didn't move.

Hours later, the first stirrings of life returned to Vernon. A throbbing pain in his head eclipsed any thoughts he may have had, and he instinctively pressed his hands to his temples in a vain attempt to make the headache stop. After an indeterminate amount of time, the throbbing stopped, and Vernon was able to slowly and shakily push himself off of the ground.

His vision had yet to return to full clarity. Vernon wiped at his eyes, slowly, as his arms still felt like they were filled with lead. Blinking a few times, Vernon managed to clear his vision. He looked around at his surroundings, and couldn't believe his eyes. He blinked a few more times, rubbing at his eyes, but nothing changed. Was this a nightmare?

A twinge, seemingly coming from some indescribable place in the back of Vernon's mind. He frowned. Flashes of vaguely coherent memories came back to him, memories of yelling, shouting, threats of violence thinly veiled behind words. All directed toward a mere boy. What a terrible person. And yet... this person was himself. /He/ remembered berating the boy. /He/ remembered belittling him, raising his hand in anger, making as to hit him, but never following through.

It was him, but it wasn't him. He had done this, yet he had never truly done it. Something... /something/ had done this to him. To them all. Petunia, Dudley, and possibly more. So many more.

His fists clenched at his sides, and his breathing became ragged. He took little solace in the fact that this was the first time in a long while that Vernon had felt anger of his own volition. A burning question still lingered at the forefront of Vernon's thoughts.

Just /what/ had happened, these last few years?

**** But wouldn´t Dumbledores behavior be excused in this scenario because he was also under the influence of the prophecy? It wouldn´t make sense if he was the only one who wasn´t affected.

******* Let me clarify: Dumbledore bashing as in he did what he did bc the prophecy made him do it, but everyone would be like "omg that's horrible and stupid" after the prophecy is done with (Dumbledore is dead by this point). It bashes Cannon Dumbledore but not this fic's Dumbledore. Get it?

** Is is true that this prophecy would only be fulfilled if Harry was a sacrificing fool something true guardians would not allow, Voldemort essentially was victorious but he even ignored hos own victory to continue to obsess over Harry Potter like someone without a ounce of intelligence. And to establish the neither of them can live while the other survives (both immortal as living is to accept death as part of live, an immortal doesn't live) would not have been achieved without the use of Harry blood on the ritual of resurrection, something that would not be achieved without a true guardian that would have found loopholes in the Cup of Fire contract and even challenged the validity of the contract towards a minor. And Pettigrew would not have escaped so easily with a competent trial of Black by Bones. While Voldemort could have been defeated by Harry in another way and fulfill that part of the prophecy the second part would have failed without that exact succession of events.
