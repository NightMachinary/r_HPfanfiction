I'm looking for any fics that address how Dudley/Vernon/Petunia or even Piers interpreted that change in Harry's behaviour or his nightmares/sleep talking in the summer after the Triwizard Tournament. Essentially, any outside Muggle perspective on Harry set post-4th year, but prior to the Dementor attack in Little Whinging.
