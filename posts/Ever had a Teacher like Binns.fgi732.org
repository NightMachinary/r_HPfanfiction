I never understood how students of Hogwarts could not pay attention to Binns. I had never met a teacher that lost the whole class. That is until I attended a chemistry class in a work shop.

Let me tell you a bit about the kind of student I was.

I was a teacher's pet when I was in school. Once my teacher lost my copy of a test in my weakest subject. A student in the lower classes found it and gave it to me. I thought that I would have to sit the test again but when I handed it in to the teacher and told her what happened she told me not to worry as she knows I would not cheat. I was that big of a teacher's pet.

What I tell about the other students was told to me by my friend. I was not paying attention to others as I was trying to pay attention to our teacher.

So the chemistry class was the second one we had that day. So we were pretty fresh. Within 10 minutes most of the class had started doodling. I had never struggled so hard to pay attention in a class. Within half an hour some of them were sleeping(not dozing off actually sleeping), and only me and a girl were trying to pay attention. The rest were doodling except for my friend who was having fun watching me and the girl struggle, that traitor.

I was trying so hard to pay attention that my eyes were watering and had turned red. They were so bad that the teacher actually asked me if I was all right. Fortunately that was the only chemistry class we had to attend.

So that is how I came to emphasize with the students of Hogwarts and started to wonder how in world did Hermione pay attention in that class.

Have you ever had a teacher like Binns? Share your story.


** I had a couple of teachers like Binns in college. History major too, ironically.

** OMG, my meteorology professor had the most sonorous voice I've ever heard in my life. Deep and velvety and monotone and sooooo soothing. It was also the earliest class I ever took, not offered at any other time, and was required for my major. Dr. M put me to sleep during almost every lecture even though I was highly interested in the material. I still got 100% plus extra credit on every exam. I still remember most of what I learned about meteorology, probably because it is relevant every day of my life.

** My managerial accounting professor is like the positive version of Binns. He has the most soothing voice I have ever heard and a slight danish accent, and combined with how mind numbingly boring the material is, I find it so difficult to stay alert. He's such a nice guy, and I feel so bad about it but I can't stay awake no matter how hard I try. It's gotten to the point where I've actually had to physically hold my eyelids open with my fingers.

** Ooof

I could never have been a teachers pet, if anything I was like Fred and Geroge and I'm happy for that.

I was on behaviour report for the fifth time that school year and I was about to get of it when we had a supply for geography. My friends got paper and threw it around and had a paper war becuase the supply was so boring, she went on tangents about her family and had a really monotone voice

Anyway she gave me 5 crosses (which meant I got an hour detention for no reason) so I called her a fucking boring bitch and slammed the door...

And from then on I solemnly swear I turned good!

** Yes at university in a history of science fiction module that I was super looking forward to. I did pretty well in uni but that was the only class I failed. I literally couldn't keep my eyes open. He had a monotone voice and a proper heavy lisp so half the time even when I was struggling to pay attention I didn't understand what he was saying ðŸ˜­ I feel my eyes dry up just thinking about it ðŸ˜‚

** as far as we know: Magic History is the most boring subject, because Binns is more "monologing" his teachings, than actual teaching. As we learn in Book 5, he actually still thinks, he is teaching his old Class. His art of teaching is more robotic and thats why its so uninteresting. yet more of it: (atleast as far as i remember) Binns never asks the class if there are some Questions. He enters the Class, makes his teaching monologue and leaves without care. So, you could think he does a "deal with it or fail the exame" attitude, which is certainly great for some classes, but terrible in Human interaction.

â€‹

Think of it as a Singer: the song can be good as hell, but if the singer has no good voice, its not good.

â€‹

Imagine your interaction with him after the Chamber of secrets is exposed. He vehemently insistet that there would be proof or Hint of its existence. He is the same as Hermione, maybe even worse. So as long as there is no report in Books, it doesnt exist. But he seems to forget that Books are just a Media to transfer Knowledge over a Long Lifespan and that it saves the exploration, knowledge and History. But if no one makes further explorations, than there cant be any further reports.

Since he seems to be "trapped" in his timeline, i could imagine he would declare the existence of the CoS or "future knowledge" as fake, because it wasnt in "his" studies.

No, i never had a teacher like him.

** I had a teacher like that for two years. In my 'high school' we had psychology classes that.many people wanted but only a third or so got. I was in one of those courses and our teacher was very nice, none of us had a problem with him, until he started to teach. Barely anyone paid attention. After summer vacation we came back and spirits were high - all of us had willingly chosen this course after all, and all of us wanted to learn. And then the teacher opened his mouth and started talking. It was almost comical how quickly everyone's enthusiasm fell.

** Public law professor in my first year of university. Public law is basically "how your government works", so it wasn't the most scintillating of subjects to begin with (especially at the start when it was "this is the history of how the government was established"), but this lady. She would give out handouts of lecture notes-- and then stand up there and just read the notes out loud, in a very monotone voice.

** I had one who was a chemistry teacher in HS too. My friend and I spent every class playing Harry Potter themed hangman in our notebooks.

Luckily I'd had an amazing chem teacher a few years before so I did alright anyway.

** I didn't get a Binns, but I got an Umbridge (Or a Snape, pick your poison)!

We had a supply teacher for maths, and she was the most obnoxious person I'd ever met.

In the class, we had to be DEAD SILENT. I mean dead silent. Not even a whisper. This really dampened the mood, because we were always allowed to talk. We always chatted during questions, and it never really affected our work, and we were top set students, none of us got there by slacking off. The dead silence was unsettling and boring, so people actually got LESS work done.

If we didn't know something, the teacher was a prick about it. First question asked, she told the asker that it was written on the board (it wasn't). 2nd question asked, she told them that you should already know. Third question asked, she got fed up and banned asking questions. We gave up on that.

Someone in my class, lets call her Tammy, got fed up. She started fidgeting, and then argued with the teacher 'Why stop us from talking? We always talk in math class, never stops us from\\
working at all'

The teacher gets angry at her. They argue back and forth until the teacher says 'Why are you even in this class!' Tammy walks out after that.

The teacher then walks around the class, insulting and telling off people for the smallest things, like uniform and work. She sets a oppressive mood.

My classmate, Sara, starts to feel upset. I could see the tears in her eyes. She ran out the classroom as well, using her exit card to make sure she doesn't get in trouble for it.

After the class ended, we called her the teacher from hell. I compared her to Umbridge, and we were all glad it ended. It was horrible. We insulted her behind her back, just like the people in HP did to Snape. Argh.

** My current history professor. He's incredibly old, his teaching is horrendous, and no one pays any attention to his lectures. I've actually nicknamed him Binns, but only one person IRL has gotten the reference so far.
