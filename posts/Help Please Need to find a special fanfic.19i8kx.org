Hello. I was a big fan of Sugar Quill and other HP fanfiction sites about 8 years ago. I read this one very long, very well written fan fiction that was about Harry Potter post Hogwarts, and it was completed long before the last book was published. I read it so long ago I can't find it, don't know exactly what to look for, but I remember it being really special and would love to find it again. Thanks for your help!

Things I Can Remember: Harry is living in London. He is an auror, Ron and Hermione are together, possibly aurors too. Harry is single. Harry has a son, or has adopted a son, or maybe just looks after a boy who is very young. The boy lives with an elederly woman in secret, but Harry visits him. The boys mother is Angelina Johnson's biological son (I think) and she is no longer alive. Harry has a love interest, I am assuming it's Ginny but it could be someone else..The story has multiple chapters, very long.

I'm sorry I don't have more to go on, but if you have read anything similar please let me know. Thank you so much!


** Slight spoilers ahead:

I was going to guess it could be [[http://heckyeahdrarry.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/reparations-and-foundations.html][Reparations and it's sequel Foundations by Sara's Girl.]] In the sequel, Harry becomes responsible for Romilda Vane's young son, whom he places with Narcissa Malfoy and visits.

But there are too many differences on reflection unless you think you could be remembering a mash-up of fictions. There is no secrecy about the child, Harry is a doctor, not an auror, and Draco, who works in a drug rehab ward, is his love interest. Still, it's a good read.

** Just a thought, might want to try posting on [[/r/harrypotter]] or [[/r/tipofmytongue]] (? maybe?)as well as there is a much higher level of readership there.
