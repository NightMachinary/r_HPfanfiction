:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Been looking for an older fic but the only thing I remember from it was Harry giving an answer to this question. His answer was very much NSFW on the flying solo point.

Pretty sure it was time travel, the one I remember. If there are any others, I'd like to read them, too.

** It strongly breaks rule 8 (a rape of child), so I won't be linking it here. Put Arthur's question into Internet search.

*** While the answer itself was meant to be a bit of a joke, possibly a trolling answer (that it happens at a table in front of Molly is another point), there was nothing of that sort. It was on ffn, but I can't remember which one it was. Pretty sure Hermione was there, but I could be misremembering.

Also, looked at that one, and no. It's not what I'm looking for.
