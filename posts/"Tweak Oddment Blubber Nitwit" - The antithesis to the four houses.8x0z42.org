Tweak: Changed, or being forced to change (Slytherin?)

Oddment: Being the "odd one out" (Hufflepuff?)

Blubber: Being useless (Gryffindor?)

Nitwit: Being stupid (Ravenclaw?)

--------------

I could, of course, be overthinking this. I probably am, actually. However, the only one that doesn't fit /particularly/ great is Tweak, for Slytherin. Though, I suppose, if you consider most Slytherins to be "traditionalists", then it makes a bit more sense. The others are pretty spot on.

If you can get on this train with me and imagine that that was, indeed, the purpose for him spouting those words at the beginning of Harry's first year, /why/ would he say such a thing? To what purpose?

EDIT: Accidentally marked Slytherin a second time under Nitwit instead of Ravenclaw. Whoops.

***** It's a common in fanon that the Trace is on someone's wand, despite canon being explicit about it being on the person, although the fanon interpretaitons probably predate the word 'Trace' that occurred first in Deathly Hallows.

#+begin_quote
  “Second problem: You're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.”

  “I don't --“

  “The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will the Death Eaters.”
#+end_quote

(An example of the Trace being on Harry is the Marge Dursley incident; the Ministry got wind of it soon enough, despite Harry being in a different room than his wand.)

As for Tom Riddle: it was an Unforgivable (which may have interfered with it), it was 49 years before /Dobby's Warning/, they had a suitable suspect with the smoking gun on him and a confession (case closed probably before they even saw the report from the misuse of magic office), and it happened far away from Wool's Orphanage in London.

Also in the sixth book:

#+begin_quote
  “But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily “He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”

  “You are quite right --- they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by ---”
#+end_quote

If he used his uncle's wand to avoid being caught here, then Dumbledore would have said that here.

****** Dumbledore doesn't seem to think what he is saying there... If the trace was on him, the aurors would have arrested Riddle even if they didn't know for sure it was him.. after all, they had proof that an unforgivable had been used in his presence and murders committed. Also any following investigation would show his connection with the Riddle's and their history which will stablish the motive.

My headcanon is that registered wands are connected to some countrywide ward, it shows all magic near underage wands and unforgivables, and perhaps also emotionally charged magic? It may explain their ability to respond quickly to accidental magic.

******* They knew that underage magic was done in Riddle Manor, and that it was avada kedavra (or not even that if the trace doesn't recognise unforgivables). Tom Riddle Jr didn't live on Riddle Manor, but they would probably have followed his trail if Morfin hasn't confessed as easily.

Remember that Harry was always caught in the vicinity of Privet Drive, where no other wizard lived. (And accidental magic is even more dangerous before they get their wands.)

If you stretch that headcanon a bit, it might be that ward that actually places the trace on magical births, even before they're named.

***** The Trace is on people's wand, not their person --- though it can only detect magic within the vicinity of the wand, whether or not it's coming /from/ that particular wand. This is why Tom Riddle used his uncle's wand for the Riddle murders.

I am pretty sure you're just assuming this, when the more likely explanation is that he just wanted to plant evidence on his uncle.

It would be pretty hard to convict him for the murder when Morfins wand doesn't have any record of recently casting the killing curse.

*** That's funny, but doesn't fit House-Elves' naming conventions. Elvish names always end in an -y sound. (And I know what you're going to say: what about Kreacher? But I always thought that Kreacher was a special case: the Blacks despised him so much they just called him "creature" when they had to refer to him, and the poor Stockholm-Syndromed old fool took it as his name.)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
