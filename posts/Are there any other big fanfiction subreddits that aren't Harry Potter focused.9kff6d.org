I found this subreddit on a random comment on [[/r/harrypotter]] years ago. Are there any subreddits like this but for other communities?


** Naturally -

for example those two I check on from time to time:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsFanFiction/]]

​

Granted, most are not as active as this one here, and some even died a rather sudden death, but they have some good threads nevertheless.

​

-edited some typos

*** Technically for Pact and Twig, too, but it seems like nobody's even read those, much less written fanfic for them.

**** It's the exception that proves the rule, but might I point you towards Familiar, a Worm/Pact crossover? (Assuming you haven't already ran across it.)

** The Game of Thrones one and the Mass Effect one exist, but they are practically dead. No one answers request threads there. So if you are into those fandoms, save yourself the trouble and disappointment and don't bother.

** While it's not very big and I just started it, [[/r/DBHfanfiction][r/DBHfanfiction]] is a thing. It's for Detroit: Become Human if you're interested. :)
