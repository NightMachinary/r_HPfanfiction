I have the most vivid memories of reading Roman Holiday and its sequels in the trilogy YEARS ago. Some of the best Hermione characterization of aaaaall time. I saw a post from a year ago that linked to a .zip file that's no longer active. Anyone able to relink a version of it, or know how to access the archived version from Witchfics.org?

THANK YOU!

Might want to save a copy for yourself though, just in case it vanishes from there, too.
