It was not just Lily who went to Hogwarts, but Petunia as well. While Lily was being chased around my James Potter, Petunia had time to see what was really going on in this war torn wizarding world. She realized that if she stayed in the wizarding world, there was a good chance that she or Lily died. She goes to the muggle world and marries Vernon Dursley, least likely to be Voldemort's spy. She tries to get Lily to leave with her, but Lily cares too much about her infatuation with James Potter, who is fighting in the war. When Lily dies and Harry is left in their hands, she tries to keep magic away from Harry not because she hates magic, but because she doesn't want to lose Harry like she did Lily.


** I realize this was a prompt and not a request, but Petunia's Letter linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11676102/chapters/26278335]]), is the only work I know where Petunia is magical, but she isn't aware of it until adulthood.

** In the Language of Flowers is a good fic that follows a witch Petunia with Lily being a muggle.
