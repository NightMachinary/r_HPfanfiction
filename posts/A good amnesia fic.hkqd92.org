I know, I know, it's super clich√©, but I'm a sucker for this trope! So, does anyone know a good story in which Harry loses his memories?


** linkao3(Gone Was Any Trace Of You by annerb) incredible fic. I especially loved Ginny's characterization throughout this.

  Draco's life after the war is everything he wanted it to be: it's simple, and quiet, and predictable, and safe. But when a mysterious curse shatters the peace he'd worked so hard to build, there's only one person he can trust to help him. After all, Harry Potter has saved his life before. Now Draco has to believe that Potter will be able to do it one more time. (A remix of If the Sun Goes Black by pasdexcuses)

** I remember one where Harry was living as a Muggle with no memory of the Wizarding World, until a woman from the series comes and flirts with him (possibly Ginny, possibly Luna, I really don't recall) and eventually reveals the big amnesia twist. No idea what it was called, but it was quite interesting.

** linkffn(You're My Density by RobSt). Harry had his magic bound, was obliviated, and sent to live as a muggle after his trial. Hermione finds him and they go back in time. Harry's magic gets unlocked, but his memories don't.

linkffn(The Shock of it All by Fairywm). Harry loses his memory and spends a week living on the London streets before he's found.

linkffn(APOCALYPSO by Grinning Lizard). Very strange, but good.

  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Some bashing, but not stupidly so. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.
