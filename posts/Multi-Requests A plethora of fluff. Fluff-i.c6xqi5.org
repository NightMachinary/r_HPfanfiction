I've just finished Holly at Hogwarts, and quite frankly had a hard time putting it down. Are there any Dudley-has-a-magical-kid fics like that?

I'm also searching for fluffy, long, well thought out ficus, preferably with no Weasley bashing, very little Dumbledore interactions, and little romance. I guess if Harry had a normal Hogwarts experience and there was no Dark Lord?

Also, and happy Weasley family fics. :) I love reading about how they interact. I read Percy Take the Wheel and loved it. (I just tried hard to not think of Moly and Arthur's fates)

There was also a fic about Luna and the diary that was absolutely hilarious that I really liked, so I guess any fluffy Luna, non-romantic fics would also be wonderful.

Any light Draco stories that aren't filled with misery and suffering would be nice.

Snape raising Harry, Snape existing in a world where it's not out to get him would be nice as well. Light and fluffy. Humorous.

Also, any Hogwarts professor fics would be fun. The ones where you get to see how they interact. Usually they're pretty funny in my opinion, so if you have any, please let me know? Especially if it's the year they're dealing with Umbridge.

Thank you so much for reading to the end, I know it was quite a few requests. I'm hoping It will save me from having to post several times. If you've seen a theme, you'd be correct, there is one. I'm not looking for an abused Harry or hurt/comfort, or anything particularly dark. Most anything long and compelling is awesome! Anything complete is even better. I've tread quite a few fics on ff and ao3, so any other site would be a welcome introduction.

Anyways, thank you!!
