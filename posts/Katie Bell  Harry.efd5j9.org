Looking for good fics which have Harry Katie pairing. Ideally the pairing would also... Yanno... Make sense from a character development point of view

**** Ah, well. I said that because in Cadmean Victory Harry and Katie's relationship is a very prominent part of the story, and much of it revolves around it. Spoiler warning: the actual pairing is not them, but their relationship was portrayed in such a way that it actually felt genuine. I actually like Katie's rendition in that story and left me wanting more from her. On the other hand, Harry's personality is a bit over the top in this fic, so I don't know if that's a deal breaker for you. Your call, I guess. I'll link it in case you haven't read it and want to check it out.

******* I've toyed with the idea of writing such a fic, but it is very difficult to come up with a character for her that isn't "Ginny, but better", "Hermione, but more social" or "Cho without her emotional issues". Writing her as a friend isn't that difficult, but giving her meaningful depth for a love interest is difficult without coming across as one-uping an existing character.

******** I don't understand that line of thinking very well.

To me, Katie is a perfect partner for a love interest that checks some major boxes:\\
* She's within an acceptable age range for Harry (one year older than him)\\
* She's got an excuse to have been around Harry and possibly friends with him several years before the romance begins, due to being on the Gryffindor Quidditch team since his first year.\\
* She's not a complete blank slate but she has enough unknown about her that it gives the writer plenty of room to write their own story without being hamstrung by canon characterization. We know that she likes Quidditch and is good at it, we know she's friends with Leanne, Angelina, and Alicia, and we know she joined the DA.\\
* She's in Gryffindor, which makes it easy for Harry to come across her during outside of Quidditch even though she doesn't share any classes with him.\\
* There is plenty of time for them to bond, since they are both new to the Quidditch team and could therefore be subject to good-natured hazing from the older members (unless you roll with the throwaway comment from Lee Jordan in PS in which he mentions that Katie was on the Gryffindor "reserve" team the previous year).\\
* She has endured the hardships of Oliver Wood grueling practices along with Harry, which can be a fantastic catalyst for them to bond.

She's not "Ginny but better" because she doesn't have to be like Ginny other than liking Quidditch and being in Gryffindor. Who says she has to have a similar personality to Ginny? She's not "Hermione, but more social" because other than the fact that she's a woman and she's in Gryffindor, what do they have in common? And she certainly doesn't have to be "Cho without her emotional issues" because Cho isn't friends with Harry before their romance starts, and again, her personality doesn't have to match Cho's at all.

********* If you write her to be smart and/or a muggleborn, you'll be accused of writing a sporty/hot Hermione substitute. If you base their relationship on Quidditch, well, "Pretty Quidditch Girl" is the reason why Harry was into Cho. If you make Katie a pureblood, you'll be accused of Ginny, but not poor. And how do I get to those conclusions? Just read one of the threads where people rant about Daphne or OCs. Or any of the shipping war posts (mostly on other platforms) where that is the kind of argument used.

Don't get me wrong, the set up for the relationship with Katie would be different, and you are right when you point out the unique ways you could start their relationship. At the same time, Quidditch is a little tricky since there's no season in book 4 and Harry is banned by Umbridge in 5. Before that, you can lie the groundwork for a friendship, but, let's be real here, most 15 year old girls aren't into younger boys. You can alter the ages a bit so that Katie is just three weeks older than Hermione, but I still feel like that's still an obstacle. Of course, you could just have Katie pull Harry away and make out with him while the Weasleys are banned by Umbridge or similar shenanigans, but that is still a lot more complex than setting up other ships.

Not all criticism is worth speaking of.

I smell an opportunity for Harry to bond with his Quidditch teammates outside of the pitch. I can just see Harry, already good friends with Katie and Fred and George, asking (or accepting) help from his teammates in preparing him for the tournament tasks. Bonus points if Angelina takes a leadership role, because she probably did some preparing already just in case she was chosen to be a Triwizard Champion.

A fantastic opportunity for some friction in the relationship. Katie, rightfully, points out to Harry that his anger issues are hurting his friends and his teammates. This would be a great place for Harry to mature and mend the issues he's caused in his relationships, particularly the one with Katie.

#+end_quote

That is often the case. I can speak from personal experience that it is not /always/ the case, however. Plus, who said there has to be a romantic relationship between them until Harry is 15 or older? I can see Katie dating another person or two while she's 14-15, and Harry struggling with feelings of jealousy while also trying to be her friend. Cue Harry finally realizing that he has feelings for Katie.

#+end_quote

It's not complex enough to be an obstacle, in my opinion. And there are many opportunities for Harry to have a friendship with Katie throughout his time at Hogwarts, so making the transition to a romantic relationship shouldn't be so difficult. It offers so many opportunities for the author to go outside the canon text without leaving it behind. To perhaps forge a channel from the lake of the canon text to another lake of the author's devising.

******** I don't know what you said wrong here. Blank slate characters are compared to prominent canon characters all the time. People have taken umbrage with a super smart Daphne Greengrass, even in stories without Hermione bashing.

** There are significant amounts of Katie/Harry request posts going back YEARS (at least 1 a week it feels like), and still very few authors have chosen to explore it despite the demand.

Kind of boggles my mind, even with the "excuses" that shes just a Ginny replacement with a different name (I strongly disagree with this sentiment myself). Still... beggers cant be chosers and so unless I am willing to write one I cant complain at the lack of them lol. Maybe I will try my hand at some point, but I still have to finish the other 2 I was writing that I abandoned when I got a cancer diagnosis due to time constraints and simply having too much brain fog to really focus on it and do them justice.

  Saving the Philosopher's Stone opened Harry's eyes to a greater spectrum. Sometimes, all it takes for someone to grow is a dash of trust and a dollop of inspiration. Harry returns for his fourth year amidst the threat of the Dark Lord and a veil long parted---and his eyes are full of stars.
