** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4799264/1/Blind-Faith][Blind Faith]] is a canon compliant fic focused on hypothetical off-screen moments in the lives of the Death Eaters after their breakout from Azkaban. It mainly follows Beltatrix's POV but also has a few POV segments for Narcissa, Draco, Rodolphus, etc.

**** I know it has something to do with romance, and dolohovs wife. I think it's a tragedy? I know that's not much to go on, sorry bro.
