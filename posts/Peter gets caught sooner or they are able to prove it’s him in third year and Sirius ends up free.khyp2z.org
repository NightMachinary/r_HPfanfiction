Any good ones where they either catch Peter sooner or in third year are able to prove Sirius is innocent and get him free?

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  So this is Big Time Rush with a female Kendell. There are a few changes but it's still fairly close to the actual show. There are things added and there are things that are taken out. I'm still currently working on this so updates will be sporadic. The only reason I have time now to write this because school is shut down due to COVID-19. I hope everyone stays safe. Warnings apply!

** There is an ongoing fic written by Breanie where Sirius is freed when Harry is 6. It's A Second Chance. Has all the canon pairings. The fic is already 2 million long and deviates a lot from Canon.

*** I started reading it, but wasn't enjoying it as much as Innocent, which has a somewhat similar premise (except that Sirius escaped with accidental magic, rather than being officially freed).
