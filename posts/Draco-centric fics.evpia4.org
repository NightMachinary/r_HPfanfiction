Draco Malfoy and Severus snape are my favorite characters in the Hp world, but right now i'm on a Draco binge.

Any good fics (preferably on Ao3) that revolve around him starting to question things? Or turning to the light.

There's this one prompt that I really wanted to see written well, where Draco joins the order. I've been working on a fic with that myself, but it'd be interesting to see how someone else makes it.
