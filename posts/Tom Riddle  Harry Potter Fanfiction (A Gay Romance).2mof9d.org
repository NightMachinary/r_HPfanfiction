** Okay, two things I noticed:

a) why are they sleeping in the same room? Did I miss something? If Tom is a prefect, he's in year 5. If it takes place during prisoner of askaban, Harry is in year 3. Why would he sleep in the same room as a 5th year student? I doubt that Slytherin puts all students together in one big room.

b)

#+begin_quote
  I mean, he's literally pressuring Harry into having sex, in a school
#+end_quote

He's literally pressuring Harry*, a 13 year old,* into having sex, in a school.

That's one thing I really can't stand in a lot of romance stories. Or even those that only have romance as a secondary element. People forgetting that those aren't young adults at university, but teenagers, from 11 to 17, so that if you take a time at the beginning or the middle.. there shouldn't be much in the way of romance going on. That Tom doesn't care.. yeah, I can see that. And it would certainly fit the "dark, sick" part. But.. yeah...

Edit: But in that regard, it wouldn't be too surprising if Harry isn't too good at defending himself. If no one believes him, not even Hermione, and Tom is two years older physically, has two more years of magical education, etc.. and Harry is a more or less innocent (he has already seen evil things, but the first two books were the most harmless or at least made it out to be harmless, no matter how dangerous everything really would have to have been) thirteen year old. How would you have handled something like that at that age?

**** Keep cool. I never said that you were a bad person. But maybe that's just me, but underage isn't all the same for me. Thinking back to school at that age, I think that 15 is a suitable age for romance that goes beyond holding hands and a quick peck on the lips. (That would be 14, 4rth year and onwards was allowed (except as dates) to the Yule ball, so that seems to also match JRKs aka the teachers view on when the students start to have something like relationships.

If it were just the "Tom is sexually harrassing Harry, maybe even rapes him" (and I'd still consider it rape in a way even if Harry tells him to do it because he wouldn't be doing it of his own free will really) plot. Yeah okay. But if you somehow want to turn it into a romance.. Eh, well, see the paragraph above. I don't take 13-year-old-relationships serious. None of the "relationships" classmates had at that age were "real"/what you'd call a relationship.

And yes, of course there /are/ those teenage mothers and fathers, so there have to be young teens that are sexually active, and you only hear about those that were irresponsible, so only see the bad examples that make the whole thing look bad but.. I don't know. I can't even really explain but, but somehow 15 seems to be the border for me where I stop thinking of them as children but adolescents (avoiding the word teenager for the obvious reason).

For the analysis: Started with that. Just takes a lot more time to type out than "first thoughts".

****** Hm, I'm not seeing that, so please help me out. If you mean the "dark, sick" part, well, that's just what you said yourself.

#+begin_quote
  Yes, I recognize that this is a sick idea, so I want the story to be sick as well. A Dark, sick, gay romance.
#+end_quote

Otherwise, I thought I made it clear that that's a common problem with Harry Potter fanfiction (I see it often in independent Harry stories because for some reason that seems to mean "totally grown up with 11" often).

If it is because of the added, bold part in the quoted sentence, that was partly in regard to the according question, how can he not get in trouble for that. Not getting in trouble for doing that to someone his age "boys will be boys" mentality. Teachers ignoring it when it's a 13 year old.. much harder to justify.

And for the not taking it serious part: Then it can't really be a romance, if Harry isn't really old enough for a real relationship. Yes, I know that's just my personal thinking. Everything else, the whole Harry guesst pressured into something he doesn't want etc works fine, but I can't see real romance at that age. So, suppose for me it depends on if you want to turn it around from pressure to romance or not.

Oh and people not believing someone to be involved with someone and not believing a child if it says "that guy is sexually harrassing me" is quite a difference.

Hm, feel like I'm repeating myself, maybe I should go at it with more sturcture instead of responding paragraph by paragraph, but oh well. The Tom "hunts down" a 13 year old thing? Not for me, but it would fit Tom so, okay. And that would be the forbidden thing about the age, the sexuality part. That's not my "problem". It's the romance that you were talking about that you want to somehow evolve it into that's my problem. I don't think there's anything forbidden about a 13 year old telling someone that they love him/her etc, because, well romance != sexuality and all that. And I don't think 13 year olds are able to have a serious relationship, completely ignoring the sexuality part. Sooo it doesn't really have anything to do with what is forbidden. Maybe I'm not good at explaining it. But yeah, that's why I don't see it as an easy way out, because it is less about a way "out" of something forbidden and more about giving Harry the mental capacities to form a real relationship. (But if you go with a more stockholm syndrom approach to the romance, so that it isn't a real romance but Harry /thinks/ it is or some stuff.. well, that would work no matter the age)

I'm writing too much. Yes, I have problems getting to the point. And yes, I know it doesn't really matter what I think anyway :D

(Edit: And is it just me or are people that downvote a discussion post without saying why strange? Just noticed it.

And another edit: Saying you are sick because you want to write about something in your story that's sick would be like saying that JKR thinks that genocide is okay because she thought up a character who wants do that. Authors can write about things that they don't want to happen in real life, funny, right? ;) )

******** Just a short response, gotten pretty late but I had to take a last look. I started going through the questions [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2mof9d/tom_riddle_harry_potter_fanfiction_a_gay_romance/cm69vwi][here]], probably got lost. This branch did get a bit.. confusing. And yes, it's still not complete because the big questions are.. not that easy to answer.

Concerning the downvoting: Well, the discussion has 0 points with 40% positive or however that is calculated. I don't know, I just.. if someone thinks the idea is totally stupid, they should just say it, right? Commentless downvoting is so.. unhelpful.

Oh, yeah, the help me out... What sounded so offensive in my initial post? Cause it wasn't meant to be, so it would be good to know what word choice or.. whatever exactly did it.

How far you can go... I don't know if there are rules for that kind of thing, wouldn't surprise me. Otherwise.. if you can bring yourself to write it, there probably is at least one person willing to read it. Because yes, there are a lot of people who read some really really strange things. The easy way would be to just not go into detail about it, but as you already said that you want to push it as far as you can, that's not really the solution.

Maybe you should ask [[http://www.reddit.com/user/morethanexist][\u\morethanexists]] (prop better in a pm) where they would abandon the story, since they already said they want to read it.

**** I don't think it's generally a horrible idea. And as mentioned, a lot of fanfiction somehow ignores how old the characters really are, so you are definitely not alone with that problem. Are there more reasons for using book three aside from "there is a time turner in use"? An accident in that one room in the department of mysteries with the time turners could do that as well and would explain why something goes really wrong. Harry would have even more reason to hate Tom at that point I suppose, so that could be a problem? But he and Hermione would still think "we left friends in a bad situation" so that would still be there. That would make Harry 15 like Tom, solving both the sleeping arrangement and why nobody gives a damn about what a 15 year old says. "Oh, he likes Tom but Tom isn't gay so he tries to make him look bad" or something feels more like something one would say to a 15 year old than a 13 year old. I don't know, 15 year olds aren't that innocent anymore I suppose, at least in their head. Or that's what I always seem to think.

And I'll keep thinking about it.

**** Sooooo going at it a question at a time :D

1: Idea: not too bad, already read much more twisted things so.. yeah, why not. I'm not all that for dark and crazy etc, but a lot of people seem to be so I think they are better suited for talking about the core story idea. And what idea I didn't like.. the 13 year old.

2: Reading: Depends on if you keep going with Book 3 as the starting point. The one where you start off, or more preciesly the chapter where you start of so that you have the beginning right. And for Tom's background, I suppose book 2 for the diary-time-jump and book 6 for the information Dumbledore gives Harry via the memories. If you move it to the fifth book to close the age difference, I suppose taking a good look at the ressurrection scene wouldn't hurt as that would be something Harry would probably think about. Also everything Voldemort has since done in book 5. (So, some things depend on when they leave as that would affect what Harry knows, and for background 2 and 6 are the only ones I can think of)

3: Well, the dark version would be if Harry developes something along the lines of the stockholm syndrome I guess, so it wouldn't be real love. The not dark version would be if one of them influences the other. They do have some similarities, so either Tom could make Harry see that his way of dealing with a bad childhood is the right one, or Harry teaches Tom. So there are possibilities. To make them believable would be your job :D

4: I suppose the other intersting question is: what would keep Tom interested in Harry after Harry gave up and let Tom have his way with him. The way you describe him, he'd just lose interest at that point. I'm doing a bit of brainstorming here, so not everything will fit together, just random ideas. So not only: Why would Harry be interested to repeat it, but also why would Tom. Harry could decide to reverse it to get revenge, he gave in, Tom swore to leave Hermione in peace, he is evil but at that point not above keeping his word so Harry starts to pressure Tom, after all he doesn't really have anything to lose anymore. That keeps Tom's interest and he wants to manipulate Harry into thinking he has control while he himself is still in control or some such messed up scheme, and somehow that makes them end up in a "kinda as if they were in a relationship" way, except that they are /not/, it's just what it looks like, and gives them time to really get to know each other. Maybe. As I said, I'm brainstorming. No real barrier between brain and keyboard.

And I don't have time for the others right now, except

7: Yes and I wouldn't want to read a romance of a 13 year old with a 16 year old. (Or a romance of a 13 year old with a 13 year old) Yes, Tom not caring about that would be believable, the teachers not looking after someone so young wouldn't. If Harry is 15, 16 himself, it's much more likely that they brush it off as teenagers having relationship problems.

since I already answered that anyway. Will be back later after thinking about it some more.

** First things first, I want to read this fic.

Question: Did the time turner plop them at the exact start of the year? How were they sorted if they are 13? I'm sure there are ways around this, but it's a bit strange.

**** I think to some extent it would depend on the tone you set within the story. I don't really think this could be done with the "fade-out" because the details here are potentially important to the plot. You can sort of fudge it by not getting into the nitty gritty and more going with Harry's reactions and feelings about what's going on.

As far as harassment, I think the more you can stay away from physical stuff until it's absolutely needed the better off you are. Verbal abuse will take you far here, as would Harry finding notes or drawings from Tom in his own personal stuff. How did that get there? Who put it there and then the slow realization that it was Tom. Maybe it's self destroying or something so when he tries to show someone, it burns a hole in his pocket.

Obviously this is a niche story. It wont have a huge audience, but if it's well written enough and tagged correctly, you can find the handful people who would be interested.

****** I think the key part in this is the "until it's needed" part. Obviously you need to go into details, but the longer you wait to do that the better off you are. I agree that it's a difficult line to walk, and honestly, I don't know how much more I can say to sway in either direction. I'm not sure what the line is. That's something you need to decide.

As to your other comment, the reason I'm interested is because it's so different from cannon. Sure it's good to see in between scenes and AU's where a few things are a little bit different, but the fact that really weird, off-the-wall stuff like this can exist is why I read fanfiction to begin with.

******** It may be common in some circles, but I've never run into it before. Which may just be a factor of how I look for stories. I usually have an idea in mind of what I'm looking for a narrow down the search to those types and it's never crossed my mind to search for this before.

Honestly, as the writer it's up to you to decide what those boundaries are. I can't and won't do it for you. You're the one who has to spend the most time with it and you're the one who's going to need to be comfortable putting it out in public. If you want to get into the nitty gritty details then go for it. If you don't then don't. There will be an audience for both versions assuming it's well done.
