Hey guys new to this community, so this is one of those requests where I have super vague memories about a fic and you guys get really frustrated at the lack of detail.

All I really remember is that Harry is classified as a savant by some outside party, I vaguely remember it being a teacher OC? Anyways someone, either the teacher man or Harry may or may not have had a panther animagus. The teacher was somewhat close to Harry but also like a savant or a member of savants that the government was keeping track of so I think this man had ulterior motives.

There might have been another school involved other than Hogwarts and it may have been the Triwizard tournament but I am not sure. I keep thinking America for some reason.

Anyway this request is incredibly vague so I hope I don't cause you guys too much trouble sorry lmao

Thanks guys lmao


** Maybe you're getting some fanfics mixed up because I know one where he is classified as a Runic Savant by his Runes teacher and has a shadow panther animagus.
