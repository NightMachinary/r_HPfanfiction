** I don't remember how long ago it was now, I read so many HP fics, but this thread made me think of this one. All I really remember about it was that the war was over and Hermione goes to find her parents to restore their memories only to discover they died in a car accident a short while after moving. She is left wondering if they would have died if she hadn't sent them away.

** What would the be assholes about?

Hermione removing 18 years of memories, and then forcibly moving them away from their lives? (They were practicing dentists, which means they were partners in or owned a clinic, what happened to that? And then the one in Australia?) Ron being too stupid to pass a driving test without having to confound the instructor? (He's old enough to have kids going to Hogwarts at this point, remember). Ron having no NEWTs, which means he's stuck as an Auror? That works for Harry, but he wasn't even supposed to live past Voldemort.

Can't imagine why they would be assholes.

*** I was thinking more of a school set story where they are a couple of snobby pricks who look down on Ron for being poor ( We don't know their canon personalities so we can't say they're not like this )

****** It was sarcasm. I honestly think Hermione was a poorer daughter than they were as parents.

I'm sorry, but I must correct you. They met the Weasleys in CoS in Diagon Alley. Arthur and Mr. Granger got along swimmingly, explaining how things from each of their worlds worked. Of course, there's a big distinction between befriending somebody and letting them marry your daughter. And I've never met a father who thought their son-in-law was good enough for their daughter.

*** They seem nice and normal in the 3 sentences about them. Hermione just seems like a bad daughter.
