:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
UPDATE: By sheer dumb luck I fucking found it again and I wasn't even looking for it decided to update for those that wanted to read the fic too.

linkffn( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7716458/2/Tom-Riddle-and-the-Snorelacks]])

I don't remember what it was called but I do remember some about the story;

It was an accidentally time travel story with Harry who landed in the 40's or 60's/70's at Hogwarts and he caused some damage to the ground but was other wise fine I think? I think he broke his wand though and so Dumbledore and the other's went over to where Harry landed were just like who the heck are you and Harry just start up told them that he was a time traveler but they were not buying it thinking that Harry was lying and were just like no seriously who are you?and so to pay for the damages that Harry had done to Hogwarts he got tricked into teaching at the school, it was either the DADA or Divination position. Harry telling them that he was a time traveler and the others not believing him kind of became a running joke in the story. If any of this is familiar to you I would like your help finding this again. Thanks!

  Harry becomes the Divination teacher in the 1940s and takes Tom on a field trip. This is crack. Nuff said.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

*** No it wasn't that. Harry didn't really time travel in that more forceful dimension travel. Thanks for the help though really appreciate it.
