Think Groundhog Day, except a little longer. Which year it is is up to you. (3rd or 4th is what I'd choose.)

Basically, Harry has to repeat the week, until Voldemort is dead, for good. This includes destruction of all of the horcruxes.


** Step 1 - Go through the maze, grab the cup, get traumatized, go back, reset.

Step 2 - Freak the fuck out, flail around being useless, deny deny deny, holy shit. Reset

Step 3 - Ok, this is really happening. Tell Dumbledore everything; Moody = Death Eater, cup = portkey, Voldemort = gross and stupidly vulnerable.

Step 4 - Dumbledore took too long, Today Harry Learned there's a time limit on this shit. Fuck. Reset.

Step 5 - Repeat, this time mention the time limit. Relax for a few days until Dumbledore comes and says that copious amounts of veritaserum and one vulnerable Voldemort adds up to a rather anticlimactic victory. Oh, and Sirius' exoneration is next week.

 

Sorry, I'm lazy.

  Harry has been living the day of the battle for more than thirty years. But today is different. Today is the day he unmakes all of Tom Riddles' foul works, saving Britain, saving those who would have died and maybe just maybe those who already have.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
