** I dont think so, like there are fics that are good and there are fics that have Harry as the master of death and/or the head of multiple houses and super rich. But in all the years I have read Harry Potter fanfiction there wasn't any fic that was both.

** Check out my collection! [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fapnkx/master_of_deathharry_excel_collection_help/]]

If you're new to the trope, I would have started with "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15695769][Dead things]]" and "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]". Those are short, gen and so very good. Then if you want really other-worldly Harry and a very interesting plot, try "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321][October]]" (and other works by this author. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus]]" is really good and popular). As for personified Death, check out "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16594244/chapters/38889167][Spoonful of Sugar]]". If you want something bigger and lighter, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10218541][As good as Death]]" is a good one. Harry is Death in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852][On a Pale Horse]]", "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11305455][Boredom is Deadly]]" and "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5936137/chapters/13650778][Be the Death of me]]" (though that last one is not everyone's cup of tea)

As for "/and head of multiple houses/", try "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18146660/chapters/42909539][The Graveyard Is Empty Because The Ghosts Are In My Head]]" and maybe "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4608235/1/It-All-Started-With-A-Visit-To-Gringotts][It All Started With A Visit To Gringotts]]".

If you don't want just links but a short comment from me for each of these recs and elaboration on how exactly Harry is the master of death in these (be it immortal necromancer or sorting mortals after their death or summoning Death to do his bidding), go check my collection ;)

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Death is omnipotent. As such, it should be of no surprise that they're able to retain the memories of various universes, or multiple timelines and lives lived. Because of this, everything is different, and yet very much the same. Death will only allow one mortal to Lord over them. It just so happens that this universe's Harry Potter needs a more...hands on approach. ----aka that AU where Death becomes a parental figure for a young mute Harry.

  War was never something that was finished in a day, but for Harry Potter, his life seemed to fall apart in one.Death's master was not a title anyone would want if they knew the consequences, but Harry didn't know this, being busy with his trying to stay alive in the midst of a war.So when the Hallows claim him as their Master, what's he to do but go a little insane?

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
