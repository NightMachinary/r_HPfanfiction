It's my headcanon that the reason Slughorn had his students work under the "wrong" instructions in HBP was because he never knew what a shitty teacher Snape was. I think that when Slughorn thought he would have gone over all the theory of hows and whys of potions so that he could expect all the NEWT students to know that you crush the bean or how to stir the potion.


** It doesn't make sense: why would then Slughorn use (and didn't warn his students) knowingly faulty textbooks?

** Slughorn taught the standard way (and so did Snape). What he did wasn't exactly 'wrong' than it was the norm. Also, don't forget that Slughorn was known to praise experimentation, as he did when Harry added a bit of peppermint to his potion one lesson.

(Headcanon) I wouldn't be surprised if Slughorn's teaching style helped to further encourage Snape to experiment back in the day, in addition to Snape's own curiosities and talents.

Snape's notes came about from years of experimenting and talent. His was the optimal way, but not the /only/ way.

** Also what Snape did to his book was VERY ILLEGAL. Any idiot with enough concentration could have gotten his hands on it and brew dangerous potions like Drought of Living Death, Veritaserum, Amortentia, Polyjuice, Felix... Hell the euphoria potion seems like magical LSD and Harry brewed it perfectly.

*** The act of making notes in the margin is not illegal.\\
But it is highly irresponsible and dangerous.
