** Best idea would be something like the Centipede's Dilemma - trick someone into thinking so hard about how they do magic that they lose the ability to do so.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717563/1/The-Lord-in-the-Mist][The Lord in the Mist]] contains /The Matrix Aeternitatis/ which would count as a 'cognitohazard.' Reading the book allows it to infect the readers mind/soul. linkffn(12717563)

#+begin_quote
  Part 3 of 'The Wandering Devil'. The year is 1996. The Second Wizarding War is in mid-swing. A traveller from another dimension is searching for a forbidden text. Forced to work with Dumbledore the traveller finds himself trapped between his quest and the war with Voldemort. Gods, demons and dark lords, he's seen them all before, but as reality grows thinner can anyone remain sane?

** Pretty sure canon had something like that in the Restricted Section. I don't have a copy of PS or CoS on me, but I think somewhere they had some mentions of books that would do horrible things to you. Or I'm just misremembering.
