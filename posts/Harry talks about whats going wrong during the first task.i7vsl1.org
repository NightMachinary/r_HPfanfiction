Harry invites Amelia Bones as a special person. He has something like a projector where Illusion Harry explains what went wrong the last years while the real Harry tries to figure out how to get the egg. He gets it eventually with one or two first year spells. Wingardium Leviosa I think.


** Pretty sure that's Daft Morons.
