Behaviour that doesn't match the personality of the character is often a sign for an inexperienced author and/or bad story.

But then there are stories, where this change of personality is intended.

What if Harry Potter was not so much brave as he was lazy? Bam, you get an interesting read like Harry the Hufflepuff. Neville isn't the little whimp he is, but a brave or maybe even arrogant student? Interesting new story! Draco is actually not a bad guy... okay, that one is a bit overdone (also 'not a bad guy' isn't a personality, it's the lack thereof if no new attribute gets added).

Where are the stories with an arrogant Hermione, a studeous Ron, a happy Severus, a head-in-the-clouds Harry, a shy and humble Lockhart, a naive Moody, an overanalyzing Fudge, etc. ?


** I've seen very few fics with a competent Draco. In canon, he's just a little arrogant twatwaffle with delusions of grandeur. Linkffn(an old and new world).

My favorite take on Hermione comes from jeconias' Blue Steel. The fic is a bit devoid of meaningful conflict and most all the characters are OOC, but it's still an enjoyable read. This Hermione feels like what canon should have been to me. I almost universally despise fanon Hermione, and I'm not too fond of canon's version either. This one hits it just right.

**** Her flaws are different (maybe a strength or two too), making for an overall more likeable character, imo.

I'm having a hard time phrasing this, but I guess the best way to put it is that the Hermione in this fic is more relaxed or "loosened up". The arrogance has gone away, and the nagging tone has changed from annoying to affectionate. She never really seemed to grow/change/mature in canon to me, just like Harry didn't really either. This is like what I think her personality should have become by 6th/7th year, so while I do think it's a bit early for the transformation, it is still more satisfying that the lack of growth in canon.

*** Honest question I've gotten 2 or 3 chapters into this before, I assume Ginny is introduced later on in the story since the characters I remember were Harry, Neville and a female OC. Is Ginny pro Harry or on the magical side. I've been meaning to get back into the story but stories with "bad" Ginny usually get me to stop reading.

**** Even in canon, Ginny is depicted as a rather aggressive and violent person. I wouldn't say she's 'bad' in this story, but as a senior leader of a country in war, she did terrible things.

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

*** There's probably a difference between actually being arrogant and coming off as being arrogant. I don't think Jo wrote Hermione as arrogant, especially after Harry and Ron befriend her. Draco is actually arrogant; Hermione is socially retarded and tries way too hard to impress professors and the like, which often backfires and makes other students think she's arrogant, but isn't meant to be.

That being said, there are a hell of a lot of fics where she's arrogant as all shite.
