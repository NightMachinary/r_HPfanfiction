I'm looking for stories where the Death Eaters who escaped Azkaban (mostly the Malfoys and Snape, but I'm not pickish) are tried for their crimes and end up convicted.

Also before anyone points out that that Malfoy was underage or under duress. There is no minimum age for a conviction as war criminal and the "under duress" argument would extort pretty much everyone in a (civil) war. Besides, this is a request thread and not a discussion.

Malfoy's old enough to be tried as an adult under both English and Scots law, and almost certainly would be since he's got either two or four counts of attempted murder on his indictment. That goes to the grown-up courts for everyone over eight (at the time, it's 12 in Scotland nowadays).

Duress isn't actually a defence to murder, attempted murder or treason, and where the duress arises as a result of membership in a criminal organisation it's not easily available for /any/ crime, the reasoning being that - bluntly, the decided cases on this put it a little more delicately - you brought the threats on yourself by joining the gang, you don't get to plead them now as a defence to what they had you doing.

*** I know, but I have seen that kind of argument in defence of Malfoy and even Snape around here before. Hell, it would let the whole NSDAP get away Scots Free.

*** ...and yet we get nothing to suggest draco was ever convicted, or even had a trial, meaning wizarding law ≠ muggle law. and draco didn't willingly join, he was forced to under threat for the lives of his and his family's

**** Well, wizarding and muggle law might be the same on this. After civil strife amnesties and truth-and-reconciliation deals get done and some surprisingly lenient deals get done. In real-world history the slaver aristocracy kept their wealth and the apartheid enforcers avoided jail, so the notion of a murderer (who was too incompetent to succeed at what he set out to) and terrorist (whose heart wasn't in it but joined anyway) who /should/ have spent the rest of his life in prison walking free isn't too surprising.

And willingly or not doesn't matter. You're not legally entitled to choose your own life or your family's life over someone else's.

** To be honest, the more I think about it, the more both wars felt like gang war than a real one. In the end, it's two non-country groups neither truly ever backed by the force of law. The divide between civilian and combatant is murky. Both groups take turns actively opposing law enforcement. The rites of passage as a Death Eater (Torturing, killing) as well as the tattoo is very gang-like.

​

As for Malfoy - assuming for one second that the judicial system is somewhat similar to the American one in spirit - it's possible that Harry vouched for Malfoy and went for something like jury nullification, where the jury understands that the law was broken, but either don't believe the law should be applied given the context, or that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

​

One last thing that's some what interesting to note, I wonder if the Wizarding World has laws against non-Killing-Curse murders. Any laws you actually find in the books is either to protect secrecy, or anti-Unforgiveable curses. Honor duels were totally a thing when the Ministry was founded, so it's not crazy to think that murder wasn't outlawed so these duels could take place. That said, this is all complete speculation from top to bottom.

** linkffn(The Aftermath).

It is only a 2-shot, and Snape and Malfoy's fate after the war get only a few lines of attention, but they do get their justice - Snape is executed, and Malfoy gets time in Azkaban.

  What if Hermione had accidently Disapparated along with Ron during the hunt while trying to stop him? How would Harry have managed to defeat Voldemort alone? Watch as Harry takes a bold step forward with determination and new allies. This is canon compliant until the scene where Harry and Ron fight in Book 7. Two shot -- COMPLETE
