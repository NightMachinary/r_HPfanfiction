My thread on Charms hit my brain with another thing that's totally underused in fanfiction: potions.

[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Strengthening_Solution]] Check this out. Super strength potion, canon. Imagine what other potions there are that can give you extra powers and abilities. Now just imagine somebody walking into every duel with a belt full of a dozen different potion vials.

So. Anybody able to fulfill this request? It would be seriously epic if you could.


** I can only think of a single fic where people *drink* potions during duels, but it's not very good: linkffn(12317784).

However, I've read plenty of fics where potions (and alchemical concoctions) were used as grenades or general splash weapons/AOE attacks, like linkffn(6517567). If this second type is good too, you might wanna look into fics about Dumbledore.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

** Escape uses options extensively, although it is more to used in the process of crafting artifacts that are then used in duels linkffn(11916243)

The Red Knight also uses Potions extensively for it's combats, although they are not really duels. Mostly because it is an art a time-travel r can use without ' a developed core' linkffn(12141684)

This is the concept behind fighting in Stages of Hope, although it is more of a substance abuse plot than flashy potions linkffn(6892925)
