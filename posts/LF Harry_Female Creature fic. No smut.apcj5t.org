I don't like smut, and I'm lookin for a fic that's harry/female creature. Harry can be girl too but creature person has to be. Anything else goes. Maybe she's a werewolf, maybe lizard girl or bird girl. Doesn't matter just a non-human sentient


** There's that one where Harry turns in to a dragon as a small child, and - with perfect 8-year-old-boy logic - reasons that as dragons carry off damsels he should get on that right away. The first damsel he selects is a centaur girl. No smut, because he's eight and doesn't entirely get that girls are different for a reason yet.

*** There are at least 3 different versions in 5 different places. Questionable Questing has the most current (in their SFW section). [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Check it out.]]

Forgot to mention, because he is a dragon, he is developing at that pace, meaning he will retain his emotional immaturity for a long time

**** This would explain why no amount of googling on my part would turn it up, it's been ages since I read it. And thank you for the pointer to the updated version!

** ...I guess you could try monmusu crossovers? But honey, you're gonna get smut. The first fic with any strange pairing is either actual garbage, or smut. Usually both.
