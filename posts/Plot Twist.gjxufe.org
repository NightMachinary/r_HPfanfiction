Hermoines parents are actually magic trying to live a "normal " life and come to save the golden trio when they are held by Death Eaters after they have been retrieved by the snatchers. Dobby never dies trying to help and they all make it out alive for the time being and fight the ultimate Battle of Hogwarts together.


** I know it's not the same, but I've actually found a fanfic in which hermione's parents are Elizabeth and Will from Pirates of the Caribbean and they knew about the Voldemort problem and came to help Hermione and her friends
