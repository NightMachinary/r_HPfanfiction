Listen I know most anime/hp crossover is hot garbage with terrible writing but this one, an hp/fullmetal alchemist is a) really interesting narratively b) lengthy c) well written d) funny and e) still updating so if you're interested I'd say it's totally worth it. Also it has... some significant swearing??? That's kind of Ed's thing though. If you find a lot of problems with JK's worldbuilding you'll find the humor just on point btw.
