So I write first person perspective and it seems nobody really likes that so I wonder: when you read a story in first person perspective, do you feel like you "are" the character? (if it's present tense). Does that make it too "interactive", like a choose your own adventure story? Edit: and what do you think of romance written in second person? Edit 2: So I was watching a movie and then the thought popped in my head that first person is like the found footage of fanfiction. That was when I realized for the first time: this is bad. "We were together for 10 years and had two kids. Then he met someone in Starbucks..." Oh shoot me already so I don't have to watch this fake abomination any further. It turned out sort of okay though. Sort of. Thanks for reading and if you reply


** I will read first person stories, however, in the Harry Potter fandom, I much prefer third person limited, as it's the style of the original books that I know and love. With that said...

No, I do not feel like the narrator, nor would I ever want to. I want to know what kind of character the narrator is, how he/she reacts, understand their voice. I may /relate/ to their opinions or thoughts, but never do I want it to be me. The narrator should have a strong, distinct voice that is clearly someone else. I can't even imagine how you could write a story to try to get the reader to feel like they're the narrator...

I personally do not like present tense writing. It sounds fake to my ears and I cannot really think of a work of published fiction that is written in present tense. Past tense flows better. It still drives the plot forward and feels like the action is happening as you read it.

First person stories are really hard if you're picking a defined character, like Harry, Hermione, Ron, etc. Not only do you need the dialog to sound like them, not only do their actions and behaviors need to be consistent with canon, but the entire story has to be voiced from a character that people already know. Just describing a simple scene now has to be done as the character and align with how they would describe something, instead of you as the author. You, as the author, might want to convey that Charms class is boring - but different characters will say that differently. Harry might talk about how he spent the class pretending to be practicing the assignment while talking with Ron instead. Ron could say that he never even bothered to listen to Flitwick's lecture so he had no clue what he was supposed to be doing, and didn't care. Hermione, meanwhile, might mention that the lesson was on a topic unlikely to appear on the year end exams. You can't just say the class was boring; you have to show it how your character thinks it's boring. This can be done really well, or really poorly. If the character's voice is not in line with what readers already know about them or is not fully developed, you'll lose your audience.

Hope that helps!

American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. I can't think of many, but this is the one that immediately leaps to mind, and it's well-written (though, I like this POV as well).

It's definitely a very tough POV to pull off, and there is almost no middle-ground --- the writing either sucks or it's spectacular. The latter is far less likely to happen in fanfic and I've only seen it done well a few times (Cybele's If You Are Prepared comes to mind, and I have a few issues with her portrayal of Harry, but her Snape is on point).

**** Oh, thanks for the example. Read it as a teenager, but already forgot it was in present tense. I often hear people say that they think first person fics either suck or are good. I guess third person is a safer choice, and I still doubt about my point of view (The way I meant my first person pov, was in the way that sometimes letters or articles are written down, because the characters are reading it, but not within quotation marks). Thanks for the fic example - I never read that one, but reading it is very interesting, because that way I can see in an unbiased way how first person affects a reader. And indeed, as a reader I don't think I am the main characters, because I'm not reading it aloud or something, and, well, I didn't write it. Neither do I think Cybele1 is the characters. It's clear that it's supposed to be the characters telling the story. But seeing as it's romance, I do get the "Choose your own adventure" feeling after all, without the choice. In a way that's exciting, but it's also a bit cheesy. Anyway, thanks a lot for your reply, interesting to know that there are still people who like first person pov. Still trying to make my mind up what I think about If You Are Prepared, and whether I should keep my story first person pov.

***** NP at all. I'm always willing to give a first person story a shot, because the good ones blow me away, but even as a fan of the POV it's hard to find something worth reading.

With third person, I feel like you got it right that it's a safer choice. It's more forgiving. If your character lacks a very strong voice, you can kind of paper over some of that with supporting characters, for example. In first person, even with those supporting characters around to interact with the protagonist, you're still in his/her head -- you can't escape that, and you have to therefore maintain that strong voice no matter what. There's less room for exposition as well, which authors often rely upon when writing in third person -- so you have to find other ways to convey e.g. back-story about something or even how a place looks.

*** Okay, thanks a lot for your long helpful reply, but I always thought that this was the same with third person, third persoalso reveals the character's thoughts only and is influenced by the way they see the world. But I guess it's less clear what the character's voice is and what the narrator's.

** My problem is actually that I feel like I'm being spoken to or I'm reading someone's description of things after the fact. For me, this gives me a bigger sense of disconnect from the story's events than third person; third person gives me the chance to see things happen as they evolve, which makes it easier to sink into the story. Even in published novels I prefer third person over first.

  One of the major failings is that authors use these POVs to avoid descriptive text, avoid "showing, not telling".
#+end_quote

No, that's not true, my story begins with description of the place. But I understand that it might be true in general or something. If you care to elaborate, what do you mean with doesn't need to show how that affects their actions? The fic will also about the characters' actions right? Otherwise there would be no story. Thanks for your reply.

  Everything in Harry's life is pretty terrible, all things considered. His ex-wife won't stop sleeping around, the government is broken, and his life is an endless cycle of crippling self-hatred and bitter sarcasm. So when Draco Malfoy comes sauntering back into it, sharp as a tack and twice as fit as he has any right to be, the only comfort Harry can find is that he can't possibly make it any worse. You know, probably.

****** Thanks for your reply and the example. As for myself, my story is not just lines of script and I chose first person because the story is about how the characters see the world, more than the plot because that's already known from canon. But I don't know how other people perceive that. Thanks for listing those pitfalls. Currently I'm doubting the perspective a bit.

** My issue with first person writing is that it becomes sort of like a list. I reached across the table. I did that task. I asked about that thing. To me it doesn't flow well, and it doesn't sound right. If you are a great writer then fine. But I've honestly only seen maybe 1 or 2 stories in 1st person that didn't make it seem like a list being read
