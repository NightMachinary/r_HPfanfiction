Hello! I'm looking for a completed story, I think it was Archive of Our Own. James gets put under the Imperius curse and Lily escapes with Harry. Voldemort wins for a while, and Lily works with Regulus to bring him down. I remember the story being amazing. Let me know if anyone has a link!

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
