House elves, centaurs, goblins, dwarves.... How many are there in the world? Or even just in Britain? Is it called the "Wizarding World" because wizards are the majority population and all others are minorities? Or does each species have it's own communities and they only interact with one another occassionally for business?


** There's over 100 house elves at Hogwarts and that's the most in any dwelling in Britain. Meanwhile Grimmuald Place only had one. It seems like Barty Crouch and the Malfoy's only had one as well. Not sure if that's accurate but only one is mentioned. If we're keeping with JKs estimate of there being 3,000 wizards in Britain (which I personally think is lowballing it) and the average household is about 2.5 and let's say only 20% of households have an elf... That's 240 + the ?110? at Hogwarts is at least 350 house elves in Britain.

** Super interesting points! It's hard to find info because most of the info puts wizards at the centre. There is this quote from the FBaWTF book that describes "beings" as /"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws."/ The way it's worded could imply that magical creatures are separate the actual magical community?

But we do know that some werewolves have created their own communities since they are shunned so much from society- I feel like we can kind of assume that this is the same with Goblins, they only interact with wizards for business, and we don't exactly see them wandering around the rest of magical britain (other than HPDH). Also with centaurs- we know there is a kind of community in the Forbidden Forest.

I feel like specific numbers gets complicated when you have to take into account wizards who are also veela, half giant, werewolves and even obscurials. And we don't know how other wizarding governments around the country regard creatures, maybe they have more respect and place in everyday society? It's kind of reminding me of the different between Satyres and Fauns in the Heroes of Olympus book series.

** There has to be enough goblins to run the main branch of Gringotts in Diagon Alley plus the branch in Hogsmead, along with any other branches that might exist in the other wizarding villages around Britain. They're also miners, blacksmiths, and mint their own coins. So I'd say the goblin population in Britain alone is somewhere in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands.

***** It's not canon, but a lot of fan fictions have a smaller branch in Hogsmeade. I'd say that it makes sense because Hogwarts students wouldn't be allowed to floo or apparate to the main branch in London but might need to make withdrawals during Hogsmeade weekends.

** There's also giants, veela, hags, vampires and merfolk.

From the books it seems like, in the U.K. at least, most of the other races are discriminated against. In 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' several other races appear in a bar scene, so I assume they're treated better or worse in different countries.

*** Was suprised the Harry Potter wiki gave this number. Apparently there used to be hundreds of tribes but they got hunted to near extinction in between wizarding wars because they sided with Voldemort in the first one. Then being secluded to a remote mountainous area somewhere in Northern Europe, they felt cramped and started killing eachother. According to the wiki though, a bunch fought during the second wizarding war so some died that way. Then it's unknown if the survivors went back into hiding or were executed by the Ministry. So actually less than 80, probably by a lot. Maybe even only Gwamp (Hagrid's ½ brother who faught for the Light) and then the two ½ giants we know of in the story, Hagrid and Madame Maxime.
