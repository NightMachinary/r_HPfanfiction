Sirius Black is Harry Potter's Biological Father because James' Marriage to Lily is for looks only as he is gay. Thanks all.


** linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) - wherein Harry is the child of all three due to shenanigans, arranged because of a curse on James. What makes it more fun is that Sirius's child with Lily is a daughter, so Harry is essentially two children of three parents with one soul.

*** Wait, I'm so confused.

Is Harry in this story biologically female but due to magic was transformed into a male? Is Harry a metamorphmagus that suffers from mild/severe schizophrenia where Harry's a girl half the time and a boy the other half? Or does Harry have both male and female parts at the same time?

The story's summary sounds interesting but the way you mentioned how Harry is essentially two children with one soul makes me hesitant to read it. Could you clarify on that point? Thanks!

**** Harry can flip between the two, though wasn't aware of the girl side of himself because of some suppression potion given to spare James' feelings or something. When Harry flips to Melania, the interactions with wands and the like demonstrate a distinguishable difference in personality. They have different animagus forms, too.

Still, it's all one teenaged kid with one set of memories and just a bunch of options.

  Harry felt he had lost his chance at family after watching Sirius fly away only for his godfather to show up during the summer. Sirius teaches Harry what he needs to know, helping him become the true Lord Potter. Then the Tri-Wiz comes and the deepest, darkest secret of the Marauders is revealed - Harry was born the daughter of Lily and Sirius. Eventual Fem!HarryxTonks

**** Then he could marry a random nice enough witch. To keep cover. There be no real reason to be a freaking stalker towards Evans.

Since Snape worst memory (and probably before) He wanted Lily to date him, why if he likes men? That's (at least) TWO years yearning after the same girl...He could have pick anyone as his beard. His unhealthy obsession with Lily (at least for me) breaks the suspension of disbelief for this idea.

  The Power Paradox; the skills most important to obtaining power and leading effectively are the very skills that deteriorate once we have power.Harry's first encounter with a dementor reveals something about him no one knew, especially not Harry. These new revelations test Harry on his path to find who he is and his role in the world. AU,eventual Slash.
