so setting: Voldemort is truly gone and everyone knows this. how is a free choice but could just have died at the attack at the Potter's?

Years later, possibly while Harry is at Hogwarts, the ministry still decides to interfere with Hogwarts education, but for entirely different reasons; they want to set up a new standard of safety at Hogwarts as well as a teacher-standard, but also secretly impose their own influence on Hogwarts.\\
They do so in form of Umbridge, who will not torture students this time around, but is still nasty, corrupt, and quite bigoted towards people with the blood of different species or afflicted with lycanthropy.

But many students, despite it being Umbridge, still agree that Hogwarts is legit unsafe, with monsters in the forest, so many accidents, and other stuff, and that numerous teachers are below standard, whether in skill or behaviour (Binns, Trelawney, Snape etc.) and that the school needs reform and make-over to a higher standard, and thus supports the ministry, while others disagree, or think whatever the ministry is trying to do will be worse than what is currently the standard.

This splits the student body and potentially even teachers in a conflict over what should be done and who to agree with, along with some students in the middle, who are unsure or don't want to take part in the conflict but is constantly pushed to take a stance.

*** it was more a focus on the dangerous parts of Hogwarts like what is in the forest and the constant dangers the students are in.

And you can't really deny some of the teachers are just plain bad. Binns literally bore 99 % of the class to sleep, Trelawney is generally considered a faker by the majority of the student population and a joke, and while Snape has the skills, his personality ruins any attempt, or lack thereof, at teaching and imparting knowledge to students.
