I know it sounds obscure and kinda defeats the purpose of ya know, a Harry Potter fic, but I've seen it done in other fandoms. Wondering if y'all have stumbled upon any in your days?


** Yeah, there's [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. I didn't get very far into it myself, but the writing quality seemed solid.

  Sirius is in boarding school, Remus is in hospital, and they don't know each other until Sirius texts the wrong number.

** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

It's a nonmagical AU but the Hermione in it is a dimensionally stranded witch with no wand and only a bag full of single use potions and gadgets. It's told from the perspective of this dimension's Ron, he and Harry are elite police officers. They've got nonmagical enemies in their universe and once Hermione manages to portal home they'll need to fight Voldemort too.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
