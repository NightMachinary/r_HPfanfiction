I'm looking for well written fics in the Harry Potter universe that DON'T have anything to do with the canon characters (including the marauders or the next gen) and don't follow canon plot. Any genre is fine, but the longer the better!


** linkffn(3964606) *Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle* Book 1.

linkffn(4684861) *Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below* Book 2.

linkffn(5784632) *Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment* Book 3.

linkffn(7689884) *Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above* Book 4.

linkffn(13353323) *Alexandra Quick and the World Away* Book 5.

â€‹

I suppose, If you look for something that really does have nothing to do with the original cast, this might be your cup of tea. I've never read them myself, but I just recently stumbled over them as they came highly recommended. I don't tend to read OC stories, only rarely do, so this isn't really my type of story, but It could be what you are looking for...

** I'm working on a fic with two OC viewpoint characters in the founders era! The founders and (later) Helena Ravenclaw and the still-alive Bloody Baron are characters, but theres so little of them in canon that they're basically OCs anyway.

It's set a few decades into the history of Hogwarts rather than detailing the founding of the school, with two students from different backgrounds coming to the school in a time of huge turmoil.

There's currently three chapters posted, but I have three more written and am keeping a pretty regular two week schedule. It will eventually be pretty long! Probably a couple of hundred thousand.

If this sounds like your thing, check it out! linkao3(23957842)

  Hogwarts, Britain's largest community of magical learning, is only decades old and already bitterly divided. England has fallen to a foreign king. And as the stone walls of Hogwarts grow ever higher, whispers say that Salazar Slytherin is plotting something... Two students from either side of a war are driven together by events that will change Britain, magical and non-magical, forever.

** Linkffn(13098062)

That's my WIP. Original plot with ideas and figures taken from Celtic myth (no actual gods, just legends translated into historical witches and wizards). There are duels, dark magics, obscure motivations and costly losses. The main character is a younger, more ruthless Dumbledore-type fighting her very own immortal nemesis.

I also know of linkffn(Starnlicht), which is complete. I still need to read it, but I remember liking the writing from the outset, when I skimmed the beginning.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.
