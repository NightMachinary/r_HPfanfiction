So here's the deal. You give a summary of a story which could describe Harry Potter but isn't. You can withhold information, talk about only a part of the story or give partially inaccurate info as long as you don't lie (for example, an info which is true during only part of the story). Obviously the game is to find which story it is (and unclearly, it's not Harry Potter).

I'll go first...

The hero of our story is an orphan, child of a prophecy (even if he didn't know) whose parents sacrificed their lives for him when he was young opposing an unspeakable evil. A part of this enemy, when he was defeated, finds itself trapped in our hero unbeknown to him. The head of the place where the hero passes the majority of his time is a grandfather figure who withhold information and could have done better to protect him against the fickleness of the people. For example, he knew about the piece of the enemy trapped in him (piece that gave the hero quite a bit of grief) and our hero had to learn it in an unpleasant way. He also never protected the hero when he was bullied by his peers. At the beginning of the story, the people around him were dismissive or even mean to the hero but later he found true friends and together they had many adventures and battled many foes. One of which was an old enemy of the world with pale snakelike features obsessed with immortality which he apparently managed to attain by letting pieces of his soul around.

Found it? Clearly it was ............ *Naruto* ............ It's funny how many similarities they were.

Your turn now !


** A small minority of abnormal individuals exist in society with powers that are beyond that of ordinary humans. Some are aware of these individuals, many are not. Many are ostracized by the majority, often from fear. As young adults, with their gifts manifesting, they learn that not only are these kids fundamentally different than the rest of the world...they are /better,/ and thats why they were tormented by everyone else (in other words, every teenager's dream).

These teens and young adults are often collected and educated at a special school for 'gifted students' with a wise and powerful professor. But others disagree with the status quo, thinking those who cast them out deserve not tolerance but to kneel, to be destroyed even, before these gifted individuals. They are often lead by one singularly powerful individual with a strong connection to the professor and school he manages, an individual with a painful past and a charismatic presence.

If you haven't guessed, it's the X-Men. A bit on the nose really, but this always stuck out to me as the sort of story Rowling was going for.

** A boy who never knew his father gets rescued from his squalid living conditions by his future mentor, who tells him that he has supernatural powers.

He spends the better part of the following decade being trained in the use of his powers, but he grows up to be a rebellious young man, showing curiosity in the forbidden side of his powers. Ultimately he turns against his mentor and chooses evil, losing most of his humanity in the process and transforming beyond recognition.

Years later he manages to triumph over his former mentor, but his days are already numbered since there is a new Chosen One about to end his reign of terror...

No, this isn't Voldemort's backstory, but Darth Vader's.

** The hero of this book series is a magical child who learns magic in a school that is a castle. They become close friends with two other kids there, and get into a rivalry with a snobby rich kid. The snobby rich kid is favoured by the hero's least liked teacher, who is strict, scary, and always wears black. Said horrible teacher is not /actually/ evil, though.

People in the magical world fly on brooms and use their flying skills not only to get from A to B, but also for fun and challenging activities. So, brooms can be pretty important. At one point the hero's broom gets broken, and at another point in time a broom they are using for one of those "fun and challenging activities" mentioned above starts playing up, trying to throw the hero off, because it was jinxed.

There are several books dealing with different adventures the hero has while growing up and advancing their education.

**** Well, obviously I'm not going to file a lawsuit, and as a wannabe author, I am all for creative thievery so long as the story has original elements. I was just surprised by the degree of copying. And, geez, you anime fans take shit too seriously

*** It is quite common. Google for articles comparing The Lord of the Rings with Wagner's operas, Beowulf and Kalevala. Sometimes the similarities are not funny.
