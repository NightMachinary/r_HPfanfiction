Because which spy agency wouldn't give anything to have someone who can honest-to-God read minds at their disposal? Imagine all the secrets that could be at the proverbial fingertips of someone who could slip into anywhere, no matter how secure, with the combination of an invisibility cloak, silencing, scent-masking, and unlocking charms. Also, given the seemingly limitless potential for destruction that magic brings to those who can properly wield it, even one of them would become an invaluable battlefield asset.


** I think the whole mind control thing is a way bigger deal than the stealth, and certainly battlefield spells.

It's something that baffles me whenever a Wizards vs Muggles debate happens, why the hell would the Wizards bother with using anything other than the Imperius Curse?

It's not only the Unforgivables. Hermione, a mere teenager at the time - albeit a gifted one - was able to erase the whole life of their parents with one spell they learned about when they were twelve.

Reading minds, make people forget their whole live and controlling them. Seriously - the muggles were lucky that Grindelwald never realised how easy it would be to take control over the Muggle world without even killing a single person. He could have made them all worship him and nobody would have been able to do anything against it.

*** Well it is true for even Muggles wanted to find a way to control others minds. ( I am talking about very well know research of some intelligence agency)

*** As I always say on said debate, it really depends on how much information the two sides have about each other (which pretty much boils down to who the Muggle-born and -raised side with). The Imperius would be devastating, but only if the user knew who to target and what commands to give them.

** Hagrid also explains, in book one, that Muggles would end up wanting magical solutions to all their problems, which is another reason why the wizarding world prefers to keep to itself.

** In the HP universe it would only make sense that the governments do have people who can do this.

The muggle governments and security agencies must be aware of magicals. Both in the fact that magicals are bad at keeping their secret and the sheer number of sqibs and muggles that are let in on the secret.

Once you know then you would immediately try and recruit some. Muggleborns that suddenly dissapeared in the jump from primary to secondary school would be quite easy to find.

Then you just offer them enormous amounts of money and boom you have your own magician.

Now you can apperate into enemy areas, become invisable and listen to conversations. Or steal documents or kill someone.

In the private sector as well it would be enormous. Think about what could be achieved by someone who can edit memories or steal prototypes and files.

Basically I think more fics should focus on this.

*** The Aurors and International Confederation of Wizards would be all over that like a rash. Basically magic = nukes, Statute of Secrecy = Non-Proliferation Treaty, and no way in hell anyone is going to let that fly.

** Have you read this series? Linkao3(say a prayer by mad_fairy) ?

After the first 8 chapters it turns into an excellent 5 part complete series. I think it's part four(?) that the spy agency gets involved in the plot and drives the whole thing forward.

The first 8 chapters are rough and full of shitty bashing but it calms right down after that and turns into a great series.
