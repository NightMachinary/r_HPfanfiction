Hey guys, Canon or Fanon that Lily Potter and Alice Longbottom were the godparents of each others children?

I think it's fanon but... Who knows at this point


** It's fanon. Harry's godmother, if he even has one, is never mentioned in canon.

** Fanon. Nothing even suggests they were acquaintances, but I imagine they reached out to each other during, at least, the last two years. And no, he doesn't have a godmother.

*** It is highly likely that they were at least acquaintances as they were all members of the Order of the Phoenix in the First war. They were all present in the photograph that Moody showed Harry in the fifth book.

#+begin_quote
  /ES: Who is Harry's godmother?/

  JKR: Didn't have one.

  /ES: Really?/

  JKR: Well, Sirius never had time to get a girlfriend, let alone marry.

  /ES: They could have just picked some other close friend of the family./

  JKR: At the time that they christened Harry, they were in hiding. This was not going to be a widely attended christening, because he was already in danger. So this is something they were going to do very quietly, with as few people as possible, that they wanted to make this commitment with Sirius. And --- yeah. Can't say much more.

*** They most certainly were not. Alice Longbottom was an Auror (which takes 3) years), distinguished herself as one and had a son (I'm assuming that there's some kind of maternity leave). Given that Lily died 3 years after graduation, the timeline simply doesn't match. Then again, most people have the Black sisters and the Marauders in one year, even when Bellatrix is 9 years older than James and even Narcissa was in her sixth year when the Marauders started Hogwarts.

**** I am always sho ked by the level of inaccuracies when it is simply a matter of logic, the black sisters being triplets makes no sense and even if that were the case, we know Narcissa and lucius are really close in age,, and that they were older than the marauderers year, I always assume Alice being one or two above them, maybe three but not really more than that

**** I always get bothered when fanfics try to stick to canon dates... But then make Lily and James work in some senior position.

Lily was a /teen/ mom.

***** Teen mom? She was twenty when she had Harry, even closer to twenty-one IIRC.

Teenager refers to people in an age which ends with "teen" (thirteen to nineteen).

******** Fair point, but she's young.

I mean, if you're going to make her have this amazing career, at least age her up a bit, considering she was in hiding quite a bit and pregnant as well.

**** The thing about that is there has to be a story if it's marauder era though its not canonical it helps a story be made without creating a bunch of characters... so just making most of the characters the same age help

*** The original definition is "a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine". In the case of fiction, it refers to the version of the story that is considered official (either by the creator or the consumer, so in some instances what material actually is canon can be disputed).

Fanon, as far as I'm aware, is just a play on canon like you said. It tends to be used about things like (in this fandom) magical cores, marriage contracts, lordships, etc. that have become so ingrained in the fandom consciousness that they're used without question in many fics, rather than for things that an individual author comes up with.
