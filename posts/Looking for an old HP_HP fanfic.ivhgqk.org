:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it years ago. I mostly use fanfiction.net or archive of our own but occasionally read elsewhere. It was a story where a Harry Potter from an alternate dimension shows up. He had a hard life and defeated Voldemort and now he wants to protect the innocence of the local harry potter. They end up falling for each other which as you can imagine led to an interesting story. Problem is I've never been able to find it again. When I was reading it it wasn't finished. I want to see if it was finished or even just reread what was there because I remember it being quite good.


** If the local Harry is female, it might be Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived?

It was a decent story up until I got a little wigged out by the... selfcest? What even is that? Anyway! It fits the little information you gave lol
