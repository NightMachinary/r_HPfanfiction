* The canon suicide walk:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-canon-suicide-walk
  :END:

- It's canon

- Makes Harry a martyr/further builds his legend

* Gobin magic:

- More than one plot/logic hole. Medicine does not work that way.

* "Confronting" the Horcrux in Harry's mind
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: confronting-the-horcrux-in-harrys-mind

- Usually involves either Occlumency or Possession

* Removing the scar
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: removing-the-scar
  :END:

- Relies on the assumption that the scar is the Horcrux

- Safest option. Takes just a minute and is easily healed with magic.

- Removes some of the tension

- Often out of the blue

- Somewhat believable even if done accidentally (eg Harry is fed-up with people staring)

- Can result in amusing reactions (eg Dumbeldore throwing fits or

* Sex-based rituals/magic:

- Easy set-up for romance/romantic comedy

* Harry randomly takes a killing curse:

Your thoughts? Which method do you prefer?


** I like some of the less tense options but with the caveat of it being an incomplete horcrux and thus easier to remove. An accidental horcrux just makes it feel like every dark wizard would have one or two lying around. After all intentional murder is not all that uncommon.

** I'm gonna give a cop out answer and say that I prefer AU stories where the Horcrux inside Harry isn't a plot element.

I don't know the general consensus on this, but I felt like it was (along with several other plot elements in the Deathly Hallows and Half Blood Prince) a rushed, poorly thought out, 11th hour addition to the story. As such, stories written that ignore this paticular bit of drama please me. Also, I've found that very few stories handle it in an original and intriguing way, often resorting to dealing with it as something that has to be checked off a list to move the plot forward.

I will say this: The best way I've seen it dealt with is in The Legacy [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy]] (Sorry on mobile). Harry and Dumbledore essentially implement some clever magic to merge the Voldemort soul fragment with Harry's soul. The result is a Harry Potter with all of Voldemort's memories and experiences, leaving him to unpack the conflicted feelings of having said experiences stuck in his head permanently. It's also one of the more believable powerful!Harry stories out there as he gains Voldemort's experiences but at high cost and risk.

*** Handling the Horcrux within Harry can definitely be tricky and if an author doesn't feel like they can do it properly I agree that it should just be ignored or taken out entirely.

I disagree that the Horcrux within Harry, however, was a rushed addition. It was set up from the very beginning of the books. If you want to ignore some of the connections as just your standard “Hero” stuff like feeling when Voldemort is close, at the /very least/ she had the Horcrux in his head in mind from GoF. The entire graveyard scene was a setup for Harry's later “suicide walk.”

No, what she almost certainly did was use plot hooks she set in the beginning and tied them together. Nearly every author does this, if they're decent.

How so? She clearly set up that Harry had a connection to Voldemort, but I don't know if she had solidified the whole scar is horocrux thing. I doubt she fully figured out the Horcrux idea until she was plotting out book 6. The fact she could conveniently tie it in to both the scar and the diary was an added bonus.

I have a bit of a telepathy kink, so legilimency/mind bond romances and spells have always been a go to. It's a bit of a cliche tired topic in this community, but it's one of the reasons I love the Sacrifices arc. Since it's plot and character development rely so heavily on blockages in the mind/restructuring the mind etc.

It hurts when the caster of that scar is particularly angry/hateful. Dumbledore was wrong (JK just made that character to easy to hate and bash), and Lily straight up sacrificed her soul and magic to protect her son. She was a corpse walking when Tom AK'd her.

This avoids the whole Horcrux issue, slams Dumbledore, and gives Harry a chance to go his own way. A triple win.

** I like the idea of reversing the ritual that creates a horcrux in order to destroy/transfer the scar horcrux. Of course, that relies on intimate knowledge of that ritual, which a bog standard HP is unlikely to have - but if he, say, absorbed all of Voldemort's memories or some such, it's a viable option.

In general, the method used has to serve the story, and not just be ticking a box on a checklist. If sex magic is the most impactful, then great - go for it. I read one just recently where Harry got hit by a goddamn truck saving a kid who ran into the street - and was clinically dead long enough for the scar to (presumably) freak out the paramedics. If it serves the story, it's the right answer.

** I had an detailed outline of a fic sketched out in which Hermione becomes a Dark Witch and an anti-Voldemort fanatic, who actually makes a horcrux for herself. Having actually performed the ritual, she is able to guide Harry through a modified version of it (that doesn't involve murder but does involve most other ingredients of a horcrux) to remove Voldemort's soul fragment.

Generally, when introducing a non-canon way to remove the horcrux in the scar, I think that a fanfic writer must ask "Why didn't Dumbledore use this method in canon?" and unless they can find a satisfactory answer, they shouldn't use it. In the case of my fic idea, the rationale is that while Dumblefore certainly knew every step of creating a horcrux in abstract, he did not have first-hand experience with the magics involved and so could not develop a modification for moving a soul fragment elsewhere.

** Harry can do the Horcrux ritual himself and tear out Voldemort's piece of soul to place in the container. I have only read 2 stories where this is done.

A truly manipulative Dumbledore (one of the reasons why I cannot call canon Dumbledore as such) would flat out kill Harry to get rid of the Harrycrux. The method of killing can be anything from killing curse to poison. Obviously, not meant for Harry centric fics.

There's also the soul merge thing, which I've only seen in 2 fics so far. It merges the two souls and essentially makes Harry a different person. I can't remember just how different he became, because the story that did this was The Legacy and it was dragging its feet far too much for me to continue reading. The other one was a dimensional hopper that ended up in the same body as a pussy HP, where they merge themselves into a singular different being. Both fics implement this as a complex procedure - in the first one, Harry and Albus iron out the details of the merge, and in the second one, the dimensional hopper is the ruler of all Europe.

There's also the fics that have Harry not house a piece of Voldemort's soul. This is fine with me - to me, the horcrux in Harry was a stupid plot device. There are also fics that purge the horcrux out of him by larger-than-life otherworldly powers - usually done in fics that explore magic a LOT.

  "sexuelle Handlungen von, an oder vor einer vierzehn, aber noch nicht achtzehn Jahre alten Person oder ...."

Which does not refer to child pornography but pornography of young adults which is similar illegal.

******* But the paragraph about written child pornography is explicit about the fact that it only applies to children below 14.

And even then you have a lot of artistic freedom. The movie adaption of "Der Vorleser" has a lot of nudity and statutory rape and is rated 6+. We watched that bloody thing in class nearly ten years ago. Thankfully, that doesn't cover explicit sex, but as long as it's not explicit you are legally clear.

** My absolutely favorite method is in Resolution by Greengecko.

In there Voldemort is defeated before the horcrux is dealt with, and it's been slowly and subtly influencing Harry for years. He's mostly resisted it, but it gains more power once Harry loses his childhood innocence and is living away from the wards of Hogwarts.

Harry does a lot of bad shit under the influence (brands some people with a mark, casts some unforgivables), though he resists the truly awful stuff like murder.

In the end when Harry realises that he is a danger to his friends and family , he travels to the Dark Plane (a plane of existence filled with mindless, demonic creatures of whom he is a master) and he commands the creatures to devour him. The horcrux, sensing Harry's resolve to die and desperate for survival, manifests and possesses some of the creatures. Harry destroys it, but it's not a clear-cut process. He has to essentially mutilate his own soul in order to kill it. Furthermore, the magic he uses to kill it he powers by all the people he loves and he burns that completely. In the end, Harry is mangled, physically, mentally, spiritually. He loses the ability to speak, plus has a whole host of other damage. Most of it is healed gradually, and he learns to speak again, but he loses the ability to love seemingly permanently. His emotions are much more muted after the battle and where he loved his family and friends fiercly before, he only feels a fondness for them after.

*** That falls under "Summon Bigger Fish".

I had the Horcrux destroyed by there being an intact soul also residing within Harry, having taken up residence when Lily Potter sacrificed herself, and when it finally wakes up, immediately teams up with Harry to confront and slay the Horcrux, which manifests as a dessicated snake anchored to the ground by twelve tendrils, one for each year the Horcrux had been there.

  The walls of Hogwarts hold many secrets, some of them benign and some rooted in a deep, dark past. When Harry stumbles upon the latter, his life and soul are shattered, leading him down a path of power, destruction, and sex. A Dark!Harry, Possessed!Harry, Harry/Harem story. Rated M.

My favorite for a serious story is Harry ripping the soul out by killing someone a la Cadmean Victory I think. This just seems badass to me. Also killing on cold blood damaging your soul in se way just makes sense to me.
