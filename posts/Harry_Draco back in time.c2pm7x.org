Harry and Draco go back in time to the 1st war against Voldemort and Harry becomes a death eater spy. They eventually show up in the present as their fake identities in an attempt to kill Voldemort? Does this ring a bell to anyone? I know I've given a terrible description I just cannot for the life of me remember anything else about it.

#+begin_quote
  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
