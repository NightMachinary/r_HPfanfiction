In the canon, James Potter was a troublemaker. He and Sirius were described as the predecessors to the Weasley twins, and his friend group frequently went on ventures after hours. He was also a little bit of a bully, playing cruel tricks on Severus at the least. He was never made a prefect. It was speculated that Remus was made prefect just to correct his troublemaking friends.

Yet somehow, James became Head Boy in his seventh year.

Are there fics out there which explore this seemingly sudden change of character more thoroughly? I'd love to see how people think it might've happened.


** Basically, James gets character-assassinated by Rowling in the later books. That's what really happened. In the first book, Voldemort says that James fought courageously against him, but in the last book, it basically has him unarmed when he faces Voldemort.

He was described as being exceptionally brilliant in his studies, so that's a plus point there. He's also described as being very popular among the student body, so that's another plus. You can also say that it was Albus sending a little political message by having a pureblood Head Boy to a muggleborn Head Girl. James is also described as being vehemently opposed to the blood purity radicalism that was taking root during the late 70s, so that could also have been a factor.

*** You're not wrong. I do think she focused too much on showing James' flaws (for the sake of Harry's internal conflict), and failed to resolve the conflict around his character effectively. She never shows how James went from being a bully and prankster to being the "great man" everybody says he is. That's why I'm curious to see if someone else has.

** Headboys aren't always chosen as the best student, some schools pick them for leadership qualities. My husband was a headboy at school and he was certainly in detention a fair bit, as well as having a very mild brush with the law at one point. Bit he was charismatic, likable and the teachers thought he would be a good influence over the other pupils.

*** While true, this applies more to dark wizards like Snape and Grindlewald than James.

** A lot of the older L?J fics have this plot though it has been a long time since I've read them. And they hae other inconsistencies because it is before a lot of things were released.

** Most stories that look at all the Marauders' time in Hogwarts deal with this question.

i personally deal with it, by actual stretching this development over a couple of years.How he slowly grows up and take responsibility and leadership roles. Like he decides to little Quidditch games with the lower years in his th year, to not only play more Quidditch and help those that never played before (muggleborn), but to have a better idea how good students really are once he becomes captain a year or two later (yes he is that convident/arrogant that he expects to become captain) and not just have the one day of try-out.

things like this, to show that he slowly grows up and it is a long process that isn't that surprising in the long run.

But of course politics probaly played a role as well. I have a one-shot planed in which I deal with thart idea.

Just look at those stories, most have at least a sideplot of this in them
