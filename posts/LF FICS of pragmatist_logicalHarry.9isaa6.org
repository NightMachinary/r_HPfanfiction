basically where harry is not a dumbass, and no i don't mean academically smart just not wizard dumb. i've read a few crack fics where harry just confuses purebloods with millennial jokes and memes but i'd really like a long story where harry uses his head.

i've read linkffn(Death is but the Next Great Adventure by TheObsidianQuill) and it's the closest thing i've got and im looking for something similar.

preferably 10k+, i don't mind non-Gryffindor!Harry, don't mind nsfw or ships (just not pedophilic or incestuous). angst, drama, crack---whatever.

*** I really want to like this fic, because the writing is of a good standard, but the whole "I don't agree with racists but they're so fascinating, and the main reason why I'm attracted to you is because you're racist" thing just turned me off.
