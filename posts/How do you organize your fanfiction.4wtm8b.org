Like the title indicates I am interested to know how you guys organize your fanfiction. Do you read on only one device or have you found a way to read/sync on more than one?

To give some context; I've been reading fanfiction for a few years now, and in the beginning it was exclusively on my phone. However, I took a break for a few months and now that I've returned, reading on both my laptop and phone has left me disorganized and thus a little irritated. To make matters harder I'm changing my phone soon and I have at least 50 something fics on the ff.net app alone. Any advice?


** I don't.

I should really get around to creating a spreadsheet to keep track, one of these days. Or get a ffn account. One of the two.

** I have an organized set of bookmarks in Firefox and if I'm in the middle of a fic, I leave it in an open tab. If I want to continue reading on-the-go I use the sync feature to pull up what I'm currently reading and my bookmarks. I've also started downloading any fic I want to read with Calibre, because I got tired of finding one that sounded interesting and returning to it just to find out that it's been deleted or the website's gone.

Both my bookmarks and my tags in Calibre are based on ships (if there are any), so at a quick glance at either I can tell if I've already gotten the fic or not. Once I've finished reading it, I delete the bookmark and mark the fic as read in Calibre.

** I have a doc file for those stories I've started but didn't finish in one go - it contains the link and summary, and chapter I'm on. For those sites that do not bookmark.

** I use the ffn faves button to keep track of fics I've completed. For fics I'm reading or planning to read I just bookmark them in my browser with some nice sub-folders to keep them tidy. I don't use this since I don't have a smart-phone but you may find it useful: some web browsers have the ability to sync bookmarks and such across multiple devices, which would allow you to keep track of your fics no matter what device you're using.

** I started a tumblr, and every time I find a fic I want to read, I post it on my tumblr and tag the hell out of the post. If I finish reading it, I write a little description that will remind me which fic it is (usually a scene that stood out, or a unique plot point, like "Total crack fic, dude's dead, it's all a video game." or "Great fic, but who describes smut from a cat's point of view?") Anyways, then I just search by my tags to find something I want to read. I'm still working on posting all of the fics I had bookmarked across 3 computers and multiple browsers, lol, but it's coming along.

** I bookmark the page the fic is on, for fics I'm hesitant to read but consider reading anyway. If I decide I want to read it after all, I download it onto my ebook reader and separate by fandoms (but not by to-read and have-read). After that, I delete it off the ebook reader if I think I probably won't reread it but have read it before.

** I'll either save recommendations to my reddit account and go look through it when I want something to read or I'll search through FFN and have about 15 pages open of ones that look interesting and then never read them anyway.

** Some people suggested you keep the tabs with the fiction you're reading open, I really wouldn't do that. Why? I have five windows open, with around fifty fics on each. It is hell to try and find anything. I also have a bunch of stuff just downloaded via ePub on my phone and recommend doing that. But there was one time when everything on my phone deleted itself because I downloaded a real book. Get an app, it seems the most practical.

** I have a "reading" folder on my Chrome bookmarks bar, and I'm subscribed to a bunch of fics on AO3; each time I get a notification e-mail I bookmark it (using a "month/day title" format). Then I go through the bookmarks when I have spare time and read the fic.

I try to remember to delete the bookmarks when I'm finished with the chapter, but don't always remember.

**** I'm really trying to read as many as I can of the specific genre I like because I don't want to miss a potentially great one.

The worst is when you start reading a fic that reads familiar and then realize 100k words in you have read it before and you didn't like it the first time.
