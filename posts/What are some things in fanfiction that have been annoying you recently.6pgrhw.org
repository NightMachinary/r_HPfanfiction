**** When Harry pops a P, I went to go up to the author and throttle him/her, and ask them what purpose popping the P serves except for making everyone run away from your story faster than you can say Quidditch.

** The word ward to refer to magical defenses. The canon term is protective enchantments. It didn't use to bother me, but over the last few years it has been growing more and more annoying. It just shows such a casual contempt for canon.
