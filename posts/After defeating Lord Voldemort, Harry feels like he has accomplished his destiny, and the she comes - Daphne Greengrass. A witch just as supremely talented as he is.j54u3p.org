** Great, everything people hate in a fanfiction but more over the top. Super powerfull, ultra talented haphne, trained by albus "I have three full time job but yeah let me train you enough so you become akin to a God" Dumbledore, jerkass "if you're not good enough we can't be friend" Grey Lordiest Lordeth of Lords Potter.

Ok, maybe not the lord part but this one is obviously underlined.

Short is, you want a powerwank fic with unlikable OP protagonists. With sparks of Mary Sueness.

*** But the charcter itself its not a Mary sue, its Just some writers that made her being one. I mean i Saw hundreds of fics where she was a well developed charcter. Most Mary sues that i Saw were Draco sisters, voldemorts daughters and fem Harry.

** Sounds interesting, but it would be important that it isn't just a power wank. After all, stories depend on conflicts and struggles
