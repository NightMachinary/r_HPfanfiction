I had recently the idea for 2 Timetravel Stories and im curious if such are existing already or not.

1. Hermione and Harry are traveling back to the Maurader Era. While both are trying to return to their time (by creating a Device or prepare a Ritual or whatever) with the help of Dumbledore, Hermione and James are slowly falling for each other. At first they find each other interesting and because a Loveship of them would thread Harry, he interfers whenever he sees them, but since they grow closer he is threatened to Vanish. The Story has Hermione/James as a pairing but without them getting together, so a tragic or drama one, she decides to break up with James so she wouldnt be responsible for a Friends death.

2. Hermione travels at some point back in time (lets say 6th year for the search of Harry, who is eavesdroping malfoy) and is send to a certain time before Harrys Parents get killed. Her Timeturner has a malfunction and only sends her back after a certain amount of time is passed. This time is shortly after Voldemorts murder on the Potters. She tries to stay hidden, but the Fidelius doesnt seem to work on her (or she was "initiated by an incident). Anyway one of the Potters or both detrct Hermione and invite her to their Home, wich she does but reluctant because she doesnt want to cause a Paradox (Harry can only remember the green Light, so it doesnt matter earlier happenings). She tries to keep distance at Baby Harry but slowly grows fond of him and at some point even try to warn the Potters. Lily and James, however, dont want to escape for the sake of time and for Harrys Future (because in Hermiones Time, Harrys future is certain and it would unforseen if they run away....but he would happy). This is also a tragic/drama FF. Lily and James dont run and Voldemort murders them, she witness his defeat (staying in the House hidden or outside). She goes to Harry and try to comfort him, as she gets send into her time, in which she is devastated for what she saw, sits with the others at Dumbledores Welcome speech but soon leaves it. Harry (and maybe Dumbledore, who saw by random through legilimency what happened to her) find her in an abandoned Room, where she only express, that she feels so sorry for him.

I know, this is really explicit, but i want to know, if such are existing. The 1. Story is pretty AU like, but the Core is: Harry and Hermione are send to maurader era and try to go back, Hermione and James grow closer and Harrys life is threatened by this. Hermione Breaks up and goes back with Harry. Doesnt matter if she falls for Harry in the end as a "replacement" for James or not.

The 2. Stories Core is: Hermione is send back to a Time before Harrys Parents get killed (lets say a Week) and she tries to find out how to get back, but observes the Potters at the same time (sounds rather Stalky-like, now that i think about it), they find her and she meets Baby-Harry and spends time with him. She warns them (because she has pity with Harry, or not, because she wants to make sure the Time isnt changed in such a way it already is) and is send shortly after the Murder. Doesnt matter, if she is able to touch Harry to comfort him or not and is send back.


** I'm pretty sure I have read one with Harry and Hermione in the marauder area and Hermione trying to keep James with Lily despite liking him - but I can't find it... (I didn't even understand at first that you were asking if something like that existed, but thought you knew the one I also know and were looking for the title..)

**** No, it was with Harry and the typical "They turn up in the part, are brought to Dumbledore and get new names etc"
