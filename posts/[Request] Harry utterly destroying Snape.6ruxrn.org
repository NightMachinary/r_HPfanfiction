I'm sure many of us have seen stories where Harry inherited a life debt or similar from when James stopped Sirius (and Remus) from getting Snape killed.. The vast majority of the time though it ends up turning into either some light blackmail or a complete non-issue.. I am looking for stories where all of the bullshit that Snape has thrown towards the Gryffindors, and Harry in particular comes back to bite him in arse in some kind of truely unrecoverable way.


** I /think/ Snape gets utterly destroyed in this story. Correct me if I'm wrong, as I haven't read this story in over a year.

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
