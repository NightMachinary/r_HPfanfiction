Something that's always bothered me about most Harry-goes-dark and Draco-redemption fics is how easily it happens. Can anybody recommend a fic that focuses on the actual process of making the decision to defect and all the problems that come with it? Like second-guessing themselves, still disagreeing with some of their new allies' beliefs, struggling to see their old friends as the enemy, their new allies not accepting them right away, etc. Doesn't matter who it is as long as they start firmly in one camp (so no Snape please).


** Linkffn(6291747) Isolation follows Draco's journey after coming under the protection of the Order. It is very well written and provides a believable arc.

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.
