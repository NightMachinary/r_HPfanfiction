In the fic, an animagius could speak with the animal they turned into, and related ones. And salazar found a way to make parseltounge hereditary.

I recall harry used the corvids as a sort of spy network. But not much else.


** The only story I have ever read with the spy network of crows is that insane story by Noodlehammer.

*** It's not that good and I admit that, but it's one of my favorites regardless. Plus the sequel is a crossover with ASOIAF and it makes me happy on a few levels.

** This sounds neat. My headcanon has Harry as a bird animagus because he's so good at flying, and crows make sense since he's always getting into shit.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

*** Presumably, its possible for wizards to have a magical animagus, and it might have even been mentioned in cannon. So, its not impossible for the Harry in that story to have a goblin animagus.
