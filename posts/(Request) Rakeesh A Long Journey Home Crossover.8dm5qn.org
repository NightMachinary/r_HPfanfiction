I want to see someone get permission from rakeesh to to a crossover with either mass effect and or star wars the are wars one would probably be easier as the author could create his own earth history mass effect would be a little more difficult but I would love for someone to write both of those. Long time reader first time poster on here btw if that changes anything linkffn(A Long Journey Home)


** Real talk for a moment. Has anyone ever remarked on the irony that we ask other fanfic authors for permission before writing a fanfic of their fanfic? I'm pretty sure no one gave a shit when JK responded to the request with lawyers.

*** If someone did something like the OP mentions with one of my works without my permission, I feel like my initial reaction would be annoyance. And then my secondary reaction would be to shrug and go on with my day and secretly hate that it exists. So probably like a real author!

**** why? I think I actually would be flattered that someone wanted to use my work as a base for their own. And unles you are going to outrigth copy/paste something from other authour, I really don't think there is the need to ask for permission

***** Because it's /mine/ and I want it to stay mine. I'm not going to like, attack someone who does it. But it will still annoy me. My thought is mostly nothing I've created in fanfiction is that unique, rather than taking from mine, why don't you make your own?

I get that fanfiction is derivative. And I have no issue if someone wants to write a story about a female Voldemort and her treatment of Harry. But why would they have to name her Emily too?

It would bother me more from a 'make it your own' perspective than anything. It would annoy me that they took the easy way out and used my character rather than trying to do something unique with their own.

But I use fanfiction to practice certain themes I want to explore in original works. Mostly because it's an easy way to get a lot of feedback on written works.

I get that it's entirely hypocritical. But the post I responded to was mostly about reactions to it and that's my reaction.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I doubt you'll get the author's cooperation on writing a related fic when they're still (ostensibly) working on the original. For an unofficial crossover, a motivated author could transport a similar fem!Harry who alludes to having personally forgotten more than most civilizations have for written records...

*** Yeah, it's not hard to just use the premise as a background detail. Ideas are cheap. You might feel slightly scummy because /you/ know what you're doing, but not many others will make the connection. Sage!Harry is not uncommon.
