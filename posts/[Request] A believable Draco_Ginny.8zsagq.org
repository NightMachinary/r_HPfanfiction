You read that correctly. I want to see if someone can achieve the impossible.

(I see Snape/Hermione and Dramione recs all the time, so why not this?)


** I'm enjoying linkffn(What Ginny Forgot) very much. It's set pretty far in the future and both Draco and Ginny seem true to their characters.

** Linkffn(12242806)

After the war, Ginny is captured and entrusted to Draco. She stays true to her character -- fierce and defiant -- but also comes to accept that simple martyrdom won't rid the world of Voldemort. Story's written well and has some neat twists along the way. Check it out!

#+begin_quote
  In a dwindling postwar society, pure-blood prisoners are being released into the care of Death Eaters for "rehabilitation." And because life is quite unfair, Draco Malfoy has been entrusted with one very angry, very vengeful Ginny Weasley. [AU of a Voldemort victory]

** This is Draco/Ginny/Harry so might not be what you're looking for but it's really well-written: linkffn(12633202)

This has dark, Slytherin Ginny where the diary horcrux has a huge influence on her in a different way: linkffn(12473874)

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12314753/1/][The Price of Victory by sbmcneil]]

Almost eight years after Voldemort's defeat, some of those who fought to defeat him were still paying the price. Ginny Weasley had been sacrificed to the son of a Death Eater to pay her family's debts. Now she was trying to save her children from becoming like their father. This is AU and does end up with H/G. *Trigger warnings -- non-consensual sex, Domestic Violence

*** Why post this here? If you dislike D/G as much as you say you do, have you ever read a fic that might actually be believable? I'm a huge H/G fan as well, (in truth I ship Ginny/Happiness) but there are authors out there who are skilled enough to keep both characters true to themselves while still writing D/G.
