Do you think she could be writing some ideas she have as fan fiction, not wanting to publish them as official work?

*** Honestly, I can safely say that many, many talented writers in the fandom could've written a better 'sequel', or they could have even salvaged the mess that the manuscript/play itself was.

The writers of that play were hacks who looked as though they'd only taken English literature up to an american middle-school level.

** I'd find that hilarious: she'd be exploring alternate universes and "what if's?" through writing fanfiction, such as a Harry/Hermione romance.

Now, the /biggest/ conundrum is this: although /we/ wouldn't know about the author's identity, would it actually be canon since it actually wouldn't be fanfiction, as it's coming from the original author?

Of course she could go "yeah, it ain't canon" and such works could be overwritten by anything canonical she writes in the future (Wildbow of Worm infamy did this with the Apollyonverse "what if?" one-shot/discussion, which was, IIRC, directly contradicted in places by Worm's (supposedly awful, according to people who've discussed it) canonical sequel, Ward).

I'd actually like to see this sort-of thing: through minor divergences in the canon story, such as Harry not meeting Ron on the Express or, for example, sitting with Daphne Greengrass, we see what Daphne's characterization would've been like in the canonical story if she were encountered and not just a randomly-mentioned name -- it'd be kinda like looking through different windows of the same house to see the world inside, instead of just going through the front door.

Disagree with them? You're "Alt-right" or are "a phobe, an ist, or have an ism". Or, the popular buzzword of the decade, a "Nazi".

Think the CCP and China are a bunch of duplicitous, unscrupulous bastards for their actions? Or that Chinese-made electronics and products have the shelf-life of cold milk under the Saharan sun? You're a sinophobe.

It's kinda sad: a decade ago, they were pretty chill and relaxed. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if people on there were using the PM system/group system as a way to organize AntiFa-related shit.

I'm not saying your wrong, but I regularly use the site (not just for reading fan fiction) and I have never seen what you are describing. Do you have any examples of this? Because while you may be right I honestly don't think of the Twitter wokescold mob when I think of the average SB user.

******** The site has shifted to the Left to such a degree that if you state something they disagree with or goes against the collective views of people on there, such as Trump having a few good points even if you think the guy is a bit of a twat, you automatically gain a stigma among most users and the staff.

Honestly, I'd consider the site a cousin of Twitter now.

Staff use nebulous, personal interpretations of the rules to add points and to ban people they don't like to gradually force people off the forum. For example, someone regular they like or have no issue with? 10 points and six months before they expire. Someone they want off the site for ideological reasons (and that's what they are, frankly)? 50 points, two years before they expire. Two. Years.

You can see how this can quickly add up and give them a "correct" reasoning to ban someone.

An amusing example? Years back, there was a debate/argument about feminism in the modern day, and indeed elements of it all the way back to the original Suffragettes, being nothing but toxic misandry.

They demanded proof of my viewpoint. I posted I think it was thirty numerous sources, many from the sites that were ideologically Left, about how batshit insane feminists are now, including up to Mein Kampf being rewritten with feminist buzzwords and being applauded for it.

I was given a warning and a massive point hit for "flame-bating and trolling" because I basically proved my point solidly, and they couldn't come up with a counter-argument.

Another? Los Angeles is basically being overrun with vermin, homeless, and filth on the streets, mostly due to Democrat policies. They demanded proof. I posted proof, and a video of a rat running across a news station interviewer's foot.

They accused me of lying, bullshit, all the usual crap because it didn't fit their world-view of Los Angeles being some paradise.

How do I know all this? It's how they gradually banned me and a few others (some of which had been on the site since the early 00's) from the site: We were 'problematic' in their eyes.

It's one of the reasons I post on the Sietch now: yeah, we've had some problematic members we've had to weed out, but the site was basically built for free speech and debating.

Anyway, I'm glad you haven't been hit by any of this, to be honest. Just a bit of advice? No matter where the topic is on the forum, no matter what section, avoid anything to do with politics. I mean ANY politics. Well, unless you have a shrine to Biden in your closet and think Communism is a great idea or something.

Keep your head down and stick to non-controversial posts in the CrWr forum, and you'll be fine. Get on the staff's shit-list for being someone they don't like? You'll be gone within a year for one reason or another.

The only reason I lurk SB now as a guest is because I keep an eye on some of the interesting stories being posted/created on there. Otherwise, I wouldn't even think twice about not visiting the site ever again -- and I signed up coming a decade ago now.

**** IMO Ward is better than Worm because Wildblow wasn't so eager to up the magnitude of the threat when escalating from arc to arc and had a bit more focus on other character who could also pull their own weight. So the primary protagonist didn't need to go full Deux Ex Machina/Mary Sue at the end to escape from the corner she had been painted into.

Wildblow did the best they could, but ultimately Scion was too powerful for fighting him and winning not to be jarring however you write it.

** While it's a fun idea, it's unlikely, as most authors tend to avoid actively participating in their fandoms. The reason for this is pretty simple, if they published something new, there's a chance someone in the fandom could claim that an idea of theirs was used, with a pretty convincing direct causal link with the authors participation in their fandom.

Even if she was secretly involved, if she somehow published a new story that contained common fandom tropes, it'd be pretty hard to believe that she came up with all of them all on her own: humans are just not that creative that way that it would be believable that she'd independently come up with common tropes that most of us are intimately familiar with.

*** IIRC, a lot of writers for various franchises have restrictions in their contracts that forbid them from interacting with the fanfiction community, just in case this happens.

Actors and actresses have this in their contracts sometimes, too.

For example, an actress reads a bit of fanfiction that has her character romantically involved with another male character. The problem? Canonically and on-screen, they're supposed to have a sibling-like bond.

If there's even a chance that reading this sort-of fanfiction could alter the actress' perception of her character's interaction on-screen, even subconsciously, it'll affect /everything/.

So, no fanfiction-reading of your character for you, Miss Actress/Mr Actor!

***** She did.

IIRC I /think/ her reasoning was to see whether it were her skill as a writer or if it were her name (from writing Harry Potter) that caused her stuff to be popular, so she used a pseudonym.

Unfortunately...

Judging from the poor reception of the Casual Vacancy when it was first released (some of the reviews were /harsh/), it was basically a kick to her non-existent testicles.

****** I mean that he keeps their characterizations consistent within the story, not having them act randomly OOC because the plot demands they do certain things. He also generally makes their actions make sense in context - even their mistakes make sense for that character in that situation. They're often not especially consistent with their canon counterparts, but neither were said canon counterparts.

It's hardly an uncommon trait among writers, but it's one of JKRs biggest weaknesses as a writer: Her characters act in service to the plot first and foremost, which can lead to inconsistent characterization and is one of the main reasons for the emergence of evil/manipulative Dumbledore as a common fanfiction trope.
