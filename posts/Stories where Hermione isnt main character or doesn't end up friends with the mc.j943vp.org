I've seen many where Ron and Harry don't become friends but Harry Hermione still do . Or the mc (who isn''t Harry or Hermione) still become friends with Hermione even if they don't with Ron or Harry. I think it saw it once where they were friends with Padma instead of Hermione but Padma acted like Hermione.

So basically looking for some diversity here

Harry doesn't have to be mc and Hermione can't be mc neither can an oc or like sex swapped character like fem Harry ( note that sex swapped characters not the same as trans). MC doesnt have to be "boy-who lived" .

story should be in Harry's gen more plot and friend focused than ship focused but ships are still ok. To clarify Harry's gen isnt just Harry's year. Fred and George are Harry's gen so are Luna and Ginny.

All ships ok including slash no ships are also ok

but no major character x oc , anyone harry's gen x anyone in marauders gen, no incest, no one x bellatrix, no main character ( whoever they are) x Hermione, no main character ( whoever they are) x Daphne ( trying to branch out)


** Dunno about your other criteria, but I've tried to gather all decently written fics that have minimum Hermione.
