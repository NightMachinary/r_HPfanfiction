Basically, the Prime Minister determines that the Death Eaters are an intolerable threat to the security of the world. So, he gives Voldemort an ultimatum: Surrender, or the full British Nuclear arsenal will be detonated within Great Britain, turning the island permanantely uninhabitable.

****** That's the spaceship propelled by dropping nukes out the bottom and riding the explosions.

The primary problems with the project were that:

(1) As proposed, it would launch from the surface of the Earth by nuking it repeatedly.

(2) Even if launched conventionally, a bad launch means pieces of nuclear bombs scattered everywhere at best.

(3) Once we started doing satellites, using it in space anywhere near earth would knock out significant numbers of them.

It's still not a bad idea for deep space (like, interstellar), if one does everything from mining the uranium on in space.

Pretty sure Magical Protection would be able to deal with nuclear explosion and probably fallout. And in the worst case scenario, France is not that far, though they would have to deal with the French wizards . . . and the French.

***** Yeah, but think about it. The Death Eaters firing spells at the shields broke them in about an hour at maximum. Judging from the movies (sadly, the best evidence we have), they were firing spells like Stupefy, which can knock you over and stun you but won't kill you. Stupefy, and spells like it don't do much damage but can break through the shield. Compared to nuclear bombs, spells in that range (Stupefy, Expelliarmus, etc.) are just a tiny shove. If 50 Stupify level spells fired by 50 people, so that's 250 spells can break through the shields in one hour- approximately 4 spells per minute, a nuclear bomb definitely can.

****** You're forgetting one thing, spells are magic, nukes aren't. A nuke's explosion wouldn't breach Hogwarts' wards for the same reason a Muggle grenade wouldn't pierce a Shield Charm, because they aren't magical in their nature. Just like physical and chemical reactions can destroy our physical and chemical bodies, magic can annul other magic.

******** That's not at all comparable. Firstly, magical plants could totally be resistant to knifes. That would make perfect sense.

But secondly, there is a difference between a magical thing and a spell specifically designed to protect. Nobody said normal weapons can't get through /any/ magic. Just not the right shield magic.

********** Rowling literally says magic overrides the mundane and its supported by the text. Magic /is/ superior. Why else would the wizards pretty much have control over the muggle government as we see in HPB Chapter 1?

It wouldn't prove the Death Eaters right at all. Power over someone doesn't mean they're inferior. Nazi Germany was more powerful than many countries but that doesn't mean that Aryans were actually superior to everybody else.

******** I'm sorry, but I can't you seriously if you compare people with dormant magic in their blood and literal active magic flux (also known as spells). Witches and wizards aren't magic only, they're also physical and chemical like any Muggle, they just have dormant magic in their blood in addition (which canon shows to make them actually thougher and more resistant to mundane injuries than Muggles, btw). Spells, on the other hand, are fully and only magical while your petty Muggle weapons are only mundane. You comparing a magic user's resistance to Muggle weapons to defensive spells is like comparing a candle's resistance to a glass of water compared to a forest fire.

Of course a simple steel knife would have more difficulty cutting, say, Mandrake roots, but that's why there is the Severing Charm and why druids and herbalists use silver and golden sickles, the latter two metals being alchemically purer and having unknown (as by the books) but still very existent magical properties. And why would you even clean a magical carpet with a vacuum cleaner when there are literally spells created with the purpose of cleaning things?

** Voldemort agrees, casually portkeys himself and his death eaters to France, then wards a beachside property to get a great viewing of the end of Muggle Britain. Diagon Alley survives thanks to wards (I use these as the word for protective enchantments though I recognize wards are not the canon terminology). Voldemort cackles and the wizarding world turns against muggles.

​

The prime minister put down the telephone as notification of warhead detachment was confirmed. His eyes became cloudy and cleared just as quickly as his mouth opened in horror. Voldemort's imperius curse had been ended.

** Nope. Nope nope nope. If you're gonna have the Muggles win or call a stalemate against the wizards, at least /try/ to make it realistic. Get the government to hire Squibs and wizards loyal to their cause and protect against magic. Have some scientist create a device that protects against mind-control. Have them use some secret MIB-like organization to Obliviate wizards with a 'flashy-thing' and restore memories that the wizards Obliviated/False Memory Charmed from Muggles that saw too much. Have them play 'Crouching moron, hidden badass' for /decades/ to lull wizards into even further complacency. Hell, even have aliens that like Muggles more than wizards come into play to help them out. /Anything/ but this "Gunz and nukez so wizards lose lol" rubbish.
