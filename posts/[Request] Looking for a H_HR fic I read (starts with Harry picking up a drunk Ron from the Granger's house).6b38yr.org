Edit: Found it! linkffn(Picnic Panic by LeQuin )

From what I remember there is some sort of party at the Granger's house (I think a neighborhood party) and Ron is so nervous he shows up drunk so Hermione calls Harry to come pick him up. Harry is pretty much perfect, he is really good with kids, good looking, and helpful. At one point they joke about Harry being a knight but they don't realize he has actually been knighted by the queen for defeating Voldemort. He also becomes a surrogate dad for one of the kids on the block.

Its definitely a guilty pleasure fic for me. Thanks!
