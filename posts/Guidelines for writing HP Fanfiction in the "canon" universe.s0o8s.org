** Brilliant, but I do have to disagree on three points:

First, there are physical limitations to magic. Though they are far less constant than non-magical physical limitations, no physical limitations on magic would lead to all sorts of problems when it comes to magic interacting with the environment.

Okay, first off, I see magic as akin to being a quantum thing, ie a physical phenomena that is badly misunderstood.

If there aren't any physical limitations, then you could just incant a single reducto spell and have it level the entire countryside, given that distance, resistance, gravity etc have no bearing on how powerful the spell would be which, in turn, would mean that it would be very difficult for the person casting the spell to regulate how the spell is going to react given a certain set of instructions.

Spells interact with the physical environment; they affect the physical properties of objects and people, bleed energy in the form of light when casting and, most importantly, can be stopped by physical barriers. There is no way they could do this without there being limits to how powerful a piece of magic that does such a thing can be.

Second; the dark arts anti-magic qualities. Dark spells are mainly used for one thing, namely magical combat. Their ability to bypass magical protections is what makes them such a feared and dangerous weapon in the first place, kinda like owning a rifle in a world of spears and swords. It's not a quality as much as it could be a feature built into the spell from the very beginning. To me, the Dark Arts don't necessarily have to counteract, bypass or destroy any other magic they come across to be seen as dark, but they do have to present a viable enough danger to life, limb and/or sanity to be treated as such. Though, in order to enable the spell to bypass whatever shields stood in its way, could the Dark Arts be using sapient spells?

Third: wizarding warfare. The idea of there not being any fixed territory important enough to hold is ludicrous. Yes, it's harsh, but you manage to contradict yourself five points later; wizards guard their knowledge fiercely. Given how most of their knowledge would have to be written down somewhere, this means that they have to safeguard said repositories of knowledge from attack by others looking to weaken their enemy's knowledge base.

This doesn't mean you are completely wrong here, though. Thanks to apparition and portkeys, wizards don't have to worry about silly things like logistics and transportation. They can just completely skip any areas that have enemies in them and strike at vulnerable spots on command. Guerilla warfare, despite having its many, many uses, would be hard to effectively execute given that the enemy can magically find disturbances and pinpoint the affected areas incredibly rapidly even if the actual aurors themselves are slow and ponderous beasts.

Well, there you have it. My three points of contention to your guideline. Also, I do have to point out that, to me, the magical world is still suffering from social shock due to the events in the 20th century. World War one probably gutted the number of incoming muggleborn, what with most of a generation dying in the trenches. Then you had the troubles of the 20s and 30s, with the rise of a dark lord and the unacknowledged death toll that goes with it. Finally, there was world war 2, which involved both the mundanes and the magicals and ended up gutting yet another generation of muggleborn. Then, you had Voldemort. Which was followed by fourteen years of peace that were barely adequate when trying to replenish a population whose numbers had been steadily dwindling and trickling away. Then Bam! Voldemort rise #2 comes out and, once again, the work of a decade and a half of steady population reconstruction's Azkabanned while a fair chunk of the wizards & witches on the light side were once again butchered like swine.

My take on the wizarding world was one devastated by an incredible death toll, a society that had collapsed three times by the end of Book Seven and hadn't recovered enough by the time 2017 rolled around. What we are witnessing is not so much the wizarding world as a thin veneer of civilisation trying and failing to hide the empty wasteland wizarding Britain had become since the start of the twentieth century.

That's it, rant over. The rest of it is fairly awesome, I think.

*** Firstly, I should note that we appear to have a very different idea of what HP magic is, which may be the source of unresolvable differences. I have found this to be the case in the past. However, that doesn't mean we can't try...

For me, HP magic is essentially anti-physical. The fundamental nature of magic is the ability to defy natural forces, not work with them. So levitation isn't the application of some unknown but physical upwards force, in line with Newtonian mechanics. There's no upwards thrust. Rather, levitation is simply making an object go up, not through any physical mechanism, but... well, by magic. It happens in spite of natural law, not in conjunction with it. (There may be a complex magical mechanism in place, but if so, it has no ontological relation to the forces described by physics).

With this in mind, you can see why I would say that there are no physical limits to magic. It would make my position inconsistent. If magic occurs in spite of physics, then it doesn't make sense to draw lines in the sand along magnitude terms (e.g. a rule like "a shield can stop physical objects, but the faster the object is moving, the more powerful the shield will need to be to stop it"). If a shield stops a physical object in spite of the laws of physics rather than with them, then it's no more difficult to stop a bullet than it is a tennis ball. Both are impossible according to current physics, and impossibility isn't graduated, but binary.

However, you're certainly right that wizards can't summon the moon, or cast Blasting Curses with the power of nuclear bombs. I think this is for two reasons:

1. While magic has no physical limitations, there are such things as magical laws which describe the limits of magic. These limits may look like physical limits (e.g. wizards are severely limited by distance, only capable of affecting their immediate surroundings), but they will be for reasons of magical theory, not physical theory.

2. While magic in itself may have no limitations, wizards do. Further, their understanding of magic is incomplete.

Dark magic:

The problem with classifying dark magic by the idea of magic used for combat, or magic used for harm, is that almost all magic can be used for combat or for harm. The levitation charm could be used to kill someone.

Given this, either all magic is dark magic, or there's no such thing as dark magic and it's just a term used to denote a way of using magic, rather than properties of magic itself.

However, I think there are two problems with this.

1. Very smart wizards who know a lot about magic, such as Dumbledore, talk about dark magic as if it's a real thing and has some intrinsic moral badness.

2. We know there are spells which can't be healed or resist healing, and these are always referred to as dark magic.

Those two points seem to point towards dark magic being some aspect about magic itself, not a social phenomena. And the only common theme in Dark magic appears to be the fact that it resists the attempts of other magic to counter it.

Warfare: you are right that there are locations that wizards care about. However, I phrased it in relative terms: Wizarding infrastructure is much less than Muggle infrastructure, and they rely on it far less. Yes, there are locations of importance - in particular, repositories of knowledge. However, it wouldn't take more than a couple of hours to pack up Hogwarts library and transfer it to a different location. So it's not the location that's important, but what was contained there. The same goes for Hogwarts as a whole: it would be fairly easy to just up and leave for a different location. It's the teachers and the students and the library that's important, not the castle.

** This seems to be less about canon and more about how you perceive the HP world to be. I understand the desire to have it nailed down, but if I'm writing a fanfic the rules I create are the only ones that matter. That's just my opinion of course. Other than that, very thorough.
