  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

** The whole "Cassiopeia Black or whoever has a book full of super useful blackmail that is totally not out of date at all, even years later" thing is a pretty common cliche when people try padding out the Black family with living members. I think it's one of those completely made up "fanon" things that sort of spread like mold to the point where everyone uses it.

Like certain characters who barely exist in canon being complete "ice queens" for example.

**** And let's be real; If /anyone/ is going to have a book containing the locations of all the closet skeletons, out of date or not, it's going to be a Black.

**** Oh, sure. I like it when the Black family is done well, but the trick is finding a story where that happens.
