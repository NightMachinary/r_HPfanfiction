I am looking for recommandations for good Ron story. As much as I love Harry and Hermione, I often see Ron either forgotten, jealous or even Ron-bashing.

I am looking for one where Ron is a real part of the trio and we see what he brings to the friendship.


** I love Ron's characterization in linkao3(A Game of Chess by Kirinin). He's the Ron we deserved to get in canon, but so rarely saw.

#+begin_quote
  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
