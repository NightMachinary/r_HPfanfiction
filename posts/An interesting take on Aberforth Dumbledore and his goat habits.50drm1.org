Chapter 10. The author was nutty enough to say that the goat Aberforth was having sex with was his own brother in his animagus form.

Excluding what's in DLP's restricted section, have you guys read anything as...interesting? There has to be something.


** There's a fic or two out there that uses that as a premise but as a joke that got out of hand. A much younger Albus pranking his brother in goat form coupled with a bunch of villagers misunderstanding. I can't recall which at the moment though.

** The Wizard Who Meddled With Time also has a explanation for the goat story. I believe it happens on chapter 4, but I am not completely sure on that. Linkffn(11420609)

*** To expand on that, for those who don't want to get through it but want to know: [[/spoiler][the goat is really Aberforth's house elf permanently (kind of; she can change back but is happier as she is) changed into a goat due to annoying him with being too stubborn about keeping everything clean, and the reason for him getting punished was casting stuff like that on a house elf]].

  Terrible things happen to wizards who meddle with time. When that wizard is Harry Potter, the terrible things tend to happen to other people instead. Fourth Year. Time Travel.
