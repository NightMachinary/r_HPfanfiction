The action I am speaking of is his taking away the House cup from Slytherin after they were already celebrating there victory.

I got the idea from a story that had a passing Line/thought from Snape were he mentions that he was up half the night comforting his students and giving out sleeping/calming potions.

For older student I Imagine it would have made them bitter and angry.But for younger student Specificity the first years it would have been Quite distressing considering there Emotional maturity and the fact that Dumbledore actually let them start celebrating. Which the more you think about it the crueller it becomes.


** It kind of seems like you're over estimating the effect this has on the kids. Why would the kids need calming or sleeping potions? I can understand them being pissed off, but that seems a bit much.

Also, did Dumbledore say, "Slytherin has House Cup!" and then add, "But wait, here are some more points!" after they cheered? Or did he say, "Slytherin has the most points," and Slytherin interrupted him with cheering, "but there are some last-minute points to award."

**** I'm not sure if you ever played much sport as a kid, but if you've ever been robbed of a seemingly deserved victory in something like a grand final, championship series or just a competition you should be able to relate.

Does it suck? Yes. It it a shitty feeling, to work for something and feel like it's in the bag, only to have it snatched away? Also yes. But if you think a bunch of 11 to 18 year olds aren't able to deal with something like that without resorting to potions, then either you are severely mistaken or they are some very emotionally unstable teenagers.

That's not to say they wouldn't be a bit bitter about it, or that it didn't further fuel the Gryffindor/Slytherin feud, but I think you are overestimating the effects quite a lot. And besides, they would still be bitter over it whether it happened a day or a minute before the award.

***** One thing to note is that of the heads of house when it comes to Snape to me he is in the top 2 when it comes to looking after his students the only reason I don't put him at number one is that we don't know enough about professor Sprout to be able to rate her.

Professor McGonagall comes in third manly because of the conflict of interest she has being the deputy headmistress.

The title of worst head of house goes to professor Flitwick because there is no excuse that he could give that would make what happen to Luna acceptable.

****** Do we actually KNOW (without looking at FANON!) that Snape comforts his students and actually helps them? (With the exception of Draco - where there's a VOW in play when he offers to help etc.) I mean if he helps them like he "teaches" (quotes because what he does isn't IMHO teaching, it's being an asshole at best and endangering his students at worst!) potions, then I wouldn't want to be in his house!

As for Flitwick: If Luna doesn't tell him, then how would he know? (It seems that the heads of house seldom enter the common-rooms and the dormitories even less!) They are not hurting her physically after all, they are "just" (I know that it's not ok - I've been bullied at school myself for 4 long years...it started with my stuff vanishing (and like say having my bag thrown into the girl's bathroom!) and ended with my homework being destroyed and people hitting me during recess and shooting spitballs at me in class (note: My teachers were worse than the Hogwarts ones: They ignored evindence directly in front of them...I am still a little pissed because my parents didn't take them all to court (I would have!)) taking her stuff (and she's an oddball after all, the teachers know that, so maybe they think she missplaces things herself?)

As for McGonagall: She's not a good head of house and "keep your head down" is shitty advice (particularly if you are a supposedly brave person!), as is ignoring students time and time again (the bullying with the badges, the heir of Slytherin thing, the sorcerers stone - I mean is it any wounder that Harry never goes and asks for her advice? Is it any wounder that he rather does things himself - I mean all the adults in his life (with the exception of his parents!) fail at doing their duties (he's neglected at Privet Drive (at best - abused at worst!), he's bullied in school, he has to fight Voldemort (which should be the aurors and the professors business, not that of a student!) etc. etc. - frankly it's a wounder he didn't snap!) - instead of asking for help (even if the outcome of doing so isn't always great, like when Sirius dies!)?)

I agree that we don't know enough about Sprout!

the whole point of this thread is that I would like someone to explore the scenario. yes most of them would have been only mildly upset about it but what about the ones that did have more extreme reactions.

Digging back into my memory about the original line from the story Snape full thought was along the line of that he was up half the night trying to assure 11-18 that no they are not evil even if the rest of the school thinks they are and that they were not being punished for just being sorted into Slytherin. which would be very detrimental to any future ambitions

I don't get it. Are you trying to say that you remember the book saying this? because the book didn't explore Snape's thoughts. If it's just how you imagine his thoughts would be, I think it's both very OoC and a very strange interpretation of the events. Dumbledore certainly didn't imply that Slytherins were evil, and there was certainly no punishment there. Well, it's possible that he was trying to "punish" Snape for being unfair, which, in my opinion, is justified. I certainly didn't see any Slytherins protesting Snape's unfair treatment of Gryffindors.

**** This is the movie, the movies changed a lot of stuff so I was referring to the books. Also, he says exactly what I thought he did. He never took the cup away from them, he simply stated where everyone was in the point system and said that a few more points were needed, which put Gryffindor in first place. I think the students understand perfectly well, it's not that hard to comprehend. Plus, everyone already knew what happened with Quirrel and what Harry and the others did. That's why Harry woke up with a ton of gifts in the hospital wing. I think the movies and the books showed Slytherin being all grumpy about it because it depicted the "evil" house as being sore losers (not a fair depiction, but still).

When I was in school, we had a similar system. My school was one class per grade and everyone worked hard each year to collect the most canned soup or whatever that we would donate to a soup kitchen, and in exchange receive an awesome pizza/ice cream party and a fancy blue ribbon. Nobody cared when someone showed up to school with a huge truckload of cans from some sale four hours away because finding the cans and being competitive was the fun part. Sure, the party was fun, but if we lost because someone's uncle that worked in a restaurant decided to pitch in, we didn't care. And this was a school with kindergarten to 8th grade, so we were pretty young. I think it's actually a good lesson. Sometimes you lose, and that loss can be pretty unexpected. Doesn't mean you didn't try or that you suck, just that someone else managed to come through that time. It's not traumatic. It's life.

** Excerpt from linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), Chapter 4, from Slytherin!Hermione's point of view:

#+begin_quote
  Her good mood was buoyed even further when she entered the Great Hall. She was pleased to see that Harry, Ron, and Neville were all present and in good health, but she was especially happy about the green and silver banners decorating the hall. She had always taken pride in her performance at school, but earning good grades was an inherently solitary activity. Helping Slytherin win the House Cup was a victory that was all the sweeter for being shared.

  On a more practical level, no matter how much her housemates disliked her, she knew they at least appreciated the points she won for Slytherin. And all of the dislike was momentarily set aside as Dumbledore read out the score: Gryffindor with 341 points, Hufflepuff with 347, Ravenclaw with 411, and Slytherin in the lead with 492.

  The cheers at the Slytherin table were momentarily silenced when Dumbledore announced that some final points remained to be awarded. Hermione felt her stomach start to sink as he awarded Neville fifty points for “a tremendous example of recall under pressure” and fifty points to Ron for “the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen these many years.” Dumbledore cleared his throat, and for a moment she dared to hope that he was finished.

  “To Mr. Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points,” Dumbledore said, dashing her hopes. “Assuming that my calculations are correct I believe that a change in decoration is in order!”

  Gryffindor's table burst into cheers as the banners throughout the Great Hall changed from green and silver to crimson and gold. All around Hermione, Slytherin house sat in stunned silence as they tried to process what had just transpired.

  Hermione stared at the head table in disbelief, wondering if Snape would do something to fix this situation. Her head of house did nothing more than grimace slightly in distaste at the headmaster's actions, and the truth sank in: there would be no eleventh hour rescues for Slytherin house.

  She mechanically finished eating the food already on her plate, but the always wonderful food of Hogwarts was ashes on her tongue.

  ooOoo

  Hermione stalked down the corridor of the Hogwarts Express. The three days following the end of year feast had done little to change her disposition, as she-along with most of Slytherin house-had spent that time stewing over how the rug had been pulled out from under them. It hadn't helped that Neville had spent that time successfully avoiding her attempts to pin him down for a conversation. Here on the train, though, there was no Gryffindor-only room to which he could retreat.

  She smiled when she finally located the compartment containing Harry, Ron and Neville. She opened the door and greeted the three of them, but the only response she received were a round of wary stares. Neville started to slowly edge away from her.

  “Thirty two,” Hermione said. Seeing the blank looks on the boys' faces, she continued. “I keep track, you know. Every time I earn points. Add it all up, and on net I earned Slytherin thirty-two points all year.”

  She sat down across from the boys, fixing them with a glare. “What I want to know is what you lot did to earn fifty points in one night. Fifty points each!”

  The cabin remained silent as the three Gryffindors turned to look at each other, apparently weighing their options. Somewhat to her surprise, it was Ron who replied to her question.

  “What we did,” Ron said, “was stop Quirrel from stealing the Philosopher's Stone and using it to bring Voldemort back to life!”

  Hermione stared at Ron for a moment.

  “That makes no sense on so many levels,” Hermione finally said, “that I have no idea where to begin.”

  There was no hesitation now as Ron heatedly recounted the events of the last day of exams. How the three of them had ventured down the forbidden third floor corridor, using music to tame the three-headed dog. How they fell into an enormous Devil's Snare, saved only by Neville's quick recognition of the plant. How Harry's skill on a broom had allowed him to retrieve a flying key. Ron's ability to play his way across a life size game of wizarding chess and finally, Harry casting the strongest shield charm he could manage and charging through flames to confront the shade of the man who had killed his parents.

  It was a hard tale to believe, but as Ron spoke Hermione saw both Harry and Neville nodding along. Neither of them seemed to be surprised by any of the things Ron was saying, and it was hard to imagine that they would coordinate some elaborate deception just to toy with her.

  “That doesn't make sense,” Hermione said, trying to think through the implications, “you interfered with Dumbledore's plans and he rewarded you for it.”

  “Interfered?” Ron asked, affronted. “Quirrel got through all of his defenses and would have gotten the stone if we hadn't showed up.”

  “Those weren't defenses!” Hermione exclaimed. “Look, if you lock a door and you don't want somebody going through, where do you keep the key?”

  The three boys stared at her for a moment before Neville spoke up. “In my pocket?”

  “Exactly!” Hermione said. “You don't leave it in the same room with the locked door, no matter how many enchantments you put on it.”

  “What are you trying to say?” Ron asked.

  “I'm trying to say that you didn't get past defenses-you got past challenges that Dumbledore wanted people to get past,” Hermione replied. “I'm saying that you didn't do anything that was worth one hundred and sixty points-“

  “Will you lay off about the bloody points already?” Harry interrupted, surprisingly vehement. “Quirrel really did try to kill me. When I grabbed him his arm started burning...”

  Harry's voice trailed away as he was obviously lost in memory. Hermione remained silent, slightly ashamed that he thought she had been making light of the danger he had faced.

  “Look, I don't know why Dumbledore awarded us points. I don't know why he does half the things he does,” Harry said. “All I know is that we tried to do the right thing, and we nearly died doing it. If you have a problem with the House Cup, you should be complaining to Dumbledore, not us.”

  The compartment fell silent after that, and Hermione left without saying another word. She felt bad for upsetting Harry like that, but she couldn't help feeling a little irritation herself that none of the Gryffindors seemed to understand how unfairly her house had been treated.

** I feel like no one is giving this thought. OP, it is unlikely anyone is going to specially write that. Snape comforting people isn't going to happen in canon. For others, Snape and Slytherin being bad doesn't make Harry's view or Dumbledore automatically in the right.

Here is the book quotes.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus: in fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw have four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.' A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. ‘Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,' said Dumbledore. ‘However, recent events must be taken into account.' The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.
#+end_quote

Awards 50 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Awards 50 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Awards 60 points. Cheering. Waits for silence. Even on points. Awards 10 points. Explosive cheering.

#+begin_quote
  [Harry] pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind curse put on him. ‘Which means,' Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, ‘we need a little change of decoration.' He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place.
#+end_quote

Harry calls Draco celebrating a sickening sight. So things might be coloured by his viewpoint somewhat. Snape is unfair, however that doesn't mean all points Slytherin gained were unfair nor the other Houses screwed over. And Gryffindor were down 160 points, or at least 40 from Hufflepuff and 110 from Ravenclaw. Do Gryffindor deserve a hell of a lot of points for Harry's actions- of course(#).

Regardless, we know that Dumbledore visited Harry in the hospital as did Ron and Hermione. In all other instances we saw the points were awarded immediately. Dumbledore could have awarded them personally, individually or together, or conferred with the other professors under the circumstances and come to a consensus together.

I don't have a horse in this race, but at its kindest what Dumbledore was for the dramatic. If being unkind drama is used to play on the emotions of people and that means to give some the thrill of victory others must be made to suffer. It may only be in the form of disappointment, but we have to believe there are some humans (people capable of good and bad), some kids, who were gut wrenched, or, as is the case, stunned and horrified.

My opinion would be that when taken in the spirit of the novel it is a fitting end. When objectively viewed as just another school it is a harsh thing to let one House go into the feast with high spirits and revel in their victory only to award it to another.

As far as what you're looking for OP- that requires a particular fan skewed perception. Those who do feel as you do are probably more likely to write it so that Slytherin win. Otherwise I don't know of any, but good luck, some might be out there. I just wouldn't expect someone here to write it for you. If you're looking for a discussion of how actual kids would feel then all I can suggest is contrasting extremes of distress don't help (even if that's what got you thinking about it).

(#)Then again as it was entirely outside the curriculum and technically they broke curfew, and technically Harry didn't save the stone (as it would have remained in the mirror and Dumbledore return); so I don't think it would have been unfair to award Neville points and give the others an award- there is a trophy room- instead of points.

*** I think that makes sense. I think in the books, it mentions that Slytherins had been winning for a long time now (or was that the quidditch cup?), so I didn't feel much sympathy for them. I think it showed Slytherin being horrified to further depict them as the "evil" house by being sore losers. What Dumbledore did was overly dramatic, but maybe he did it because Gryffindor was so low in points others would have wondered where all of those points came from. So if he had to make an announcement about where the points came from, he might as well as just award them right there. But that's a lot of speculation, I can't say for sure that JK thought that hard about it.

***** Dumbledore really didn't explain anything- best chess game, cool logic, courage, bravery. So as far as the school at large is concerned, they still don't really know why the points are awarded.

That being said Percy talks about Ron beating McGonagalls chess set like it was common knowledge. Meaning that perhaps tales of Harry Potter in the hospital wing got out in the school rumour mill. Of course we assume the whole tale wasn't told to the school. That makes sense- no one thought Voldemort was there. But that begs the question- if nothing was told then why would Percy not only understand but be proud that is brother beat a professors work? ie. Hurray for disobeying school rules and endangering his person, breaking curfew, and purposefully trying to get by protections put up by professors in the forbidden corridor. Doesn't sound like Percy.

In summation- clearly some knowledge was out, enough to give context that the curfew breaking trio did something great. Dumbledore's speech didn't explain further. Meaning, as is the case for all other points awarded, it probably made more sense to award the points to their face when he saw them prior. Which, in my opinion, beats leading the Houses on, and he could still say a few short words at the feast already having given the points. Just my two cents.
