The story is a harry potter/witcher crossover taking place in the fallout/elder scrolls fusion verse. Harry's magic doesn't work like it should. When ciri teleports, monsters come after them. The princes of the elder scrolls verse are being awoken and worshipped in the year 2295ish.

But the idea for harry changed recently. The premise: harry potter at 163 is the mage-general of a United Earth. Most muggles are dead due to world war iii. Earth is dying. Wizards are sending out scouts to alternate universes looking for either a world to colonize or technology or magic to save their planet.

Originally harry was going to be about 20, dumbledore was the mage-general, and harry a scout.

I changed it recently to harry potter ii is the grandson of harry. He's just finished blackguard auror training, the elite of hitwizards. But harry ii is dying. His mind is slowly deteriorating. He goes to visit his grandfather then attacks the old man. Four days later, harry awakes to find his 163 year old body dead and a coterie of mages having done a very illegal mind transfer to copy Harry into his grandson's body. Unable to cope with this shitty, but well meant, action, Harry volunteers to be a scout. He ends up on a new earth where he has to scout out potential tech and magic, send it back, earn Galleons(the cost to talk to the scouts on other worlds is insane and thus any shit he finds that can help his earth earns money to get him more supplies), and eventually meets a person or two from fallout 4 but the story takes place in atlanta, georgia.

Anyway, my big issue is this: how do you think an older harry who's dandled great great grandkids on his knee would deal with a descendant doing what he did because harry ii wanted his grandfather to continue to live long enough to make sure their world/people survive. And Harry beginning to fall in love again with Ciri, the woman he travels with after she saves him from a deathclaw then he saves her from a raider gang.

Anyway, it's been a while, hey All.
