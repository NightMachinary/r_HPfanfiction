so it was a fic with harry being raised by voldemort, he also is dating ‘noir' like the king of vampires and in one scene noir bites him not to turn him but to like transfer healing abilities and such, he goes to durmstramg at on point too. i'm pretty sure it was on ffn if that helps.

edit// 128 days later i found it! it's “a different life”
