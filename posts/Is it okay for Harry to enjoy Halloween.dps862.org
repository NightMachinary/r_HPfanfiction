Since it is Halloween today, the question kept popping up in my mind: would he enjoy the holiday?

Yes, he lost his parents on the day -- regardless of whether or not he knew them -- and that can take the joy out of the holiday. But, at the same time, it isn't out of the question for some people who experienced tragedy on holidays, to still enjoy the actual holiday itself? This is especially true, if Harry has kids who enjoy Halloween.


** It's not like he really connects those events. If you are older and something like that happens stuff like costumes or certain foods will remind you. My cousin died on Halloween when I was 15 so I'll think “oh I wore that costume that day” or “she wanted to dress up as ...” or “about this time of the day I found out what happend” - Harry doesn't have any of that.

** It never bothered him in the books, I don't understand why people think it would later. He has a nice time in 1st and 3rd year and wishes he was having a nice time in 2nd. It's an arbitrary date, he doesn't have to get soppy.

** Honestly? Yes, he can enjoy it. And he can allow his kids to enjoy it.

** Halloween is the night the trio was formed. How many people can pinpoint the exact day they created lifelong friendships.

** You could easily write it either way because in the books Harry's reaction to trauma is pretty damn inconsistent. Sometimes he reacts along the lines of what you'd expect, other times it hits him with all the impact of a BB fired at a battleship.

Personally, I really don't see him having an emotional connection to the date. He has deep feeling of loss/longing of an orphan, but the association with the date wasn't really hammered in by young childhood or trauma. He only heard about it later, then experienced the memory on a different random day. I'd expect him to have more trouble witnessing love between parents and children than the day.

I have no expertise or experience with this though, so I could certainly be wrong.

** I doubt harry would consider it Joyful

I imagine during halloween with his kids, he would let ginny take command and just fade into the background maybe going over to ron and hermiones to have a quite drink

I imagine Arthur and molly put on an amazing Halloween party for the kids.

** Normally I would say no...but I actually don't think he ever really references Halloween as /the/ day where they all died. He certainly knows, but it never really gets mentioned or discussed that he feels bad on Halloween because of it.

Maybe because of the bs story his foster family fed him for so long, maybe because he feels so disconnected from the events, and maybe because there is simply too much going on at the time to really worry about what happened then. Nobody else seems to make note of it on Halloween, they still hold feasts without mentioning the War every year.

** Realistically speaking, he probably wouldn't. Harry has a lot of reverence for his parents and deeply resents his orphanhood. He's constantly getting into arguments in their honour. The Dementors affect him by drawing out the memory of their death, despite the fact that he's lived with an abusive family, and has been in several life threatening situations since then.

The whole Halloween thing is pretty weird, actually. I can't see a Wizarding World in which Halloween wouldn't become a macabre celebration of the Vanquishing of You Know Who by Harry, and if JKR was consistent with the portrayal of societal cause and effect, I imagine there'd be a lot of people pointing at Harry and constant reminders of his own loss and how happy it makes other people, which would both make him not in the mood for celebrating. It annoys me that this huge plot point gets ignored in canon.

** Does Harry actually know that they died on Halloween night, though? I'm wracking my brain but for the life of me I can't remember when or even if he learns that little tidbit.

*** I don't think he learns in that context but rather it was on Halloween that Voldemort vanished the first time after failing to kill Harry, which is therefore the night his parents died.

**** Okay, but does Harry know for a fact that Voldemort vanished on Halloween too? Or would this all be a case of characters knowing things they shouldn't because it's audience knowledge?

** He really never has the faintest indication he doesn't enjoy it.\\
He has no reason to associate it with anything bad (not counting the various events in the books, which could admittedly make one a tad paranoid about that date)
