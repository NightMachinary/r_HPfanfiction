I've pretty much never read this type of fic before, and I'm interested in the ways someone could approach this.


** The Mind Arts ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts]]) has a mentor Dumbledore and not quite a bashed Hermione, but she refuse to see his flaw and felt to the second plan (don't know if it will turn into "bashing" since the author don't seem to bash anyone but close enough).

I remember another one Harry/Daphne with a bashed Hermione and where Dumbledore began the same way but saw his errors in the middle and completely changed how he treated Harry (stopped backing Snape, brought Harry to a Transfiguration Guild and maybe even become Minister), I'll try to look it up.

Edit : Looked it up, almost certain is is Defiance : ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12516323/1/Defiance]]).

*** Defiance is, without a doubt, one of the most interesting super Harry fics I have had the pleasure of reading. Thank you for telling me about it!
