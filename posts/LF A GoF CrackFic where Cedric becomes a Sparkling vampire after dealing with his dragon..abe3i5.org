Pretty much as the title says. I'm pretty sure it was based on Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion. All I remember is that Cedric doesn't do well against his dragon and somehow ends up coming out a vampire who sparkles (ala Twilight). Cho seems to like him that way.

Any help would be greatly appreciated as this is driving me batty.

I remember something similar along those lines in this, if it's the fic I'm thinking of.
