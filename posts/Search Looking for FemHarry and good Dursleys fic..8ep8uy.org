I forgot the title, it was on AO3, and Harry was a girl, and it was honestly the only fem!Harry fic I read where it was actually compelling. All I remember is that Vernon was the first of the Dursleys to actually start treating her better because he felt guilty for treating a baby girl like crap, and he teaches Dudley to be kind to her and it takes Petunia some time but eventually she starts accepting her. I really hate that I've forgotten the actual title.


** Any other details?
