So I have a fanfiction I've been writing.

This one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13387005/1/My-Life-as-a-Teenage-Gladiator]]

I do a lot of art in my off time, and I'm considering drawing illustrations for it as I now have an Ao3 account thatbi can post them in.

Would that be weird?

Would that be something ya'll would want?


** You'll get the whole range:

- People who will read the story only because it has drawings

- People who like the addition of drawings

- People who don't care either way

- People who dislike the addition of drawings

- People who will refuse to read the story solely because it has drawings

Bottom line, do it for you. If you enjoy it, that will come across in your work and others will enjoy it as well.
