Something like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] by Astolat or [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/205064/chapters/304642][Song of Songs]] / [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/209072/chapters/312422][Busman's Holiday]] by Mad_Martha.

(ps I highly recommend these, especially Song of Songs & House Proud)

I don't care about pairings, I just want the fic to be high quality. Thanks y'all!


** There's an unfinished fic on Spacebattles called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harrys-island-home-harry-potter-that-flies-off-the-rails-quickly.325447/][Harry's Island Home]] which has young Harry being built an island (with house) and then improving it.

*** It is brilliant and high quality, but remember you have to get through the first bunch of chapters which is filled with diagon alley characters. Harry etc only come in later.

As much I love DireSquirrel and her writing, very few stories other than oneshots have actually been completed so be forewarned

** Building it Together - linkffn(10615911) - This is similar to House Proud, just a slightly different take on things.

  Forced proximity can only lead to bad things, right? Right. (Written for hd tropes 2014. Trope: Forced bed sharing)

** If there were a TV series in the wizarding world about refurbishing wizard homes and exorcising ghosts and poltergeists from them, would it be called "This Old Haunt"?

*** Lockhart could host it.

"So, Ron's friend Harry told me that Ron is a huge Chudley Cannons fan. Naturally, I thought of making him a Cannons themed bedroom, but the Chudley orange is just horrible, so instead Ron will be getting a Gilderoy Lockhart theme, complete with signed first editions of all my books, and I'll throw in a couple Cannons tickets too, I guess. I'm sure he'll love it. It is /me/, after all."

*** Astolat is one of my favourite fic writers! She's written a bunch of HP fic, all of which I'd highly recommend.

(IRL she's Naomi Novik, author of Temeraire)

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
