I was imagining fun ways in which 'the power he knows not' could work and I thought of Harry is too beautiful to hurt.

Harry has a great childhood at the dursleys because they just can't bring themselves to hurt him. His bright eyes and endearing smile warm their hearts.

He gets to gringotts and the goblins can't being themselves to be rude because he's just too pretty to make sad.

Quirrel can't bring himself to hurt the little angel and ends up wasting too much time talking to harry to actually try and get the stone.

The basilisk ends up declaring harry it's son and refuses toms orders to hurt him because he's so cute.

The dementors can't stand to be near him because he's just too pure and bright. It's painful to be near him.

The dragon gives him the egg when he asks for it. The merpeople give him back his most important person because he flirts with them. He escapes the dark lord because voldemort developed a little crush and wanted to impress harry with his kindness.

Just cracky things like that where Harry just gets by because people can't think properly around him because he's too fucking pretty.


** It makes me think of that crackfic where all manner of dark creatures are so attracted to Harry's super dark aura that voldy just doesn't have an army and gives up

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

He bravely confronts Rita skeeter to stop bullying Hermione, and now she's flirting with him through her articles. Malfoy wants his attention even more, but most of all, wants to capture one of his hairlocks to finally be potter for a day as well. Bellatrix just wants to cuddle him close because look at him he's so cute when he did a big angry and yes dear that is how you cast an unforgivable.

** Have you read the Graceling series by Kristin Cashore? One of the books is [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Cashore_novel][Fire]]) and has 'monsters'- animals that are an anomaly among their kind because their brilliant colors make them beautiful and irresistible, like a compulsion. Wild animals that are 'monsters' often don't live long because they are hunted down. The book tells the story of the last /human/ monster and what she goes through when her father used his powers for evil and she just wants to be left alone but her appearance drives everyone closer to her.

Your prompt kind of reminded me of that. Harry could be one of the monsters but instead of getting it from his parents it could also be a power passed down from Riddle like/instead of parseltongue. Riddle used it to control others and gain followers and build his Death Eaters- Harry of course wants to be /'just Harry.'/

****** there are four books in the series and fire is set in the world as book two something of a prequel, it should also be noted that "monsters" just aren't just "too with pretty with their bright colors" they are legitimately terrifying creatures who can control the minds of non-monster creatures. her father was a legitimate monster, not just a "monster" he thought of himself basically like a god and that he could do anything to them. also, monster creatures are more deadly than regular creatures, not less they would mind-controlling regular animals into walking into their mouths something that makes them more terrifying is that they would also do this to children. monster is brightly colored with all colors of the rainbow the main character has bright fire-colored hair. while monster does attract normal creatures and humans in a sort of "charm" they also arent more likely to get eaten than normal it's more like being hypnotised with other animals breaking their normal habits hypnotized just to stare at them to the point that without outside prompting they would just sit there and wast away not meaning any rudeness I just don't want anyone coming into these books with misconception the Graceling series is a very dark story but it is also a very compelling story about overcoming hardship and finding your inner strength. one of the main themes of the story in the second and third books is not following the evil of one's parent. I love this story so much but it's not some light fluffy stories and the first book Graceling has nothing to do with the continent that fire takes place on and there is no monster instead there are only humans with graces supernatural powers or skills that only show up in humans with heterochromia two eyes with different color and is a really really good story in its own right. there is some connection but ill leave that unstated

** crack-fic powers, activate:

During 2nd year, Harry has an urge not to look like Goyle and grabs Hermione's polyjuice instead. Ron and Hermione grudgingly accomplish the mission, though they're totally caught up in arguing about the merits of boy bodies on the way back.

For Harry, the problem is quite different. He isn't upset, but does appear somewhat sullen on their way to the hospital wing. It's just that he doesn't want to cure it, really. The change has fixed (and improved) his eyesight. Pomfrey is unusually agreeable to his retaining the changes, as she finds his purring very soothing. if there's any detriment, it's that he can't return to the Dursley's - like that would upset him in the least.

Albus insists that he needs to be transformed back into a muggle-acceptable form. With cooperation from Pomfrey, McG, and Snape, Harry becomes mostly human, though his cat ears hide in his unruly (but touchably soft) head of hair. When he lets the ears pop out, it's like Veela Allure, only in cuteness.

** Hermione had gotten caught up following Harry. /Yet another/ 7th-year girl had stopped him in the hall. Then a wizard in stunning pearlescent-orange robes had walked right up to Harry, "I'm Calvin Twilfitt and I think you should be my next robe model."

"Thanks! said Harry, and they continued on. Hermione, agitated, whispered "What is he even doing in the castle? And he didn't ask for your name or give you any information!"

Harry shrugged, "He'll figure it out."

"We're so late for potions!" huffed Hermione, but when they walked in, Snape said "Who has dared to interrupt my- oh, hello Harry! My apologies, please take your seats. Malfoy, share your notes with Mister Potter."

"Gladly, sir!" said Draco, enthusiastically patting the seat next to his.

After dinner, Hermione almost ran to Dumbledore's office.

"How's Harry?"

Hermione's frustration was apparent, "We were late to potions and instead of being angry at us, Snape apologized!"

Dumbledore nodded, "Well, beautiful people are treated differently from moderately... pleasant-looking people. They live in a bubble."

"How did Harry turn out as well as he did going through life like that?" asked Hermione

"The bubble isn't always a bad thing, look at me. Granger, I don't share this often, but this is a picture of me when I was 25 years old."

Hermione was dumbstruck, "What the...what? You looked like Godric Gryffindor!"

"I know."

"And your eyes were so much more twinkly. What happened to your eyes?"

"My point is, Granger, the bubble doesn't last forever."

Hermione was still looking at the picture, "Can I keep that?"

"No. It's my only copy."

**** I think Luna would work better as a child of Morpheus (he's specifically the god of dreams) rather than the Hypnos (the general god of sleep). Or maybe Apollo, and you could have wrackspurts and whatnot be a type of oracle-adjacent thing. Iris or a minor cloud nymph (not a god, I know, but pretty close) could also work.

​

Do you mean Ares or is "areas" a different god?

​

If Roman variants are fine, I think I might make Ron a child of Mars rather than Ares (his chess feels like it'd fall closer to Mars than Ares since Mars had more strategy). Nike might also be kinda funny (since he isn't particularly amazing at anything) and fit his ambitiousness, but I'm not sure if it'd work otherwise.

​

I think Ares would be totally fine for Ginny, but if you wanted to go more obscure, maybe she could be a child of Nemesis.

​

I think it could be kinda funny to have Draco be a Legacy - one of his relatives was the direct child of a god rather than Draco himself. Actually, depending on how far you want to bring the AU, maybe most of the Pureblood families are Legacies.

​

If Voldemort is a threat in this AU, I think he'd need to be a Demigod too. Hades might work well, but I don't want to go for some sort of "children of Hades are typically evil" thing. One of the other war gods like Eris (strife) or Deimos (terror) might work well. Or maybe just Hecate so as to justify his great magic power.

​

Also, did you mean to spell "Hermione Granger" as "Harmony Grander" and "Demeter" as "diameter"?

***** spelling fixed

I meant to make luna a child of the god of dreams I just got confused ill fix that, thank you. she has been adjacent to an oracle in a lot of HP fanfics and I like the idea of her just being quirky more with a sort of dreamy disconnect from the world. ultimately it would be up to debate whether she is oracle adjacent.

as for Ron I made a discovery above and changed my mind to Athena. it fits when you think about it. with the spiders being one of the bigger indicators.

ginny is more aggressive than vengeful or particularly can revengeful, I can see Bellatrix as a child of nemesis

also having the noble families being legacies makes so much sense and puts blood purity as something that makes so much sense and something that non-fanatical could believe in, something that might even hold some truth and event adds an extra layer to blood purity when it comes to muggle demi-gods and immortal "witches" that are the children of gods/Hekate but might not show a talent for anything but manipulating the mist

Draco specifically I could see as a descendant of pluto but specifically in his god of riches epithet, being the reason behind their riches and maybe even their luck and cockroach-like survivability

the black family probably being descended from Dionysus specifically in his madness epithet giving them both more power darkness connections and the famous "black madness"

the dumbledore would be descended from Heckat as both a direct descendant and as a dem-god of her showing the family's extreme magical aptitude.

the Weasleys being a rambunctious mix of war gods and bestial gods showing their power but more directly molly is a daughter of Hestia shown whenever she is protecting her home and family "not my daughter you bitch" being the most prevalent example of this (perhaps changed to her using powerful fire magic turning Bellatrix to ash rather than freezing her)

the family that madam Pomfrey being a legacy of apollo

the Longbottom's would have their legacies in mars on both sides of his family making him something of a war hopeful making his more natural and plant biased magic a bit of a letdown (whose until he shows how devastatingly it can be used in war

the Lovegood's would have roots in more knowledge biased gods but more recently lunas father is a son of Dionysus

finally, the penultimate we have Voldemort and the marvolo bloodline for Voldemort himself not be a son of Thanatos and his fear of death would at first come of living an uninteresting life and ending up standing In the of standing in the fields of asphodel forever, however after he creates the first Horcrux he would fear the fields of punishment he would want to live forever so that he doesn't have to face his punishment. Over time, however, he would stop running from death and start running towards godhood so he never sees death. marvolo bloodline would be one that has not had a significant infusion of new blood either divine or mortal in nature and my opinion might surprise you it would either be Demeter or just some random saytr, given that the gift to speak to animals is one that is almost entirely exclusive to nature biased whether that's a deity or saytrs and since they almost exclusively have kids within the clan there would be no or almost no other deities to make them more complicated than that.

** Plot-twist: Harry is actually an Eldritch abomination, a young one, that believes it's a mortal/Harry Potter.

Only a few people can see the truth, which includes Voldemort: All others, including Dumbledore, just can't see it.

It doesn't help that an unknowing Harry genuinely has a sweet, innocent personality.

*** Ugh, let people do what they want. Fanfiction writing can be anything anyone wants. It doesn't have to be canonical, it doesn't have to be just like the books. If I wanted to write a fanfic where everyone was completely out of character or Harry Potter was so evil that Voldemort trembled, I could, because fanfic is exactly that- fan written fiction. It doesn't have to be canon. Let people have fun and stop being such a jerk.
