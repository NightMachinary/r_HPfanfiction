** I mean, asking for feedback/constructive criticism in an AN isn't in bad taste I would think. If you still feel uncomfortable, just add an 'I'd like to improve my writing so if you have time please leave some feedback'. Something along those lines :)

** I definitely suggest letting readers know if you're okay with receiving criticism. Some people will only offer criticism if they're sure the author wants it, because many authors don't.

Begging/blackmailing for reviews ("I'll only put up the next chapter if I get 10 reviews") is more commonly thought to be in bad taste, but it doesn't sound like you're considering that.

I find that the longer a fic lasts, the more it develops a following, and you'll get more reviews on later chapters as a result. (The exception is the first chapter, which often has a high review count compared to following chapters.) Climactic chapters and cliffhangers get more reviews, too, if it's the sort of fic to have climaxes and cliffhangers.

** Back when I was writing, reviews were coming in naturally, I never had to ask for them. One tip, one of the worst things you can do is get salty about negative reviews. That includes flaming. Just don't let it get to you, having a temper tantrum in an A/N is a good way of losing reviewers.

** I believe that you should always write for yourself. ALWAYS. Tell the story that you want to tell, not because you need praise or reviews, but because it is bottled up inside you and it needs to get out. Don't let criticism or negative reviews discourage you from telling your story.

The creative act - making music, writing, creating works of art - is fucking terrifying. Musicians, writers and artists spend so much time punishing and criticizing themselves, but they create because they have something to share. The act of putting your work out there for other people to see is a courageous leap.

Don't write because you want accolades. Write because you love it and you can't stop.

** I struggled to get any attention for all of the 5/6 years I was writing and posting fanfiction. I tried asking, not asking, posting on forums . . . it was soul destroying. Some fics and some writers get attention, others don't. I don't really know why. Maybe some are just better than others or maybe they are just plugged into that indefinable thing readers want at the time.

*** A lot of stories that have hundreds or thousands of reviews are like that because they're written more immaturely so naturally younger people will read them. Kids will more commonly review or comment on the contents on the chapter and not review the actual writing style or direction of the plot. Or you'll get a lot of â€˜update please' sort of things directly after you've updated a 10k chapter.
