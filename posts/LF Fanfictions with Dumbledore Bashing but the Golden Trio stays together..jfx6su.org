Good Ron, Hermione and Harry with bad Dumbledore. No slash.


** Ok, I have no real recommendations to give you, but now I kinda want an Injustice-like story of a scrappy golden trio having to figure out a way to kill an all-powerful Dumbledore in a distopic setting.

** Ooooooooh yoI know it's a good prospect for a fic, but I cannot think of a single one...actually. I can. But I don't know if you'll like it because they don't do much stay together as...Harry and Ron die together and then Hermione goes back in time

It's still being written, but I'm pretty sure all of what will be written of them (Harry and Ron) has been written though, so if you want a morsel, I'll track it down for you.

** "Saying No" by Bobmin356. Half serious, half crack. No pairings. 6th year

"The Betrothal expanded" by slytherinsal. 4th year. Not heavy Dumbledore bashing IIRC, but he definitely gets thwarted. Mentions of sexual abuse.

#+begin_quote
  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
