Or just Harry that isn't so easily manipulated by others and is more handsome/popular around the school (sorta like Sirius or Cedric) preferably over 100k words


** HP and the Wastelands of Time has a very confident Harry. Mainly due to the fact that every time he dies, he wakes up in the summer of '96.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** Harry is quite confident and popular in Harry the Weapon by SlytherinSal and Tale of a Tail by birdwoman95. Note that there is Dumbledore bashing in both of these, so if that bothers you, just move on to the next recommendation.

  Vernon gets the smarts when accidental magic in response to a bellow breaks the compulsion to be mean to Harry. He is well sore with the magical world which is making a child soldier by grooming Harry, so he decides to turn the weapon back on them by teaching Harry all he needs to survive.

  An AU kicking off mostly from where Hagrid picks up Harry, though he's very AU. Some OC, but mostly just independent Harry. No pairings. Rating for some languageish things. Writing is complete, but will add one chapter a week, when I remember to (only 5 or 6 long, can't remember which).

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
