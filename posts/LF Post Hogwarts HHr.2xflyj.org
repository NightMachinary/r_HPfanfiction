I remember a fanfic I read a while ago and I was trying to find it again. What I remember about it was that it started off with Teddy and Victoria cutting thru the forest and they get to a lake and waterfall and this was actually where Harry self-exiled himself and he is making it into a kind of wildlife preserve. I remember that Luna visits from time to time and that Hermione was lonely and teaching at Hogwarts and the story is about her reconnecting with Harry. Oh I remember that Harry became an animagus that I think was a panther(maybe a wolf). Does anyone remember what it was called or has a link? Please and Thank You!
