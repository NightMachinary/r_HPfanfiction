Are there fics where the discriminations against muggle-borns are used more subtly, that somewhat reflects how it is in the real world? Say a pureblood family who would never use the word "mudblood", but still somehow show signs of prejudice. In the same vein of get out, or the hunt.

Would really appreciate recommendations.

Edit:

Glad you guys are paying attention to this post, and I appreciate all of your recommendations. I did not expect this post to delve into social issue discussions, but hey, if that's where the conversation is going, that's where it's going.

A few points I want to address:

- I am aware of this portrayal in canon (i.e Slughorn) and/or fanon, but I am looking for fics that have a main theme of it.

- The reason I wanted to read these kinds of topics is that obviously, it draws a parallel between the real world and HPverse, but also I am interested in a different sort of villainy after reading so many genocidal fics. I mainly got this drive after watching a youtube video talking about the HBO show, Watchmen. The Youtuber discussed how a more interesting (storytelling-wise) villain perhaps is not one who joins the death eaters and murders muggles, but a non-visible, non-intentional, institutionalized discrimination deeply rooted in culture. Here is the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONrideBdiZA&t=8327s&ab_channel=MacabreStorytelling][video]] if you are interested.

- If this sort of discrimination is shown in a fic but not recognized, perhaps that can raise another topic for discussion.


** I don't exactly have a recommendation but I have examples of tropes that fit your request that someone might read and recognise and be able to rec a fic for you:

- “Muggleborns are discriminated against by Purebloods because they refuse to assimilate into wizarding culture” trope. Speaking as an English person, it's very reflective of the attitude that a lot of older people I know take towards immigrants. It's very “I'm not racist, /but/”. They point to their neighbour and say things like “see, he's one of the good ones! He doesn't bring his weird religion into our country”.

- The belief that Muggleborns are innately less powerful. This one is quite subtle because the Pureblood family wouldn't /hate/ Muggleborns. They'd wouldn't curse them in the street, but they would pass over promoting a Muggleborn because they believe they're innately worse at their job. This reflects scientific racism and sexism in the real world, like when people thought that black people and women had lower IQs, which was bullshit. I think linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) has this.

I see far too many of those Slytherin Harry fics where they paint Slytherins and purebloods to be the /real/ oppressed group. They're like “Muggle traditions have replaced wizarding ones, muggleborns made us replace Samhain with Halloween and outlawed all dark magic (which isn't harmful magic at all!)”, like do they /really/ think that muggleborns have the political power to do that? Unbelievable.

It would probably be more accurate to say that the trope shows prejudice and discrimination but doesn't recognise it as discrimination.

Basically everything that's written in fiction can be applied to real life in one way or another. So it's really advisable to think about that before you write. And if you're deliberately writing something that can be without any problems, without being taken out of context or (deliberately) misunderstood, used by racist people to advertise their views then you're doing something wrong.

*********** Yes writing something is absolutely advertising something. And the way how you write it decides what it is that you're advertising. If you write about a racist society and paint them as the good guys, you're advertising racism. If you're writing about a racist society but make it clear that the behaviours they're portraying are racist and therefore bad, then you're writing /about/ racism. It can be a way to raise awareness about how racism works in society, to help people recognise certain behaviours and avoid them/call them out.

It's practically impossible to write something without advertising certain opinions, concepts, whatever and it's the writers responsibility to make sure those things aren't a buch of racist propaganda.

Racism is a subtle thing. It's everywhere in everyday life and a lot of people have to suffer on a daily basis because of it. Racism is a nuanced things and people can be racist without even realising they are. And there very much are people who question the morality of it. People who are openly racist and justify their behaviour with some warped kind of reasoning. And if you then go ahead and write something where racism is a good thing, those people will use it as a justification for their behaviour. People who don't know they're racist will keep on displaying their racist behaviour because it's portrayed as normal and good in those stories. And if you don't want to be part of that and support those views, then don't write them into your story as something good.

I‘ll by the way take it as a compliment to my english skills that you think I‘m american.

And that's where I'm saying it's the reader's problem, not the writer's. You don't police what people write just because it goes against the norm.

I didn't live through it, but I was born during a dictatorship. You don't tell pople what to write and what not to write just because it's not "PC". That's just not ok to me.

Someone who's never had racist views will have no problem with a "racist" piece of art.

Someone who's already a racist had previous problems, so the writer's not responsible for it.

And someone on the fence, it's the same. Something else made them doubt. If you go "See? Racism is good because this story I read!", then you have deeper issues.

*************** I‘m not forbidding people from writing something. I'm just saying what not to write if you don't want to have a certain outcome. That's like saying „don't jump off that building if you don't want to die“. „Don't write that unless you want to participate in advertising racism“.

And racism really isn't a either you are or aren't thing. It's, as I said, very nuanced. Not wanting to go out and kill people because of their nationality/ethnicity or something else doesn't mean you can't be racist. It's in a lot of smaller things too. „I‘m not racist, I have a black friend. Why can't other black people be more like him, then they wouldn't have any problems.“ ~ a person who is most likely not aware they're racist but still is and will be encouraged in their behaviour by reading stories where that kind of behaviour is advertised.

Also writing racist stuff unfortunately doesn't go against the norm. That's very much the problem here. It's way too normalised.

And nobody will say „see racism is good because of this story I read“. If the stories we‘re talking about would advertise the displayed behaviour as racism, we wouldn't have any problem. The thing is that they just show the racist behaviour and portray it as a good thing without ever making clear that it's racist. If it was „oh yeah, from the POV I show it here, it's shown as good, but it's actually racist“, it‘s fine. Racism is bad. No question there. Barely anyone who's racist would call themselves racist. They know racism is bad. They'll instead go on and say things like „I'm not racist, /but/“.

But those fanfictions don't do that. They don't call the displayed behaviour racism. They just portray the racist behaviour, and people will read it, unaware that it is racist and then they will translate this behaviour into real life and feel justified.

***** I've seen a few good ones with this trope. That these traditions were there for a reason that actually had impact on both behaviour, and magic itself. I will always classify any magic that requires negative intent, or can only be used to harm as dark. If it's just powerful magic that can actually be used in a variety of ways both good and bad, it's not dark.

With the traditions, I remember this story where magic wasn't just energy, but also had a form of sentience, and that these traditions helped bolster your connection to certain aspects of magic depending on what traditions you follow, and also helped keep you sane even. As in that the reason that most Muggleborns "went native," is because magic has a certain relationship with magicals, and that going against it would just do more harm than good. Something like a check and balances type of system that allowed people incredible powers, but also made sure that others had it also. Also the reason Magic couldn't work with science is, because if that was possible, it may have allowed an individual to have way too much power, and thrown the balance all out of order. Like Magic nukes for example.

She also pulled examples from what was on JK's website at the time (this was back in like 2011 so Pottermore wasn't around yet and neither was the canon bloating that we have today).

****** That's kind of missing the point though. It's basically inventing a problem to justify the purebloods racism against muggleborns and muggleborns having to give up their own culture.

It would be a cool thing in another setting. But as it is in Harry Potter, purebloods are in power and muggleborns are discriminated against. Muggleborns aren't making any laws and forbidding any traditions. Purebloods can basically do what they want, I mean a bunch of them had no problems buying their way out of prison after the first war. No one is stopping them from practicing any traditions. It's never a question that the magic that is forbidden are things like the unforgivables and that they're simply designed to harm people.

So what reason is there to desperately want to find a reason to justify the purebloods behaviour when in canon there never was any questions that it's just plain racism?

Basically, if it's in a pretty canon setting and just an excuse to have muggleborns as the bad guy or as an excuse to have them give up their culture and show the wizard way of living as superior, it's morally questionable at least.

I think there's a way to show some nuance with it - particularly if you demonstrate that muggleborns are making up a greater and greater percentage of new witches and wizards and just by pure numbers they are culturally making the magical world more muggle culture esque. Because cultural destruction is also not a good thing - we see this a lot in history when you look at how indigenous populations have lost so much of their culture and tradition due to immigrants.

I also think there's a huge difference between lamenting that ancient holidays are not practiced anymore/shunned than complaining about changing archaic and discriminatory educational, economical, and political systems.

I think there is a great different between people finding land and starting to oppress and kill the people already living there, and culture slightly changing with time due to outside influences. Nobody stops the old families of still doing what they want. They won't be discriminated against because they don't celebrate Halloween or something, they're very much still the ones in power.

Cultures, language, basically everything changes over time, that's just what happens. There's nothing wrong with that happening and there is nothing wrong with holding on to traditions.

Some stories construct as more of cultural shock, others diss the Muggleborn for stuff like criticizing Wizarding Customs that the story has (Samhain, Yule, rituals, etc)

  Speaking as an English person, it's very reflective of the attitude that a lot of older people I know take towards immigrants. It's very “I'm not racist, but”. They point to their neighbour and say things like “see, he's one of the good ones! He doesn't bring his weird religion into our country”.

I am an immigrant. I moved with my family from Bashkiria, Russia to America in 2004. This isn't racism, immigrants /should/ assimilate into their chosen culture. You don't get to move to another country and demand the community around you accommodate your culture. Now if you said "they must forgot their roots and denounce their culture" or something along those lines then sure. But assimilating into your new country should be expected, not treated as racist.

And the main problem I've seen is that these attitudes generalise to the whole group. These old English people see an immigrant (who you can't identify on sight of course, so they just go for skin colour) and immediately assume all these things about them. And then this hatred of immigrants leads to ridiculous things like Brexit.

****** That's actually an interesting example, because clothes are the only real canonical difference that suggest that wizarding and Muggle worlds might have different cultures (apart from magic and lack of tech, lol). But in canon we don't see any muggleborns complaining about it at all- you would expect it would be the first thing they changed, if they really were in charge and able to demand culture changes. That, to me, proves that there's no basis for the “muggleborns hate wizarding culture” trope in the HP universe. An author could invent it if they want though, but they should make it clear that they're changing canon, not explaining it.

My version would be this: A few muggleborns question the need for robes or they wear Muggle clothes on the weekends, and it gets publicised in the media. “Muggleborns hate wizarding clothes!” says the +Daily Mail+ Daily Prophet, and people start talking about how Muggleborns must be disrespectful of wizarding culture. And then maybe a Muggleborn kills a Pureblood and that gets publicised too- “Hate crime against Purebloods?” - never mind the much higher stats of Purebloods killing Muggles and muggleborns. People start to see Muggleborns as invaders, encroaching on their lives. Fudge introduces a bill to calm down the public- it's not going to get passed, of course, it's just for show. But suddenly you've got +UKIP+ the Wizarding Independence Party backing it, suddenly you've got the mums backing it because they “don't want Muggleborns taking up my child's place in our good schools”. Malfoy pays for an ad on the Knight Bus which says “we'd save 1 million Galleons by completely separating from the Muggle world” (no one knows where he got that stat from). And the bill passes, and suddenly all Muggleborns get put on a list. They have to prove that they didn't steal their magic, and Aurors raid the homes of suspected Muggleborns, obliviating them and dumping them in the muggle world if they find them. Fudge resigns because he never expected the bill to pass and Lucius Malfoy becomes Minister.

I think the Knight Bus message would've been better as “Muggleborns are costing us 1 million Galleons”, but I didn't think of it at the time lol.

The end bit was a mix of the Muggleborn Registration Committee (again, which did happen), and the UK deporting people- I thought obliviating them and leaving them in the Muggle world was quite a good metaphor for that. Not perfect, but close enough.

I didn't mention the Wizangamot? Brexit was a referendum with the whole country voting, which was what imagined the bill to be like. But again, that can be left to the readers imagination because I didn't say how it got voted in.

Dumbledore and Bones didn't stop the Muggleborn registration committee. And, like Brexit, maybe no-one thought it was a threat because it was too extreme to get voted in. It really was a shock when it happened.

#+end_quote

It is different, but many fanfic writers think it's not. I don't necessarily agree with it as a comparison, but it's a way to reflect real prejudice like OP wanted- I wrote the prompt/summary because I think it's a good example of how the media can change the viewpoint of a whole population, like Brexit-supporting newspapers and the Daily Prophet both did, and make them vote in a way that surprises you.

Maybe it could be part of a no-Voldemort AU then, where the Purebloods use the media and political influencing to oust Muggleborns instead. The point is that they're /not/ directly attacking Muggleborns, they're just passing discriminatory laws to make their lives harder and to make it harder for Muggleborns to enter the wizarding community. And if Aurors do attack some Muggleborns- well, it was their fault! They were /unregistered/. They were criminals. If they registered then they would be fine. So it would reflect real life quite a bit, like ICE in America.

I do think that the phrase “Mudblood” indicates ethnic racism as an explanation over racism due to cultural differences and I argued that vehemently on a thread in this sub yesterday lol. An example of ethnic racism would be my second bullet point in the original comment, xenophobia is the first bullet point.

** The best stories I've read have been the ones where the ministry just didn't hire muggleborns, and halfbloods only could get the lowest of positions. There were no laws against hiring muggleborns, but the nice pureblood owned stores in Diagon Alley (which was all of them) just didn't hire them. And no Master would take an Apprentice who wasn't exeptionally bright (and muggleborns were at a dissadvantage when it came to family knowledge) or well conected.

Knockturn alley was one of the few places muggleborns could work and a lot of them left the british wizarding world for south america, or went back to the muggle world.

The problem is that the stories tend to have this one good idea in a story filled with bashing and tropes.

Edit1: It's kind of pointless that I save every story I read on pinboard when I barely tag them. Quick search gave some stories that fit:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/Democracy]]

Deals wit the Wizengamot post war, and the struggle for right both for muggleborns and "lesser" pureblood families like the Weasleys. It gives a very different take on Neville.

There's also a very wanky story that I think is called "Oliver Twist", pretty sure it's on ff.net. I think it fell squarely into the "interesting idea in a pretty average to terrible story" category, and I think I'm mixing up several stories.

Edit 2: Found the story, I did mix memories of several stories, and the story still managed to be even more wank than I remembered it to be.

Basically muggleborns are taken from their family as children, have the minds wiped and then are adopted by a wizarding family.

They are then fully adapted into the world after but it goes deeper than that and I'm not sure how to explain it well.

** The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady has this, especially in the later books! I find their portrayal of prejudice to be very accurate, and the cultural divide between the dark families, the wider wizarding world, and muggleborns is well written. The casual way the wizards disregard muggle inventions and discoveries is really good, too.

A bit of a spoiler here, but the way the war between Voldemort and the Order of the Phoenix and a lot of people's apathy to it was shockingly realistic. A lot of “not really my problem” and especially one newspaper clipping that was like “my muggleborn maid never had any problems with the extremists because she kept her head down! It's only the Bad Ones that get targeted!” It really amazed me.

There's a comment in the fic that I really like, about how the Purebloods are the powerful few in a minority---their culture is being wiped out, but at the same time, a lot of their practices are harmful. Really well done. No bashing, too.

***** On a related note, I really want to see a wizarding nature vs. nurture debate.

Like, I'm in developmental psych and I'm trying to write something in the HP universe at the moment and it occurred to me how different early learning would be for a wizard child, just learning about how the world works in general, like the laws of physics and the laws of argumentation. And since HP magic is ostensibly a rule-based system and Hogwarts starts at eleven, I feel like children raised in the wizarding world would have a kind of... instinctual grasp of the underlying logic of magic that Muggle-borns wouldn't have, and that would be really hard to catch up with for a Muggle-born child, especially in a prejudiced society where someone in a "white-collar" profession like a teacher is likely to have been raised in the wizarding world and use teaching methods that have underlying assumptions that just don't mesh well with Muggle logic.

I feel like JKR does such a great job of portraying that with the Weasleys, like Ron being weirded out when a car isn't bigger on the inside than it is on the outside (and I also feel like the movies left out a lot of the more M.C. Escher aspects of HP magic which is a huge part of what makes it so wondrous, but that's another argument). To them the way that the Muggle world works is just... illogical, and their own version of "science" and epistemology in general has branched out from the Muggle one such a long time ago that they're nigh mutually incomprehensible.

In the real world we see this when we try to, say, use intelligence tests on people from cultures wildly different from ours, because their familiarity with certain concepts (test taking itself, in some cases, or knowledge being individual and not collective, as well as common objects and things like deductive logic) is way off from ours and they prioritize knowledge that is so different from ours that we really can't measure it effectively (like some Aboriginal populations having a level of spatial intelligence that is literally unimaginable to the Western mind but having no formal logic system because in their culture it's just not that important).

So, since wizards basically never came up with the nature vs. nurture debate or studied brain development as such, I can see why they would see Muggle-borns as, well, dumber, and it would likely show in the Muggle-born children's grades (another phenomenon that we see a lot in the real world!). And a Muggle-born child would have to have massive, and I mean massive, amounts of cognitive flexibility in order to adapt to all this and overcome the disadvantage of not having been raised in the wizarding world when it comes to more logical or theoretical aspects of magic rather than simple everyday spells. Again, you see this in canon a lot with Ron vs. Harry and Hermione - he just gets some things very naturally that are nigh incomprehensible to Harry and Hermione, despite how smart Hermione is and how little effort Ron puts in typically.

So I can imagine how this could be a hindrance for some "white collar" positions where you'd have to extrapolate new ideas from this knowledge, like some kind of magical research job or some kind of magical engineering, if wizards aren't willing to be open to the ways Muggles reason about the world and if the Muggle-born wizard isn't bright enough to switch between the two systems of thought with ease. But I can also imagine that those who can switch can do some really innovative things with magic just due to having been exposed to such a different upbringing, as we see with Hermione and, hell, Voldemort, actually.

I think there's some Purebloods who are discriminatory based purely on blood (hence the slur), and they would believe that being born by Muggles automatically makes you lesser and lower Muggleborn grades reflect that- the nature group. And then there's the Purebloods who think Muggleborns are lesser based on cultural differences, because they didn't grow up based in the wizarding world- nurture. And then non-predjudiced people might be like “okay, the cultures are different but both methods of thinking are equally valid” or something, like the view social anthropologists take on other cultures.

I mean, you could, but you'd be breaking the law. Wizards get wands before their first year in Hogwarts, because they'll be allowed to use magic once they get there, not before. So, why would you let your kid use yours? How would you teach your kid anything if they can't practise? You can tell them about spells, what they do and their incantations, but everyone will learn this in school.

The ultimate difference is whether you are willing to break the law to teach your child. Granted, a Muggle-born would never be able to perform magic at home because they don't live with other wizards, but do you think Slughorn believes wizards who come from magical families are more skilled because they can break the law and use magic before school? I'd say it's because he believes they are "naturals".

Even the way he refers to Lily sounds wrong. When Harry says Hermione is a Muggle-born and the best witch in their year (or something along those lines), Slughorn pretty much says "I'm not prejudiced, Lily was my favourite student, I even have a picture of her here!" Yes, she can be his favourite student, but the very fact that a talented witch like her was a Muggle-born impressed him even more.

This law is very, very contrived, probably put there by JKR so that Harry couldn't use magic at home to solve his problems.

We don't know how it even works, or it's limitations, by all we know we could probably shield against with other enchantments in a Wizard's House. The law seems to be ther mostly to prevent children from breaking the Statute of Secrecy

Not like the Ministry would be able to track anyone's specific use of magic, seems to be area based since they can't differentiate between Dobby and Harry using magic. So it should be logical that it simply won't work in a Wizarding home because it can't tell who is actually doing magic.

I would certainly teach my kid some basic stuff, why wait until they are at school and struggle with basic things they could've learned much earlier.

Most of that stuff is due to how JKR needed the plot to work, no practical reason.

********* That's my point. Everyone knows the tracker isn't precise. Umbridge even used this flaw to try and get Harry arrested. So yes, if you're willing to break the law, you probably will get away with it. However, I don't think this law is the Muggle equivalent of downloading music online illegally, which everyone does in many countries. You especifically would let your kids do this, but not everyone would.

I can't think of a moment when either Arthur or Molly saw their kids use magic and were okay with it. Also, this isn't only about breaking the law yourself, it's indulging your child to do so. From a parental standpoint, it might not be the best idea depending on who you ask.

Besides, parents might take in consideration the practicality of doing this. There is a possibility that the wand might not "behave" at the hands of someone else, which would make it harder for them to perform magic with it at best, and get someone hurt at worst. Speaking of getting hurt, at least in Hogwarts they have the Hospital Wing. At home, you'd need to take your child to St. Mungo's and wait who knows how long to get treatment.

Moreover, Hogwarts is one of the safest places in the world, or at least it's supposed to be. What do you do when your kid take your wand outside and try to use it in public? Not only exposing wizards, but also risking to get a stranger hurt or even themselves. We all know kids can be troublemakers and parents can be too lenient, which make their children think they can get away with anything.

You might argue that misbehaving kids could steal their parents' wands anyway, but you have to admit it's more likely to happen if it isn't drilled in their heads that using magic outside school is forbidden.

Edit: you take your kid to St. Mungo's in case they hurt themselves. If your child hurts you by mistake, you better hope they don't do too much damage. At Hogwarts, there is a professor in every class with their own wand, who is able to control the situation if it gets too dangerous. Is it 100% safe? No. But if you're home with your kid, you better have another adult with a wand to control the situation.

*********** I don't think they learn Latin in Hogwarts. In Potions, according to JK, you'd need to perform some spell or some type of magic to make it work. This is why Muggles can't make potions. Runes and Arithmancy could be taught at home, I guess, but will the child even like or want to take these electives? And having some advantage in a few theorical classes isn't really such a big deal that would make a wizard be impressed with a Muggle-born's talent in general, let alone in Potions.

I think all parents focus on teaching their kids how to read and count, and maybe a thing or two about the human body. They can teach them about herbs, plants and spells, but the theory will be taught at school anyway. What makes a difference is practise.

******** Not all children are equally skilled, nor do they learn at the same rate. And maybe Draco just got a bad habit, or maybe his parents don't let him ride a broom as much he says they do.

Draco is also poor example, due to his arrogance and especially because it has to fit the plot of all children learning stuff at the same time.

Which makes little sense.

Or we actually don't know about it, since the only, more direct examples we have are Ron(who's not very studious at all) and Draco(who was tasked with riding a broom, not practicing magic)

Ron got the grip correctly and still couldn't cast a spell.

It makes much more sense in fics when those that come with a Magical Home have already practiced magic(didn't Hermione said she tried a few spells in first year?) and are probably tutored during summer.

Specially those that have interest in things not taught at Hogwarts or in more combat magic.

While many of the purebloods in the secretive Sun Chamber are overtly discriminatory, there are many elements of the plot showing the subtle ways these views are held, even by Muggleborn characters. Harry is a bit OP and makes some foolish decisions, but it feels more in character for him to act quickly, rashly, and deal with the consequences later.

Spoilers: Harry uses the Deathly Hallows to burn the prejudices out of everyone, and even his friends are forced to reflect on the ways they held these views. Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy both hold condescending attitudes about Muggles and those manifest in different ways, but it's characters like Hermione picking up Wizarding attitudes of superiority to Muggles over time and the idea that magical creatures need the assistance of wizards that are more subtle.

That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth.

** Thinking of fics that don't have explicitly discriminatory laws but nonetheless feature societal and institutional blood supremacism:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk): Hermione senses a "quiet bigotry of low expectations" towards Muggleborns, and resents the heck out of it.
- linkffn(Murder Most Horrid by Useful Oxymoron): An AU in which Voldemort never happened and Bellatrix became an auror---which doesn't stop her from being blood-prejudiced as heck.
- linkffn(A Necessary Gift by cosette-aimee): Muggleborns don't get the mentoring that everyone else takes for granted.

On a more plot bunny note, it would be interesting to see stories in which not being able to do magic over the summer is an actual disadvantage that affects people's progress. (To an extent, it happens in canon when Draco (apparently) learns extracurricular magic such as Serpensortia and Occlumency during the summer.)

It would also be interesting to see a fic in which Hermione is a Dumbledore-grade genius, which has some negative consequences. In particular, consider purebloods who sympathise with Voldemort but consider his methods to be uncouth and destructive; they instead play the long game, sitting the conflict out, waiting for Dumbledore to die of old age so that things could go back to the way they used to be. Voldemort they resent for being an upstart and giving their cause a bad name.

Now, they find out that the next Dumbledore is here---and she is an outspoken and stubborn Muggleborn. Suddenly, time is no longer on their side, and Voldemort has more supporters.

** linkao3(A dealer not a Death Eater by Jaxon) has excellent portrayals of both overt and subtle anti muggleborn prejudice. It's snape/lily, so it might not be for you, but there's no character bashing nor whitewashing of any kind. Also really well written. I hope you can enjoy it!

A loving relationship with his best friend is the happily ever after that Severus has always dreamt of - but he should've realised that a formidable magical couple will always attract attention from all the wrong quarters. With Lord Voldemort infiltrating an ineffectual government, Muggleborn rights eroded, and Lily unable to work, their lives are left in peril.Lily adores her supportive boyfriend, despite his streak of darkness, and in this terrifying new world, she knows his illegal potions are the only thing keeping them afloat - but the pressure of being a second-class citizen pushes her towards the only people who accept her: Severus' sworn enemies.Haunted by his Cokeworth past, Severus is determined not to let history repeat - but can he evade the rich promises of Lucius Malfoy, the lure of the Death Eaters, and the seductive call of the dark arts?

** There are a few, but not many. Mostly because the fandom as a whole is incapable of understanding why discrimination happens in the real world, which means their ability to portray it in a fictional context is flawed at best and infantile at worst. Additionally, attempting to write a fic that does portray it realistically would cause controversy and invite flames and personal attacks, so most people with the ability and talent wouldn't bother in the first place.

Most writers involved in the fandom don't want to admit that someone like Voldemort can have a point, which is why they would get so many followers in the first place. Ironically enough, most people who demand more nuance and subtly seem to be under the impression that you really do just cast an Imperius curse on people and get them to throw away their lives for random things that don't make any sense. The reality is that all radicalism is based on a truth, which is what draws people in to it. If you do not understand that truth, you cannot understand the radical, nor are you equipped to refute or counter them, if indeed you even can. No one is going to be convinced to give away all their worldly possessions and suicide attack the Ministry of Magic while wearing a Halloween mask because some weirdo with no nose told them to do it: everyone seems to understand that on the abstract, but they don't want to actually admit it or put it into practice in their own writing. They get lazy, they take the easy way out. They fall into the trap of 'telling' us what we should be seeing and drawing from the story, instead of 'showing' us events and trusting us to draw those conclusions ourselves. If you're telling instead of showing, it's bad writing.

People don't want to try and understand why the Death Eaters would be doing the things that they do, which means subtly and nuance rarely exists. Even Rowling's own portrayal of Voldemort and the Death Eaters was without nuance: we were "told" that Voldemort was a political revolutionary whose attempted coup failed, but what we were shown was a creepy snake man who was obsessed with killing a teenage boy and the headmaster of his private boarding school. We were TOLD that the world isn't divided up into good people and Death Eaters, we were /explicitly/ told that, and yet every antagonistic 12 year old from book 1 gleefully took a Dark Mark somewhere between book 6 and 7 and were throwing around Unforgivables like they were going out of style. They were */literally/* junior Death Eaters. The only evil person we ever saw who */wasn't/* a Death Eater was Delores Umbrige. Rowling used Sirius as a mouth piece to hold Umbrige up and try to teach us a lesson about how the world isn't just good people and Death Eaters, there's nuance, look see, look at this new Defense professor! And then two books later, every student in Hogwarts collectively stands up and points wands at the Slytherin table, because they're all junior Death Eaters and */everyone knows it./*

Rowling wanted us to believe this was a story about choices and consequences and bravery and love, but that's just what she told us. What she showed us is that the world would have been an objectively better place if Harry had been an unhinged serial killer and spent the first three books killing everyone who was rude to him or his friends. Throwing Draco and all of his 12 year old playmates off the train to their deaths on the Hogwarts Express and making it look like an accident would have solved most of the problems in the later books, but you're not supposed to think about that.

Rowling set the tone for the series herself: the subtlety and nuance is a complete farce and something we are merely told exists without it ever being shown. So that's the way it is for most fan fiction, too. That's also the reason the epilogue fell as flat as it did for most people. Marked Death Eaters walk free for no reason, people who murdered and tortured and used the Unforgivables, given a free pass for no reason. This is Rowling herself admitting that the Death Eaters must have just all been Imperiused or done it for a lark, because obviously once Voldemort is dead the underlying social issues that created him and lead a significant portion of society to openly support his coup must just vanish into thin air. It really all was just one great big Imperius curse all along. All it took was for their leader to die and that entire political zeitgeist immediately folded like a house of cards. Good thing it doesn't work that way in reverse, or the series would have ended when Snape killed Dumbledore.

tl;dr, subtly can't exist unless you're willing to give both sides valid reasons to be doing the things that they do. Rowling couldn't be bothered, which is why we never saw Voldemort be a charismatic political revolutionary and only ever saw a creepy snake man with an unhealthy obsession over a teenage boy. All of the deep and complex conversations that pulled people into his views and convinced them that his methods were the best and most valid choice happened off-screen, where she did not have to write them or elaborate upon them in any manner whatsoever. Likewise, most of the fandom can't be bothered either.

You can't claim that the world is more nuanced than Good Guys vs Death Eaters and then have all the Slytherins be junior Death Eaters that get held at wand point by the rest of the school at the climax of the story. Pick a lane and stay in it.

*** I agree with you mostly but I do not believe that something most be based on true to launch a radical movement. Sometimes the key is to present lies as truth and in case of purebloods if this lies helps them convince themself of their own superiority and keep their position of power their are going to be taken as truth. The fanfiction where I have seen prejudice handle the best is in Victoria Potter where the protagonist herself hears things like muggleborns are muggles who steal magic and how wizards talk about muggles as inferior beings and she is passive about it and even is I influenced by the things her friends say herself as most eleven year old would be. The story so far is only up to year two but so far I understand how Voldemort had a followers in this society. Not because their ideology has true in it but because it preys on their fear of muggles being dangerous and at the same time inferior and the fear that muggles may somehow steal magic. What I like about how is presented here is that is in the details that you see this things the autor doesn't tell you things she shows you. Really recommend! Sorry for any errors I'm learning English

Leave here a piece of the story as an example for op to decide if he wants to read it

“It didn't take long for them to leave the station behind, and the girls returned to their seats. Pansy held out her hand in front of her and examined her perfectly polished nails. "So, Victoria, tell us about yourself. I'd heard you'd been sent to live with Muggles... but that can't be right, can it?"

Victoria blushed. "It's true," she said, causing all three girls to gasp.

"Oh, you poor thing," Daphne said, looking like Victoria had just announced she was dying.

Susan was similarly aghast. "Was it awful?"

Victoria opened her mouth to reply, but Pansy beat her to it.

"Obviously it was awful," she said, putting a hand on Victoria's knee, "but at least it's over now. Really, you're lucky they didn't manage to steal your magic."

"That's just a children's story," said Susan, but Pansy shook her head.

"It's not," she said firmly, "Daddy told me it was true. A few of them come to Hogwarts every year, didn't you know?"

Susan rolled her eyes. "That's silly. Muggleborns don't steal magic."

Victoria looked between Susan and Pansy, not sure who to believe. Certainly she couldn't imagine the Dursleys ever being able to steal magic.

"Well, I don't know about any of that," she began, cutting off Pansy's reply, "but they didn't steal mine."

"But you must have so much to learn," Daphne said, "I bet those Muggles didn't teach you anything."

Daphne's statement confirmed Victoria's worst fear. "I suppose everyone else knows so much magic already," she said glumly, "I haven't even cast a proper spell yet."

Susan snorted. "Neither has any---"

"So much to learn," Pansy interrupted, "luckily, you have us to teach you!"

Victoria smiled. "Will you tell me about it? Growing up in the magical world?"

"Of course we will!" Daphne said, clapping excitedly, "but where should we start?"

The three girls shared a look, before speaking as one:

"Robes."

**** That has all the subtlety of a baseball bat. "Indifference" does not equate to nuance or subtlety. Somebody's OC being indifferent to house elf rape and racial slurs doesn't make your story subtle or clever, and it's not realistic either. It's just another example of what I already mentioned: people who grossly misunderstand something like discrimination cannot write it, and the results are infantile.

The average wizard has dozens of perfectly valid and legitimate reasons to not want their society to be overrun with and controlled by people like Hermione Granger. Rowling did not care to think about or elaborate upon that, even though she very clearly teed herself up to do so by making Hermione's crusade for House Elf rights look absurd and damaging to the elves themselves, so she invented absurd and nonsensical talking points for the Death Eaters, like theft of magic. Copying the mistakes and blunders Rowling made in her obvious indifference to her own stated goal of "the world isn't Good Guys and Death Eaters" and then selling it with indifference of your own is not good writing, nor is it subtle. That is just repeating exactly what happened in canon but expecting the reader to buy it /this/ time because */magically talented Slytherin FEM!HARRY/* */hng warg abibble derf./*

***** Firstly when in the series muggleborns where looking to overrun and control wizard society? Is this a real fear? Are muggleborns actually trying to control wizard society? What perfect and valid reasons has the average wizard to said they are superior to Hermione? So you say that discrimination in the real world always runs in the basis of true? Can you share with me the true behind this radicalized racist moments ? Because we are not talking here of any kind of radical movement. We are talking here of a movement whose goal is genocide or at least segregation of people because of their blood. So I would like to hear the truth behind those kinds of movements in real life. Is not that I think that this movements have no logic behind them but I think that they prey on fear and not on truth at least to get followers. I think that you can write a nuance story where Voldemort preys in the fear that the purebloods have that as you said they are going to be overrun and controlled by muggleborns. Is this actually what is happening ?maybe is not but it doesn't have to be true for people to believe it.

I mean you said that theft of magic is a nonsensical talking point as if people in real life don't believe nonsensical things either because they are taught at home those things or because it confirms their believes. What I like about VP is that prejudiced is portrayed as I remember hearing people being prejudiced as kids an how this ideas may follow to adulthood. How kids just repeat what their parents say at home. With kids I don't think that you can't make discrimination more nuanced than this because little Draco doesn't know exactly why he has to hate muggleborns apart from my dads says and they steal magic.

****** When? Is that a serious question? Did you miss the two and a half book long subplot of Hermione vowing to change society and lead a revolution over house elf rights? Did you miss the part where she was, objectively, WRONG, and actually terrorizing the elves and causing damage to them with her dogged persistence and moral crusade? Are you ignorant of the obvious implications of what someone like Hermione would do if she had real power or authority in the wizarding world?

Also, yes, it is in fact a real fear to have your society and culture destroyed by outsiders. Are you just asking stupid questions?

The author you're quoting clearly doesn't understand the point of discrimination, and neither apparently do you. That is half the problem with this topic, the people who are not subtle about it do not /know/ that they are not subtle. The people who do not understand it are not aware that they do not understand. You think you do, but you don't, and the "but is X /really/ a thing" questions prove that.

And yes, theft of magic is nonsense and it's obvious Rowling just pulled it out of her ass. Like the Hallows themselves, it never came up in six and a half books worth of time, it was a last minute addition to the story so she could do exactly what she claimed she wasn't doing: divide the world up into Good Guys and Death Eaters. The culmination of the plot was Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor holding the entire Slytherin house at wandpoint, because it was an evil house full of Junior Death Eaters and everyone knew it. Draco Malfoy is not subtle, and Draco Malfoy babbling nonsense about Hermione having stolen magic from somebody is not subtle or clever either.

Maybe if there was any indication whatsoever that it was actually possible to steal magic, it would be a different story. Maybe if this absurd talking point had been brought up even once at any point in the previous six books, it would be a different story. But it was not. And you don't really seem to understand that. You keep trying to reference real life issues as a parallel, but you don't really understand those issues, either, so it fails completely. I've got bad news you're not going to want to hear: most of the people you disagree with or think are stupid, nonsensical, or discriminatory in real life have pretty good reasons for being the way they are, and you just don't want to accept that.

A realistic political talking point would be something like "immigration is bad because it destabilizes the job market, driving wages down and preventing the formation of unions." An unrealistic talking point would be "immigration is bad because all immigrants are secret lizard people trying to steal the psionic pearls I keep inside of my skull that help me think." Draco Malfoy, and every other character Rowling had regurgitate the magic theft talking point, went with the second option, because not only is there zero evidence it is true, but as far as we are aware it is literally impossible to steal magic from somebody. They are proclaiming an irrational impossibility as justification for their decisions. And you are trying to defend it by saying "I think people I disagree with in real life are nonsensical, so nonsense qualifies as clever and subtle."

No. It does not. Just because you personally do not understand something does not mean it is nonsense. Magic theft wasn't subtle in canon, and it's not subtle in your magic girl superpowered fem!Harry Slytherin LARP story, either. To reiterate: Draco Malfoy is not subtle, and you don't make him subtle by just having people ignore him or shrug at his delusions and move on. You make him subtle by */giving him better talking points and modifying his behavior/*, and the entire thrust of this broader discussion is that at least two-thirds of the fandom are not intellectually or ideologically equipped to do either. A writer can only write what they know and understand, and if you don't understand how discrimination works in real life, you can't write it in fiction either.

That's the reason I went on a tangent to point out that Rowling never had Voldemort be clever and charismatic and political where we could see it, not even in flashbacks or memories. She was obviously incapable of writing it, so she didn't even try. At least she was self-aware enough to realize that, which is better than can be said for most fan fiction.

If you are okay with Drarry. This has a range of discrimination from subtle to not so subtle. One example is one of the other instructors is always arguing with one of the other ones trying to defend muggles and muggle borns but it always comes across sort of belittling.

** Discrimination is overt, but widely socially accepted and therefore doesn't tend to involve nasty names or terrorism, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). As the series progresses, it becomes clear that there is a element of truth to the differences in blood status (first- and second-generation mages have wilder and more chaotic magic than pure-bloods), but not in a way that actually justifies banning non-pure-bloods from Hogwarts and from many types of employment.

It's also suggested that the prejudice might be influenced by babies being sensitive to their parents' magic, like they recognise their mother's scent, and thus developing an instinctive aversion to adults who don't have any magic. Not enough to cause blood prejudice all on its own, but enough to plant a seed.
