It's been a while since I read a really good fic that had absolutely batshit fights. I'm talking the likes of Dumbledore, Voldemort, Grindelwald, or Flamel, whatever badasses of a given era, just throwing down full bore, in fantastic detail.


** The linkffn(Sword of the Hero; Wastelands of Time; Denarian Rengade) series have some of the most epic and amazing fight scenes I have ever read in fanfiction. (Each book linked is a start of a series.)

The Sword of the Hero trilogy, in particular, has fight scenes on unparalleled awe-inspring /scale/. Think of the largest, most epic battle you can imagine - and Sword of the Hero is a few times that. SotH peaks in the second book, IMO.

The Wastelands of Time series has fight scenes in a very similar style to the Hero trilogy, but fight scenes here tend to be more fast-paced. I'd recommend reading the SotH trilogy first, however.

The Denarian series falls in between the two. It's a crossover, but you don't need to know anything at all from Dresden Files to read it - in fact, you'll be better off reading it without knowing about the Dresden Files, as the world will feel larger and more fleshed-out.

All 3 series are excellently written, with phenomenal worldbuilding and a plot that'll keep you on your toes. But best of all, the fight scenes are fantastically visceral and high-impact. Have fun!

~thinks~

Harry, Neville & Dumbledore chasing Voldemort & Bellatrix on dragonback through the volcanic caverns that used to be Gringotts, weaving between falling stalactites, flows of molten gold, allied hippogriffs, lava-faring ghost ships and Inferi giants to bring down the Dark Lord before his Cataclysmic Eruption Invocation is completed and the entirety of London is destroyed by a new Krakatoa?

That's about as over-the-top I can think of without delving into space opera...

**** I'd rather not spoil it for you, but the battles are /far/ larger and still more epic than what you described :) Honestly, give it a read. I've never read anything that approaches the feel of the battles in SotH. While the story is slow to pick up, you'll be in for a treat (especially re. the second book).

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I see Starfox5 has already been mentioned once, but my choice would be Patron purely because all the fight scenes are magical (D&E is part muggle). It's got everything - one character vs several, pitched battles, duels, the lot. I honestly don't think anyone does fight scenes better than Starfox5.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** I suppose if you had to pick a single character it would be Hermione, but it's far from being a Hermione-centred fic. Harry has a big role, both Dumbledores... There's lots more to it. Excellent Voldemort character too. And several well-defined OCs.

I'm biased because I became a beta half way through the story, but the reason I offered is that I loved the story so much.

Give it a go. You won't regret it.

  It's funny how the world works. There are too many things near and dear to us for a wand to be drawn at every occasion. Everyone has a story, and the lines and points come together to form a web of something too ephemeral to measure. Harry thinks that the strands are snapping a bit too quickly.

** Small excerpt from my fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort snarled and waved his wand in such quick motions I would not have seen them had I not been channeling Lightning into my nerves.

  Three things happened. The ground beneath me was transfigured into quicksand, catching the first foot that planted itself into the ground--- in this case, my left foot.

  A blue light erupted from the dark wizard's wand, flying to me in what seemed to be a corkscrew manner--- a piercing spell of some sort, most likely. And behind it, was a wide area fire spell meant to overcome me if I managed to avoid the piercer.

  I kicked off of the air pulling myself out of the quicksand and out of the range of the corkscrew spell, before swishing my wand at the incoming flames. "Aguamenti!"

  I instinctively knew that without Erebus' help, I could not hope to stop a jet of flames this intense even with me spraying water on it.

  So, instead, I drenched myself in water, and cloaked myself in my Lightning before dashing through the flames, emerging on the other side with what amounted to be a sun burn judging by the redness of my skin.

** Although it hasn't been updated in about a year the Merging has a really nice fight scene. Voldemort and Bellatrix VS Harry and Dumbledore at the Ministry. Also a few other fights.

Also, Camden Victory has some strong battle.

Then there is Awaken Sleeper which is arguably the best Harry Potter/Dresden Files crossover.

Another one is Magician:
