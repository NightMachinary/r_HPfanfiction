No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune/no Ginny giving Harry a love potion.

No kid politics or anything like that.

Not looking for pairings, would rather not have stories with pairings. But if there is am fine with het/slash/femslash/etc.

Basically, kids going through mini adventures. Fred and George creating a new project, maybe Harry and Ron find something out about their dorm mate and try to follow them or just anything silly like that. Looking for more light hearted stuff in general

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. ‚ÄúA what?‚Äù Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.‚ÄúA Chizpurfle,‚Äù Hermione hissed back. ‚ÄúNewt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.‚Äù ‚ÄúMy mam told me about them,‚Äù Seamus Finnigan said darkly. ‚ÄúShe said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.‚Äù‚ÄúThey eat wands?‚Äù Harry asked, horrified.‚ÄúYeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‚Äòem all out.‚Äù

** I'm gonna recommend anything by mad_fairy linkao3(10824855) They write Harry as a visionary who literally changes the world, so the plots are pretty large scale. But half the actual text is slice of life stuff. Like, there's a puppet club where the puppeteers animate dolls to act out the play. And there's a subplot where the puppet club and the choir are banned from putting on shows, so they stage a protest. Nothing monumental, Voldemort won't be defeated by it. It's just that Neville and the other puppeteers worked hard to rehearse their play, that's all.

**** I just started reading this and boy, is it a mad tale. It started off with Harry's weird dreams of the ninja world of Naruto, teeters into manipulative!Dumbledore territory and is now about how Harry unknowingly sets mobs off at Hogwarts. But I cant stop reading it!

To paraphrase a review of this thing: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ay8yze/comment/ei1933z][you read the story for the ideas its author generates and not for the plot.]]

But I agree, the slice of life parts in between are good. I liked the parts were the 1st year Gryffindors created a comic book, and how later on all the first years formed a inter house club where they could do projects like repairing old music boxes, or playing games. I haven't reached the puppet subplot yet.

** Just a random ramble, no nonsense thingy. I wrote it on my phone. The formatting and spelling and grammer are horrendous. (Will probably edit later - sometime)

------------------------

‚ÄúI got an outstanding for divination,‚Äù Harry showed off his essay to Ron and Hermione. He scrambled a long essay about how he would fall into a hole of despair, the whole world would go crazy and how the grim would visit all of his friends. Hermione scowled.

‚ÄúThis is horrendous,‚Äù she pointed at the smudges of possibly breakfast or dinner on the essay. Harry shrugged. ‚ÄúWell, Trewalney overlooked the lunch on my essay. She only commented that I should not eat that much fatty foods while divining. Because fat would possibly block my divination power.‚Äù Harry messes his hair around.

‚ÄúBut apparently she understood... in a way that divination comes and goes on its own‚Äù he explained.

Ron laughed, ‚Äúsure, instead of you forgetting to write your home work because you were looking at you-know-who! ‚Äú his eyes looked over to the raven law.

‚ÄúHey! Don't say you know who. Reminds me of Voldy.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrosss, I am eating‚Äù Hermione waived her spoon at the two of them. ‚ÄúJust let me eat in peace please‚Äù.

However she would not get her peace.

Seamus chimed in, ‚Äú Harry and you know who? I thought you like ... hated him?‚Äù

Lavender disagreed, ‚ÄúSeamous, you know, the line between love and hate is very thin‚Äù

Another voice piped up ‚Äúhe is dead‚Äù.

‚ÄúOh my god, noooo‚Äù. Harry objected. How did it go from divination to this? Okay well it was my fault that I bit into Ron's frigging lure.

‚ÄúMaybe he is necrofilius‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe are not talking about that! We are talking about my outstanding divination essay! Also gross dean. FUucking grossss. I don't like dead people‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I divine that next week we will have a new infamous couple‚Äù lavender said gleefully. Harry glared at her. ‚ÄúStar crossed lovers separated by life and death‚Äù

‚Äúohh potty boy has a girl friend...‚Äù Malfoy sing songed, while he past by the gryffindors.

Ron grinned smugly, ‚Äú yup it is going to be your daddy's ex boss‚Äù.

‚ÄúRon.... urgh. Stoop it!!! We were talking about my divination‚Äù

Malfoy made a gagging face. ‚ÄúI am going to go. Away.‚Äù He said elaborately. His eyes lingered a bit on Harry's bushy friend.

‚ÄúI have no appetite anymore.‚Äù Hermione gathered her books a second later. ‚ÄúSee you at potions‚Äù

Ron shared a look with Harry. ‚Äú you don't think those two....‚Äù

Harry looked proudly. ‚ÄúGuess you came a long way from having an emotional range of a teaspoon‚Äù.

His best friend rolled his eyes.

‚ÄúSo... what's up with Bones?‚Äù He asked.

** There's a lot of just being teenagers going to school (but a school full of magic!) in linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay). But he's not a troublemaker, if that's essential.

If you're willing to read something non-Harry-centric, then linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff) is very much lighthearted teens-being-teens. The protagonist is a well written self-insert, and so she is /aware/ of the canon plot and taking steps here and there to bring Moldyshorts down, but she's mostly just having a great time with friends and magic.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
