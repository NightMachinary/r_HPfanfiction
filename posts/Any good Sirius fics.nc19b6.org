Hi there! Looking for Sirius x OC books! Preferably female in marauders era and completed! I love a lot of angst but I am very desperate to read anything :)


** One of the best-known Sirius/female OC fics is the "Interwoven" series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/197906/Katinka31][Katinka31]].

It is old, the majority of it was written before OOTP came out, so it is canon-compliant up to GOF but no further. As a result Sirius' backstory and the events in Harry's 5th year are different.

Personally I love Abigail Loomis, it is a fascinating and well-written OC. For this reason I don't mind that the story is no longer canon-compliant.

** This is one that I really liked, especially Sirius's characterization. It's complete.

edit: is the bot not working or something? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4956727]] "What if Harry's parents weren't killed by Voldemort? What if, by meeting a little girl from Wales while they were in school, all their lives were changed. AU story for the years prior to canon."
