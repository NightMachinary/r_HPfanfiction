** Well-written post! This follow-up comment was right on too:

#+begin_quote
  On the subject of Ron and Hermione, it's not fun watching Harry snap at them, but Rowling's explanation is so on point. I think she came on an episode of a major fan podcast, I can't for the life of me remember which, and addressed this.

  So after OotP releases, she's approached by fans who want to know why Harry snapped at Ron and Hermione. Rowling says haven't you ever snapped after being frustrated? The fans say, yes, but never at my friends.

  Rowling's point is that Harry doesn't just have friends. It's not that simple. Ron's and Hermione are his family, they are all he has. They are his source of stability, all he can depend on to be there for him. Dumbleore is distanced, as is Sirius, and up to this point the Weasley's hadn't fully stepped in.

  Harry vents with Hermione and Ron because they only people he can do that with.
#+end_quote

Tbh I feel like Ron & Hermione might be two of the best drawn friends /in/ children's lit. It's easy to forget as an adult reader or as a child reader, but they are two kids the same age as Harry really /doing their best/ despite probably not knowing hardly anything about child abuse or how to help survivors or people with PTSD. God knows there seems to be zero adult support in those remits in the wizarding world.

** Uhhh, no shit? PTSD might be an overly strong diagnosis of it (as Harry's nightmares about it ceases pretty much at dementor fun times), but the following equation is certainly true:

End of GOF + everyone keeping him in the dark during the summer through school year (latter basically only applicable to Dumbledore) + the Ministry's treatment of him + puberty really ramping up (testosterone is a wild ride) = Harry's temperament during OOTP.

*** I don't know how much you know about PTSD. I'm certainly not particularly well informed about the subject, but one of my close friends is a combat veteran and his PTSD only appears in subtle ways in specific circumstances (as far as I can tell). Not every person with PTSD is crippled by its effects.

The thread (which I'm guessing you didn't read) goes through point by point of PTSD symptoms for children and teens that Harry exhibits. I'll list those points here, and let you visit the original post if you want the accompanying explanation.

#+begin_quote

  - Experiencing nightmares or flashbacks about the trauma

  - Acting impulsively or aggressively

  - Avoiding situations that make them recall the traumatic event.

  - Having trouble focusing at school
#+end_quote

Does Harry need a better excuse than PTSD to have a significant temperamental shift? Is being tortured, kidnapped, held captive, witnessing a murder, used in a blood ritual to revive your parents murderer, and then forced to duel him to the death not a good enough reason to start exhibiting many of the symptoms of PTSD?

"Torture? Pfft, no big deal, now if you throw in a little testosterone, now you've got a doozy on your hands."

**** Yeah Harry likely has some symptoms of PTSD in OOTP. Cedric's death and the Occulmency lessons that force him to revisit the trauma along with Umbridge/Ministry bullshit explains why Harry is on edge for the whole year.

Which is even more surprising that HBP didn't go into the trauma of Sirius dying.

It just never occurred to be that Harry would have lasting effects from these experiences until I had some fucked up things happen to me (obviously not at bad as Harry, but I kinda see where he's coming from).

** I'm not sure that mental illness exists in the HP universe. Some JKR quotes about Dementors:

#+begin_quote
  People talk about the Harry Potter books as wizard wheezes but they have a pronounced dark side as well. The Dementors, for instance, are prison guards who track people by sensing their emotions. They disable their victims by sucking out all positive thoughts and with a kiss they can take a soul while leaving the body alive.

  I do not think that these are just characters. I think they are a description of depression. "Yes. That is exactly what they are," she says. "It was entirely conscious. And entirely from my own experience. Depression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experienced."

  What does she mean?

  "It is that absence of being able to envisage that you will ever be cheerful again. The absence of hope. That very deadened feeling, which is so very different from feeling sad. Sad hurts but it's a healthy feeling. It's a necessary thing to feel. Depression is very different."

#+begin_quote
  Cornersoul: So what happens to all the dementors where will they go will they be destroyed if so, how

  J.K. Rowling: You cannot destroy Dementors, though you can limit their numbers if you eradicate the conditions in which they multiply, ie, despair and degradation. As I've already said, though, the Ministry no longer used them to torment its opponents.

#+begin_quote
  One young Canadian boy earlier asked her how Dementers breed.

  "I was just so pleased that he thought about it and pleased that I had the answer," Rowling told The Canadian Press.

  These evil creatures don't, by the way, breed but grow like a fungus where there is decay.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-canadianpress-moore.htm]]

My impression is that in the HP world, there is no such thing as depression as a naturally occurring mental illness. Sadness is a natural emotion, but depression is not. Rather, whenever anyone is depressed - whether wizard or Muggle - it would be because a Dementor is nearby, spontaneously generated by conditions of despair and decay.

If that is the case for depression, I don't see why something similar wouldn't hold for other mental illnesses. And of course you also have the fact that Harry comes out of an abusive childhood as a fundamentally kind, well-adjusted person with no problems with normal social interaction.

My impression of Harry in OotP is that his behaviour is simply meant to be "uncontrolled teenage emotions" + "normal reaction to circumstances".

*** I like the idea, but this is just a non seqitur for me.

First, even if you are right about depression being caused by Dementors, there's no reason to extrapolate this to other mental illnesses.

Second, there is no indication in any of what you quoted that even implies that Dementors take the place of clinical depression in HP as opposed to just being a similar effect.

Lastly, depression is just as natural as sadness, or a sore elbow or poor vision, so there's no conflict with anything in HP.

I'd say PTSD seems consistent with Harry's behavior and a perfectly normal reaction to what Harry went through (a quick Google shows one study found it prevalent in 67% or torture victims).

That said, I can see it going either way, as she's not know for exhaustively researching minor details, but Id imagine that determining the mental state of your hero after an endure book is worth a glance at symptoms list.

**** Depression occurs in some people, in differing degrees, in response to different circumstances. Doesn't happen to everybody, or even most.

Harry's reactions just seem like perfectly reasonable response to his experiences. They don't seem pathologic.

***** They only seem reasonable in light of those experiences. Exhibiting PTSD-like symptoms, as Harry does, is normal for a victim of extreme trauma, but the same behavior from your average teenager would make them see like an overly-dramatic, whiny brat (maybe even pathologic), which is how I often see Harry regarded in OotP. He's not. He's just dealing with some heavy shit.

*** From the quote it seems like JKR was saying that Dementors mimic the feeling of overwhelming depression. She never implied that Wizards and Witches couldn't naturally be depress.

Given how one's emotional state can affect magic (Merope and Tonks) it doesn't feel like canon if magical are free from mental illness in general.

What's interesting to me is her saying that Dementors multiply from despair and degradation. Something about that makes them feel even creepier
