I remember Harry being close to Snape, Draco close to Dumbledore and Neville liking Remus but Remus was sad over Harry so kinda ignore Neville But the three were turned to toddlers I can't remember why And when they got turned back to however old they were before, they all stayed friends I'm pretty sure they grew up a certain amount every week or so? I just can not remember the name ðŸ˜­


** I have no idea, but I hope someone finds it. This sounds cute and I'd like to read it.
