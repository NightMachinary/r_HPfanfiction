Any fic featuring Narcissa, preferably ones that explore her character and what happened to her after the war.


** Bit later on in linkffn(The Merging).

*** I can't decide if this Narcissa is more of a mother figure to Harry or a romantic interest. Has fanfiction ruined me?

**** Definitely mother figure although turning her into a romantic interest would be a brilliant twist to the story. And yes, it ruins us all.

**** It's one of the dangers of exposing yourself to others' thoughts, sometimes you get ones you don't really want.

** Good, not-abused-by-husband Narcissa fics are hard to find, I feel you.

These 2 aren't about her after the war, but you might enjoy them regardless because they feel in-character for her and they show key events through her eyes:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9063635/1/A-Lie-for-a-Life]] <- this one is a oneshot about her life with Draco and Lucius and her POV of the final battle, I really love it

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5823342/1/Fallen-Pure-Blood]] <- 4 chapters, focused on her relationship with Lucius. Same author, I really like that one too.

** *The Death of Narcissa Black*

It's about what happened /before/ the first war but it is amazingly done.

** there's one she appears and is expanded upon, but she isn't the MC its the linkffn(The 8th Year) I honestly found it quite boring and didn't like this version. It also helps that i don't like Draco nor Hermione, and them as a pair is even worse for me. To complete, this Daphne was a bit annoying and shallow. Really liked both Harry and Neville in this tho (there's no bashing, this is a "happy fic" kinda, but mostly, yeah, "happy")
