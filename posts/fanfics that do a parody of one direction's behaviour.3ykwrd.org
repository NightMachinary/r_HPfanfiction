If you are a fan of one direction or have seen them, you know how the band acts very homoerotically with each other and this has lead to different ships and fanfics about them. PArt of me wonders if this is a cultural thing in britian to be the friendly or close with other men. My question is thos, ever seen a fanfic with they parody it or reference 1d's behaviour? like ron and harry and the boys of hogwarts act all homoerotic and strange like they do with each other


** I can't answer your fic request, all I can say is that the way the 1D boys act is not a British culture thing. It's heavily manufactured and quite unusual for British men that age.

*** While I'd usually hold my tongue unless I have a fic to rec, I have to disagree. We often are quite homoerotic among mates for absolutely no reason at all.

To be honest, I'm suprised that "real-life" fic writers don't ship Pegg/Frost.

**** Not to that level though. While there are odd examples here and there of really close friends, the average group of 4-5 young British men are more concerned with acting as straight as possible - or at least the ones I've met have been. I feel like the Inbetweeners is more representative! (half joking)

More to the point, it's just a bit annoying that a heavily marketed boyband is being suggested as an example of British culture. Bo Burnham's 'repeat stuff' comes to mind.

EDIT: I'm probably dismissing you too quickly. You may well be right. I haven't seen it myself, but it's probably true that HP fics don't show Harry and friends goofing around in the same way most boys there age do, and i would probably include a few jokes like that.

****** I think if you went to public school your experience is likely to be far different to the majority of the country's, unfortunately! You're right that once alcohol is in the mix it becomes different though.

I haven't followed 1D, but, without going into detail as to how, I know a lot of the marketing behind celebrities, products and experiences marketed to young women. There's a reason slash writers tend to be young girls.

It's interesting that the OP is looking for a fic that's not slash, but is displaying the same level of homoerotica that they see from 1D. I'm not sure how easily that could be written, rather than shown visually, but perhaps speaks to the fact that the HP series was written by very little sexual tension despite mostly being read by teenagers by the end of the series.

******* I'd recommend a song by Bo Burnham, repeat stuff, which is all about how young male singers are targeted and marketed to teenagers. If you have some background in that area you may find it amusing.

Onto the point of homoeroticism without homosexuality in fiction or fanfiction, I can kind of understand your point. It is far easier to convey on a visual medium such as television, and conveying body language in prose is a sticky wicket at the best of times, lest a touch be misinterpreted as something more.

It could be averted I suppose by just having the two main characters be straight, although that may have broke back mountain vibes.

Just one more point may I inquire why you assume that most slash writers are young girls? I assumed the same, but would welcome your view.

******** Haha, I literally recommended it up thread! Love that song.

I think without the visual medium it either becomes rather forced and fake sounding or outright slash, which is why we probably don't see it more - it requires a writing skill we tend not to see in fanfic.

I think there has been informal "research" (i.e, half-arsed surveys) regarding fanfic authors who tend to be women, although it's more balanced here on reddit. Also, if you've ever shown slash to an LGBTQ person it becomes glaringly apparent that, just like the stereotype of virgins writing unrealistic smut, you have straight people writing unrealistic and painful sounding slash. For young women, slash offers them an opportunity to explore sex and porn without the societal shame of female sexuality - it's "safer" and more accessible, in a way. When it comes to boybands like 1D, it allows them to be both accessible to girls (in that they are not dating other women they would have to compete with), while still portraying them as sexual beings in a fun and loving way. Think of how Harry Styles, commonly written in slash fanfic, is described as hot, cute, sexy by girls who are only just entering their sexuality. He's safer and friendlier than a more stereotypical beefed-up stud.

I probably have't explained it that well but I've been enjoying the last of the Christmas baileys. Essentially at one point of my life my work involved marketing to teenage girls, before I couldn't block out my screaming conscience anymore.

** LOL yeah I seriously doubt that most groups of straight British guys are as homoerotic as One Direction... It's well known behind the scenes that at least one, if not two, of those singers are actually gay. YMMV on whether they're secretly dating each other like half of tumblr thinks.

If you're looking for fanfics with very close platonic male bonds, check out Marauder fics. I've heard good things about the Shoebox Project. Remus/Sirius fics would probably be good ones to check out for a mix of homoerotic humor and platonic friendships with the rest of the Marauders. I don't read much Marauder era fic so no specific recommendations for flamboyant friendship fics, sorry.
