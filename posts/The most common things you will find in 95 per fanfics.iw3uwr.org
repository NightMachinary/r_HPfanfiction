*** And once again we see that pointing out, criticizing, or in any way acknowledging the existence of misogyny is one of the most reliable ways to get downvoted on Reddit (or probably anywhere else, really).

*** Except bot really ? Ron isn't an idiot, he's just a lazy teenager. If you want to say Ron has anger problems, you gotta admit that Harry has anger problems.

***** What makes you believe that ? Hermione can not be such a low-born violent troglodite.

Except for that time where she punched Malfoy. In the jaw.

Or that time where she decided that the best way to break a teacher's eye contact was with fire.

Maybe also that time where she sets birds to almost eat Ron alive.

Aside from that ? A. Total. Angel.
