** You are homophobic. It is not bullshit. It is the same as if you would constantly go around saying "I do not want to read any stories at all with black people in it! I only read stories with white people!" and then trying to say "BUT I'M NOT RACIST!!!" Yes you are racist in that scenario. Yes you are homophobic in this one.

**** Fuck off, dude, you didn't specify Drarry, you said blanket all gay relationships. Not all gay relationships are Drarry pairings, which is obviously a bad thing because of itself, not because it's gay. No shit. But you said "no gay relationships period." So yeah, I agree with the other poster. You're a damn homophobe.

***** Well, I had a comment typed out, before the comment was deleted, so let me just leave this here.

If you only hated Drarry, then no you aren't Homophobic. If you dislike all slash pairings then, yes in a way you are Homophobic.

The definition of Homophobic is

#+begin_quote
  having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people.
#+end_quote

Nowhere there says it has to be a strong hatred, a small dislike is enough. So even if you are just a little uncomfortable with Homosexuals then you are in a way Homophobic, even if you aren't hateful towards them.
