Like most people who like free stuff, I've appreciated the free podcast “Harry Potter at Home.” To combat the mind-numbing boredumb (spelling intentional) of quarantine, J. K. Rowling has allowed an all-star cast to read the first Harry Potter book to Potterheads across the globe. It's available on Spotify, absolutely free, and includes big names like Daniel Radcliffe, Stephen Fry, and Whoppi Goldberg.

I'm surprised at how much I enjoy the books after all these years. There's heavy nostalgia for me, and even first-time readers connect quickly with the iconic characters and magical setting. I've enjoyed plenty of time to consider the franchise and what elements helped it reach the heights of popularity.

It got me thinking about the books' conventions and style. There's a distinct “Harry Potter” style that establishes continuity throughout the books and movies. But how much of our understanding is based on that style? This question led me on a rabbit hole that eventually started pairing up Harry Potter plot points with anime stereotypes.

But first, a disclaimer. I don't have plans to write this fan-fiction, nor am I trying to bash either Harry Potter or anime. I thought it would be fun to tease anime because so many of my friends watch it. As an outsider to anime, I've seen common threads or tropes that show up a lot, so I've taken these and remixed them in a Harry Potter fashion...

***** You do you, but for the "Harry Potter wakes up to find Hogwarts and Hogsmeade Village have been turned into a generic Japanese high school and small town respectively, and he's the only one to notice the change" idea I've been tossing around in my head for a few weeks now, I'm having Draco take on the "ineffectual excessively rich idiot with an overinflated ego" role.

***** I don't know much about the others, but Draco isn`t nearly as competent to be equitable to Vegeta and Phoenix Ikki, who routinely kicked everyone's ass only to be stopped by teamwork or the protagonist getting a powerup(or interference by third parties, like Athena or a Gold Saint)

** So Harry is a poor orphan who is mistreated, finds out he's a wizard, is initially beat up, but discovers he inherited a secret(or more) power from his redheaded super talented mother, and that his father was the Minister for Magic and loved by many.

He converts most of his enemies, thinking he's doing everything through hard work, only to discover he's the reincarnation of Merlin's youngest son.

I can't see Hermione being anything like an extreme tsundere, but more one who is quiet until riled up.

Ginny can be tsundere. Easily.

Ron is like the laid back best friend who shows a spine of steel when needed. Heck he doesn't need that much work, supposedly he already eats like an anime character /s

Draco is the ineffectual school rival, Snape the git professor, and Dumbledore the eccentric old master who kicks ass when he actually gets serious.

Sirius is the laid back teacher who actually cares a lot about Harry.

** It was a good article but it felt too elaborate for a typical shounen, especially one inspired by the most popular.

I'd say an anime HP fic has 2 routes, A) being a Haikyu!! Inspired Quidditch fic but you would have to tweak the rules to make it a better sport.

Or B) which is a cross between FMA and Blue Exorcist, which would entail something like this.

James Potter adopts Harry Potter who is son of old Dark Lord Voldemort and Lily Evans who both come from a civilisation long dead as the two remaining survivors and Harry has a cool power up from his biological dad but is distrusted by the world. This is because the more he uses it the more he becomes a Dark Lord so after James dies by Voldemort Harry and his best friend Ron who is missing a body vow to find Voldemort and beat him up, and find Ron a body aided by their childhood friend Hermione.
