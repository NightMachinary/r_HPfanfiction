So I've been writing this fic on an elderly Harry and Ginny and their adventures their old age. The Potter clan has become quite huge over the years with Harry and Ginny having lots of grandkids and even great-grandkids.

I intend for this to be a long fic with romantic and funny elements, interactions with the younger generation. There's weddings, family events and grandkids coming over for summer, all experienced by an elderly Harry and Ginny. The best way to describe it is a Slice of Life fic with a heavy focus on banter, love and day-to-day stuff.

  This tale intends to chronicle Harry and Ginny's lives well into their old age. I aim for this to be a long, romantic and funny story with appearances from kids, grandkids and even great-grandkids. There's weddings, family events, grandkids coming over for summer, all seen from the perspective of an elderly Harry and Ginny! A Slice of Fic that I'm hoping you all will truly enjoy!
