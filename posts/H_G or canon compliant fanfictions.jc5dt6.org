On fanfiction sites there is no way to filter fanfiction based on whether or not they comply with canon. Because I prefer to read about the canon pairings (at least for the main characters) and just the canon timeline it is sometimes hard to find good fanfics. Anything is fine: post hogwarts, next generation, dh from other perspectives, etc. I do not see the cursed child as canon. Do you have any good recommendations?

Of course there are the fics of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][Floreatcastellum]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/31969/Seriously-Sam][SeriouslySam]] and Little0bird and I'd strongly reccomend checking them out. Any more fics?


** Hmm... Does it count if Harry and Ginny were married but she passed away and he's heartbroken?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young With Me]] has a misleading summary but is actually a very moving story. Incomplete but it's still getting updates every few months.

** Try linkao3(an open secret) it's a fairly accurate portrayal of how harry and Ginny get back together after the battle for Hogwarts.

  Harry and Ginny quickly reunite following the end of the war. However, due to the pain and grief of their losses, their family fails to recognise the love shared and growing between the young couple.
