Lucius Malfoy approached the group, their backs facing him.

"Spectacular stunts my friends, but all for naught! Turn around please" he said with a smug smile.

The DA members did so.

"Ah! What a pity. What a pity. So Potter, you thought you can outwit the Death Ea-"

Upon glancing at "Harry", Lucius was met with the sight of an older man wearing round-rimmed glasses, with a mustache along with a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead, and had a cigar hanging from his mouth. He looked at the other students, and saw that they were completely different people who were wearing the same clothes.

Lucius turned to his fellow Death Eaters as he said, "YOU IDIOTS. These are not them! YOU'VE CAPTURED THEIR STUNT DOUBLES!"


** In where after third year harry and sirius pool thier money and hire the world's most dangerous hit wizard to pose as harry. He casually follows potter around under an invisibility cloak all the time, and after teaching the kid some fancy slight of hand and a few acrobatics, Harry learns to seamlessly switch places with his "double" and hide under the cloak instead.

Only problem is, the hit wizard looks nothing like him. A hulking 6'10" wizard in peak condition, with a full Escanor like mustache. Clearly wearing prop glasses with no lenses, a messy black wig, and a fake scar painted on his head, squeezed into a students gryffindor robes and tie. The death eaters are clearly confused after confronting potter only for this stranger to turn around to his full hight and flex, tearing his uniform at the seams.

Avery opens his stupid mouth for the last time; "wait, your not potter!"

Hit wizard with Arnold Schwarzenegger voice: "and your not breathing."

Avery "what?"

"Reducto."

Avery's headless corpse falls backwards as the hit wizard's wand tip smokes. No one even saw him draw.

"Now say hallo to my little friend! The hit wizard has pulled what resembles a miniature hungarian horntail from... somewhere, and Malfoy does not like the ominous heat and glow emanating from it's wide open maw pointed directly at him.

*** There's a fic I just recently re-read that I think is called In Plain Sight, I can't remember the author but it's on ff.net. In the story Harry had gotten LASIK surgery to fix his eyes and no longer needed glasses. Him not wearing glasses was enough of a â€˜disguise' that no pure blood student (Ron and Ginny included)could recognize him. It also featured Moody and a team of Aurors pulling a /21 Jump Street/ assignment that fooled the pure bloods but did not fool students raised in the muggle world.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.
