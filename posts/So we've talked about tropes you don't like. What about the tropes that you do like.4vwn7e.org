With parseltongue, I enjoy it when people write it as genetic through Lily's bloodline. I have my own headcanon that the actual trait was dormant until it came in contact with Voldemort's magic/soul.

And really, it's not just the Potters that would make that kind of story hard to believe. There probably are families like that but most of the time the authors take this kind of thing to ridiculous levels (like forgetting that they even have other children) and what makes it even more retarded is when it's suddenly all Dumbledore's fault because he used some kind of spell that the author just invented that makes everyone ignore Harry...

Sorry for the rant, but i really don't like that kind of story. I do however agree that Harry with a brother or sister can be very good if it's done right. linkffn(Fraterculus) comes to mind. (Although i donÄt think i ever finished that...)

**** I'll read 'em, but I don't like them and unless the writing is decent, then I'll always feel it as if reading was a chore. Let's not forget that Lily's sacrifice was due to love. If she treated one child different then it shouldn't have worked. It's jarring to read a fic where Lily ignores one of her children as it just doesn't fit her character. That's like saying Molly wouldn't feed the boys because she wanted a girl.

It is, in my opinion, lazy writing. There's other ways that you can write it so it seems Harry receives less attention without being starved. Maybe Harry was shy and avoided contact and Lily and James agreed. Maybe Harry wanted his brother, the saviour, to spend quality time with Harry.

Every mother I have spoken to claims that their child's birth was one of their best days. It just... annoys me to see when people make Lily forget Harry. "Oh, I had two children? Nah. I don't remember birthing TWO children." And even then, I cannot see James being like "LOl gtfo Harry, you're nothing." It's obvious that in the wizarding world, at least for some, family is important. I cannot see a pure-blood ignoring his heir.

I recently read a fic where Harry was quiet and shy and thus he was often missed. That makes sense. Ugh. I dunno, though, I was a quiet child and was often left to my own devices. I know that not all parents are the same and some kids have bad childhoods... but James and Lily aren't the people that'd ignore, starve, or beat their child.

Your ranting has got me ranting! And nope, haven't read it. But, I'll add it to my 'to-read' list. :)

The characters actually mature as the story goes on, which reminds us in the end that both Harry and Jim are still kids. It takes time to explain different introduced concepts, while also throwing in new twists to cannon.

All in all, there's a reason it's probably a lot of people's recommended WBWL fics.

** I'm a sucker for a Twin!Potters story, as long as it isn't just regurgitating the books with a twin added in, or, my most hated version of the trope, plagiarizing the book, while making Harry's twin a SLYTHERIN, normally followed by them (normally a girl, but I've seen a couple of slash fics) dating Draco Malfoy by third year. I'd rant here, but it'd take up too much space.

A Slow burn romance done correctly, not just constant teasing for 300k words before they even go on a date, and no, I'm not exaggerating that amount of words, granted that wasn't an HP fanfic.

Strong!Harry, Independent!Harry, Smart!Harry, Powerful!Harry, and any real variation on this. We have seen almost every variation of Harry and his story by now, be they living Potters, Voldemort beating Harry in the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry dying on Halloween, 1981, or even Harry joining Voldemort. These variations tend to be my favorite of how the story goes.

Freed Sirius is also a fun time, as it makes the story much more fun, rather than making the first two or three chapters of the first five or six books Harry Potter and the Case of the Unreported Child Abuse.

My guilty pleasure though, is a good ol' time travel fic, whether they be in the vein of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, or Three to Backstep, where an older Harry is sent back in time and is in his younger body. Then there's Harry Potter, Savior of the World, where he's still in his older body, or Harry gets sent back to the Marauder's Era, those are fun too.

**** I think I skipped over it purely because it blatantly says one of them is a Slytherin. I find that in the realm of Fanfiction, people glorify Slytherin house, just like how they glorify Severus Snape, or Draco Malfoy.

They seem to skim over the fact that while Slytherin is /supposed/ to be the house of the cunning and ambitious, in 1991, and years and years before then, going back to at least the 60's (As James Potter thought that Slytherins were evil and therefore needed time to develop that opinion), it was more the house of pureblood bigotry due to the beliefs of people in the British Wizarding World.

It's a huge pet peeve of mine, and a gigantic turn off as well, meaning that I tend to not read stories featuring a Slytherin main character.

That said, a great slow burn fic if you don't mind kind of messed up relationships/pairings is Tied For Last. linkffn(6031176) Warning: it's Tomione. It's also among the best-written fics I've read and manages to pair up characters from two different times without actually using time travel.

***** I think I like [caveat: well written] Hermione/Riddle because of the way that the ship engages Hermione's cerebral side. Usually she's smarter and harder working than everyone around her; we don't really see any other young characters who are as passionate about learning magic as she is. It might take Riddle being a little bit OOC but I like the way that both characters can learn from each other, with Riddle's preconceptions about Muggleborns being challenged by Hermione's intelligence and passion for equal rights, and Hermione discovering what it's like to spend time with a peer who is on her academic level.

Unfortunately, most fics like this don't explore these themes properly and/or rely on the crutch of shitty time travel. I have higher standards for this ship than I do for most and the author of the above fic is pretty much the only one who meets them. And she admits herself that the relationship portrayed in the story is often manipulative and abusive and shouldn't be imitated in real life. So, like, I totally understand the yuck factor on most of these stories and why you'd be hesitant.

Ginny was the right blend of headstrong, but not off-putting or abrasive. Luna was sweet but stubborn and just the right amount of strange.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?

** I used to like this a lot, but I am getting very sick of lazy Evil!Dumbledore and general Dumbledore bashing. Yeah, we know you hate Dumbledore. Your brand of bashing isn't any different from everyone else's, especially when it doesn't fit the rest of the story. However, some fics have a well-done Evil!Dumbledore or Manipulative!Dumbledore and I enjoy them a lot.

I do like fics that give Draco character development (except those where the author is clearly in love with him). I like humor fics that lovingly point out the silliness inherent in the magical world.

I think romanticising the bad guys is done often enough it counts as a trope. I know that they're assholes but in a weird way that just makes them all the more awesome. And I'm not talking about Draco or Snape (cause they can be redeemed) but the Real bad guys like Voldemort and Bellatrix.

** I like time travel as long as it's realistic. If Harry is 25 and goes back to being 11 he's not going to fit in with his 11 year old peers. I like it better when he's closer in age (17 when he goes back to his 14 year old self or something similar) or when he goes back in time but is the same age (is 25 when he ends up in the past). Then he gets a job as a teacher or working for the DOM. The only Harry is 25 and goes back to his 13 year old self story I liked Harry was only at Hogwarts like a month before he left because it was obvious he was a 25 year old in a 13 year olds body.

It isn't really time travel but i think "The Lie i've lived" does a perfect job at this. Harry James just really doesn't fit in with his peers anymore and his struggle to find someone that it's ok to be sexually attracted to is pretty funny too.

If you can add in the threat of another love interest, without that actually being consummated, then I'm golden. I remember one fic, think it was Ghost of You, where Neville winds up in love with Ginny and goes from the Neville we all love to a creepy guy who gets his ass kicked. It was funny and awesome how the story made me look at a character I never had any issues with, and then made me hate him. Now, anytime I read a story involving him, my reaction is always "screw Neville."

** +I know I'm going to get angry at myself once I'm told what it is, but TLAT?+ Never mind, I'm a dumbass of the greatest degree. My self-directed anger cannot accurately be measured by those shackled by three spatial dimensions and one temporal one.

This is probably going to make me seem like a horrible human being (most likely a relatively accurate description), but my love of Hermione being put down (not killed) is Great and Terrible. Though this mostly has to do with me knowing a full on Hermione type in real life, and the fact that we haven't murdered each other is probably proof of a divine being.

While there's not a ton of it, I enjoy "Harry running off from Magical Britain" fics of The Unbreakable Vow, The Perilous Journey variety.
