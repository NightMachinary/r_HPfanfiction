linkffn(To Reach Without) Didn't see that bit of accidental magic at the start coming, but the character development is the best I've seen in ages! Can't wait to see where it goes, but hoping for similar fics so I can get my fix for this subgenre.


** I think a genderswitch story should be clearly indicated in the summary. I guessed, but a reader shouldn't have to guess.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

** If you're looking for something with genderbending, take a look at Red Headed Stepchild. It's incomplete but has a gender transition for one of the main characters.

There is also Session Transcripts, which is amazingly well written but also incomplete and likely abandoned. In it one of the main characters comes out as trans.

** To stick with the accidental magic bend, but sadly incomplete (and seemingly abandoned), there is this linkffn(6720336).
