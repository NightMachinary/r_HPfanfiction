I've been thinking about how a duel would go if wizards thought less like fictional characters and more like people, and I realized that transfiguration is ridiculously useful.

In the first transfiguration class we see Professor Mcgonagall turn her desk into a pig to show off to the students, i've been thinking about that. If it was possible to just wave your wand and turn a desk into an actual living animal, then why would you not be able to point your wand at a couple chairs and essentially just create yourself an army of yourself? Or clones of the founders? If professor mcgonagall was able to create a pig without having perfect knowledge of the animal's nervous system, musculoskeletal structure or even its immune system, then why not a human? There may be some rules that prevent you from doing that, like maybe you dont need perfect knowledge of a pig if there exists a spell to turn a desk into a pig.

Let's pick a different example then, could you not use one of the dancing dolls in a duel by transfiguring it into you, and then use that in combination with ventriloquist charm to make it seem like you are right in front of them while you shoot them in the back of the head? Or just say the magic words and they're dead instantly.

And yet another example, if you had access to a gas mask or some spell to protect you against toxic gases, I'd also like to think you could probably also get the gas mask or the bubble around your head to be invisible or just hard to spot (that's where you could use the dancing doll if you can't)

Why stop there though? If possible, I think if you had the prep time you could go around some place you intended to lead your enemy/enemies and transfigure nitroglycerin into dust particles that you can transfigure once you're sure they've inhaled /some/ of it.

Can you guys think of any other uses of transfiguration to insta-win every fight? Because I'm having lots of fun with this.


** Well, you have to keep in mind that Transfiguration is one of the most difficult branches in magic, so it would be very, /very/ difficult to conjure a clone of yourself.

Because McGonagall is a powerful witch, and anyone /can't/ point their wand at chair and create an army. Also, obv principle of reciprocality, if it can be created, it can also be dispelled.

Your "insta-win" appears to me more like "if you are powerful and talented, and your opponent is not, you can insta-win every fight". Which ... yes. I doubt anyone will disagree, but it's also not that much of a revelation.

** I mean, the main limitation on Magic seems to be that it's really hard and most wizards are disinterested/lazy/not overly bright and can't be bothered/don't want to bother. Enough people couldn't cast shield spells well that the Twins had to make enchanted hats to help out, for example. It's basically like most people not being able to repair a car or rebuild a computer or do mental arithmetic. Very useful skills, but a lot of people don't have or get them.

So, that's how I look at it. Becoming someone able to do all the McG-level transfiguration stuff practically (ie. without exhausting yourself to unconsciousness and quickly enough that the situation won't be over by the time you do it) and in combat situations (those are so stressful we literally have to mentally deconstruct and rebuild people so they're willing to run into them and able to keep their heads while they do) is basically the equivalent of learning to do high level physics equations and simulations in your head while doing one of those really intense folk dances that involve a lot of twirling around and dizziness.

Not easy, in short. :)

** I can think of far nastier and more effective things! I am sparing in their use though, as I don't want characters to be able to trivially obliterate their foes. In other words, the Dramatic Imperative always wins.

If I were to model magic for a role-playing game I would have spells cost Magic Points to cast (think Fatigue Points in GURPS), which can be recovered by not doing magic for a while or by accepting physical or psychic damage (think gaining a Quirk or a Disadvantage). If you run out of Magic Points you can't cast any more until recovered, and different spells cost different amounts of MP. The scale, complexity and duration of the effect would also vary the amount of MP.

** It was either in linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) or linkffn(Delenda Est by Lord Silvere) that had pretty cool battles that featured heavy transfigurations.

The one I'm thinking of has Harry applying for a job as the Hogwarts DADA prof. And Voldy crashed the party which dissolved into an intense battle featuring a lot of high level transfiguration.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** McGonagall is a Master of Transfiguration, and Dumbledore is probably the only wizard in Britain who know more about this branch of Magic than her. For the rest of the population, most of them are simply unable to copy her feats of magic, or would take a long time to do so, which is unpracticable in a fight.

Also, while McGonagall should be able to completely destroy most people thanks to Transfiguration, it shows more about her power as a witch than the power of Transfiguration. If you put her against another strong wizard, let's say one of the Head of House, all of them would be able to use their own Mastery of magic to fight and there is no way to know who would win (Flitwick would know more spells, Snape more curses and poison, and Sprout can use her plants like Mandragores).

Finally, I think it is unlikely for a wizard to be able to create a "clone of himself", not to mention one of the founders. While Transfiguration can be used to create an animal, I'm not sure it could be used to create a human in the first place (like, can magic create a "Soul"?). And even if you could create a human like being with a conscience, it doesn't mean it would have any of the knowledge of the person you used as a model, not to mention your ability to use magic.\\
So, if a wizard tried to create a clone of himself, I think he would probably end up with a doll looking a lot like him in the best case (but unable to cast any spell), or just a complete faillure in the worst case (see FMA human transfiguration, without the loss of limbs).

â€‹

PS: Concerning the "Nitroglycerin into dust particles" idea, when you Transfigure something, you can't really change it back. You don't end up with "Nitroglycerin that has the appearance of dust particles", you have "dust particles". If you want to have Nitroglycerin again, you need to Transfigure the dust particles into Nitroglycerin (which make the 1st transfiguration useless), and while canon was never 100% clear about it, I don't think you can change something that is inside the body of someone else. Just like you can change the water he just drank into poison, I don't think you can change the dust in his lungs into nitroglycerin.

** If we are talking about a realistic battle between two competent and powerful Magic users, their fight would be something more akin to what you would read in stories about pagan gods and other mythical conflicts than the lame and boring duels we mostly see in canon and even fanon. And if the fight is between a (very) competent wizard and an average or below average one, it would take less than a second for the superior party to win.

But even with lower-tier to mid-tier wizards, there is so much more that can be done with combat. Diffindo, for example, could be used for anything ranging from amputations to straight up beheading. Harry could transfigure someone's necktie into a snake and then order it to kill the person. Or you wanna end a fight quickly? /Accio eyeballs/nails/hair/teeth!/ Or cast Wingardium leviosa on their neckties to hang them. Apparition would obviously be spammed by everyone, and setting up anti-Apparition wards on a battlefield would most likely be first priority, especially if you can tweak them to only allow /you/ to Apparate. Throwing a quick Imperio on someone mid-battle and ordering them to kill their allies would also be a pretty common trick. Summoning someone's /shoes/ would be enough to end a fight, as the way the charm works would most likely make the person lose balance and fall, allowing you to incapacitate them. Oh, how could I forget invisibility! What a huge Pandora box of possibilities that gives you too!

This goes on and on, we could write literal libraries about all the possible applications of magic in combat. If we are talking about realism, I feel like you need two major things, and perhaps an optional third. The first two:

A. Expand the lore of the Wizarding World. Introduce amulets and enchanted clothing that would negate some types of spells. Kinda like how the Weasley twins spelled a Protego into clothing (I hope that's canon and not fanon tho). That's a good idea that you must expand on heavily if you want realism. Additionally, make Occlumency a more widely known skill, and make it so that it makes the Imperius either useless on you, or it would take a ton of power and time to be cast on you, something that's not feasable in the middle of combat. Make splinching and loss of balance extremely common for Apparition, if it's done under stress, regardless of how powerful or experienced you are with it. Make rituals more common place, rituals which would give you some magical resistance, or such. But be careful, opening the lid on rituals makes a whole new can of worms pop up, which you then need to tackle. In the wizarding world, you are one (commonly known) spell away from being turned into a fully obedient slave with no hope of ever breaking free. You would think that a society like that would be way more paranoid about protecting itself. (Main reason why it pisses me off how Occlumency was made into an obscure skill, when it's one of the first thing any magic user should learn).

B. Overall nerf magic. Create a system of magical stamina. (or just use magical cores if you then want to get ripped into on our subreddit here) Make spells way easier to fuck up. Make Transfigurations randomly revert if the spells aren't cast properly. Let conjurations be dispelled by a simple spell, rather than having to fight the conjured thing as if it's real. Make area-wide spells way too unreliable and dangerous to be cast if you have allies in the fight, and sometimes even if you are alone.

And the optional third:

C. Keep the Magic system as it is and completely revamp the Wizarding world. Don't nerf anything, don't salvage anything from the existing lore. Take the essentially infinite potential of HP magic and run with it. It would mean the WW be turned into something more akin to the Asgard of the MCU (or the Asgard of the Eddas, for that matter). This would make whatever story you write much more rooted into hard, traditional fantasy than the light, urban fantasy that HP (and even fanon, almost exclusively) is.

** The problem is that in the HP universe there were never really anyone on McG's level other than maybe James Potter as he was called a prodigy in transfiguration, the fact that he could hold his own against Voldemort proves that, but my point is, that only McGonagall and Dumbledore are capable of those kinds of things

Even Voldemort never used any impressive transfiguration, instead opting to shoot jets of green light, killing curses and deadly spells, which is honestly kind of disappointing

Thus what you are thinking of is really hard,

** Just transfigure everything into Xenomorphs, they're apex biological-killing-machines, they're fast and versatile and they're bloody terrifying.

Think of the average pureblood death eater throwing out dark torture curses and then he suddenly has this terrifying magical abomination hunting him. It looks like a insanely scary dark creature yet he wouldn't know what he's supposed to do when he's faced with it. And if he's so focused on that tall black demon bearing down on him, he wouldn't notice the rape-spider Facehugger crawling through the grass to latch onto the front of his skull, block his vision, obstruct his airways and snap his neck with its tail.

Why bother transfiguring basic animals when you could go the meta route by transfiguring realistic fictional creatures and monsters?
