There are lots of fics with soul bonds.

In these fics,usually a non- planned/unwanted/unexpected soul bond happens between Harry and one(or more) girl, and after that, Harry quickly accepts the situation and eventually fall in love with his "soul mate".

I am interested in to read a fic where Harry effectively rejects the soul bond. Gets angry with the girl or other people. Complain that he is just a teenager and is not read for something like this. Tries to find a way to break it. it seems an interesting idea and I don't remember having read anything like this.

Anyone knows any fic like this? Or where do I challenge somone to write this?

It's dead, but what's there is good. Pretty much exactly what I would expect to happen if two teenagers were privy to each other's every thought.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
