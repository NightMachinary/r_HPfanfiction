*** I am still amazed at how people like to put nobility in fics and don't do one bit of research as to how peerage works, how addressing nobles work, and how naming titles works.

I blame Naruto fics, because anyone who has -sama as an honorific gets translated as Lord(even in canon), even if they aren't actually noble(Jiraiya, Orochimaru) so everyone and their mothers end up as Lord Something, and now people want to apply that everywhere, despite the fact the culture and system being entirely different.

That's also where the compounding of names come from I bet, so when addressing someone they have to speak some 4 surnames, yeah ok, nobility actually does that(Portuguese /royalty/ had some 7 surnames IIRC) but they aren't addressed like that all the time*. So Harry making people in school call him Potter-Black-Peverell(lol, same family two names that's not how this works) at roll call still sounds stupid.

*** If you are not using Dumbledore as your scapegoat, then writing him right is probably one of the hardest thing to do, just like Luna. He's wise, old, his speech is very formal but sometimes uses colloquial language as a way to lighten up the mood, yet you shouldn't make him too serious nor too senile. He always leave clues to help you but it's very suble about it. At least, that's how I see it. There's nothing more enjoyable than reading a nicely written Dumbledore.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart.

** I also think part of that is due to Dumbledore always saying "Harry" versus every other student gets called Mr. Or Miss. So that provides the fanfiction authors room to either show that Dumbledore really cares for Harry "like a grandfather" hence the familiarity. Or that Dumbledore is truly manipulative and uses this fake familiarity trying to get closer to Harry while withholding the basic respect every other student gets by being called Mr or Miss.

Yes, Sirius. He also says a specific thing which is very annoying if I had to say. Yes, I'm referring to "pup", or " cub" (by Moony).

Whenever I see the word "pup" or "my boy" I stop reading the fanfic.

** So I wasn't the only one that was utterly confused with some of the speech patterns people use for him in fanfic.

On a side note "my boy" is generally used with older(sometimes condescending) characters.

IIRC Dumbledore called Harry, Harry or Mr. Potter when they were both playing a part in front of some unsuspecting fool.

** I don't think you're using the right parameters(?) here.

In canon, Harry and Dumbledore barely talk, especially prior to HBP. They usually have one or two conversations per book from what I remember. In fact, Dumbledore doesn't really talk much in most books, period. So any phrase he would say would not appear oten by default.

So the total number doesn't say anything useful here on its own. You would have to take the total number of conversations Dumbledore had (either with Harry spcifically or in general depending on what point you are trying to make), and then compare it to the number of "my boy"s (you should also include "my dear boy"s, btw.).

(If yo do it generally I would also reccomend looking at who he is speaking to, since speach patterns can change based on the status of the person you talk to.)

In fanfic Dumbledore often has a larger speaking role, as well as significantly more conversations with Harry specifically, so even if the ratio were about the same, there would likely be significantly more hits. Because he talks much more.

As it is, your post is a pretty much pointless.

If you've read the type of fic I'm referring to, then you understand qualitatively that Dumbeldore will say 'my boy' once each sentence and like every time he refers to Harry and many many times in even a short conversation.

** I think "my boy" is used to make the reader anti-Dumbledore. That's what I think, not that the expression was necessary. Let's face it, Dumbledore is a manipulative old fuck, excusez moi. If you have doubts, just read the part where he explains to Snape that he raised Harry "like a pig for slaughter". Dumbledore more or less tells Snape he is right. So basically the "you will defeat Tom Riddle cause he doesn't love and you wanna fuck Ginny so you love her *I'm deliberatily saying it like this* " thing Dumbledore keeps repeating is basically to make Harry commit suicide by letting the noseless cunt kill Hairy "Harold 50 noble titles" Potter.

PS: I get very very annoyed when the author uses "AK" in short for Avada Kedavra and the verb from AK ....
