  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  I'll do a summary later, but it's Durmstrang Harry story where the reader reads about Harry's lessons at Durmstrang. Dark! Harry, Intelligent! Harry, WBWL! Harry
