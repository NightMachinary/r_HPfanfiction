I'm not talking about it coming completely out of left field just like that, more like very subtle hints were given before but which could have been overlooked. It could be something like the protagonist did their life with the plot and all that and their date for the Yule Ball is someone of the same sex. My understanding of peoples' opinion on the subject, from what I read, is that they are less than favourable for anything regarding lgbt+ in Harry Potter fan fiction partly due to the whole drama that followed Rowling making multiple additions to the world post the publication of Deathly Allows.


** I would have no problem with that. For me, the problem with Rowling's changes was that she was trying to retcon what she had already written. In fanfic, authors are supposed to be exploring new ideas and changing things, that's what makes it interesting.

** My problem with the JK Rowling thing was obvious retcon. I was fine with the Dumbledore being gay thing though I had previously imagined him as bi. I hated the Hermione thing because she's white in the books, no question about it. I'm fine with gay main characters as long as it isn't Harry/Draco (because why the hell would Harry date a racist who was too cowardly to kill someone face to face), Harry/Snape (pedophilia and also Snape?), and Harry/Voldemort (pedophilia and also Voldemort?). Granted if it's an obvious fulfillment smut fic, I can't get into it either because as a straight person, it's hard for me to imagine myself as the protagonist. I suspect this depends on the reader.

**** Besides, to the questions about poor Delphi Diggory, it is usually nicely forgotten that Voldemort post-cemetery-resurrection was actually physically really not a human at all. His body was alchemist conjured construct, made by two wizards (one of them rather inept, other not able to do actual magic), who were certainly not interested (or even knowledgeable, I suspect, in the case of Peter) in the human reproductive organs. I strongly suspect that they didn't create for him even all functional bits.

*** None of what Rowling said was a recon.

Before Deathly Hallows, when they were making the Goblet of Fire movie, the director wanted to bring Dumbledore into the ball with his wife. It was here that Rowling told several people that Dumbledore was gay.

She always imagined him as gay, but he wasn't someone who discussed his sexuality. This is why there are some pretty obvious clues in deathly hallows without directly stating it.

And with Hermione. Rowling never said that she was black. She was supporting the actress that was playing her in the play and pretty much said that people could imagine her characters however they want and she has no problem with people imagining Hermione as black. It was a more tongue-in-cheek comment about her never explicitly stating Hermione skin tone.

There is plenty of stuff to be annoyed at Rowling about but the two most common complaints about her arent even true.

**** "Hermione's white face"

"They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor --- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him."

""I love you, Hermione," said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rubbing his eyes wearily. Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, "Don't let Lavender hear you saying that.""

"Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table."

"'Yeah, I see what you mean, Remus,' said a bald black wizard standing furthest back - he had a deep, slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear - 'he looks exactly like James.'"

Note how the black characters are explicitly described as black. Why? It's Britain. The book covers, approved, had a white Hermione.

She said "I had a bunch of racists telling me that because Hermione ‘turned white' -- that is, lost colour from her face after a shock -- that she must be a white woman, which I have a great deal of difficulty with. But I decided not to get too agitated about it and simply state quite firmly that Hermione can be a black woman with my absolute blessing and enthusiasm."

She also said "Canon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified. Rowling loves black Hermione "

On your first point, I wrote my comment poorly. I apologize. To clarify, I meant that I don't care about Dumbledore being gay because it could be retcon or it could have been intended from the start. I didn't find evidence for Dumbledore being gay (oh wow a white hankerchief from Grindewald's wand) but I felt it was always up to the reader. Hence why I thought he was bi. But the Hermione change was obvious and clashed with the books.

** Judging by past survey results, that depends on where you ask the question. The majority of the Ao3 community is pro-slash and therefore unlikely to get offended at your hypothetical. However, only 50% of the people on this sub are open to reading male slash fics, and quite a few people here are vocal about their distaste for such pairings.

For me personally, I've read a few fics in which the protagonist's sexuality wasn't apparant until the plot reached a point (like in your hypothetical) where it became actually relevant.

To me that just seems like appropriate realism. In real life sexuality is not always some defining lense that effects every moment of a person's life. For most people during day-to-day interactions and major life achievements in work, school, public service, etc. sexual desire is usually irrelevant. Therefore I consider it good writing for an author to depict their characters /without/ giving stereotypically obvious tells to their sexuality unless the character is actively pursuing romance.

It can and often does have a much larger impact than you might think.

So the thing is? Being LGBT+ has consequences /far/ beyond who we want to fuck and date especially if one is trans. It can have an impact on where we live, who we associate with, often how we vote, and a lot of areas of life you wouldn't expect due to the attitudes of larger society and their distaste fo rus. We have our own subculture, our own history, our own books and more. All of this has to be taken into account when writing a queer character.

** Generally, I like to read most characters as bisexual up until they make a firm stance about their sexuality. That way it's never a surprise and whoever they have the best chemistry with is who I think they should get with.

I don't think a character's sexuality is something that necessarily needs to be hinted at or 'make sense'. It doesn't need to be a plot point or a major theme. Like you said, they can just show up to the ball with whatever partner they choose and it won't matter

** I mean, if the character turned out to be homosexual so the writer could pull some Christianity-level Homophobic rants out against that character, I'd be a bit miffed regardless of how well it was foreshadowed. (And yes, I've read stories where that's happened before - usually with Harry giving the rants alongside some Pureblood friends because there's a lot of crossover with the 'don't infringe on traditions, they're untouchable!' crowd there).

Same with if it suddenly became smut (though that's not homosexual-exclusive, sudden smut of any sexuality is irritating - warn before the porn, people), or an unexplained Death-Eater-and-their-Victims pairing (because pairing what is essentially a Magical Nazi Officer and a Magical Jew is just fuckin' weird and creepy without some serious development or retconning). The latter seems to be far more prevalent in Slashfic, but the few unwarned Harry-Bellatrix fics I've seen have been weird as well. If developed well, they can be great, but if not, they're usually weird.

Otherwise, I wouldn't really care. I'll read anything if it's done in an interesting or fun way. I'm ace, so all sexuality has a bit of scandalised-fascination to it anyway in that - ' Drops elbow onto the table and rests head on hand "You do /what/?" ' - sort of way.

** I read mostly femslash as it is so I'm certainly not adverse to it, and I'm LGBT+ myself as it is. I just want to be well done and actually feel like a real romance that happens to involve two people of the same gender It's frustrating to see a lot of cishet offers make the focus of so many queer romances be about coming out and dealing with homophobia. Yes it exists, yes it's a major fucking problem, but it's not often done well and falls flat. Not only that, but sometimes I'd like to read romances where people like me are normal and happy.

The only ones I don't read are fics where characters are transgender. Not because I think there's something wrong with being trans (I am trans), but because you almost never see it done well or done accurately. Being transgender is a weird and alien fucking experience most cisgender people will never fully understand, and it shows in their writing. So I just...don't.

** Ah, this happened to me with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl.]] I didn't notice but in hindsight I agree with the author that I probably shouldn't have been surprised. Unfortunately, it didn't really go anywhere since the third story is unwritten so I can't really say what my reaction would be since it's really only at the "am I gay?" stage iirc.

I guess you could say this was also the case with [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] and there I noped out since it didn't seem to have anything to do with what I thought was the defining feature of the fic. Well, technically, the bit I noped out was where they clarified who the painting actually was. I was already borderline with it... which is why I didn't stick around to make sure I understood the reveal properly... but that was because it was too slow burn not sexuality related.

There's a really, really long Sirius raises Harry storyline with several gay main/primary supporting characters. I'm kind of interested in reading more of that but, again, it's really, really slow moving so I've set it to the side and actually forgotten what it's called. I think Ernie was a rapist in it. But to the extent these are main characters and I read it... I kept reading it (well, skimming to try and get a handle on what was happening with the plot but that didn't really work).

Mostly I don't read a fic (these days) unless it's next gen or Hinny and these kinds of fics either state what the pairings are at the start or are literally based around a specific ship, so it doesn't come up.

There's only so much text about how pretty a guy is you can write while ignoring every girl without giving away your game.

That said, fuck surprise pairings regardless of orientation. Fuck surprises in general, really. Getting the plot spoiled never ruined my enjoyment of anything, but finding elements I dislike after I already put a few hours in absolutely has.
