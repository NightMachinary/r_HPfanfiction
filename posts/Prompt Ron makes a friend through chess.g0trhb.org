Just thought I would throw this out there, of Ron making a friend through chess.

My original idea was that during the start of Goblet of Fire, Ron finds a secluded nook for himself where he works on chess (his preferred way of thinking through a problem) and has a spot for himself. After the Goblet of Fire names Harry and he and Harry have their falling out, Ron increasingly retreats from the Gryffindors and goes to his private corner of the castle. There he meets Fleur, who incidentally likes chess. They bond over it and meet up whenever they have free time. It can be platonic friendship with Fleur being a big sister figure for him (personally I think the platonic version would be more interesting) or eventually romantic somewhere after he quits being an Auror (I know slowburn is slow but he'll have the maturity needed to handle a relationship by then).

Ideally, no bashing of any character.

I just thought it would be a fun idea for anyone interested and currently stuck on what to write.

Plus, being stuck at home, this is how I deal with cabin fever.


** A Ron-positive prompt? Hmmm...mind if I use this idea in a longfic of mine?

*** Best of luck! And have fun!

I just wanted a Ron positive and Fleur positive story, without all the whole 'allure' thing and ideally without any bashing, bullshit soul magic, red strings of fate or any lordship/ladyship magically dropping on the unsuspecting heads of the protagonists. Seriously, doesn't it get old after some time?

I read a good Ron/Fleur story, which you might enjoy: linkAO3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3213029/chapters/6990455]])

The reason why I'm not writing it is because I'm taking a family friendly shonēn anime series, putting the canon through a post cyberpunk espionage thriller blender, with a few gallons of blood coating as a part of the mix and calling it a 'story'.

  Though he's a confident and competent newspaper man, Ron Weasley's heart is full of disappointments. His boss is horrible, and his two best friends have abandoned him in favor of their own company. They haven't even invited him to their wedding. He doesn't think things are likely to change, but then he unexpectedly bumps into Fleur Delacour in a Muggle coffee shop in downtown London. His teen crush might be the one person who can become a real friend and perhaps even someone he can love.

**** This is great! And the Harmony fans will love the fact that Hermione cheated on Ron with Harry and got away with it, even marrying him and living in a "Palace".

But in all seriousness, this fic is good. I just wish Ron was a bit more assertive, maybe cut the Dream Couple off for good, but maybe I'm just petty.

** I've been working on a long fic with an original character who's in the same year as Harry and the gang but in Ravenclaw, and I whipped this up to go with it. Any feedback is appreciated.

Maya started down the hallway towards her favorite alcove that overlooked the quidditch pitch. Her homework was finished and she had managed to escape the prying eyes of her dorm mates so she could read the new novel her brother Avi had sent. She slowed as she neared, stopping a bit away. Her usual seat was taken by Ron Weasley, hunched over a chessboard and muttering to himself. She adjusted the strap on her book bag and approached him.

“Hi, Ron.”

He glanced up at her momentarily.

“Hey, Maya.”

“I was looking for somewhere quiet to read. Do you mind if I sit here? I promise I won't disrupt your game.” She nodded towards the board where he was in the middle of a complicated game.

“Sure.” Ron moved the board towards him, making space for her to sit.

"Thanks.” Maya took the seat and put her bag near her feet.

“Do you play?” Ron asked, nudging a piece to move.

Maya shook her head.

“Not really. Dad tried to teach me but I don't really have the mind or patience for it. I'd rather be in the backyard playing quidditch or reading.”

“My dad taught me. No one else in the family really plays.” Ron glanced up at her.

“Do you want to play?”

“I'm really terrible. Besides, you look like you're in the middle of a game.”

Ron shook his head.

“It's fine. This game isn't going anywhere anyways.” He pulled his wand from his robe pocket and reset the board.

“Ladies first.”

Maya looked down at the board, desperately wishing she had paid more attention to the games her father would play with Avi and Ilana.

“Right. You there in the front row, move forward one,” Maya said, nudging one of the pieces with her finger. Ron snickered at that and she stuck out her tongue at him.

“I told you that I'm not good!”

Ron moved one of his pieces and Maya again attempted to remember some sort of strategy before settling on moving yet another random piece.

“You said your dad tried to teach you?” Ron asked as he absentmindedly moved a piece across the board.

“Yeah. He was a chess champion back when he was in ravenclaw and he wanted one of us to play with him. Lucky for him, my older brother and sister are sometimes willing to play. Neville's tried to talk me into taking up gobstones but I don't see the appeal in that.”

“Neville's your cousin, right?”

“Mhm. His parents weren't able to raise him after the war so his gran, my dad's aunt, asked my parents to raise him. He's practically my brother, and because he's two weeks older than me, everyone's treated us like we're twins so we've always done everything together.”

Ron stared down at the board, studying the layout for a moment before finally nudging a piece forward.

“So you're one of four?”

“Six. I have a younger brother and sister. They're twins and they're still at home. And you're one of what? Five? I know Ginny and Percy, and Nev's told me about the twins.”

Ron shook his head.

“I have two older brothers who finished school before I started. I'm the sixth of seven kids. Always busy and loud at the Weasley house.”

Maya aimlessly moved one of her pieces.

“You're really good at quidditch,” Ron added.

“Thanks. I'm a bit miffed that we're not getting to play this year. I spent half the summer reading over my sister Ilana's playbook to prepare to take on your house. I guess I'll have to settle for watching the tournament.”

“Who do you root for in the League?”

“The Arrows,” Maya replied without hesitation.

“The Arrows? Might as well root for the Tornados.”

“And who do you root for?”

“The Cannons.”

“They're practically the worst in the league! Honestly, you're better off rooting for the Bats or even the Falcons.”

“Pfft. One day the Cannons will be the good again.”

“That's incredibly optimistic.” Maya glanced down at the board and realized that she had only three pieces left.

“Bollocks. I told you that I'm not very good.”

“I can teach you,” Ron offered. Maya glanced up at him and found him watching her.

“Are you sure I'm not entirely hopeless?” Maya teased.

“You're smart. You can pick up chess.”

“Well, my evenings are open now since quidditch was canceled, so if you're willing to teach me, I'm willing to learn.”

For the first time since she had sat down, Ron smiled at her.

A bell chimed somewhere in the castle, and Maya realized that the sun had set and curfew was quickly approaching.

“Let me walk you to ravenclaw tower,” Ron offered as he started cleaning up the game.

Maya watched as he carefully put away the pieces, counting to make sure none were lost, before folding and shrinking the board.

“Right. Do you want to meet tomorrow for your first lesson?” Ron asked as they walked through the corridors.

“I promised Padma and Neville that we'd work on our essays for Potions tomorrow. You could join us and we could have a lesson when we're done.”

Ron paused for a moment before nodding.

“Yeah, alright.”

“I'll save you a seat then.” Maya started towards the entry to ravenclaw tower.

“Hey, Maya?”

Maya turned back to face Ron who was standing with his hands in the pockets of his robes.

“Yeah?”

“Thanks.”

“Good night, Ron.”

“Night.”

Maya watched Ron head off towards gryffindor tower before turning back to the eagle knocker.

** I saw 'he and Harry have their falling out' and 'he meets Fleur', and I got a mental image of Ron deciding to express his jealousy (over Harry being picked) by utterly outclassing Harry.\\
Every time he sees Harry (who's presumably training hard for the Tournament he got sucked into), Ron offers advice and help with training, he practices spells hard and carefully considers theory to help other students, he wishes the other champions well, makes a good effort to romance Hermione and be chivalrous towards Fleur and Hogwarts' other women...and does it all in the most lordly, patronizing way he can manage towards Harry.\\
(And yes, that would include restoring the color to and fixing the frills on his dress robes.)

in the story ron's the best in the school, that info filters to crouch sr. who wants to play him. this annoys percy.

** Oh, man, this whole day I've been reading this as "Ron makes a friend through class" and thinking it's a prompt about how antisocial Harry, Ron and Hermione are.

I quite like what I'm going to call chess!Ron fics, which treat it as more than just a passing fancy or, often, a recurring joke about characters not playing chess with Ron. However, I'm not really convinced chess is a way of working through problems... it's a very abstract game which involves a further level of abstraction due to being turn based. The number of situations where chess is a natural analogue are quite small. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYAoOjm27U][And then there's this speech from Person of Interest,]] which is really about trying to not make God into a sociopath.

If we took this as more "what Ron does when he's basically alone and friendless" then I think we get somewhere more interesting... especially if we take chess as Ron's attempt to have his own thing (something his brothers were never overly concerned with). At this stage of GOF, Ron's in one of his most "overshadowed" phases and, as my misreading indicates, it's not like Ron had many back up friends. Retreating into a little chess world... and maybe this is what you meant with "thinking through a problem"... makes sense.

I think this allows us to take anyone who's in a similar headspace to Ron... maybe Fleur feels like she has no real friends (but quasi-sycophants)... without necessarily needing them to also be interested in chess.

But that's just how I'd take it. Very interesting idea.

Pretty much what I was going for.

It's less of using chess as a way to perceive the world, as much as using a game to subconsciously process his problems.

I just thought a friendship between the two, with their own in-jokes and secrets, independent of all other relationships, would be interesting.

The chess is just a means to an end.
