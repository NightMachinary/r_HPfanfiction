:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey I am trying to do d a story that I started to read last year but that was unfinished when I got out of fan fic. It was about Harry going back in time after Gus death. Part of it is stoping the bad that happened but it's also about getting his love Fleur to fall in live with him. Now here is a spoiler but the last thing that happened was Fleur reviling that she came back in time to. If anyone knows what story this us I would so appreciate it. I tried to find it but I seem to remember that the story summary was not good at telling exactly what the story is,


** Is it Across the time by izwan linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11651647/1/Across-The-Time][11651647]])
