  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** I once had this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9wj0dy/voldemorts_horcruxes_all_obtain_bodies_and_start/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][idea for a story]] where all of Voldemort's Horcruxes get bodies at the same time and start fighting each other.

One of the ideas for that scenario was that Diary!Riddle is basically this naive extremist teenager who genuinely believes he would do a better job ruling magical Britain than all those old idiots in charge. He then falls in a deep personal crisis when he realises that all his older selves are unhinged crazy people who just keep fighting each other for power instead of working together to "fix" magical society, and eventually defects after having become disillusioned with everything he previously believed about himself.

Sadly I'm not nearly enough of a good writer to actually do that story justice.

Tom Riddle is young arrogant idiot who thinks he is the best, only to find out his meagre shard of soul is easily overpowered by a way more stronger magic of the Founders, and here particularly Helga Hufflepuff, who turns him to a hospitable soul.

** It's been a really long time since I've read it, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King]] by Shadenight123 has multiple Voldemorts running around. Near the end of it is the craziest time turner plot I've ever seen, too.

It's very good, but also one of his earlier works. He's also very active on Sufficient Velocity forums, writing there instead of at FFnet. There's a good chance you might have read one of his fics before without realizing it. It took me 3 or 4 fics before I started recognizing him.
