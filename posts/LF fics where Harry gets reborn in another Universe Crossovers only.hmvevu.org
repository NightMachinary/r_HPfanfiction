Like, Harry dies in HP Universe, and then gets reborn in another fandom, with his magic and memories.

Which fandoms?

Supernatural, Naruto, Marvel(MCU, X-Men, Netflix, comics, literally any Marvel), DC, literally any Universe you want.

I'll either read with the fandoms I already know, or I'll find some more, new fandoms to like by your suggestions.

Doesn't have to be MOD!Harry, but it can be if you find them.

Thank you!

  Loki's in for it now. Odin has had enough and has banished him to Earth to relearn some lessons. Too bad he hadn't paid attention to where Loki ended up. Now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, has to deal with memories that aren't his own while he gets his revenge on those who sought to use him as a weapon. Can Harry regain what he lost, or will his past self take control first?

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

  The Hyuuga Clan is also known as the All-Seeing Clan. But they didn't need the help of the Byakugan to know that there was something special about their heiress. (Harry is Hyuuga Hinata/Second in my Reincarnation Series)

  "Evidently, even if he wasn't the Boy Who Lived any longer, apparently, he seemed to be incapable of dying properly. From what he'd observed so far, he had been reincarnated into some bizarre world populated by magic ninjas." In which Harry is reborn as Sasuke and isn't an emo little shit.
