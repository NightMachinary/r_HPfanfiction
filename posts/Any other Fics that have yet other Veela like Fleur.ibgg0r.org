In Book 4 we get the Veela introduced, but as the Canon progresses, no other aside from her is seen. I dont mind, since those arent important for the Plot, but are there Fics that have more Veela than just Fleur inside? The content can be humor, slice-of-life or even smut. It doesnt matter.

** When a Veela Cries has a whole host of Veela (part of the story is Harry getting to know Veela culture, so he gets to know a lot of people throughout Veela Society) beyond Fleur, and Gabby is fleshed out into a fun character too. Takes a while to get to that point, and the opener is... criticised strongly. There's some interesting stuff and some good set-up there, but if you dislike it enough, skip to about chapter 8 or 9 and you'll get the beginnings of the Veela stuff (it only gets more prominent from there).

  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.

** [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel]] have very evil Veela collaborating with Lucius Malfoy. There was nothing NSFW about her, just that it surprised, because most Veelas (aside from those in linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan), but they don't count) are good and misunderstood.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Yeah, I got a few stories I think of that have other Veela characters. Hope you enjoy this list, a few spoilers on how Harry meets these Veela but not something I thought would ruin the story.

*DUEL* - linkffn(9041086) - It's a little later in the story but Harry does eventually go and visits the coven of the Veela or something along that line. It does include a few extra Veela characters of course.

*The Lost Summer* - linkffn(8554615) - Does some neat world building around Veelas while introducing some new Veela characters. It's short, sweet, and simple.

*Amicus Protectio Fortis* - linkffn(11547735) - Again this is late in the story. Harry goes and meets with the Matriarchs of the Veela.

  Harry won the war! So, why is he sitting all alone at Grimmauld Place while everyone else is off celebrating, or planning his life? Well, maybe it's time our hero took a little vacation and enjoyed the lost summer.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
