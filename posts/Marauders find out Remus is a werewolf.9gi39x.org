Hi all!

I'm looking for any fic recs where James, Peter and Sirius confront Remus about his lycanthropy. I've read Against the Moon and since then I've been browsing around for good fics. (There is also one in particular I enjoyed but can't find again where Remus thinks he's going to die on the same full moon they figure out his secret and Sirius is furious when he comes back that he didn't say goodbye- if anyone knows what I'm talking about please let me know)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5642077/1/][Intellectual Exercises]] is a short little oneshot that fits what you're looking for!

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]] might fit as well, if I remember correctly?
