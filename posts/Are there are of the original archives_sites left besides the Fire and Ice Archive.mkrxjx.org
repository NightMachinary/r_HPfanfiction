Hey all,

So, as you all know, the original archives that used to exist for different varieties of HP fanfic have disappeared, one by one. FFN and AO3 are obviously around, but I think you know the kind of archives I mean... fictionalley, Portkey, restricted section, etc etc etc. Ours is still here (a Draco/Ginny archive), and I'm determined to NOT let it disappear. It was started on eFiction, there are some real technical problems now, and exactly one of the techie people who began the site is still around, so you can probably imagine what the issues are.(That winning-Powerball plan didn't work, so I haven't been able to move it to a platform that actually would be better...) It was started in 2004 (not by me, I took it over in 2014.) But it got me wondering... it can't seriously be THE LAST one left standing. So which of the others that started in the early days are still left?? Does anybody know?? (BTW, we're at [[https://www.dracoandginny.com][Fire and Ice Archive]] if anybody wants to check it out, but this isn't self promotion-- I just want to find out how many pages similar to ours are still left. Also, I'm actually Anise in the fandom since 2002, so who knows, somebody might actually remember me! Miracles DO happen. ;)


** Potions and Snitches (the Severitus archive) is still up and running: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/]]

*** It is a very sad site: of course, I understand it is all-Severitus all the time, but I cannot understand why all stories are EXACTLY THE SAME (Harry is almost tortured to death, saved by Snape, super-sentimental scene of fake reconciliation without any true repentence). Just one story which seems at least a bit original is “[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2878][Dear Aunt Tuney]]” by Manfredd and that is unfinished. And then there are incredible things like “[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2744][The Harry and the Ivy]]" by slytherensangel26, Lady Destiny: I have never read any pureblood married Snape with The Snape Manor, it looks really bizarre.

** I know that is exactly against what you are talking about, but AO3 is run by the non-profit organization exactly for the purpose of archiving third-party archives (and yours wouldn't be the first to be mirrored there).

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/about-the-archive#whatisao3]]
- [[https://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/en/]]

Otherwise there are still other archives than FFnet, AO3, or Wattpad: SIYE, [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]], and others are still around, but it is true, that it seems like those big three are pulling all oxygen from air for anybody else.

*** I think AO3 is great-- I remember the day FFN decided to get rid of all the explicit fics, and given that these things happen all the time, there absolutely needs to be a huge archive that's an alternative. But I'm very unwilling to let FIA go that way. I literally just got an email from Open Doors last week saying that they are still a looooong way from hosting Fictionalley's fics, and only 79 of them are actually on AO3 right now. (I don't know why it's taking so long, and nobody else seems to either, but for whatever reasons, the process started in 2018 and that's all there is of it that has been completed to date.) So that's one reason, but a much bigger one is that the FIA archive has meant so much to some people for so long. I don't know what I would have done without it at certain points. It's saved my life. No matter what, I'm keeping it alive. But it's good to know that it's not the ONLY early survivor still standing.

**** Oh, it is a shame, that Open Doors work so slow! And of course if you hold on, then more power to you! And yes, there are some ancient sites with some incredibly influential stories which are if not exactly thriving at least still holding on: [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/]] (you see, what's my preferred ship ;), although a lot of stories from here have at least copies on FFnet/AO3), [[https://www.fanficauthors.net/]] with some of the most fundamental stories.

***** Well... that would require somebody who both knows something on the techie end AND was putting time into it. I'm in the second category, but not the first! ;) It's a LONG story, but basically, there were a zillion volunteers when the original creator started the archive in 2004. They really started to kind of fall away in about 2011 or 2012. I didn't get FIA until 2014, and if I hadn't stepped up, it would be long gone by now. By that time, it was me, a couple of mods, and exactly one person left who had any tech knowledge at all. She's doing a couple of things, but the reality I've had to face is that she's done with it aside from very basic help. She was one of the two people who originally started the archive, but she's just not into it anymore at all. I'm grateful for the help she does give. I have IT friends who've worked in very different areas from keeping ancient websites going, so they help as much as they can, but it's not really what they know. I've actually thought about paying someone to just sit down and talk about what WOULD need to be done in order to make the site viable in the long run.

****** yeah, and I shouldn't say anything as I am not volunteering myself :( For somebody who knows their way around Apache (which is what's running on the site) and has access, it should be matter of an hour or so. CORRECTION: Your hosting provider offers [[https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9927/2218/free-cpanel-positivessl-certificate-offer/][SSL certificates for free]]. No idea, how to switch it on though.
