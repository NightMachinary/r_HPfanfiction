I've been in a big mythology kick lately since I've been exposed to the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. I don't mind the length or the characters involved.


** Linkffn(13098062)

This is mine, OC work in progress. The plot involves figures from Celtic mythology adapted into the HP world, and they're central to what unfolds. It's post-canon, the protagonist is somewhat of a younger, darker Dumbledore-esque character. I do a bit of worldbuilding with other myths here and there as well.

If you can suffer the first couple chapters, you might hopefully have fun with it; chapter three begins to show the aspects you're looking for, and I think it's where I hit my stride.

^{Edit because I used the word 'figure' three times in two sentences and figured I should correct it before someone figured it out.}

*** Thank you. Is the Pyrrha mentioned Pyrrha of Thessaly? Can't wait to check it out. :>

EDIT: Well, I guess I should say /one of/ the Pyrrhas seeing as there are several with that name in mythology.

**** No, she's not one of those figures. Sorry if that disappoints! The name is unusual, but I put a lot of thought into it. It's both fitting and plausible, I think, given her upbringing and what names we've seen from canon.

***** No, it doesn't at all. It is an unusual name but, like you said, it's fitting.

  The Cabal decried Pyrrha's course as doomed, so she went on alone. Upon an unnatural isle she found the haunting witch she sought to end, let free the unraveling bonds, and lost control. Escape was hardly the word for what followed when so little remained.

** A significant portion of Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time occur in Atlantis. I'll admit I don't know much about the mythology of Atlantis beyond it being a lost city so not sure how faithful it is to the myths. That said, it's a pretty fun read if you don't mind works written in the 1st person perspective.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

** The Wayland Smith's stories often incorporate ideas from European mythology. In particular, the second fic in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/683603][The Wandering Devil]] series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612/][Traveller]], draws on many tales about the 'sidhe' in old Gaelic folklore. linkao3(10313612)

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind and found themselves in a world filled with the night-time fears of mankind. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields, and the Gentry are riding. Worst of all, Death himself has taken an interest in them, and he has a plan. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear.
