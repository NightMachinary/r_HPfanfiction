** Linkffn(Oblivion by chaosemperornex) and linkffn(knowledge comes at a price) are the only 2 good ones I've found after pretty extensive searches.

  He's not the Boy-Who-Lived. He's not the Chosen One. He's not even a hero. Quite the opposite in fact. He's a being of such terrible greatness that at one point, those who were hated as devils and worshiped as deities, saw fit to seal him away. Now he's back and he wants his throne. Let Order reign...

  Lily Potter never actually saved her son's life. No, Hermaeus Mora did it for her, at a price. The witch ended up in Apocrypha and Harry became a new dimensional anchor for the Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge now standing on his shoulder. Poor, poor Wizardry World.

*** I was not a fan, personally. The dialogue was weird, and the chapters were entirely too short. Formatting was also not ideal.

***** Sorry about how long it took me to reply, FFN was down when I first saw this and then I forgot about it entirely.

The dialogue just seems very stiff and has odd word choice sometimes.

#+begin_quote
  "Let your blood drop on top of the parchment." answered the older Potter "It is enchanted to reveal somehow certain details about the owner of the blood."
#+end_quote

Just as a quick example, I have no idea why he would specify on top of the parchment. Something like "Let your blood drip onto the parchment", or "Get your blood on the parchment." would work better, imo.

And then "It's enchanted to reveal details hidden in your blood." The main issues with that sentence is the 'somehow' which just makes it sound weird, and the 'it is'. Contractions are important; not using them makes things sound very robotic and formal. Which is occasionally something you want, but not in a random conversation between family. The rest is fine, really, though the 'owner of the blood' bit is a /little/ odd.

And later Harry says some skeletons are 'loitering' around some ruins. Which is a term I've only heard used in the legal sense. That may be a localization thing, or maybe your Harry is supposed to be using big words for the sake of it.

I'm trying really hard to be constructive and clear, but I'm not great at this.

****** I was afraid it would be something like that.

The stiff dialogue and word choice comes from both my experience (or lack of) as a writer, and my limited vocabulary (as English is not my native language). Not trying to make Harry use "big words", as you said. I just thought those would be appropriate for the situation.

Regardless, thanks for replying.

  Her big yellow eyes opened slowly. Those stupid two-legs had brought her and her young with them to this place so far away from their home. She wasn't pleased with them but would go along with it for now. There was a rustle in the bushes not to far away from her cage. "Well, well if it isn't a little Dovahkiin," she said. - Warning for Yaoi. If you don't like it then don't read.

  [complete] Harry died. Voldemort won. The world burned. A foreign magical nation sends a message into the past to rewrite the future. However, meddling with time always has consequences, and doing things again doesn't necessarily mean a happy ending. AU, multi-xover. Contains SLASH. Complete!
