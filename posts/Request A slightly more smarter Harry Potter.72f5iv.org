Looking for stories where there Harry is slightly smarter then he was in canon, but not unbelievable. So no Hermione or Dumbledore levels of intelligence please just because it's not believable.

Just a little bit more smarter.

Any rating is fine, am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash although would rather the story not focus on romance that much.

DO NOT give me stories with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as pairings, don't like them as pairings. Any other pairing is fine.

*** More smart either way, just as long as it's believable and isn't Hermione or Dumbledore levels of intelligence.

**** You are being teased about your incorrect grammar. "A Harry Potter who is /smarter/," or "a Harry Potter who is /more smart/," are both fine (though I would argue that "more smart" is incorrect). "More smart/er/" is, however, incorrect.

***** Ah my bad, I didn't realize that it was incorrect. And now I feel foolish.

**** You're overselling Hermione. She is intelligent but not smart.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.
