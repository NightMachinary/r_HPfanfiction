I loved Dumbledore's Army and thought it was a shame that Rowling didn't use it after Umbridge left the school.

I would either like the DA or something like the DA to help students with their classes that they need help with.

With so many students, students who are better at certain classes then others you'd think that there would be some sort of tutoring section for people who need help.

People like Neville who wasn't that good at potions, or isn't that confident in things like Defence.

People like Ron who needs to work harder and stuff like that.

Maybe people who need help to write essay's or whatever.

I know at my school, when I went to school because I'm no longer a teenager; we had tutors to help students that needed it. So I just wondered why something like that wasn't set up at Hogwarts.

So yeah, just looking for stories that has tutoring sections, note it doesn't have to be the main focus of the story, as long as it's shown I'd be fine with it. If someone would like to write something that has to do with the tutoring sections I'd love to read it as well

Any rating, any Era, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Note I don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione but if it's written believably I'll allow it.

Very little to no character bashing.
