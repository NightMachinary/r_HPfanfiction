Finally read Altered Destinies and I loved it. Tried reading Balancing Destinies but couldn't get through more than half of it.

I am looking for stories similar to AD, where Harry goes way back in time and end up having some sort of Mentor relationship with Tom Riddle. No slash, that's not what I'm after today.

Hopefully there are similar stories to this


** Boy who lived - it's Harry going back in time and saving Merope and hence, Tom. It's Harry/Merope with father/son relationship between Tom and Harry.

  Not even the birth of her son could compel Merope to continue living after her husband's abandonment, but the green-eyed stranger sitting by her deathbed, cradling her squalling babe, proves to be an unexpected savior. Time Travel. Rare Pair: HarryxMerope

** Haven't finished Altered Destinies quite yet, but is a parental relationship alright? If so, If Them's the Rules, linkao3(284278). The tags seem to be marked as slash, but it really isn't.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.
