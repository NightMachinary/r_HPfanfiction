*Fem!Harry is bisexual, and dabbles with a multitude of other characters male and female, but the Fem!Harry/Ginny romance is the main focus of the story.

*Hard R.

*Violence/Sex/Language.

*No summary can really do it justice.

I seem to be recommending this more often than usual... but that's okay because it's one of the best fics you'll ever read.

** Oh boy. This brings back some hazy memories. Are we talking sites, authors, or specific stories? Also, NC-17 or no?

*** Honestly any of the above would be appreciated, although specific stories would be nice. Any rating is fine, I just appreciate good storytelling.

edit: spelling ("good storytelling" has a different connotation than "god storytelling". Oops.)

** There's a writer called Antosha who put out some steamy stories, but they are limited to registered readers. Worth a look (and the registration).

[[http://mujaji.net/repository/browse.php?type=categories&catid=25]]

When I have a yen for these types of stories, I usually search for likely pairings- Hermione/Fleur, Hermione/Pansy, Hermione/Luna (sensing a trend yet?). The problem is that these rarely include anything more than the romance and some associated angst to drive the main character outside of her usual thought patterns.

(A Butterfly Effect is a good rec that goes beyond the usual fulfillment scenario)

*** Aye. I second this. Antosha writes some pretty visceral fem/.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8587736/1/In-The-Long-Run][In The Long Run]], HG/GW. It's one I'm reading at the moment, unfortunately it's not updated very often.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound_With_Silver_Threads][Bound With Silver Threads]], LLP/OFC. Been a while since I read this, but I think I liked it.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7525570/1/Here-And-There][Here and There]], HG/GW. A time travel fic that I can definitely recommend.
