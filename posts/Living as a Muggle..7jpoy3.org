Any fics out there wher Harry doesn't want anything to do with the magical world and wants to live his life as normal everyday Muggle. Where he refuses to go to Hogworts and have anything to do with magic. Where he lives a normal Muggle life.

I prefers fics that start before canon.

I don't prefers fics that have Harry leave the magical world after he's gone to Hogwarts.

Wbwl and Fem Harry welcomed. Crossovers welcomed too.


** Step 1. Take any piece of non-fantasy fiction with a male lead.

Step 2. Pretend that the main character is secretly Harry Potter who changed his name and came up with a fake history for himself to escape the attention of the magical world.

Step 3. Repeat.

*** I mean, a Harry who is scarred by the war and silently suffers while everyone else is throwing a big party and decides that he does not fit in would be interesting. But what OP wants makes no sense. How can a 10 year old boy be allowed to make such life changing decisions in the first place?

*** If we do go with a post war Harry it would make sense for him to pretend to be ex-military. It would explain quite a lot. And since he always wanted to be an Auror maybe he could pretend to be ex SIB - the military police's detective branch. Cormoran Strike sounds like a cool name...
