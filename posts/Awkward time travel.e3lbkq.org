I think the idea of harry time traveling and one of his parents or one of the marauders falling for him is pretty hilarious. Got any suggestions? I have weird humor I get that.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Harry was sick of it all. So when he catches Draco in Snape's private stores, he decides that he isn't going to stand back and let Draco lie about it. During the fight, a rare and unusual herb is hit, and Harry gets splashed with the concoction...and wakes up in his parent's fourth year! Determined not to be used again, he befriends a younger Snape and changes his name.

**** To stop him from being a Death Eater and a miserable cunt in the future? Have you even read the fic or are you just yapping on? This is the teenaged boy, not the adult. Love the salty downvotes by the way. This is what I get for trying to help and fulfill OP's request. By your "logic" why does he choose to befriend Bellatrix Lestrange from the other recommendation? Fuck, this fandom can be really edgy.
