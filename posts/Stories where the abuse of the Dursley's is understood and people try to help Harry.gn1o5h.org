So earlier I had made a discussion about the Dursley's abuse: The link here: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gmyt58/overdoing_the_dursleys_abuse_when_is_it_too_much/][Overdoing the Dursley's abuse: When is it too much for you? (A discussion about writing abuse in fanfiction in general)]]

Now, I'm a huge fan of hurt/comfort type of stories where characters go through something traumatic and slowly get better through help with others. (Rather they want help or not). So that's where I'm looking for, if the abuse is worse than in canon I want the author to understand the implications of such abuse, and the writing for it to be respectful, instead of it as a way for us to feel sorry for Harry or us getting excited when the Dursley's get what they deserve, I want more than that.

Harry still struggling, not being able to fully trust adults, hiding stuff like food as though he's afraid it'll be taken from him, it being ingrained in him to cook, clean and other household chores, where some people might stop him and maybe if they do he freaks out or something similar, doesn't need to be exactly that, but just something where the abuse is really ingrained in him in some way that makes sense.

I want Harry taken away from the Dursley's, I don't want evil Dumbledore, I want well meaning Dumbledore who just made a mistake.

Whatever the rest of the overall plot is I don't really care, I don't care if Horcruxes are a thing or not.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings)

Anyone can be the main character, Can be on ANY site, can have any warnings. Can be any plot or genre.

No Character bashing. Now: Characters disliking/hating each other, or having a falling out, or getting upset at a realistic thing to get upset over is perfectly fine, but no evil Dumbledore or evil Weasley's. No Order or Weasley's using Harry for his fame or fortune, no one using a love potion on Harry, et cetra.

No OP Harry, Harry smarter or more powerful then in canon is fine, I don't want it to be a just because thing, I don't want him having Godlike magic or because of creature inheritance or anything to that nature, I want it to be because he worked hard for it.

If Harry is a "Lord" I'd rather him still help people, not be Draco Malfoy 2.0

Would rather it still be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

Edit: It doesn't have to be exactly like I was mentioning, with the abuse, just something in a way that makes sense, instead of how canon treated abuse.

  "The Dursleys," Harry said to Amelia Bones, finally opening up about his childhood, "they kept me in a cupboard."

  Amelia nodded. "Well, it's good to hear the Muggles at least know something about how to properly raise a wizard. Did they also expose you to danger?"

  Harry blinked. "Well, they let my cousin beat me up all the time... so long as he could catch me, that was."

  "No, no, that won't do at all," Amelia said, and Harry felt like he was finally getting somewhere. His feeling was short-lived. "I'll have to have a discussion with your guardians. They should have at least been throwing you out of the window on a fairly regular basis. How's a child's magic supposed to manifest if you don't expose them to proper danger? Honestly, these Muggles know nothing. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Harry. Don't worry, I'll make sure to take the appropriate action."

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** I commented on the previous post but will add on here!

A few of my faves: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5926514/1/Perception-is-Everything][Perception is Everything]] by Kendra James (Severus and Remus take Harry on as an apprentice after discovering his abuse)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4927160/1/In-Care-Of][In Care Of by Fang's Fawn]] (Severus is stuck in bird form & Harry takes care of him. Severus sees how the Dursley's treat Harry)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3341876/1/Reading-the-Signs][Reading the Signs]] by GoldenCompass (Don't remember much from this but Harry loses his voice & Severus discovers his abuse. They communicate in sign language)

A few others: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12063568/1/][The Best Affinities]] by Caesara (more neglect & exploitation than physical abuse. Aunt Petunia uses Harry as garden labor for people in the neighborhood & Severus takes him on as an apprentice after he discovers Harry had a special magical ability)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16909389/chapters/39725442#workskin][An Unexpected Detention]] by MagnificentandStrange

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4547552/1/Arms-of-A-Dark-Angel][Arms of a Dark Angel]] by snapegirl

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3804990/1/Emerald-Eyes][Emerald Eyes (& Sequel Mindful Eyes)]] by JadeSullivan (this is one of the first guardian Snape fics I read)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4722467/5/][Harry and His New Family]] by grugster (lotsa hurt/comfort in this one & honestly it's a bit much. But there are lots of adults concerned about Harry's healing in this one)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2519543/1/Skin-Deep][Skin Deep]] by vingilot (honestly this isn't my fave & there was too much abuse for me & there maaay be some dumbledore bashing. But Harry is sexually abused and has tattoos on his body to make sure people don't touch him. I believe this is severitus.)
