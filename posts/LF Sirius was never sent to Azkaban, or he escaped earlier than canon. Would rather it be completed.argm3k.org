Looking for stories where Sirius was never sent to Azkaban, he was given a fair trial or the like, or he escaped earlier than in canon.

Would prefer him raising Harry.

No Weasley or Dumbledore bashing, if possible.

Would rather it be completed

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione. Any other pairing is fine. Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

No super powerful or super smart Harry, Harry more powerful or smarter than he was in canon is fine, but please make it believable enough.


** There's the Innocent series, which has its plus points, but also a slew of negatives - like Remus being present (can't stand him personally), Sirius working for the Ministry after being proven innocent, and having too many POVs, Remus tolerating being in Greyback's presence and addressing him as 'sir' and so on.

I also felt that it was far too long winded - the first book ends with Harry's first year or something, and that's almost 500k words for 3-4 years, from the time Harry is 8. That was too much for me, and I abandoned it halfway through.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

**** I just finished what's written of this series and really enjoyed it. Though I do agree that it is very long. While I like that about it, I can definitely see where it could turn some people off.
