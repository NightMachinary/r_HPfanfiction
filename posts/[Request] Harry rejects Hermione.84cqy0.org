I read too many HHR stories where Hermione chooses Ron, after some time they break up for some reason and she goes to Harry who gladly accepts her and declares his undying love.

I'm looking for something a little bit different.

The premise is the same: Harry is in love with Hermione, but she chose Ron. After some time she understands that she made a mistake and that she is in fact in love with Harry. Hermione goes to him, but he rejects her, because he:

- moved on (happy with a girlfriend or even with his own family);
- or doesn't want to be a reserve boyfriend;
- or just can't forgive and forget;
- or something else.

I think several years ago I read something like this. I believe the story was named "Your turn" and in it Hermione realised her feelings for Harry after she had married Ron, but at that time Harry found his happiness with another OC girl. Unfortunately I couldn't find it any more.

Thank you for recommendations!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

***** Thanks!

I looked through it and I don't understand how does it relate to my request? Did I miss romantic part of the betrayal?

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione disappears. Harry searches for her for years, but she is gone... until she finally comes back on her own terms. (Written to illustrate the flaw in this trope.)

  A little humorous one shot by me and my friend...I know that this would never really happen, since Snape didn't become Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher until after Cedric died...But who cares? 8D
