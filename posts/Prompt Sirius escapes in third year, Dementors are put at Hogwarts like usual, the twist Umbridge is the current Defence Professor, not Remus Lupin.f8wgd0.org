** First thoughts. Umbridge would be completely different. The reason she sent the Dementors after Harry, and tried to get him expelled for underage magic, and used the blood quill on him were all in response to his insistence that Voldemort had returned. If this takes place in third year that motivation is missing.

In fact, in third year the ministry was heavily on Harry's side, with Fudge himself ensuring Harrys safety after running away and taking care of Aunt Marge with no consequences for Harry.

With the only change being Umbridge as Defense professor there wouldn't be a massive change to plot. She would probably teach a stuff but effective ministry approved curriculum designed to best prepare students for their OWLs and NEWTS. Harry would probably approach her first for help with the patronus, though most likely she'd discourage him, saying that the ministry had the dementors completely under control.

What I feel would be a better approach would be to have Lupin as defense professor and Umbridge as History professor. Her hatred for filthy half breeds would make for great conflict with Lupin. The breakins from Sirius would work well for generating conflict in the ministries distrust for Hogwarts ability to keep the students safe.

*** That sounds like a interesting idea! I just wanted to see any kind of changes with it (didn't have to be exactly what I had posted). I even posted a edit, just in case.
