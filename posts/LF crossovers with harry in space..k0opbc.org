Hi all. Just came across a SG-1 ccrossover called Harry Janus Potter - Dances with his Destiny. It opened with harry coming into possession of this cool spaceship with a bunch of cool weapon technologies that were described in detail, then he proceeds to not really do anything involving spacebattles and it lost me.

I know there are plenty of crossovers where he goes somewhere with ships, but most of them have a ground based/political focus. I just want Harry in a cool ship bouncing around doing fun things. Bonus if it involves a smart harry and/or magitech.

No slash please. Crossover Fandom isn't all that important.


** I'm planning to write one, even got a really detailed system for how every part of the spaceships work but I can't get around to writing it.

  COMPLETE. Firefly: :Harry Potter crossover Post Serenity. Two years have passed since the secret of the planet Miranda got broadcast across the whole 'verse in 2518. The crew of Serenity finally hires a new pilot, but he's a bit peculiar.

*** This is one of my favorites. I like how they really tie in the plot lines of Firefly and not try to force it. The way it's done just seems to make sense, like it was waiting to happen all along.

**** Mine too! I also really like how you don't /need/ to have seen Firefly or Serenity (though, of course, I have ... repeatedly ;) ), nonjon did an excellent job of giving backstory to the 'Verse without it seeming like heavy handed exposition.

** Linkffn(Havoc Side Of the Force) is a fun HP in space ride.

My own Linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard) is more plot-driven, so may not be what you're looking for, but it has a pirate Harry in the Rebellion.

  I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.
