...as opposed to trying to atone for inadvertently murdering lily, and supporting a cause that lead to the fracture of their relationship and the prejudiced abuse of people like her. or, there's nothing in the text that supports that as one of his existing or sole motivations. he says in DH:

  “I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter ---”

  He stood to gain nothing personally but the triumph of the cause Lily had believed in. He was trying to do right.
#+end_quote

i've never seen someone actually substantiate that claim, which is partly why i'm making this thread. what evidence for it is there?


** As the author, JKR gets to establish the facts of her universe but she doesn't get to determine how it is interpreted. So she can determine Snape's actions but she can't determine how we view those actions.

The key issue here is that what a person /does/ reveals more about their true character than what they profess (which is incidentally one of the reasons "show don't tell" is common writing advice).

Snape and JKR state that he was motivated by a kind of noble love for Lily which meant he took up her cause as his own. His actions, however, speak to something else. The people Snape chooses to associate with and enjoys the company of reveal much about his character - he obviously prefers the company of the Malfoys to the Order, even after his supposed conversion. The way he treats Harry is simply not compatible with the idea that Snape truly and selflessly loved Lily - if you love someone you don't treat their most precious thing like shit. And his treatment of Hermione indicates that he apparently retains a certain amount of anti-Muggle born prejudice. And he clearly still loves dark magic, something Lily hated.

Snape's actions are far more compatible with a kind of obsessive, acquisitive love, where he wanted Lily as a possession. His being fine with James and Harry dying so long as Lily survived is further evidence of this. Under this view, Snape's vendetta against Voldemort is the personal vendetta of a man who had his prized possession taken from him, not an ideological disagreement.

And to counter a frequent response: saying Snape had to do the above as part of being a spy is a fundamental misunderstanding of his nature as a double agent.

*** I agree with your general assessment (Snape wasn't convincingly redeemed, in spite of Rowling's best intentions), but I think you cast him in an unreasonably malicious light.

I see him as a loner who falls in with the wrong crowd and does bad things. His attachment to his one friend outside this group (call it love if you will) is strong enough that, upon being betrayed by Riddle, he in turn betrays the group. I think we see more evidence of genuine, close friendship (or unrequited love, even) than possessiveness. And the former would be more likely to turn him against everyone he knows.

Do we see Lucius interact with the Malfoys in a non-DE capacity? Narcissa comes to him as "Draco's favourite teacher and Lucius' old friend" -- but that tells us nothing about whose company he /enjoys/. Throughout the books it's made clear that he's a loner and I see no reason to believe he forms close attachments to either group.

Love comes in degrees -- Snape's (considerable) hate for James was stronger than his love for Lily (helped along considerably by Harry's appearance and James-y behaviour in their first interactions). I think if Harry were in Ravenclaw or Slytherin, their relationship would be /very/ different.

#+begin_quote
  And his treatment of Hermione indicates that he apparently retains a certain amount of anti-Muggle born prejudice.
#+end_quote

Do we see any prejudice outside of the 'mudblood' comment (which I refuse to hold against him -- I've said far more stupid and hurtful things)? His dislike of Hermione can be explained by her friendship with Harry and, well, genuinely being annoying.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The impression I get is that Snape held back on dark magic at Lily's urging. It seems very natural that he would learn the Dark Arts (which I agree, he clearly loves) after their relationship deteriorates. I'm not sure how any love would change that -- forsaking the Dark Arts in the name of a old friendship is very ...un-Snape-like.

Ok, I wrote way too much. (This is weird -- I'm usually on the other side of this discussion.) Basically, it's clear his actions don't reflect perfect, romantic love and I don't think Rowling suggests that. But there's no evidence that his love is possessive or perverse. I think he's a loner who made one close friend in his life, and that meant enough to him to change his allegiance.

I'm pretty sure the real life equivalent would be calling your black friend the N-word, or your gay friend the F-word. You don't use those words unless you're racist/homophobic, it's not something that you simply blurt out.

**** I agree with all of this except saying he hated James more than he loved Lily, and that he loves dark magic.

When asking Dumbledore to protect Lily, he asked him to protect James too if that's what it took.

Hermione sums it up best in HBP when she says Snape teaches DADA like Harry. They have /respect/ for the dark arts, and Snape has an innate capacity for them. He also doesn't really see the dark arts differently than other forms of magic.

His love for Lily was only romantic on the surface, considering he cared enough about her well being to sell his soul to Dumbledore for her protection, along the protection of the man he hated and the spawn of their union. Take everything good that's ever happened to you in your life, (every accolade; every achievement; every loved one and the love you feel for them) and place all of that into one person. That's what Lily was to Snape. His only friend. The only person to actually care about him. The only one who was willing to look past bad hygiene, poverty, a standoffish attitufe, and Snape self-destructive behavior. It's like a single ray of sunshine in a life that's been nothing but storm clouds.

nah, that isn't obvious. we aren't privy to his inner thoughts. even then, associating with and liking someone doesn't mean you share of or approve of their views, considering he'd prefer the company of lily to all of them, during hogwarts, where their views clashed. and i don't think it's unrealistic to suggest he cares about dumbledore. it's entirely plausible that he and the malfoys have an amiable history, and given that he doesn't have to actively oppose them, since his cover is dependent on him only pretending to be reformed, he just lets it be. he also has a rapport with filch, a squib- even snape must like having friends. also, this is actually one of the instances where his being a spy /is/ relevant, since staying in lucius, a high ranking de, 's good graces, is useful for info. on voldemort and the DEs. you can also say he more or less betrayed them by aligning with the order which would ultimately result in their...death or incarceration, or such.

i can accept an interpretation that says how he treated hermione is implicitly anti-muggleborn, but i don't think you can argue that it was explicitly his intention, or that it clashes with him consciously and actively opposing muggleborn discrimination in it's most obvious forms- at best it just says he didn't do the work to examine his unconscious biases. he bullies hermione because she's a gryffindor, friends with harry, and he's a bully who thinks it's amusing to pick on students and stan for slytherin. it's funny, actually, because a lot of people on this sub talk about how annoying and grating hermione is, how she isn't a genius just very studious, and that's exactly what snape mocks about her

and no one's claiming that he /selflessly/ loved lily. it's obvious that he didn't, since he projects his hatred of james onto harry, and doesn't think or care about how lily would want harry to be treated. the claim is that he does feel remorse for, *specifically*, his death-eater and murder-y actions and how they affected lily, and actively works against /that/. not his bedside-manner- he doesn't care about that, that wasn't the cause he supported

he maintains a fascination with the dark arts, but he uses that knowledge to heal and help others throughout the series, from draco to katie to dumbledore. /how/ he interacts with and uses it changed

...i can't see how he hoped to possess lily after she was dead. his indifference to james and harry's death also doesn't suggest he thought he could 'claim' her after they were disposed of, just that he doesn't want to devote any energy into actively helping james or his progeny, so focuses on lily being not-killed. also, that was when he was 21. you can easily say he regrets that sometime after and would save them if he could do it again, just not...be civil with, or like them. like, he does try to protect harry for lily, even if he mistreats him. that's the point

#+begin_quote
  Snape's vendetta against Voldemort is the personal vendetta of a man who had his prized possession taken from him, not an ideological disagreement.
#+end_quote

i mean, you're stating this, but not proving it. all in all, you're mostly criticising unclaimed abstractions. 'snape's love for lily was toxic, ergo it has to be toxic in this specific way'. nothing in canon opposes the idea that snape actively thought he was doing the right thing to atone, and opposing the ideology as a part of that. nothing supports that he has a personal vendetta against voldemort, or that he doesn't disagree with him ideologically

to elaborate on the point above: saying snape is 'obsessed' with lily, which i agree with, isn't really useful without outlining /how/ that obsession manifests. norman bates is obsessed with his mother, which causes him to assume her personality and murder women that he's attracted to. batman is obsessed with his parents' death, hence his guilt and never ending battle against ~crime. snape is obsessed with lily, which manifests as him supporting the cause she believes in, opposing voldemort (he holds himself partly accountable, hence the guilt), and being willing to die to save others, because of his feelings of guilt and remorse
