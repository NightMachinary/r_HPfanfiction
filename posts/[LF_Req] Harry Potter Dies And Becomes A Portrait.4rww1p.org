** The only story I can recall that fits your request is [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/5280/1][Restoring Hope]] and a oneshot sequel, [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6683][Turning the Page]] by Paracelsus, who wrote Coming Back Late. Hermione's portrait figures much more prominently in the story compared to Harry's.
