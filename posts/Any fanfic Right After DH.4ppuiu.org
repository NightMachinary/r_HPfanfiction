Hey guys, just finished the series for the first time a couple of days ago! I was just wondering if there is any well written fanfiction right after the Deathly Hallows ended? (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, the rest of the Weasley's, etc.)


** *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), is pretty good.

  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. The following day Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals. Grave Days.

** /Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ is a superb piece of writing. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but what exists has some of the best and most distinctive writing I've ever seen in fanfiction. The "voice" is crazily well executed, and the large number of erudite references and allusions only add to the story.
