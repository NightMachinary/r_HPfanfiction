And how the hell did we get this idea? Did J.K. Rowling allude to it and I'm just forgetting that bit? Did he actually have a fan club (a common trope)?


** It's an inference and a logical one at that. He was young, from an Ancient & Noble family, a rebel, he ran with his own crew, he played jokes and presumably, he was good at magic & attractive. Now if we ask the question "Would a young Sirius Black use all those things to bed as many girls as possible?", I think the answer is a resounding yes. The glimpses we get in the books show a pattern of little inhibition, poor impulse control and generally a passionate disposition. AND he was a teenage male on top of that. He had it and he (most likely) used it.

*** I think this is a perfectly reasonable claim, but it's by no means the only logical scenario. A lot comes down to what the cultural norms are in the wizarding world around sex during teen years, which we get no canon info on. You'd imagine that over the 1000 or so years of Hogwarts' history, teachers worked out a system to keep a significant portion of witches' educations being interrupted by constant impregnation, which would eventually shift into cultural norms.

I don't know if it's just because it happens in /every/ fic that talks about them, but Sirius and Tonks both being promiscuous seems to have become canon in HP fiction and to me it's such a one-dimensional interpretation of the wizarding world (and the way people work in general).

**** Honestly, did he want, try, think he is a promiscuous ladies' man? Maybe yes, but was he? No way! While the marauder era is around 1970-80, and a fairly open era, by all example purebloods seem to be effectively raised at least a couple 100s earlier. Where does he even get the WORD promiscuous from? Makes little sense to me.

Tonks makes a bit more sense being a muggleborn with a rebel streak as wide as Hogwarts is tall, but that is also built upon the idea of her being the perfect moldable sex doll... I don't see how she may end up facing this alone and go down that path. Someone with her powers in HUFFLEPUFF? Someone has to have noticed and tried to help out, maybe talk to Sprout... Tonks Promiscuous fame feels more like something that was forced upon, a secondary curse of her main power in most cases, and I don't see the world being stupid enough to let it happen to her without even she herself think it is wrong.

***** Tonks is a halfblood. Her mum is Andromeda Black (Sirius' cousin) and her dad is a muggleborn, so she was presumably raised in a mostly magical environment. I also didn't really see much evidence for the rebellious streak, apart from joining the order, but by that logic Snape, Kingsley and Remus are 'rebellious'.

I think the main reason she's written as Crazy Wild Tonks™ is that authors think it makes it easier to make Tonks interesting, but I think this characterisation comes from linearly extrapolating the few snapshots we get of her in canon.

My image of her was that she liked stepping out of line for smaller stuff, like pranks or being out after curfew, but that she respected more serious rules more than most Gryffindors (probably for the best since she became and auror).

****** I was way to asleep when I wrote that... What I meant with the muggleborn part was that she was raised with some muggle influence, enough to likely be able to say 'electricity' at least, thanks to her father, so what I think is that her father should be... 'Sane' enough to help Tonks NOT fall too deep into the promiscuous sex doll persona. Sirius main support in life during many years was James Potter that was his same age, Tonks did have some proper paternity.

In my opinion Tonks is more of a do-gooder that think the system should work, ergo being an Auror, but sees it does NOT work and steps out of law (Is there any canon reference to the Order actually being illegar?) and does what is needed to fight the Dark and such. I don't think she is some 'Crazy Wild Gal' really when I say rebel, more of a 'I do shit my way' kind of rebel with very good intentions.

She keeps short spike purple hair and lets it shift around even when being serious and likely at work, does pig snouts for jokes and giggles, goes by her last name and doesn't give a fuck much about opinions, like how she literally bullied Remus into being with her.... Tonks is like Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs: She is a cop, but doesn't give a fuck, that only means she uphealds the law and spanks the wicked.

** Did he try to be? Almost certainly.

Did he exceed? Probably not a whole lot.

1. The Marauders aren't lovable pranksters to everyone. Their treatment of Snape shows they don't know how a joke goes too far. People might have laughed but if you upset someone you are going to alienate an entire social circle in some cases.

2. The latter years of their schooling and immediately after was shadowed by what is effectively a magical civil war. People would be worried about safety, shagging someone who is friends with Bones, Dumbledore, Potter, and other OoTP members could make you a target.

3. Generally not a lot of hookup opportunies in a prison, especially one with soul-sucking monsters for guards. Being an escapee makes the situation only marginally better if you want to avoid going back there.

And then they made more dementors with that semen.
