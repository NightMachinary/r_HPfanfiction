  “Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object!” said Moody. “It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament. ... I'm guessing they submitted Potter's name under a fourth school, to make sure he was the only one in his category. ...” (GOF, chap. 17)
#+end_quote

Do you know about any stories where this fourth school has been investigated? I know about delightful linkffn(Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687), but nothing else.


** There's one where Harry refuses to compete.

** Well you could try a story called the Diary of Time by joemjackson. It's where Remus becomes the Headmaster and Sirius the top professor of Fernunculus University, Corporation of Kent when Harry is forced into the tournament

linkffn(12624339)

In another story, the bad guy uses the name of a Japanese magical school and an assistant Headmaster of that school comes out to watch/participate. The story is part of the Honestly Harry series by Captain Compass and is called The Year of the Spares.

  The fourth year of Harry and his girl's at Hogwarts. A prestigious but dangerous competition comes to the school and Harry ends up totally in the middle of danger again. Are Death Eaters returning along with their Master? Why are there extras of everything hanging around? Uncertainty, new enemies, situations of bravery and foolishness; another regular deadly year for Harry

** linkao3(The Accidental Animagus) Harry actually gets a judge from his school, despite the latter being even more baffled by the development than the others.

Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path) IIRC he's from Salem Institute or something like that. The school had closed a few years previously.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG.
