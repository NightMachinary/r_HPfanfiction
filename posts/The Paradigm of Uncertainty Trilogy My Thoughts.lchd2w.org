I know I'm about 20 years late to the party, but I recently found this trilogy while looking for a copy of the fic A Sirius Affair. I really want to talk about my thoughts on it (with spoilers), and this seemed like the best place for that sort of word vomit.

Being a Sirius fangirl, I only ever read A Sirius Affair and a little bit of A Sirius Change back in the day, and while I knew they were offshoots of a fic called Paradigm of Uncertainty, I never bothered with said fic because I was only concerned with the Sirius storyline. However, now that I have them saved on my Kindle, I'm reading all 5 stories in chronological order (so A Sirius Affair, then Paradigm of Uncertainty, then The Show That Never Ends, then A Sirius Change, then The Hero With A Thousand Faces). So far, I've read ASA, PoU and TSTNE, and I'm currently on A Sirius Change. I will update this post once I've read all 5 fics.

*A Sirius Affair*

ASA was a beautiful and really nostalgic read for me, and I'd happily pick it up for a comfort read any day of the week. I love the Sirius/Cordelia romance and the creative plotline, and I'm an absolute sucker for fics where Sirius' name is cleared, so that aspect delights me every single time. Some things require a little suspension of disbelief, and there are a lot of typos and a few inconsistencies (probably due to this being authored by 2 people)... but heck, it's a fun ride and really takes me back to the golden era between GoF and OotP when my own fanfiction imagination was constantly running rampant. Highly recommended!

*The Paradigm of Uncertainty*

I really enjoyed the first of Lori's PoU trilogy - again, it was pretty AU, but believably so, and the plot was incredibly engaging. I wasn't sold on the weird six-housemates-in-a-mansion living situation at first, especially with one of them being an OC, but it definitely grew on me after some time (as did the OC in question). Also, dare I say I prefer this Cho Chang to the wet wipe that is Canon!Cho Chang? The villain, Allegra, is also a great creation. One thing Lori definitely gets right (in all three fics) is creating villains and situations that genuinely feel high stakes and also don't recycle things that have been done in canon. The authors of Cursed Child should have taken a leaf out of her book in that regard!

*The Show That Never Ends*

However, on a more negative note, the second fic, The Show That Never Ends (TSTNE), definitely lost me quite a bit, and I want to talk about the reasons why:

1. The increasing Muggle pop culture references from the magic characters is... jarring, to say the least. I can let it slide with characters like Harry and Hermione, who've grown up around Muggles, but George Weasley dropping superhero references?!

2. There is a little too much blatant fan service - the full-on Buffy and Spike cameo made me cringe right to the core of my digestive system.

3. The characters are incredibly AU relative to their book versions... even their book versions from the first three books. It wasn't so bad in the first part (PoU), but it's definitely worse in TSTNE. I think Harry and Hermione getting together somehow worsened the AU-ness. Perhaps I'm not as much of an H/Hr shipper as I thought I was! Obviously, the argument can be made that people change in adulthood, and that 27/28 year-old Harry and Hermione aren't going to be the same as 13/14 year-old Harry and Hermione... but even then, some of their dialogues just feel like they're being said by completely different characters that bear zero resemblance to their book counterparts.

4. The dialogues feel really unnatural in places. At several points, I found myself thinking, "Nobody talks like this." That was the case in the first fic too, but it's definitely worse in the second one. I also think (and I wouldn't blame Lori for this, because it's only natural) that Lori's own Americanisms (or her non-British-isms - I don't know her nationality) tend to come through a little too strongly in the dialogues. She definitely made the effort to incorporate British slang, but it feels off-kilter simply due to a lack of understanding of how it's used. E.g. she tends to use "bloke" rather than guy, which would be fine, except "bloke" isn't a universal Britishism. Ron would say "bloke". Hermione? Not so much. But in this universe, she does.

5. The characters's "voices" are hard to keep apart because they all seem to just be vessels for the author's own voice. I notice this much more in the PoU stories than I do in ASA and ASC, so I think this is definitely a Lori issue. In many of the long conversations where only speech marks are used, I've found myself having to go back to the beginning of the conversation and count lines to be able to determine who's saying what, because it doesn't feel obvious.

6. Following on from point 5, I get the strong sense that certain characters only exist, or are only brought in in certain scenes, in order to advance the plot. E.g. Laura's love life is only discussed in PoU because it's relevant to the main storyline, since her boyfriend Sorry later becomes a key player. However, where Sorry is in TSTNE is anybody's guess. (Edit: the above actually is somewhat clarified in HWTF, so I somewhat eat my words - however, I do still find it odd that Sorry was SUCH an absent boyfriend for a fic and a half's worth of time and none of the characters felt the need to check in with their supposedly great friend Laura as to the health of their relationship. It also doesn't seem too believable that the Sorry from the first novel, who definitely seemed to care about Laura, would suddenly be "too busy" to discuss their relationship, especially given that they had TWELVE YEARS of history together, from their teenage years into adulthood It just felt like he needed to be written out in some way in order to make way for the coupling up of Laura and Ron in the third fic). What I love about the actual HP books is that even when characters are used as plot devices, like how Mundungus Fletcher in Book 7 tells the trio about the locket, they feel like fleshed out humans who have their own lives and make their own choices that naturally mesh with the main characters' choices in order to drive the plot forward. In the PoU trilogy, I can't help but feel that the side characters don't have much going on in their lives beyond their concern for the main characters. That said, I do feel like the OCs have some merit and mesh well into the existing world. I particularly like the character of Napoleon, even though his unrequited attraction to Hermione feels totally unbelievable and inexplicable to me.

7. The whole Mage plotline is... kind of unbearable. The trope of Harry having ridiculous, gratuitous powers that nobody else has has always been eyeroll-inducing to me. While his Mage powers are adequately explained, making him THAT powerful just feels unnecessary and borderline Gary Stu-esque. That said, the scene where he starts to really lose it and the evil version of him starts saying cruel things to all his loved ones is pretty impactful.

8. The Guardian stuff was inventive, but ultimately weird and unconvincing. Why did Theo agree to save Harry in exchange for a portion of Hermione's life (which she later revealed she never intends to actually take)? If she didn't wish to interfere in human affairs, why did that caveat change things?

9. Hermione in particular really doesn't feel like the Hermione I know in this fic. I feel annoyed that she ended up in the same workplace as Harry: while her being there obviously makes it easier for her to be where she needs to be for the plot, and while she /did/ end up in a more bookish, less combat-intensive division that's more suited to her personality and talents, I think it would be much more realistic for her to have continued to work in a completely different remit. It just feels like she's slowly morphed into a female Harry in this book. Half the time I can't tell their characters' "voices" apart. Then she suddenly decides that giving up a portion of her life for Harry is too far and she needs time to rediscover herself. Girl, you've basically become him anyway. ðŸ˜‚

Edit: I've now finished reading A Sirius Change and Hero With A Thousand Faces, so I'll review those now.

*A Sirius Change*

A Sirius Change to me is a prime example of an author not quitting while they were ahead. A Sirius Affair was tied up fairly neatly. A second fic that supposedly takes place in the same timeframe as TSTNE just wasn't needed. It also doesn't feel believable to me that major life-altering things are happening in Sirius and Cordelia's lives, but Harry and Hermione aren't there for them. The author, Carole, explains their absence by saying that they are busy with the events of TSTNE, but I see the events of ASC as significant enough that Harry (once he gets back from his two months of being missing) would be there to support Sirius and Cordelia through them (I mean, Sirius' wife goes missing and needs rescuing!). Also, I didn't really like how a lot of what happened essentially undid Sirius and Cordelia's well-earned peace, plus the wereleopard stuff was frankly borderline ridiculous. I actually found myself enjoying Draco's character, as well as the development of Ginny/Draco, more than Sirius/Cordelia, which isn't a ringing endorsement given how much of a Sirius stan I am. So unless you're a VERY keen Ginny/Draco shipper AND have read the first two PoU fics, I would highly recommend skipping this fic - some bits of it will be unclear/confusing if you haven't read the first two books of the PoU trilogy, and the Ginny/Draco portions are the highlight and would carry the fic if that's your ship of choice. If you're a Sirius stan like me, definitely read A Sirius Affair, but skip this one.

*Hero With A Thousand Faces*

As for the final fic of Lori's trilogy... HWTF starts off REALLY well. The bombshell at the end of the second fic, followed by the return of Ron really improves things. It was handled really well, plus his character and behaviour felt more believable relative to his canon counterpart than most of the others do. The changes in it felt warranted by the unique circumstances he'd been through. However, I really wasn't convinced by his unwillingness to pick up a wand/learn magic again. I think that highlights one of the main issues I have with the world of PoU in general that I already touched on in my discussion of TSTNE - it's far too "Muggleified". I don't for a second believe that a witch or wizard could simply choose not to have a wand or use magic and not feel like they were missing out on anything. To me that would be like somebody in today's world choosing not to have an email account. They could get by without one, but it would make their lives a lot harder. We never see Ron face a single negative consequence from his choice not to use magic. I'd have much rather read about that than read yet another Harry/Hermione scene where they talk about Allegra or their insecurities... but perhaps that's just me.

Also, speaking of gratuitous H/Hr scenes, I have to say that there is wayyyyy, wayyyyy too much fan service in the middle of the fic. I'm sure die-hard H/Hr shippers would appreciate the excruciatingly detailed descriptions of Harry and Hermione's pre-wedding and wedding celebrations, but I am not one of those and was absolutely dying for more action to kick in, and I was relieved once it finally did.

It was a bit disappointing that Lori never finished HWTF - it would have been good to read the confrontation between Harry and The Master. However, I have to say that I was relieved to be able to simply read a summary of what would have happened rather than having to actually read it happen, especially since she was planning another fic after this one. I think after over a week of reading these fics, I'm now quite exhausted! So I'm happy to have closure without having to read any more.

I do think Lori was perhaps a little bit over-ambitious with regards to certain concepts that she introduced in the series as a whole. Some of them contradict other aspects of the story, or have potential implications that are never addressed. Firstly, she made her main villain EXTREMELY difficult to defeat (although I did appreciate that Harry's Gary Stu Mage powers were not ultimately what brought on said defeat.). Also, the concept of the Guardian introduced in the second fic made me question various things in the third fic: TSTNE made it clear that the Guardian doesn't interfere in human affairs, yet she reappeared in this fic to let Hermione know certain things. It doesn't add up, I feel, and makes me wonder why they didn't try and consult the Guardian about other things. A third aspect I found myself questioning was that seeing infinity was apparently enough to send Harry mad in TSTNE, but here, Kate Salvatore is able to see and deal with all the magic in the world, and the Chancellor of the IFW could at some point become privy to the knowledge of how to shut off all the magic in the world, yet neither of those things cause madness in either Kate or the Chancellor despite the fact that magic is presumably infinite. I think smaller and less mind-bending and world-altering concepts could have made the fic more internally consistent (and likely made it easier for Lori to complete it).

*My Overall Thoughts On The PoU Series*

Overall, I can't deny Lori's incredible creativity and ambition (over-ambition, even!), and I think it's amazing that she created what she did just three books into the real HP series with so many unknowns to flesh out. However, I do think the characterisation needed work as it often strayed too far from the original, plus the "Muggleification" of the world didn't seem to fit with JKR's creation. That said, I'm unsure where Lori (and indeed Penny and Carole) are these days, but I'm surprised they never tried to cash in on their old fanfiction fame the way Cassandra Clare or E. L. James did. If those two are published authors, Lori and co. definitely could be (indeed, I'd argue that Lori is a better writer and far more creative than Cassandra or E. L.).


** Thank you for the review of this fanfic. I first read the TV Tropes page and it's incredibly uninformative about the actual story, kek.

*** Thanks! Yeah, I went looking for other people's thoughts on the fic and couldn't really find any beyond one comment in another Reddit thread... so I thought I'd write out my own thoughts in case anybody wanted to hear them!

**** Can you elaborate more on the villain of the story? TV Tropes hyped that guy a lot.

Also, TV Tropes says that the final parts of the story were incredibly mind screwy. How was that?

***** I will do once I reach the end of the third part! Right now I'm on A Sirius Change, which is a companion piece that takes place at the same time as the second fic of the PoU trilogy, but focuses on Sirius/Cordelia and Ginny/Draco.

I've now finished reading all the parts of the fic (and updated this review!). I had a look at the TV Tropes page for it too to see what was said. I can see why they hyped him up the way they did - he seemed to have no weaknesses as a villain (apart from arrogance, but that seems somewhat merited given his level of power and knowledge). He was also raised in a way that meant he developed pretty much no empathy, as well as none of the moral limits of the average person. At one point he even engages in incestuous relations with his own mother.

There were definitely some mind-screwy concepts in general, and particularly towards the end. In general, the good guys have to really push the boundaries of magic and the universe in order to try and defeat evil. It gets slightly head screwy at times (but not so much as to be unfollowable).
