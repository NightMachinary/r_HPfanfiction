I recently re-read Ushmushmeifa's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2646438/1/With-Sword-And-Head-Held-High][With Sword And Head Held High]] and our own [[/u/__Pers]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7165521/1/Don-t-Disrespect-the-Queen][Don't disrespect the Queen]]. This set me off on reading other [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Highlander-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/31/224/?&srt=1&r=10&s=2][Highlander crossovers]]. (I'm also now on the second season of the Highlander series...)

I've found that I particularly enjoyed stories from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/479439/MarbleGlove][MarbleGlove]].

I recommend his story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2067949/1/Death-Betrayal][Death & Betrayal]]. Those who like Snape will, I think, like this story. (I have not yet read the sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2323014/1/Life-Loyalty][Life & Loyalty]].)

I also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2418008/1/Icarus][Icarus]]. It isn't a HP/Highlander crossover, but I wanted to recommend it anyway. "Some successes are only measured in how long you last before falling. Hermione writes a letter and begins a relationship."

I hope you enjoy these stories.
