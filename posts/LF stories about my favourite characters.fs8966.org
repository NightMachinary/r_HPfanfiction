  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco returns to the school for his 7th year - one of the only Slytherins who does. As isolated as he feels, he soon realizes someone else has been alone for much longer.

#+begin_quote
  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.

** I have one complete story about Snape that's pretty much follows canon, and another AU that ships him and Regulus and features Death Eaters too, which is in progress.

Hope I'm linking properly from my phone

Linkao3(22211695) Linkao3(severus seen)

But if the links don't work, I'm pet_genius on AO3.

[Edit: it linked to the wrong fic, I fixed it, hope it solves it] [Edit 2: it didn't, here's a full link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22211695/]] ]

  "Tomorrow is broken. Tomorrow is nowhere." A year has passed since the Phantom Thieves struck down a god and saved Tokyo from a terrible fate. But when people all over the globe begin to suffer from "Paranoia Syndrome," mysterious seizures which leave them contorted and unconscious, Akira Kurusu finds himself in the Velvet Room once more, demanding answers for the affliction. His investigation leads him to the Dead Sea, the rotted remnants of the cognitive world, where all things go to be forgotten - including someone the Thieves had thought to be long gone. Meanwhile, Akira's comatose body is found in the waking world, and his terrified friends suspect the worst. Akira's confidants struggle to learn the truth behind Paranoia Syndrome, while he and Goro Akechi approach a fated confrontation in the decaying shell of the cognitive Tokyo. As the sickness continues to spread, the Phantom Thieves must reunite and destroy the evil festering beneath the Dead Sea's waters, before its malignant influence unravels civilization forever.

  The Prince's Very Extended Tale - The story from Snape's perspective, as he struggles to redeem himself with help from an unexpected ally.Definitely meant for adults (dark themes, not smut). Complete (until I rewrite). I love reading people's comments so please leave them, positive and negative comments are welcome.
