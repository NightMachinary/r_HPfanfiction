:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry is a teacher (maybe headmaster? idr) at Hogwarts, and the Ministry finally pushed hard enough that the TriWizard Tournament is restarted. The main force behind the push is Susan Bones, who also happens to be Harry's ex. Somehow this story ends up with a Harry/Hermione pairing?

Forgive me if I've gotten two fics smashed together in my mind --- it's a distinct possibility, and it wouldn't be the first time. Also, if you have any further Teacher Harry + Harry/Hermione stories, I'd love to hear them!
