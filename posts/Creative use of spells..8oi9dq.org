Hi,

I'm looking for completed stories or uncompleted but not abandoned stories where there is some creative use of spells.

I read a lot of fics where the pull out some complicated, over the top spells and so one but what interests me is some creative use of basic (even harmless at first glance) spells in combat modified maybe by visualization and intent. Some may need powerful people to do it which isn't too much of a problem as long as it is a bit creative (for example why not use aguamenti which seems to be pretty basic and harmless like water jet cutter by changing how the water comes out. Why can't a bubblehead charm be used not to allow to breath but on the contrary to block any air?).

Thanks


** The Mind Arts linkffn(The Mind Arts)

- Harry creates several balls of light to send into his opponents face.

- Harry invents a spell that pulls everything towards it, during a duel he shoots it off the side and pulls the opponent out of bounds.

The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute)

- A bubblehead charm is filled with water to suffocate someone.

- Harry transfigures blades of grass into metal and launches them at his opponent.

- Harry vanishes the earth underneath him to escape being trapped at one point.

*** Also wanted to add a not too common fic: Echoes of Power, Part I: Anger linkffn(3322666)

Harry gets really creative with his use of spells. Some highlights include:

- Creating a bubblehead charm around someones head, then shrinking it to change the pressure and destroy the inner ear.

- Using warming charms and beard flipping charms to distract opponents.

- A great scene focuses on just what your talking about. Harry duels someone using only the cushioning charm.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** In linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter) Harry's signature spells are simple and creative. For example he fills the air with spices and uses a bubblehead charm to protect himself.

** A scouring charm was mentioned in the Last Mage of Krypton series as being used by Flitwick to win a duel. "Only one foot slipped."

In the same fic, Hermione creates a spell that causes the opponent's next spell to send them flying back.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
