I'm looking for good Adult Harry fics. Not immediately post war, but after things have settled a bit, at least a couple of years. I don't quite know how to generically describe it, I suppose examples would be Ministry bureaucracy headaches, kinda slice of lifey? Maybe getting bored with Auroring and getting a different job? Having a midlife crisis and going on a world tour? Just. Adult Harry fics. Idk.
