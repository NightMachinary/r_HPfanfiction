  Anyway, I think you both probably do know that a penis is used for sex. So let's look at one. Go ahead, Ron.

[[https://www.wattpad.com/235509289-hp-rl-sb-new]] Here it is. Now that I saw the author name, I googled it and their ao3 profile seems dead. Weird, huh.

*** I am ashamed of myself, but what can I say? I saw it maybe once and then it stuck in my brain and I could not find it anymore. I grew so desperate (I hate not finding things, really) that I made this throwaway to ask here

Thanks for not judging

** Haven't seen that one.

But I do remember a short on ffnet (I think) about Harry and Rose having a torrid affair, sneaking fucks all over the place. Ron keeps stumbling across them, and they keep coming up with more and more fantastic explanations on how Rose fell on Harry's lap after he accidentally managed to drop his pants.

I can't find it again, which is probably just as well. But there's a disturbing number of Harry/Rose fics out there.

*** Ah, I believe I read that one before. People really seem to dig Harry/Rose, right? I've seen a few Ron/Lily Luna and Hermione/James Sirius or Hermione/Albus Severus, but nothing tops Harry/Rose it seems
