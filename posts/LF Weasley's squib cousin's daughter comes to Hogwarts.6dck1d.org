I remember reading a story (probably about a year ago) where the Weasley's squib cousin's daughter comes to Hogwarts - she's sorted into Slytherin and they aren't that nice to her until they realize she's actually a descendent of a pure blood family and not a muggle born. Once her heritage is discovered then she's (I think, somehow) one of the highest ranking witches in Slytherin?


** I didn't know there was a story on it but the idea is straight from J. K. Rowling. She was going to be in the books but Rowling cut her out. Meant to be the trio's Slytherin friend.
