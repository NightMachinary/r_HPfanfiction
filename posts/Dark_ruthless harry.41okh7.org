Hey people, I'm looking for a well written dark Harry fic. Anything goes except slash - I don't mind smut, gore,extreme violence and all that. Just as long as it's a dark Harry :)


** My vote goes to *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185): [[/spoiler][that Harry was neither evil, insane, nor psychotic, but appeared benevolent, charismatic, and compassionate. He could be brutal, cruel, and ruthless when necessary. Therefore, the damages he created were even greater because he could charm and mobilize millions for his purpose. Ironically, the only credible resistance to his imperial ambition at the time of the last published chapter was Voldemort, who was busy controlling muggle governments and brainwashing thousands of muggles into suicide bombers.]]

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** linkffn (The Nightmare Man)

I think this... covers it. Basically Harry is insane and dark as hell.
