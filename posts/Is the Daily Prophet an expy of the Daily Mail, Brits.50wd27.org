As an American, I don't really know all the satirical references to British culture that JKR made.... I know Rita Skeeter is an expy of tabloid reporters, but what else was Rowling poking fun at?


** Not really, the Mail is known for being right-wing and sensationalist, neither of which really describe the Prophet. Skeeter's column is a poke at the gossip tabloids that harassed Rowling.

That said, she definitely doesn't like the Mail, which is why she gave it to Vernon.

*** It always bugs me when I hear Vernon mentioned as being a Labour voter precisely because of how Rowling mentions that he reads the Mail. That and he seems like a caricature of someone's racist uncle.

***** Yep. And remember Vernon runs a drill factory. For all Petunia's aspirations of being middle class, it's likely that he didn't go to university and worked his way up, now being stuck in the typical Baby-Boomer time warp where he assumes that "young people today" are all layabouts for not doing exactly the same.

******* I don't have my copy of Philosopher's Stone to hand but I swear the first chapter had him as an owner. The wiki has him listed as a director. It also lists his start date there as 1968, with his birth date being 1954 or before, which suggests that he started work there as soon as he left school, probably as a salesman, since he was privately educated, rather than the factory, and worked his way up.

******** Yeah, that sounds reasonable, straight out of Smeltings into an office type role, gradually working his way up to director.

It's interesting to imagine the kind of job he actually does, come to think of it. His home life doesn't exactly scream sales to me but he also doesn't come across as the kind of administrator who gets promoted to board level. He seems like one of these people who must be totally different in the office.

********* If it was the sixties when he started working there, I expect he was earning a modest wage as a salesman, he would have already had his bullish nature by that point because it was emphasised by the school he went to, so he probably would have used that determination and intimidation in order to get people to buy. If he was selling drills, that's not a door to door kind of thing, but more industrial, and if you think about the UK economy at that time, there were a LOT of factories. I could imagine it would be easy pickings and he'd do very well.

Petunia, most likely, would have been a secretary, perhaps at the same company, perhaps at one of the companies they had a big deal with. He would have impressed her with his fortitude and his disdain for Mod fashion, which probably would have alarmed her a little bit. He might have had his own car which would have felt like unparalleled luxury. (Did you ever read J.K. Rowling's story of the Ford Anglia which inspired Mr. Weasley's car?) I expect that she still lived at home and felt overshadowed by Lily. To feel pretty and enticing and novel to this very up and coming, masculine, headstrong young man must have been quite intoxicating for her, and he'd probably have wined and dined her because he wouldn't have been splashing the cash around on himself or anyone else. She'd have worked after she got married, but only until she got pregnant, it wouldn't have seemed proper. They'd have bought a house for under Â£10,000 when they got married (cohabitation still being relatively rare) and sold it, probably for twice that, in the late 70s to upgrade to number 4, Privet drive when Vernon got the promotion to director and they decided it was time to have a baby.

I am getting an urge to write now. I wonder if there are any young Dursley fics out there.

** Tabloid papers are definitely a target, but the Prophet also seems to be a parody of gossip magazines like Hello, OK, etc.

I wouldn't say that the Mail specifically is being referenced as opposed to tabloids more generally. It doesn't seem like the Prophet has a particularly "right wing" viewpoint, whatever that would mean in the magical world (pro-Pureblood, I guess). Rather it seems to be sensationalist, which is true of all tabloids.

*** It's sort of a general conglomeration of the bad side of media, really.

Rowling's had some serious run ins with the press. One of the leading cases on privacy law of recent years is [[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/1908.html][Murray v Express Newspapers]] and it's over photos of her kids.

** I don't think the Prophet is sexist and pervy enough to be a straight-up expy. The Daily Mail's online Femail page is really something. Female celebs can't step out to the shops without an article that describes what they're wearing and how rough they look without mentioning what it is they're actually doing.

** I read HP before I started reading newspapers.

The Daily Mail's journalistic style has always reminded me of the Daily Prophet. It's all the adding of irrelevant adjectives to paint a picture of the person they are interviewing, the "We can exclusively reveal" and other such things.

The Mail is a tabloid, really, but when I think of the word "tabloid" I assume red-tops like the Mirror and the Sun, and while they are sensational, they are (in my experience) much more sex, gossip, celebrities and relationships rather than being a hysterical take on a tiny aspect and blowing it up into "news" which is what the Daily Mail and the Daily Express tend to do.

You can read all of these newspapers online, BTW.
