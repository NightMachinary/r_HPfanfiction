I've wanted to write a post War fic for at least a decade now and while getting to the writing of it will likely take some time, I like to do some research when the mood strikes. Essentially I want to do a realistic rebuilding story and I had some things that might be interesting as discussion. The overall idea is thus: assuming that we look at Death Eaters and the movement as an insurgency how would counter insurgency help reform the government? Whether or not this is a purely "Muggle idea" considering Kingsley Shacklebolt's stint in the British PM's office I don't see it as too much of a stretch since this is fanfic anyway.

Here are my background questions that people might have insight about:

1. How many Death Eater's remained alive after the battle and how likely is it they escaped?
2. The book presents two very black and white ethical sides those for Voldemort's ideology in a extreme way and those against. What might a middle position be?
3. What might the politics look like of someone who was elitist/traditional, but not an outspoken supporter of Voldemort?
4. Obviously Lucius Malfoy cannot hide from what he has done, but how likely is it that other wealthy people are just slipping back into "normal" lives again?"

And of course anything else that might be interesting to think about please share!


** If you want to keep this story canon and epilogue compliant, here are my suggestions:

1) The role of Ministry of Magic immediately following the Battle of Hogwarts.

The British Ministry of Magic resembled more of a failed state. Although it properly tyrannized law-abiding citizens, it was utterly useless against sadistic genocidal terrorists. For example, after Voldemort came out into open in Year 5, it failed to capture a single Death Eater, despite Harry Potter (their supposedly Chosen One) knowing every one of his inner circle members.

Then, 6 weeks after the 'great' Albus Dumbledore died, it fell without a fight to Voldemort's forces. Then, large number of its bureaucracy collaborated enthusiastically with those sadistic genocidal terrorists to exterminate a sizable minority of its population.

Finally ten months later, its security force, along with that sadistic genocidal maniac and his minions, were destroyed at the Battle of Hogwarts by a group of teenagers and citizen volunteers.

This was an completely pathetic organization that should have lost all authority, legitimacy, and deterrence after the war. I expect it to be thoroughly purged by the winners of the war and rebuilt from the ground up.

--------------

2) The roles of our heroes (The Trio, Ginny, Neville, Luna mainly)

I know many people like the angst/comfort/hurt genre. But I don't think our main characters going broke immediately following the Battle would be canon compliant. They didn't just lead happy lives 20 years later, but ruled magical Britain, and that could not have been achieved if they had drown themselves in PTSD misery for years!

They were after all mentally extremely strong people. They certainly knew that despite the enormous cost, they had scored a major victory over the evil. However, significant number of Voldemort supporters were still on the loose or even hiding in positions of power. Their own hold on power immediately after the Battle was tenuous at best. They knew they couldn't afford to brood over loses or drown themselves in self-guilt, but would honor the fallen with effective actions of their own.

Their decision to send Harry and Ron into Auror force, and Hermione and Ginny back to Hogwarts was a highly rational one. It meant they placed political necessities above their own emotional needs. One of their goals was certainly to have the boys taking an active role in the government, while having the girls recruiting more followers at Hogwarts.

We know Ron and Neville spent only a few years as Aurors, which meant that Death Eater threats were mostly gone by that point. Harry needed only 8-9 years to make it to the youngest Head Auror ever, which implied that he was very successful at this job. He spent a further decade as Head Auror before becoming the director of DMLE. Another implication of those canon facts was that Harry had the loyalty of Magical Britain's security forces.

Also, you can no longer assume our main characters to remain innocent children or naive teenagers anymore. To get where they are at in the Epilogue, they will have to become hardened warriors and cunning politicians.

--------------

3) Magical Britain will have to experience radical changes. I have written an one shot for the occasion of BoH's 20th anniversary. It's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][an interview with Harry]], linkffn(12925628), and I have him saying "they had been very thorough with Voldemort sympathizers".

I don't expect them to carry out mass executions or torture, but they would take following measures such as:

- Establish their own political and paramilitary organization/network based on the DA. Hermione, Ginny, and Luna were working hard in their last year at Hogwarts to recruit followers for their cause. It started out as a self help group for students to overcome the trauma of the previous year, and Luna came up with the proposal to formalize it and expand it to the general populace after their graduation.
- Seize control of Magical Britain's security forces with DA veterans and Order members.
- Rile up and organize the general public to purge and reform Ministry/Wizengamot. The mass torture of Hogwarts students under the Carrows should serve as a primary rallying cause.
- Grant significant emergency and surveillance powers to Aurors. Auror office eventually became the equivalent of combined MI5 and MI6.
- Hold public trials and fully expose atrocities committed by Death Eaters, Snatchers, and Voldemort sympathizers.
- Reject “I'm just taking my orders” as a form of legal defense.
- Reveal the damages caused to Magical Britain by Blood Purity ideology, using examples of Bulstrodes, Carrows, Crabbes, Goyles, Lestranges, and most importantly, Voldemort himself.
- Make public support of Blood Purity high treason.
- Taboo the word “mudblood”. But instead of going after each trigger, Aurors would record the frequency and location of their occurrences, and send humans to conduct in-depth investigations.
- Vetting of all public positions (Ministry employees, Hogwarts staff) for extreme ideologies.
- Confiscate assets of Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to compensate their victims.

*** Thanks! I was already planning some of this. I agree with numbers 1 and 2 whole heartedly you did a great job summarizing The original story idea came from a writing based RPG where I came up with a plot for creating a Wizarding MI5 so that will be a large part of it.

** 2 is a little tricky because Rowling took a lot of Nazi themes and added magic but forgot why the Third Reich came to be. Hitler could only rise to power because of the abdication of the Emperor and the resulting democracy which lacked widespread support. The nation was crippled by the Versailles treaty and had to surrender a significant part of its territory. And due to the lacking democratic tradition, there was no stable government. Throw in two economic crisis (1923 and 1929) and people were desperate for stability and improvements.

Yet there is nothing similar in the magical world. The purebloods already appear to be fairly influential. After all, a good dozen managed to bribe their way out of prison. Voldemort's rise was a simple power grab and little more. He didn't rise because the people were desperate after almost two decades of war and hardships, he rose because the elite conspired to take more power. That makes it a lot more black and white than the Third Reich, which had a lot more nuance to it. Rowling took the street fighting gangs, the Death squads and the racial purges, but failed to build a foundation on which to rest that. That's why the Death Eaters are a lot more black and white than the Third Reich, at least until the end of 1940.

*** Thanks for this. I love the WWII time period, but couldn't put my finger on why a direct parallel didn't seem quite right. This explains it nicely . I'll have to brainstorm some other effects,

**** It is also curious to note that the Muggleborn registration was a lot harsher than the Nürnberg laws it was modeled after. The laws just banned racial mixing and had some job restrictions, whereas Umbridge was shipping people off to Azkaban by the score within a month of taking over. Meanwhile such massive persecution wasn't seen in the Reich until at least the invasion of Poland.

** 1. Most frontline Death Eaters are likely captured or dead.

2. People who kept their heads down and didn't do anything in the war. Too cowardly to do what is right, not evil enough to support Voldemort.

3. Like "oh, let's not be too harsh... those people meant well, and they were only following orders... let's not make too much of a fuss about mudbloods, I mean, muggleborns, yes? Both sides were extreme, right? Let's try to be a little more balanced."

4. I would think that actual Death Eaters don't get to slip back, but those who didn't actually fight, but went along with the regime, and those who managed to keep their hands relatively clean and claim they were only doing their usual jobs at the Ministry have good chances to slip.

With a post war plot, revenge will be an important theme. What is revenge, what is justice? Can you stop people from continuing the war? Will you keep your own side from committing crimes now that they are in power? Can you mend the rifts the war tore up? How far do you take the needed purges? What about rebuilding and restoring that which was taken from the victims of Voldemort?

I've got my own take on post war rebuilding in "Divided and Entwined", where the war was far bloodier and more vicious, but the questions remain the same after every civil war.

*** All good points thanks! I guess another thing to think about is that we don't have much in terms of an actual DE agenda besides blood purity, that's not a /small/ thing per se, but it is broad. Besides straight-up bigotry what drove people to want this (economics, preserving tradition etc.)

Dealing with Muggleborns who want revenge was another thing I will need to flesh out. If I go with the fact that no DEs escaped then I want to avoid the trope of a child out for revenge, but I might think of something else.

**** Well, I usually assume that the main motive of Voldemort was power - he wanted power over everyone else. And his followers wanted more power than they had. That goes for the dark creatures following Voldemort as much as for Lucius Malfoy. Others might have bought into the "mudbloods want to steal our country/culture" line.

With regards to revenge, depending on how far you stray from canon, some people might have legitimate grievances against the good guys.

Also, while I think all DEs who took part in the Battle at Hogwarts were captured or killed, there should have been DEs holding down the fort elsewhere - in the Ministry, Azkaban, perhaps some base. I don't think Voldemort took everyone with him and exposed his bases.

** Sorry for not answering your questions directly and for this long and rambling text. But you did say you were researching. What I have are some cut and paste paragraphs from various newspaper articles regarding the events "post-revolution" of a real life country. Just replace the words "Marcos" with Voldemort, "cronies" with Death Eaters and "Aquino" with Shacklebolt.

Let's begin.

--------------

1) Chasing after Marcos and his cronies' ill-gotten wealth

Martial law and failed promises

After declaring martial law in 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, who was first elected in 1965, ruled for another 13 years. But the promised changes did not happen. Instead, he created the following legacy:

(List of legacies abridged)

Centralized corruption, Crony capitalism, Unrestrained and wanton human rights violations,

Although the first 4 or 5 years brought about sustained economic growth, Marcos ruled without mandate, triggering widespread criticism in the domestic front and the international community. He was not popularly elected beyond 1973, but held several rigged referenda to reflect ostensibly the people's approval of his martial law regime.

Marcos, Imelda and their cronies, which constituted the martial law-sponsored new oligarchy, were behind what is plain and simple kleptocracy, or the use of power and state structures to plunder and accumulate wealth and enable them to live like kings and queens even for 20 lifetimes.

Former Senate President Jovito Salonga, the first PCGG chair, estimated their total loot at between $5 billion to $10 billion. After 30 years, the estimate stands. Even the international community accepts these figures.

1986: Game-changing revolution

The four-day EDSA People Power Revolution in 1986 was the game-changing political upheaval that led to the determination of the scope and extent of the illegal wealth the Marcoses and their cronies had acquired and stashed here and abroad.

Marcos left many documents in Malacañang and these documents revealed the paper trail of an intricate web of corruption that led to their accumulation of illicit wealth. The paper trail has led to the discovery and identification, although not all, of the illegally acquired wealth and the dynamics of corruption.

Hence, the first order of the day for the administration of President Corazon Aquino was the full documentation and recovery of the illegally acquired assets of the Marcoses and cronies, and the prevention of their dissipation and transfer to other parties.

With the national coffers emptied by the toppled dictator, Mrs. Aquino was then hoping that her government could recover a respectable portion of the illegal assets to provide social services for the Filipino people.

But this did not happen overnight...

Despite the marching orders, the PCGG was beset with controversies stemming from clashing views of its leaders on the implementation of the two presidential orders.

A faction believed to go all-out in the recovery efforts by sequestering those questionable assets and filing appropriate charges before the court. Constituting the hawks within the PCGG, they did not want to give any quarters to the dictator and his ilk.

But another faction felt it made better sense to negotiate with cronies for an out-of-court settlement. Court battles are messy; they take time before decisions are rendered. The prospect of out-of-court settlements, where Marcos cronies would return sizable amount of illegal assets in exchange for immunity from lawsuits, loomed as an option.

*** Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies

What the entire world knows after 30 years is a mere fraction, and not the entirety, of the Marcos loot.

It negotiated the first compromise deal with crony Jose Yao Campos, a Chinese Filipino entrepreneur who owned the controlling interest of United Laboratories Inc., a major drug firm, for the return of the Marcos assets listed under his name.

Campos, low key and unassuming, was probably the most cooperative among the known Marcos cronies. Unlike other cronies who chose to slug it out with the post-Marcos government, Campos cooperated fully in surrendering the Marcos assets under his name. Marcos used him mainly as caretaker of those illegal assets.

A friend of the dictator, Campos surrendered to the PCGG the 197 titles representing pieces of real estate property in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan and Baguio City, and P250 million ($5.3 million) in cash. The pieces of real estate property have a combined value of over P2.5 billion ($52.5 million).

In 1987, the PCGG recovered P375 million ($7.9 million) from the accounts of Campos and Rolando Gapud, reputedly the dictator's financial adviser, in Security Bank and Trust Company, a local commercial bank. Decades later, the Honolulu court decided to compensate the human rights victims of the Marcos regime and ruled the sale of two pieces of property in the US to pay them. They were listed under Campos' name.

**** TL;DR

The book presents two very black and white ethical sides those for Voldemort's ideology in a extreme way and those against. What might a middle position be?

"...another faction felt it made better sense to negotiate with cronies for an out-of-court settlement. Court battles are messy; they take time before decisions are rendered. The prospect of out-of-court settlements, where Marcos cronies would return sizable amount of illegal assets in exchange for immunity from lawsuits, loomed as an option..."

What might the politics look like of someone who was elitist/traditional, but not an outspoken supporter of Voldemort?

"...Campos, low key and unassuming, was probably the most cooperative among the known Marcos cronies. Unlike other cronies who chose to slug it out with the post-Marcos government, Campos cooperated fully in surrendering the Marcos assets under his name..."

Obviously Lucius Malfoy cannot hide from what he has done, but how likely is it that other wealthy people are just slipping back into "normal" lives again?"

Very likely
