  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

  Summer of 1993, Professor McGonagall visits a small American town hunting the one man who might be able to help capture the escaped convict Sirius Black, and more importantly fill in as the DADA professor. There she meets a boy that disappeared eight years ago sparking a massive if fruitless manhunt for the missing Boy-Who-Lived. Werewolf!Harry with DAD!Remus
