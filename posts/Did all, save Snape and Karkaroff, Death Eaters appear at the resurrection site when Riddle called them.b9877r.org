  The Death Eaters ... [formed] a silent circle, ... Yet they left gaps in the circle, as though waiting for more people. Voldemort, however, did not seem to expect more. ...

  Voldemort moved on, and stopped, staring at the space --- large enough for two people --- that separated Malfoy and the next man. ... "The Lestranges should stand here," said Voldemort quietly. "But they are entombed in Azkaban..." ...

  He had reached the largest gap of all, ... "And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service. One, too cowardly to return ... One, who I believe has left me forever ... and one, my most faithful servant, ..." (GoF, ch. 33)
#+end_quote

It's all very specific. I'd say they all returned that could or would, since Voldemort is specifically calling out exceptions.

EDIT: Voldemort names some of the DEs: Avery, Lucius, Macnair, Crabbe, Goyle, Nott. But some DEs I remember I don't see named here: the Carrows, etc. (but the scene is /long/ and I was just skimming).

*** Thank you.

My takeaway:

Coward=Karkaroff

Leaving forever=snape(or perhaps subterfuge if his belief is that snape is a longterm spy for him)

Barty=mosy faithful

Who are the three dead?

And why only two spaces for lestranges? The brothers and bella are three.

#+end_quote

IIRC, the three dead are Regulus, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. Regulus died in the cave where Slytherin's locket was kept, though its implied Voldemort never re-visited the cave until he knew Hufflepuff's Cup was stolen. He didn't know Regulus actually swapped the Locket with a fake. In fact, Voldemort's internal monologue after the Cup suggests he never checked up on any of his Horcruxes after making them. He just made them, dumped them in their canon locations, and then never checked them since he assumed nobody would ever find the Horcruxes. In the case of the Diary, he probably expected Lucius to give him the Diary shortly after his resurrection in the graveyard.

So either Voldemort asked Lucius for the Diary back and tortured him as punishment for losing the Diary (most likely)... or Wormtail blabbed to Voldemort about Harry destroying the Diary, since Wormtail might have overheard Ron talking to Harry/Hermione/Ginny about the Basilisk and Voldemort. In HBP, Dumbledore speculated that Voldemort punished Lucius for giving away the Diary and getting it destroyed. Though at that point, Voldemort had no logical reason to check the Horcuxes. After all, the Diary was only destroyed because of Lucius giving it away. The rest were hidden in isolated locations whereby they couldn't just be given away carelessly.

Evan Rosier was the one who cursed a chunk of Moody's face off, and Moody's account basically confirmed that Rosier died dueling against Moody. In hindsight, this might make Rosier at least the third most talented duelist among Voldemort's Death Eaters (after Snape and Bellatrix), and depending on how skilled Moody was in his prime, it might even have made Rosier the most skilled duelist of the Death Eaters (obviously not counting Voldemort).

Wilkes also died fighting against Aurors, but he is seemingly very insignificant of a Death Eater. He didn't die putting up an impressive fight against Moody, nor did he contribute to any of the Death Eaters' major attacks on the good guys (e.g. severely damaging Moody, killing Molly's two brothers, torturing the Longbottoms, etc). The fact that Wilkes is never mentioned outside of Karkaroff's trial also suggests he wasn't a notable threat to the Order or the Ministry (unlike someone like Bellatrix or Dolohov). Even within the fandom, Wilkes is probably one of the most forgotten Death Eaters. IIRC, he might have been in the same year as Snape and the Marauders, or perhaps 1-2 years older or younger either way. I think the tiny impression we are given of Wilkes is that he died young (as did Rosier and Regulus).

Perhaps Voldemort (and by extension, Rowling herself) subconsciously was thinking of Bellatrix as a Black rather than a Lestrange at that moment. So the two spaces were in reference to the brothers. Alternatively, and much more likely IMO, perhaps the two spaces were for Bellatrix and her husband, and that Voldemort simply just didn't care about the other brother. Even if it was a mistake, it would still be in-character for Voldemort to just overlook the existence of individuals who are less important to him.

Though a more reasonable answer would be that Rowling just made a tiny mistake, whereby she either forgot about Rabastan Lestrange (since the two spaces are clearly meant to be Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus). It would be an understandable mistake, given how both Rodolphus and Rabastan don't really do much in the series. I always found it odd how unimportant they were in the timespan of the books, given that both brothers took part in the torturing of the Longbottoms and that Rodolphus was married to Bellatrix, who was consistently portrayed as a major character. Though the Lestrange brothers are an entirely other topic given what happens in DH (why not just make them the DADA and Muggle Studies professors instead of the Carrows? It would give Neville even more motivation to fight against them).

*TL;DR: Three dead Death Eaters were Regulus, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. Two spaces for the Lestranges would likely be a slight mistake on Rowling's part, whereby "the Lestranges" would be Bellatrix and Rodolphus whereby Rabastan is forgotten. Rowling really should have used the Lestrange brothers as the DADA and Muggle Studies Professors in DH instead of the Carrows. It would motivated Neville even more, and the Lestrange duo are certainly important/loyal enough for Voldemort to give them those responsibilities.*

Were they interested? Were they mentally stable enough (I mean, Sirius was not totally here at the end of Year 5, 2 years after he escaped, and they have been in Azkaban longer than him, without being animagi, and have only been freed a year and a half prior) to be in a school?\\
Wouldn't Neville try to kill them any possible way? I mean, if his grandmother let him go (or didn't know they would be here), they tortured his parents into insanity. No way Year 7 Neville would have stood em even for a day.

***** From what I understand the reason Rosier lost to Moody was becuase Moody was only using stunning/knockback/otherwise non life threatening spells, but due to Rosiers prowess and level of violence Moody resorted to the Killing Curse, which instatntly took Rosier out of the fight since it is unblockable and he wouldnt be expecting an order member to use it.

**** I assume that Bella was Bella Black when she joined and would most likely not change her... Position .. in the gathering. From the looks of it each one has a specific spot in the formation so Voldemort can easily spot whose there and whose missing
