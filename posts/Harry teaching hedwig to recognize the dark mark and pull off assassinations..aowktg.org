Alright. So. I am reading “With a forked tongue I lie in wait” and in chapter 13 Harry gets his owl from Hagrid as a late birthday present and try's to send him a thank you note, however, Hedwig is named “Crochety Anne” by Harry and isn't happy with the name and refuses to send the note so Harry says “ Fine, I'll just use a school owl”, hedwig knocks him down, harry gets laughed at by a few Hufflepuffs and Harry says “You laugh now, but in two months time I'll have an attack owl that will be able to pull of assasinations.”

So now that that's out of the way, I thought I should make this post to get some more attention to this lovely idea for some talented authors to work with.

I think that assassin hedwig has quite a bit of potential for a few amusing one-shots or could be incorporated into a longer crack-type fic.

Have fun with this! ~Nephthys

  (Continuation of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) It's easy to make big plans and ask big questions, but harder to follow them through. Find out what happens to Harry Potter-Evans-Verres, Hermione, Draco, and everyone else once they grow into their roles as leaders, leave the shelter of Hogwarts, and venture out into a wider world.

  She's a suave, flying personification of unstoppable demonic fury. But you can call her Mother Owl.
