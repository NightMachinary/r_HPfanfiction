As title says, I'm looking for a fanfiction I read before that has this scene where Tonks is at her flat with Remus, and he confesses to betraying Harry or doing something for Dumbledore that he knew would hurt Harry. Tonk's reaction is to throw Remus out and they do not get back together in the story.

Later on there is small scene of Remus standing outside in the rain watching Tonk's flat and he's confront by a couple of police officers and told to move along.

I not 100% sure but I don't believe it was a Tonks/Harry pairing but they were close friends at least in the story, I could be wrong through :)

*Spoiler Alert*: Pretty sure it's a betrayal story but I cant remember much other then near the end Tonks is still an Auror and she reads a report about werewolf that died and she releases it's Remus and she's a bit upset but has moved on as it's years later.

Any help is appreciated.


** I am definetely annoyed with myself because I know for a fact that I have read this fanfiction recently and I cant remember what it is called.

*** I also remember reading that but can't remember where. And I've checked and ruled out the one fic I'd thought it might be.

*** Ah. I'd only ever read the re-write, which has the even less memorable title of "The Marriage Contracts Redux"

**** I didn't know there was a re-write! Is it a lot different than the original? The story is pretty cliche but it was fun when I read it.

Okayyy so essentially in this story Remus knew that Peter was a spy for Voldemort, he told Dumbledore but Dumbledore convinced him not to tell everyone. This led to James and Lily's deaths. After their deaths, Remus did not speak up for Sirus's innocence despite knowing Peter's betrayal because Dumbledore convinced him not to. This obviously led to Sirius's imprisonment in Azkaban which could have been avoided if Remus spoke up. So essentially Remus's betrayal is being Dumbledore's lackey at the expense of all his friendships and other relationships which led to all the tragedy in Harry's life that could have been all avoided if Remus wasn't Dumbledore's bitch.

That's pretty much it lmao

** Hi All,

Thank you all for the help to identify the story. Really appreciate everyone taking the time to check and reply.

It was indeed the Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts - though not sure if I read the redux version or the original but I guess I try both..

I did enjoy the amusing sub-plot where Harry and Neville have an on-going bet and keep feeding bullshit stories to Dumbledore on how they defeated Voldemort, and if Dumbledore will believe the made-up stories each time :)
