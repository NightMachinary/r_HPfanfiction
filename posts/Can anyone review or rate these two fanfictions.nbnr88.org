Soul Scars by Rtnwriter

Personally, I really like Harem fanfictions with Harry as the main protagonist so I Tried to find some on that topic. After reading a lot, I came across these two which aren't really well known (I think) so I would like someone's opinion on them. It would be very much appreciated. Thanks. (BTW if u have some more suggestions for Harem fanfics please recommend me some)


** Four Founders is the most awesomest story in the history of awesome. Trust me, I'm not biased at all.

More critically, FF started as an exercise in writing lemons when the author foolishly considered trying his hand professionally at romance novels, but then it turned into a real story that then exploded Into a whole series. And you can see it with some hard, sharp tonality turns.

Just remember it was written over a decade ago. I would not write a fic like that today.

*** You must be looking at A03. I only post on FFN. My AO3 fics are those with a few more lemons than FFN allows, but I'm not really interested in writing lemons any more. I have over 23 finished, novel length stories in HP, SW, and more recently Worm. Four founders alone has three sequels. Nowadays I'm just interested in writing as good a story as I can, and sharing it with anyone who might want to read along with me.

  That changed when the hands started working on his belt. “Mum?” he said, confused.

  He felt his little wizard stiffen immediately.

This is genuinely hilarious and I'm not even one whole chapter in yet ahaha

What kind of fic would you write today? I noticed you hadn't written any fanfics past 2015.

** I enjoyed them and thought they were a decent read. Lots of similarities with the Heir of Magic by Gryffindor but since the author (Darth Marrs) says he was inspired by that story that should be expected.

For other Harem stories try those by RotaryFile (Selector) - Witches Secret Trilogy, Our Lady o'the Bless'd Do Over, Harem of Honeys, etc Plus most stories by Red Jacobson are Harem oriented.

For a fun little crack harem story try Hermione the Harem Girl by Rorschach's Blot

You can also try Harem of the Ancient House of Potter by SSJ04MEWTWO (found at adult fanfiction org)

And of course the classic Radaslab's Harem War. You should also look at his story Life Sucks Then you Die.

Harry Potter: Neko's Mate by FurySerenity (Vance McGill ) inspired/based on Gandalfs_Beard's Hermione's Furry Little Problem. AndcVance has his own version of Harem War.

No links as a couple of the suggested stories will probably run afoul of Rule 8

** I don't remember Four Founders all that well--so it's probably not terrible.

As for Soul Scars, I remember it a bit better, but only really because I was irritated at how passive Harry was in his relationship when I stopped reading.

I wouldn't say either are bad, so give them a try.

** I tried reading Soul Scars once. As I recall, I dropped it because I got tired of reading chapter after chapter of nothing but angsting over Harry's abuse. I know some people like that sort of thing, but it was not for me.
