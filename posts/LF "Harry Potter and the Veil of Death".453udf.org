** How about linkffn(4536005)?

I think I liked it when I read it, but I read so many redo stories that they tend to blur a bit. :-)

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkffn(6755363)

This is /not/ a recommendation as I'm not a big fan of Weasley/Dumbledore bashing outside of crack-fics.

  Remus was so shocked at seeing Sirius fall through the veil that Harry had raced past him before the boy's intentions even registered with the werewolf. Screaming "Sirius!" Harry followed his godfather into the veil before anyone could stop him. H/Hr

** This is one of the most common time travel/dimension travel mechanics. That being said, ABC is probably the most well known, but there is Harry Potter and the World that Waits. linkffn(4388682)

  A shell shocked but triumphant Harry Potter decides to leave his world behind for another. Someone should have told him that AUs can be really, really different. HP/ X-Men crossover.
