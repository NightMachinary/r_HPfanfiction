** I agree to some extent, yes. But the thing is, you'll probably get more leeway from the fandom when making Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, or perhaps Nicolas Flamel be the top dogs around than, say, random OC number 1558483893 or something.

Depending on how it's done, it can be very easy to end up turning whoever this OC is into an annoying Mary Sue. And when using non-British OCs for this role, it's also easy to slip into the cocktail of clichés surrounding 'magical Britain bashing', including things like:

- Insulting Hogwarts (i.e., calling it 'Hogwash') and making the foreign schools so amazingly perfect (and yet Fleur, the Beauxbatons' champion, went down to a bunch of Grindylows in canon).

- Calling magical Britain backwards, while making the rest of the magical world be so perfect and tolerant of everything (and yet Durmstrang outright rejects Muggle-borns, and Madame Maxime preferred to hide her giant heritage wherever she went).

- Bashing the usage of wands, and saying that these silly Europeans are so ridiculous for not going wandless.

- Foreign-magic wank, similar to what fanon often does with goblins and house-elves.

Etc.

I know it's fanfiction and all, but there are some things which are more likely to deter readers than others. Inserting some random super-powerful OC tends to be one of them.

Basically, my view is that when it comes to pushing a different character/OC into surpassing or equalling Dumbledore/Voldemort level, then you'd better keep the writing tight and avoid the super-easy temptation of bringing along the usual bashing that accompanies it.

It's a different case when the character is balanced out by the fic, though. If Amazing OC or whichever canon character is given Dumbledore levels of power are placed in a decent plot, then it's more likely to be believable, and tolerated by readers. It's just too bad that I've seen more than a few fics where the author tries so hard to 'one up' canon with their Dumbledore/Voldemort 2.0, as if almost saying, "Oooh, look at my super-amazing hero/villain who's soooo much cleverer than batshit insane Voldy or the stupid old goat!!!!!"). No. That comes off as being pretentious at times.

I've seen quite a few readers avoid powerful-OC fics for exactly the same reasons that I do, and not just in terms of the OC fulfilling the role of Harry. Heck, it's sometimes worse when everything's the same up until that point in the plot, and then Amazing OC shows up and saves the day just like that.

It's not impossible to give the power to some other character besides the big ones from canon, but it can break the suspension of disbelief when this person is just so absolutely wonderful and used as a self insert. Then there's the odd chance that the author might use Amazing OC as a mouthpiece to rant against their (the author's) frustrations in canon as well (it tends to show up as little quips or jokes about canon events, e.g., someone saying, "As if I'd be stupid enough to send seven Potters out in the sky.").

I'll say it again, people can write about their amazing non-Dumbledore or non-Voldemort characters being at the top, yes, but do try to adjust the story accordingly. It's highly likely to turn into the same power-wank-fest that the typical Independent!Harry story suffers from, if left unchecked.

*** I don't know much about the impact on the plot that such a powerful OCC could cause because I don't really write anything, I just read it, so I'm going to accept your opinion on that. About the "attack on Magical Britain", I don't care too much, as long as it's reasonable and rational. Yes, it is possible that there are countries that are more tolerant of magical creatures and blood status than Britain, but it is also possible that there are countries that are much more rigid about this.

Describing Beauxbattons - where most students are described as futile and snobbish, their champion scored the lowest in the Triwizard Tournament and their headmistress hides her own heritage out of shame - as the apotheosis of tranquility and freedom is ridiculous. The same goes for Durmstrung, who is canonically discriminatory and has a special emphasis on the Dark Arts - let's not forget that they let a Death Eater become headmaster and that it was Grindelwald's school, after all, before he was expelled.

I'm kind of tolerant of OC's as long as they're well constructed and organically included in the story. White Squirrel's "Accidental Animagus" series is particularly good at this point, inserting an alliance between Voldemort and some foreign Dark Lords/Ladys, with Harry and Dumbledore having the help of Great Sorcerers from other countries, making them Lords/ Ladys of Light in some ways.

I don't like Mary's Sue's either, though. I find it frankly unrealistic and quite illogical when someone appears and magically solves all the problems in the world, finding the cure for lycanthropy, destroying the Dementors, killing all the Death Eaters, making Voldemort a brainless idiot and Dumbledore a worthless old man who does nothing but give second chances and cast Stuners - and we won't even get into the topic of "Harry randomly becoming a super-wizard-god-of-magic-lord-of-all-legendary-families" in two weeks, with the right to a shopping trip to Diagon Alley, Lily secretly being a thoroughbred, helpful goblins and a new magic chest with a mansion inside.

However, what annoys me is not necessarily that Dumbledore and Voldemort are powerful, because they are, it's just that it's unrealistic to say they're the "best, biggest, smartest, most powerful, meanest/kindest" that exist or ever have. You don't need an OC's directly present in the story, however. You can just name some random country under the command of a horrible Dark Lord/Lady that will never have any relevance to the plot, except to show that they are not gods. You can point to some super healer, duelist and sorcerer who lived two hundred years ago and battled "the Darkness", too.

Everyone has their opinion, obviously. It's just the accumulating clichés that continually test my patience.

**** Yeah, I get all that. But what I meant is that people tend to give more leeway when the 'known big three' are overpowered in fanon, rather than having some random person show up or be mentioned.

I guess I forgot to say that some readers like operating within the confines of canon to some extent. Just as some people might like seeing a refreshing new face being mentioned, so do others like seeing Dumbledore and Voldemort be on top time and again.

Different strokes for different folks, I guess, but the clichés do seem to be more prevalent in fics which try to 'outdo' Dumbledore and Voldemort with someone else.

Good writing will, as you've said, have the other OP characters be accommodated by the plot in some way, though it's more likely that the average fic will fall back onto clichés in order to 'justify' the inclusion of Amazing OC.

Even when using canon characters, it's easy to slip into bad-writing mode. For example, making McGonagall be super-powerful, putting stupid Dumbles in his place, and fixing the whole of Hogwarts alongside awesome, OP Snape et al.

It's tough to get it just right when bringing in more powerful characters.

** I mean, in-world, it makes sense. It's a pretty common thing for people to do. We exaggerate the things that affect us and ignore or minimise those that don't. We do the same with pretty much everything - sports teams, musicians, wars, heroes and villains, etc.

It'd be quite bizarre for someone in Magical Tibet to say Voldemort is the GDWOAT (greatest dark wizard of all time :D), but a British person would absolutely say that about him because they've probably been terrorised by him. Similarly. the Tibetan Magical would say that a Dark Wizard that's affected their neck of the woods is worst. As a real world example - for someone who lived through World War 2, it might be the worst thing they've ever experienced and they'd title it as such. But WW2 would be a distant thing happening in a far off place to someone in rural Indonesia. It's all relative and personal.

Also, describing people with titles like that is less a statistical or descriptive thing and more a cultural and emotional one. They're titles that reflect how people feel about them, rather than any quantifiable measurement of scale. To British People, Dumbledore is the greatest wizard in the world because he's affected their lives directly and they've been raised in a way that frames him as such. They won't care if Bob Marcowiecz from Russia has more quantifiable magical power than him, because he's someone else's wizard that they'll never encounter.

It's basically like a verbal version of those "World's Best Parent" mugs. There was no competition defining the 'best parent', but people still feel those kinds of things because of their emotions regarding their parents. Meeting someone else who's 'quantifiably a better parent' won't make you feel any less positively about your own parent.

When writers do it... /shrugs/. The fandom is weird.

** I actually don't mind it personally.

Too many characters makes for a poor story and having characters more skilled/powerful than Dumbledore or Voldemort tends to just turn into a bash magical Britain story.

That's not to say that there shouldn't be more skilled adults, but having more than a handful of people able to even hold off Voldemort takes away from his threat.

Voldemort was known as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named out of the country too, and despite his setbacks in canon, was probably only matched by Dumbledore with a mythical wand, 5 decades more experience, and a phoenix.

That being said, I do find the lack of truly skilled lieutenants in canon lacking.

It's a bit boring, isn't it? You hear horror stories from the Death Eaters, how they terrified people, how they were deadly and cruel, but most of them seem to only have Unforgivables in their arsenal and nothing else. Snape, Bellatrix and Dolohov seem to be the most dangerous diners, but Snape wasn't even on Voldemort's side, Bellatrix was killed by an overweight housewife and Dolohov only appears once or twice, with his only memorable feat being almost killing Hermione in the Department of Mysteries. I'm not even going to talk about Lucius or Rookwood, who got beaten up by a bunch of semi-trained kids.

On the "light side", you have McGonagall, who looks reasonably stronger than most wizards on Canon, but as I recall only fought during the Battle of Hogwarts; Kingsley, who helped to contain Voldemort for a time with the help of Slughorn and Minerva; Sirius, who died because he chose to play and laugh over taking his psychotic cousin seriously (I still cry and feel like strangling him whenever I remember) and the rest of the Order, who were said to contain skilled members, but I've never seen anything big.

I always felt a little disheartened by the lack of lieutenants to fight on both sides, instead of kissing Voldemort's robes and looking at Dumbledore with stars in his eyes.

** I relate everything I read to a teenagers point of view which is how we are viewing the world of canon. Harry was a kid the whole time in canon and not even particularly curious about larger world. He asked "There are other schools of magic." In 4th book and wasn't even aware of his own paternity, as he didn't even tried to look too hard. So maybe the world is larger, Maybe the world is richer in culture and history than what harry knows. We don't know anything except what JK tells us, we can create on own, speculate and discuss.

** Well, Dumbledore was canonically the one who defeated Grindelwald, who, as you said, helped start a World War. If there were people more powerful than him, then it probably stands to reason they would have taken care of Grindelwald first. So, yes, he is almost certainly the most powerful wizard of his age unless you want to invent some reason why either someone more powerful than him didn't take care of Grindelwald first or didn't do anything worth mentioning. We also have no idea how powerful the Founders really were, all we know is that they helped start a school and were excellent wizards for their time. I really don't see how it is going against canon to make Dumbledore more powerful than the founders when we have no idea how capable they would be present day. Voldemort had Dementors working for him too, so I don't see how that makes Erkizdis more powerful than him. Voldemort almost certainly would have managed to create a conflict as large as Grindelwald did if he hadn't had chosen to try to take Britain where Dumbledore lived as opposed to Grindelwald who avoided Dumbledore as much as he could. Don't forget Dumbledore also states he avoided Grindelwald until he felt he couldn't anymore. Grindelwald performed better because of his past history with Dumbledore and his better tactics, not because he was more powerful than him.
