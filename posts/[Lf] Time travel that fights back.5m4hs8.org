** 9001% unfinished. But explores the concept in detail, and an easy read to boot. linkffn(Balancing Destinies by DobbyElfLord) but for context you'll want to read its prequel linkffn(Altered Destenies by DobbyElfLord)

** This is kinda (if you squint) like the time travel in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died A Lot]] . It's a Final Destination type plot where "Death" or "Fate" keeps trying to kill Harry.

This fic is really really creative and a great read! If you're not a Snarry fan (as I'm not really) then just skip the coda which is the only part with any graphic Snarry. The rest is a really cool fic that takes Snape saving Harry all the time to the next level.

The basic premise is that during Harry's first year, he dies during the detention in the forbidden forest with Draco. Because dumbledore knows the prophecy, and knows Harry can't die (yet...) he gives Snape a time turner and puts him in charge of saving Harry. The Final Destination part is that fate keeps trying to kill Harry (I think he dies 20 times from Rons broken wand in second year for example) and Snape just keeps saving him. It has cool time travel and interesting time loop things with multiple snapes. It's also canon-compliant (EWE) which is rare for most hogwarts era slash - especially Snarry.

** linkao3(The boy who died a lot) I'm not entirely sure if it fulfills your criteria, but it is a good example of time travel trying to fight back. Harry dies in the first year and Dumbledore gives Snape a time turner to save him. Fate keeps killing Harry in very ridiculous and not so ridiculous ways and Snape has to keep using the time turner to keep him alive. The fic has some (in my opinion out of place and out of character) slash towards the end of the fic, but it is mostly skippable. The strange thing about this fic is it manages to stay almost completely within canon while being very original.

  ‚ÄòAll attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries shortly after we managed to retrieve her. What is more, her five days in the distant past caused great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the course of their lives so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been ‚Äúun-born‚Äù.
