Hey all in a nostalgic mood for the old days of the fandom when whatever we made up about the Marauders could have been cannon. Remember the time before we knew Lily's last name? (Am I dating myself? Probably.).

Anyway, I am looking for well written, complete fics. I know they might be full of tropes and I am okay with that. I prefer Het and no smut. Other than that I am pretty open as long as it is older maybe say Pre OOTP and Snape's Worst Memory. You all are great with recs so I am looking forward to your ideas.

I'd have to say: Yes.
