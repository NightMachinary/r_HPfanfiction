Umbridge isn't too bad in this one, although that's mainly because of Harry. But she didn't grate on me too much, so...

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** Her character may make it into Darkness!Harry as an outwardly beautiful woman who's fucked, murdered, bribed, blackmailed, and poisoned her way to the top but seems like an incredibly sweet woman who tries to seduce Harry to get his support---as a fifteen year old---as she tries to secure her next step in the Ministry, supplanting the Minister.

I've only read one fic where she's not evil and it was this terrible hufflepuff!power story where she's really there to see if dumbledore has fucked up with harry and has all the hufflepuffs helping her.

*** I followed the second paragraph, but I'm fairly certain the first part was a different language. Is that the plot of some fic?

** In my story "Patron", she's not quite evil incarnate. Still evil though, but not a gleeful sadist. She's also a very attractive witch.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
