** linkffn(2594688). I feel bad suggesting this because I hated the writing so much that I dropped it a couple chapters in, but it was recommended to me because I wanted something similar, and it sounded like there were slim pickings in this genre.

The main thing is, in 6^{th} or 7^{th} year, Harry, Ron, and Hermione lose their memories somehow and get lost. Everyone is scrambling trying to find them or something and they're just wandering around muggle London for a while. Don't remember much after that, but the writing was cringe worthy at times.

** I just recently read linkffn(the power of pain by vampirulover) and enjoyed it. It's problematic in some aspects but it has some fascinating pieces of magic used.

  Five years, it had been five years since the battle for Hogwarts. Five years for the students who suffered that day to move on with their lives. To love, to laugh, to marry. Five years since that fateful day that left the brightest witch of their age confined to a bed at St. Mungo's spell damage ward.
