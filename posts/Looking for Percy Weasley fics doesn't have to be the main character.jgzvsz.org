Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be old or new, would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Just want Percy to be used more in the story, in general.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

Am fine with male pregnancy, but don't want it detailed.

No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune.


** I have a ton. I will try to link them here. Some are shorter and some are very long.

These are three of my favorites. All of them are longer and Percy is the main character.

** Heh, can I self promote here? I have one I'm working on and it's Percy centric. AU. Takes place in the summer before HBP. Previous events occurred except that Percy hasn't abandoned the family (yet) and those at the ministry still haven't seen Voldemort so as of right now during the fic, they still think Harry is a liar

  Harry had never really properly planned anything before. The fact that his first ever plan was risky and filled with assorted dangers was not actually deterring him as much as it should.In other words, this story explores how Harry's third year at Hogwarts might have played out differently if a little project management and an ambitious plan had been thrown into the mix.
