There are so many cool prompts here, but it feels like the only stories about prompts are the short stories in the comments. Don't get me wrong, I love those comments, but they're too short. I'd love to read actual full stories based on prompts


** Remember that shipping wars prompt where Dumbledore supported Harmony and Voldemort Drarry that came a week or so ago? I have 2 chaps already.

**** The thing is that adapting from prompts is not usually your main fic. IN my case I'm doing it just for fun. So, I don't put as much time on it.

Currently, I have those 2 chaps (2k words each)... I am looking around for a beta to go over grammar and stuff as English is not my main language... then I'll publish.

I have half an outline as well... but I think that since this is for fun, I'll just go for it and publish and improvise after the middle point.

** There was a prompt where Lavender's name gets pulled from the GoF instead of Harry's and I'm making a Harry/Lavender fic out of it. Only 5 chapters so far and I haven't updated it since March but it is outlined. It's just that my other fics are distracting me, so üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

** A good portion of prompts are like muses or plot bunnies. They're fun to think about, and a blast to write 'hot off the press' for a chapter or two, but once the novelty wears off, things fall flat.

** linkffn(13015659; 13398288)

The first was a response to a prompt here (Sirius with a different animagus form), the second is me mocking a rather stupid one (Hermione is pregnant but there are multiple possible fathers; OP suggested Snape and Malfoy).

  Instead of a grim, Sirius Black had a different Animagus form, one that Harry adopted as his new pet. The result of a Reddit prompt.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger is pregnant. Trouble is, she has not slept with a man during the past decade. Which is why the whole pregnancy business is rather unexpected, and the reason she sought out Harry and Ginny for advice. Postwar, EWE? Cracky.

** I wish there were more places to put my prompts. I've come to realize I'm more of a muse than a writer. Can't get the ideas out on paper unless I immediately write it all down. And ever if I do, it's more of a one-shot than a whole multi chap fic and that's depressing

*** I'm much the same, I have a lot of really interesting ideas and I know all the important elements of writing a good story. But I frankly refuse to contribute to the endless pile of unfinished work on fanfic sites. Because I know myself, any story i start has a 99% chance of never being finished and as an individual who gets so extremely frustrated every time i find an truly excellent story that has been abandoned, I'd rather not be hypocritical

** I know I've seen a few people take them up into actual fics - I've even pulled a few together into ideas to add to my list to write when I actually find the time. :)

I don't sort prompt-fills separately in my bookmarks, but if I can find some in my other folders, I'll post them here.
