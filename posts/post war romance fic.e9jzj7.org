No hinny or Harmony and no bashing and no slash

Are there any fics where molly and arthur see that harry is not happy with ginny and encourage him to break it off? without ruining the whole relationship with the weaslys


** Personally I mostly read slash but maybe you'll find something if you look into Haphne or smthing. It seems to be a pretty big ship so I guess there are some fics around
