For me, it's either by force(rape stands and manual stimulation as in actual animal husbandry today) or he's s fucking master in sympathetic magic(voodoo and making creatures do what he wands using a piece of the whole to affect the whole) or both depending on the story.

Edit: in one of my stories(hiatus), hagrid has a job at a crossbreeding facility where one of the current crossbred jobs is a dragon's egg being incubated like a basilisk is though instead of a chicken, fawkes is incubating the egg. The creature born would have been a faerie dragon like creature with butterflyesque wings, a phoenix sized dragon body, and a bond to the first person it sees upon hatching. It Would also have the phoenix song but its blood would be healing instead of tears and its saliva would be a highly toxic one.

I miss this idea but i have no other story that would require this plot

** This is quite literally the first time I have ever considered that. I suppose it depends on whether he is allowed to be doing it or not. Noone says anything about the blast-ended screwts, other than "oh good god, what on earth is that??", so I am assuming that he is permitted to make horrifying crimes against nature all he pleases. This implies he must do it the, ahem, manual way. After all, if magic was needed then everyone would know he was using magic when he wasn't supposed to and he'd have his umbrella snapped. This does imply that at least the mother of any crossbreeds must be a magical species of course, otherwise the manual method wouldn't work.

This does raise questions of whether a centaur was originally a crossbreed. If so, then either the mother was a witch, which means there's a possibility that the father was a non-magical horse, in which case Ew and also Ick, also this implies a whole bunch of charms to make that possible. Or the father was a human, and there is some sort of magical horse out there, so centaurs are actually half unicorn/Pegasus/Kelpie. As the centaur herd is in Scotland, and kelpies are from Scottish mythology and said to be able to take human form, I rather prefer that idea. Either that or we now know the answer to the question of "if an animagus gets pregnant or impregnates something while in animal form, what species will the babies be?"

*** There's canonical mention of a werewolf being bred while in her were form and having pups, I believe, which leads me to think an animagus could probably also get impregnated or sire on an actual animal. There could've been a very horny animagus that turned into a horse and just traveled the world sampling mares.... BRB need brain bleach.

** Given that the Ban on Experimental Breeding was instituted as recently as 1965, I'd guess that the process is fairly simple. In the case of the Skrewts it involved a firecrab egg, some Manticore sperm, a cauldron and the waving of a pink umbrella at various junctures, following a recipe book kept in the Restricted Section of Hogwarts' library. At least Hagrid waited until his name was cleared before he started making them.

Does anyone recall whether they were around for the Battle of Hogwarts?

**** You're assuming he stuck the egg back into the firecrab. I think he brewed the concoction in the cauldron until it turned into a bunch of baby skrewts.

Definition of magic: the rules of physics, chemistry and biology change because we figured out how to ask the right way. I'm more concerned about the replies that suggest a Manticore (fundamentally a mammal) could cross-breed with a Firecrab (amphibian- it's actually a kind of turtle) and come up with any sort of spawn using nothing more than a double-dose of Amortentia for Pets (tm).

***** See, it's turtle-/like/, but it's very clearly a crab (not an amphibian, by the way, an arthropod) - in other words, it lays /eggs/. Many, many, many microscopic eggs. Think fish roe, not bird's egg.

Also /in vitro/ refers to the fertilizing in a glass test tube bit. Obviously for humans you then need to put it in a womb, but it's not an inherent part of the process.

****** Well smack my mouth and call me Nancy- the assumption and presumption were mine. In vitro literally means 'in glass'- I was thinking it was in fluid.

In any case I don't see a manticore making any sort of babies by rutting over caviar or turtle eggs without thaumaturgic interference, so the point stands.

****** Magical creatures, my dear. It is not a guarantee but if someone were to write it that way and handwave the obvious need for high-tech stuff with “well, magical creatures, and magic is weird” then most people would just shrug and continue reading.

So really, I think “in lebes” seems a possible enough method for Hagrid.

And how does that relate to the knowledge of sperm and (microscopic) egg, isolating them and inducing fertilization outside of a living organism? Or rather, since you don't seem to get it, do they /know/ what spermatozoa and ova are?

Lmao did you read anything I wrote? I called it /in vitro/ because /in vitro/ is what it is, albeit in a metal and rather large test tube. It's /in vitro/ as opposed to /in vivo/ fertilization. But feel free to point out where I mentioned tech.

** What if he's like Dr. Frankenstein and literally attaches pieces together?

In canon, though, I think that Hagrid probably used the Pokemon Center method, by which I mean that he throws all the animals in one pen because he thinks they can just magically get along (lol) and then leaves them to it.

He's probably like "and then I found this egg!" All happy like in the Great Hall while Minerva looks at him with a bulging forehead vein and says "remind me to Scourgify my brain."

Creating new cross-species is likely a well documented practice in the wizarding world utilizing both standard practices used by muggles for animal breeding and some magic to help the process along.
