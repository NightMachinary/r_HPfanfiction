I mean, he'd never even seen a game. He didn't know the rules. He had zero attacment to the idea of quidditch at that point. And everyone just assumes, "Of /course/ you'd want to be Gryffindor's seeker, why wouldn't you?" And he's on the team, without even hearing, "Harry, would you like to do this?"

I'd be really resentful, personally, and refuse the "honor" the first time I was able to get a word in edgewise. Or maybe the first time practice conflicted with something else or was in the rain. Then again, I'm female and have no interest in either playing or watching sports.


** I can just imagine at the end of first year Harry looks at McGonagall and saying can I stop now. McGonagall gets flustered and confused. Harry elaborates by asking if his punishment is over.

** In the perfectly normal series Harry really sees being put on the quidditch team as a punishment and is annoyed at how much time he has to spend on it(he would much rather spend time with his friends or studying). He also quits the team later after almost falling of his broom [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]

In canon it was also a punishment. They were told that anyone messing around on the brooms would be expelled. He was caught doing so and put on the Quidditch team in lieu of expulsion.

**** It wasn't intended as a punishment, Mcgonagall smiled at him and told him, that his father would be proud and that she may consider punishing him if he doesn't train hard. Harry also doesn't consider it to be a punishment.

** In cannon I think he's just releived that he's not being expelled , which is what madam hooch said would happen if anyone tried flying while she was away. Then later he found he actually enjoyed the sport. Or if thats not how it actually goes in cannon, at least it makes sense and explains why he wouldnt be put out about being given no choice in the matter.
