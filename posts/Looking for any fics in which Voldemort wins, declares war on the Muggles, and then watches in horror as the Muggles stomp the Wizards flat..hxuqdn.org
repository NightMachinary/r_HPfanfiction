** I generally dont want to say this, voldemort is smart enough to realise that sending magicals after muggles is dumb, would be hillsriois if he started ww3 and had all world leaders under imperio, kinda like Palpatine in star wars.

Then have them kill each other only to have wizards sieze power right after the war

*** I don't know, he hasn't been in the muggle world since he was a kid, and had to live through the London Bombings of WW2, but if you tell a lie long enough then you start to believe it. So, maybe towards the end he ‘did' believe that 1 to 50,000 sounded like okay odds, and that wizards really ‘could' subjugate muggles.

Sure, they could take over with a few well placed Imperio's, and then he tried it, and found out that, no, actually; all the muggleborns that have been being driven away due to hate from the purebloods had joined the army...

And the muggle world had protections against all of that...

And suddenly the houses of his followers were being bombed, and Tom was reminded of the bombing of his youth and, as news reports came up around the world, and the obliviators failed to wipe the minds of Billions, Tom realized that he had made a terrible mistake.

He had always thought the wizards stupid, bickering in their little world while millions were killed in fields across Europe; but at some point he'd gotten caught up in that feeling of power, and lost himself to that same stupidity.

There are Seven Billion Muggles on earth, how many Magicals are there? Sure, not all muggles can fight a magical, but not all magicals would fight either. Just look at Tom's easy takeover for proof enough of that.

And even for the ones that would fight.. How many would kill thousands? Because 1 to 50,000 is a Big gap to cover, and at some point you'd see cities lost to nuclear fire. An H-Bomb on London would wipe out the entire British Magical Government, the only bank, and who knows how many magicals, after all. The muggles have a contingency plan for that.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): UK military and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio helped out with Horcruxes.

--------------

[[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] had something [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/cfsvss/eu_vodemort_and_the_death_eaters_have_conquered/][like that]] from time to time, and [[/u/Xavier_Elrose][u/Xavier_Elrose]] wrote a quite nice scene:

#+begin_quote
  "Wave is off, telemetry looks good across the board."

  Magic, it seemed, could cause technology to fail. Certain 'clever' wizards from a particularly nasty faction bent on destroying nonmagical humans- "Moogles", apparently, though I could not have guessed where they got that name from- had though that if they disabled technology, us "moogles" wouldn't be able to fight back.

  "Got a blip in the wave, passing on the coordinates to targeting."

  Wizards, it seemed, could be really stupid.

  "Satellite 37-61 will be in position in three minutes. Impact in six."

  Wizards, apparently, had been more or less stuck about four or five hundred years in the past since...well, since.

  "Rods away. Impact in three."

  It did not exactly make for a balanced war, if one side had magic, and the other had to rely on fallible technology. No, it wasn't fair in the least.

  "Impact in 30 seconds, found another blip. Forwarding coordinates to targeting."

  Because relying on magic apparently meant never learning to think. It wasn't much harder to track technology failing than it was to track it succeeding, which meant these 'clever' wizards had very helpfully painted giant targets on anything and everything they considered important enough to protect. And while shutting off technology did limit our potential strike options...

  It wasn't as though we suffered from any lack of solutions.

  I watched as the screen showed a satellite view of a secluded moor turning into a violent hellscape in an instant, as titanium rods dropped from space annihilated whatever installation these "Death Feeders" had there.

  The lack of boots on the ground was frustrating, as far as gathering intelligence on our foes, but they had seemed entirely incapable of actually coming up with clever ideas that might actually work. There had been a few high level people getting offed by teleporting assassins, early on, but the liberal coverage of their movements by hidden snipers killed a bunch of wizards, and dissuaded the rest.

  In a frustrating failure of intelligence, it sounded conceivable that the snipers had actually gotten all of our opponents, that the orbital bombardment was a waste of time. We didn't have firm numbers, but it sounded like our foes numbered in the hundreds, at the most.

  Still, as a wise man once said: "There is no overkill. There is only 'Open fire' and 'I need to reload.'"

  "Satellite 24-15 will be in position over the next target in two minutes. Impact in five."

  The operation carried on.

** Did you know, it's only been nine months since this War on Sorcery started? If I were still going to Hogwarts, this would be exam time. I'd be graduating in a few weeks.\\
 \\
But I'm not. I'm hidden in a wizarding tent, the exterior of which is disguised as a lion statuette, which in turn is shrunken down and hidden inside a expanded trunk full of junk, which in turn is lying in an old dusty boarded up attic.\\
I have an Air Recycling Charm, and a house-elf periodically brings me fresh food, water and newspapers (going through the whole parade of popping into the attic, opening the trunk, fishing out and expanding the lion statuette until it's big enough to climb into). I wish I could do something to thank him.\\
 \\
Oh well, details. I'm well hidden away, but there are other muggleborns (yes, I'm a muggleborn) who couldn't or wouldn't hide. Judging by the news, most of them are dead now. Or worse.\\
You-Know-Who...he won. He's a master of mind magics, it was easy for him to infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, one Imperius at a time. Harry Potter vanished, nobody dared to speak out lest their friends and family are targeted...\\
 \\
And then, the Dark Lord declared war on muggles. Furthering his goal of pureblood superiority and muggle(born) subjugation/extermination, now that he had the Ministry of Magic under his control.\\
I was terrified of the idea; with Apparition and the Imperius curse, it'd only take days to compromise and paralyze the muggles, their military, their emergency services, their communication...they'd be helpless. I tried leaving anonymous notes in police stations, hoping that they'd help somehow, but after a few I had to go into hiding.\\
 \\
But...the muggles weren't conquered. They fought back. They broke the Statute of Secrecy, revealing magic to the world and how witches and wizards were trying to subvert their government.\\
It started a major uproar, especially when some of the Death Eaters were sloppy and got caught on camera. A few incidents of murder and Obliviation caught on tape got the whole muggle world up in arms.\\
It didn't take long for laws to be passed. Laws authorizing military action against magical governments. Laws identifying wands as a terrorist weapon. Laws ordering the arrest and confinement of identified magical beings.\\
And...the killings. One newspaper (the Daily Prophet's gone) says that the new location of Diagon Alley was exposed and bombed a few days ago. Another one (a muggle newspaper) blames the sinking of a cruise ship on wizards.\\
 \\
It's not just in Britain. Europe, America, Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the whole world is embroiled in conflict, muggles and magicals alike fighting against their extermination or subjugation.\\
All because Voldeuuhh...You-Know-Who bit off more than he could chew. He hasn't even been killed yet, he's openly running the Ministry of Magic now. Nobody can even fight against him anymore, because that means siding with the muggles trying to exterminate us.\\
So I'm hiding. I don't want to fight for Vo-the Dark Lord to conquer muggles. I don't want to fight for muggles who've been indoctrinated into thinking we're all evil. I'm staying hidden.\\
 \\
...\\
Sometimes, at night, though, I think. It's not You-Know-Who and his Death Eaters who take the brunt of the casualties here in Britain. They never seem to be amongst the dead. It's always magical creatures, centaurs, goblins, werewolves, etc...or it's non-Death-Eaters, half-bloods and muggleborns, people who'd be V-the bad guy's enemies if this War on Sorcery didn't happen.\\
And outside Britain, entire countries are being torn apart. Magical communities overseas that might have stood against the Dark Lord are being slaughtered by their muggle counterparts. And muggle militaries are being shredded by magical retaliation.\\
 \\
Deep down, I wonder...if this was the Dark Lord's plan all along. He's a master of mind magics, after all...

Neither of these is "muggles /stomp/ wizards," per se, but they do involve armed conflicts with a wizards versus muggles (mostly) setup:

linkffn(Burning Times by Alathon). Harry went into a long-duration coma during the horcrux hunt, and the fight spread to involve the muggles.

linkffn(Weapons Free by Angelicxdiscord). The war spread to be Voldemort's forces versus muggles and light wizards.
