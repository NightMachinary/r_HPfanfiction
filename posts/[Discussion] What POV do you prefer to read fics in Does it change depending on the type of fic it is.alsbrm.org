First, just want to say thanks to everyone in this sub - I love it here, because I always can find a bunch of really thought provoking discussions going on, as well as great recommendations and advice. A lot of other subs, especially in regards to books and movies, aren't so supportive and helpful to one another!

On to the question - do you prefer to read in 1st or 3rd person in fanfics? Or do you just not really pay any attention to the POV?

*SKIP this section if you'd like* -

Definitions for anyone who wasn't clear on them or wants a refresher (I had to look 2 up because I wasn't sure!):

- 1st Person - Uses 'I', 'my', 'me'. We only follow that character and know what they're thinking and feeling. This is how Suzanne Collins wrote The Hunger Games trilogy, which follows Katniss Everdeen. This is also used in things like Divergent, The Fault in Our Stars, and Twilight. Most fanfictions for those fandoms are written in this POV.

- 2nd person - Uses 'you'. Choose Your Own Adventure books use this a lot. I had a hell of a time trying to find any popular and well-known examples - if you have any, please let me know. I can't think of any fanfic I've ever read that uses this, either.

- 3rd Person Limited - Uses 'he'/'she'. We follow this one person, we know how they are feeling and thinking, but it's not direct like 1st Person. This is how JKR did Harry Potter, and how a majority of HP fics seem to be written.

- 3rd Person Multiple - Still uses 'he'/'she', but the POV can shift. The most popular examples I can think of are Swan Song by Robert McCammon and The Stand by Stephen King. A fairly decent amount of HP fics are written in this POV, as well, hopping from Harry to Hermione, to Voldemort, to Wormtail, etc.

- 3rd Person Omniscient - Still uses 'he'/'she', narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of everyone in the story. Examples - Little Women, Pride and Prejudice, Discworld, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. ^{it's been years since I've read the first 2, and have not yet had a chance to read the last 2, so I can't be 100% these examples are correct; they were mentioned in several different examples of POV I found with some searching. Let me know if I'm wrong, please.}

Now, I didn't find much on this, but I'd also like to argue there's such a thing as '1st Person Multiple' - It's what you would think, 1st person, but going from character to character. I've seen this in Hunger Games fanfictions, using "I" and "me", and also going from Katniss to Peeta to Snow, etc. I can't quite find any examples in books, though. Again, if you know of any, please let me know!

*Moving on* -

Which POV do you prefer for HP fics? Do you read in a specific POV but never write in it, or struggle with one? Or do you not really pay attention to what POV it is? I've noticed the majority of fics seem to echo the POV the author of the series used (JKR and 3rd Limited for HP fics, Collins and 1st Limited for HG), although there are some outliers. This also seems to change (at least in the HP sense) in regards to what type of story it is. For example, most 'redo' fics stay in 3rd Person, but with some odd mix of Limited and Omniscient (with whomever when back in time having future knowledge). Self inserts are almost always 1st Person Limited, with a dash of omniscience thrown in because they've 'read the books'. Canon rehashes, Slytherin Harry's, female Harry's - 3rd person limited. Dark and depressing or creepy fics? 3rd Person Multiple.

I generally prefer to read Hunger Games fics in 1st Person or 1st Person Multiple, but rarely like 1st in a Harry Potter fic unless it's a particularly well done self insert. I think I tend to mentally blur 3rd Person POVs all together - I notice if I'm following one person or many, but not really if it's omniscient or not. Bad POV or shifting a lot between POV and also completely ruin a great story, though perfect POV can't fix a bad one.

Things to discuss other than the title questions - If you're reading a 'self-insert', do you prefer it to be 1st or 3rd POV? What POV do you struggle to write in or get right?

Are there any good HP fics that use 2nd Person POV well, or use a certain POV to a particularly good effect?

And (I dread throwing this one in here a bit, it's complicated enough as it is) how does the tense of a story factor in for you? Do certain tenses work better with certain POVs?

Do I sound like those obnoxious questions you had to answer at the end of your high school English books short stories?


** Second person is extrodinarily hard to do well, because the main character cannot make a choice the reader would not have without breaking immersion.

First person is harder to do well than third, because the POV character needs to be someone you'd want to listen to telling the whole story, which is easy to screw up.

Third person limited (like the books) because it give the authors all the benefits of first person (limited information) without the added challenge of keeping the character charming enough to not annoy the reader.

Third-person multiple (A Song of Ice and Fire also uses this, BTW) has become the go-to because it's easy to use, more forgiving if one character is boring/annoying, and still lets you keep secrets form the reader.

** I dislike 1st person generally. I set myself a challenge to write in 1st person to practice and ended up writing a diary type fix based on Adrian Mole because anything more serious just felt too... I don't know, cliche? Try hard? Even more so with 2nd person. I just spend the whole time thinking "oh shut up". I'm sure it's done well somewhere but I haven't personally seen it yet.

I like 3rd person, and stick to one POV most of the time, although I did write something where the POV did shift within the story. I'm not sure I would do the same thing again because people got confused but it felt natural at the time.

*** I remember a couple of fics I wrote years ago that used Third Person Multiple, but generally I tended to stick to a single point of view for an entire chapter. On the handful of occasions I switched POV within the chapter, I tried to make it clear by identifying the character whose POV I was switching to by name as soon as possible, because I do agree it can be confusing.

**** Yes, usually I have line breaks at the very least, but prefer to stick to one chapter per person. But for this one it was kind of a fluid, silly fic anyway so I was sort of doing the camera thing - Rowling did it a few times in her earlier books where the reader "camera" ended up following Ron and Hermione instead of Harry. It was fun to write but yes I wouldn't write it again.

** /Bungle in the Jungle/ uses a second person PoV, and I couldn't say if it's done well or not, but I found it engaging and surprisingly not jarring, so there's that.

I'll read any PoV, with a slight preference for 3rd person limited, but present tense stories are a struggle unless they're really short one-shots.

*** IIRC, /Bungle/ reads as though it's Harry's internal monologue (like I have sometimes; like "you go ahead and throw things everywhere, brilliant" type thing). It's pretty much the only 2nd person PoV I've ever actually enjoyed reading.

** I almost exclusively read 3rd person (any 3rd person), and in past tense.

I've only read a handful of 1st Person fics (and books, for that matter) and I have never read a present tense fic.

I know of "Bungle in the Jungle", which is a 2nd person POV, but just because of that I wasn't even able to finish the first chapter. I find that POV to be without a doubt the worst you can choose to write a fic. The absolute worst. 1st person is palateable if the author is someone I like listening to. I'm pretty firmly set in the belief that 1st person is /always/ a self-insert to some degree, depending on the authors "acting" capabilities, and the authors capabilities to self-reflect. That means that almost all fanfictions written in 1st person are straight up impossible to read for me.

  Entries not allowed:

  5 . Any form of interactive entry: choose your adventure, second person/you based, Q&As, and etc.

That is from the FFN content guidelines and probably the reason why you won't find many second person stories.

** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure]]) is recommended here from time to time. Probably the only decently popular fic with 2nd person perspective

edit: 3rd person multiple can get confusing fast if you have too many pov characters

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** To be very quick:

First person is a very intimate form of writing. I prefer how drastic and personal the story can become when temporarily using first person in dramatic settings.

Second person. I've never read it, so I have no opinion.

Third person Limited: Similarly intimate but not to such an extreme as first person. This makes it really easy to relate to the character you only have the knowledge that they do. This is the style I prefer.

Third person omniscient: A bit below limited. This form has plenty of potential for dramatic irony which is really effective for me used properly. If you have a broad cast that you want people to relate to, then this is what I would recommend.

** 3rd person limited to be honest. I feel like a lot of fanfic authors try to go with one of the two other forms, but the shifting perspectives make things drag on needlessly and it often doesn't add much to the story.

** I like third person, just because it's what I'm most used too. I feel like second person would be the most difficult to do well, while I've read a few bad as well as a few good first person stories.

But yeah, I prefer the third person myself.

** I'm late to the game on this one, but I'll put my hat in there: I have no problems with 1st person, 3rd person limited or omniscient. I haven't read any fanfics in 2nd person; I only know of 1, which I haven't read: Bungle in the Jungle. Third person multiple is fine as long as the author makes it very clear whose perspective I'm reading.

As far as tense, I really really don't like present tense unless the fic is really short. For some reason I only associate the present tense with depressing works or dream sequences (which I find rather odd, because my life presently is neither a dream nor depressing). There have been quite a few otherwise decent stories that I abandoned reading simply because of the combination of length and use of the present tense. I don't think I've read any story that employs the future tense in narration.
