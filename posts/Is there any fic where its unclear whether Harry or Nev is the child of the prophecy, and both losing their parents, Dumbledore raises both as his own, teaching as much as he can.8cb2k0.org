  There are many what ifs. What if Harry had continued to teach the DA? What if Dumbledore had taught Harry more than just an understanding of Voldemort. What if a small change at the start of Harry's 6th year caused a spiral of events, causing Harry to repay three favours to a surprising Hogwarts student? Begins at the start of HBP.

Some would look at how little the powerful wizard that stopped Grindelwald and scared Voldmort does in the books and question if he was even trying. Dumbledore saw the worst of the world, his sister beaten and broken, his best friend started a war. Its understandable he wants to keep Hogwarts as sheltered and as idyllic as he can but some people would say his best would be leveraging that power and talent he has.
