** I saw this in the finished stories bookmark I have. Gonna check it out later but I read the majority of the first chapter and liked what I read so far. Reminded me of my Wu-Tang raises Harry story idea.

** I'm sorry to say that the summary didnt draw me in. There was nothing that made me interested in Barry. I rarely read non-Harry focused stories, and nothing in the summary suggested anything of interest.

So, why should i care about little Barry Little?

*** Thank you for the feedback! The summary was done as a bit of an afterthought when I realized that fanfiction.net needed one as a requirement. I will have a think and retool it.
