** It would be cool if we could use something like [[http://animebracket.com/][animebracket.com]] since they have an [[http://animebracket.com/results/best-old-man-in-anime/][awesome bracket format]] and you can vote by logging in with your reddit account.

You could also make it a regular thing where people would vote for "best fanfiction pairing", "best OC character" and things like that.

** Sounds great but I definitely recommend four or five categories if possible just because there's some real variety of fics. Categories like, one-shots, romances, adventures or humorous perhaps.

** Would you divide it up in categories?

I mean, otherwise it's really no better than just sorting by favs on ff.net. But if you have categories such as certain pairings/genres then it would actually add something.

** Double or single elimination? What determines the initial entries?

*** I was thinking of making a post and making a comment for each of the most common fan fics and allowing others to comment. Upvotes will determine the seeding of the bracket and then I'll create a bracket online where people can go and vote on their favorites!

**** I think strawpoll would be better for the seeding of the initial entries. Upvotes on reddit are influenced by things like timing, positioning, user popularity, even the randomization algorithm that kicks in for popular stuff.

** To what purpose? Is not the number of favorites or reviews sufficent? I'm happy enough with having multiple favories stories.

*** Favorites or reviews have no bearing on how good a fanfiction is. Some of the best have way fewer than some of the worst.

****** Not really. Presumably the list of stories in the bracket will all be good. Ranking them doesnt let you compare them with stories not in the tournament.
