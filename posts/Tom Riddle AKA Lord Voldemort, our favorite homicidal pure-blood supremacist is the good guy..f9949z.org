** There's some definite elements of this in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11862560][To Reach Without]], though it's introduced fairly late in the plot and the story is (as far as I'm aware) abandoned. Fair warning, the story centres around Harry turning into a girl due to an existential crisis fueled bout of accidental magic and elements of gender dysphoria and gender norms in case that isn't something you're into but I found it well written, and the world building is well thought out and incorporated even if there were elements of it that I wasn't too keen on (entirely due to personal preference and philosophical leanings rather than anything to do with the quality).

**** That's the easiest way of putting it, though it's a relatively slow build up to that realisation on Harry's part. It's not just a genderswap and instant happiness. She's initially super weirded out and psychologically messed about by the whole thing and wanting to get back to her old body. But given that she did if to herself, at least subconsciously, it's reasoned to give it a bit of time (the reversal process being a standard ritual that takes some time to set up anyway). That dichotomy is the main source of 'conflict' for most of the early story (as well as loads of interesting magic and world building stuff).

The author herself is trans I believe, so it's handled in a reflective and mature manner (as far as i can tell not being trans myself).

******* There are some fucked up elements such as Draco in first year expressing a desire to rape Luna by the time they're in like fifth year. It's meant to be “wow he's fucked up”

Also Harry is a smarmy arrogant know it all who hates losing and will escalate and it typically bites him in the ass.

******** I've read the first ~10 chapters and it was not to my liking, because: rambling author, overused italics in dialogue, magic trunk apartment, convenient time turner, and mild Ron bashing (I love Ron so much!). What I did like was that Petunia married a decent person, Harry grew up loved, and the exploration into the why and how of magic. However, I think I would prefer to read a "wizard textbook" or scientific journal type thing by this author rather than Methods of Rationality.

******* HPMOR is one that's quite polarizing, mostly as a reaction to its popularity. Basically, it was one of (if not the) best known fanfiction of HP on the internet - and so ipeople have pushed back against it by pointing out its flaws.

Personally, I think the first few chapters are decent, but it starts to go off the rails after that. The science is not particularly great, I didn't find the story particularly good, and the 'rational' aspects didn't strike as actually rational (moreso just calling itself that). Basically the idea of a scientifically raised Harry running around doing experiments and trying to figure out how magic works is a great premise for a fic - but it takes that starting premise, moves away from it, and weaves in the author's meh ideology under the guise of rationality.

It's not a /bad/ fic for everyone, though - and I'd recommend giving it a try and seeing if you like it.

****** Believe it or not, different people have different tastes, yes there are some parts that take time to get through but I overall enjoy it- everyone says that Harry can't debate but I see those parts as him simply freaking out, people say he's all stupidly arrogant but I love how often that comes back to make him feel like an idiot in retrospect, people complain about the loads of author tract which is fair but it is also a relatively thought provoking fic, I also enjoy the system of magic that he builds especially the thing about transfiguration not being permanent and all of the subsequent relevant revelations. I also find much of the humor to be very much my style, eg " you have a rep for being the "nice girl" you should name your army some tough name like the blood commandos - she had named it the sunshine regiment, their insignia was a smiley face" or "dracos brain was experiencing a hideous malfunction in which it could think of nothing to say but the truth"

Like I tell my kids "don't yuck someone else's yum", if you don't like it then let those who do enjoy it in peace
