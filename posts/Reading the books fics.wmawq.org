Lately I've really been getting into "Hogwarts Reads the Harry Potter Books" or something along those lines. The best I've seen is Pen is a Sword series by A Being of Violet Fire. I seem to be having issues tracking these kinds of stories down though. Can anyone offer any help/suggestions? Preferably on ff.net or AO3 since they're easily accessed on my cell phone but any site is fine in the long run. I don't have a preference on pairings as long as it isn't too mushy please.


** There is a literal shitload of these on ff.net. How could you possibly have trouble finding them?

*** Perhaps I should have been more clear. I'm looking for ones that are either a. finished or b. updated pretty regularly and aren't overrun with pure crack.

** [[http://readingthehpbooks.proboards.com/index.cgi][This]] forum seems to have quite a bit. Most of them seem to be fairly regularly updated.
