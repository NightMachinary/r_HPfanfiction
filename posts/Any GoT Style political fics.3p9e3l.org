I'm really into fics that explore the political side of the HP universe. I prefer genuine cunning being used, alliances being formed, backs being stabbed etc. to the 'Harry claims seven hereditary seats, Fudge is an idiot' stories that you sometimes get.

Something where families are constantly vying for power in a Game of Thrones style work would be perfect. It seems unlikely that it would exist and not be on every rec-list ever, so any recommendations for political fics would be much appreciated!


** It's not quite GoT-style politics, but linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) has Harry rising ever higher, despite the foes in his path. There's quite a bit of war, but also political intrigue and maneuvering.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

** One to add to your update list, it's in progress and hasn't gotten to the part where the true power plays begin, but what could be more like GoT than a HP GoT crossover?

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

*** Is this worth reading? I'm three chapters in and I already hate the premise of it. Everything is black and white, OOC characters, and veritaserum + the veil is basically thought police.

**** The summary does say "in the style of the French Revolution." Though, to be fair, using veritaserum is probably a good bit nicer than what was often done during the Revolution and subsequent Terror. I think the Veil is probably nicer than the guillotine, too.

Regardless, if you feel that there's lack of intrigue at the beginning and that bothers you, then it is coming. Probably not as extensive as GoT... but it's not as long, either.

If it's the violence and attitudes of the revolutionaries that bothers you, then that's not really going away. But it's also not too unreasonable, either. The French Revolutionaries were, once again, worse. The story is, if anything, a mild glimpse at what might plausibly happen if the muggleborn in Britain launched something akin to the French Revolution, then like the French, were threatened by other European governments that are run like Britain was and see the revolution as a theat to their own systems.

Sure, it's not always pleasant to look at, but then again neither was the French Revolution if you look at it too closely. The American Revolutionaries had advantages that made things easier for them than it was in France, yet alleged and actual royalists were still treated badly.

***** I see. Good explanation of it. I think the attitudes more than the violence is a bit jarring. I'll stick with it a bit longer to get to the intrigue then.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.
