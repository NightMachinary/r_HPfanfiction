Are there any good fics where Hermione goes to the past as a SLYTHERIN student to prevent people like Bella and Malfoy from becoming deatheaters, or where she is the twin of regulus/snape/etc. Preferably there isn't a time loop (like the future is still set, or she jumps forward in time) Thanks for any recs you can give!


** Linkffn(One Step Forward, Two Decades Back). The evil Dumbledore can be annoying because it's cliche, but at least it's a unique spin on it.

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
