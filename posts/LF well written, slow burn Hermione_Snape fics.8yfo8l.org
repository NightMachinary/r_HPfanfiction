** This was written I believe pre HBP. It is the first in a trilogy but if you don't like slash (the other books are from other characters POV) you don't have to read it. One of my favorite trilogies! It is called Body of Knowledge by Arsenic. [[http://tasteofpoison.inkubation.net/viewstory.php?sid=3]]
