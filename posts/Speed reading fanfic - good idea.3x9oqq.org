** Hey y'all - bit of a weekend project for a buddy and I but we're thinking of creating free speed reading versions of a tonne of popular fanfic (with author's permission, of course). One example attached and, ignoring pretty awful design, looking for feedback and suggestions on overall experience - good, bad and ugly.
