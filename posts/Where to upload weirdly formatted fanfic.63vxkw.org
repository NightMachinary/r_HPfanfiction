** I'm pretty sure ao3 would work for this. They allow custom HTML and CSS for your works.

They call the custom CSS "work skins", and [[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370][here's a basic tutorial on how they work]]. Hope that works for you!

** The only thing I can think of is to upload a PDF to Google Docs and share a link.

** Sorry no clue where you'd be able to post your story formatted like that but if you do find a site will you post a link to it here?

** The only thing I can think of are just blogs with a lot of css freedom.

** Hey, if you send me the epub I can put it up on a website, extracting the HTML from kindle isn't hard.

[[http://siye.co.uk][SIYE]] is really liberal in terms of allowed formatting, but it's Harry / Ginny only - except if you ask the admins, so you could do that. They are generally rather nice in my experience.

Otherwise I have no idea.
