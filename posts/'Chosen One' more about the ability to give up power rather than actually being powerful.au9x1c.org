Harry, for all his talents, is very much a 'follow the breadcrumbs' type of hero. By that I mean in each book he gets caught up in a mystery that is personally relevant to him that he is pretty much forced into solving which usually involves adventure and hijinks. I mean, think about it, the first several chapters in most of the books are all about Harry being smacked in the face with reasons to get involved in whatever problem is plaguing Hogwarts that year while tying Harry personally to it. As an example, in the first book, a lot of time is spent on all the clues Harry is smacked in the face with as well as his headaches and the slow realization that Voldie is not dead and is out to get him.

In short, I have to conclude that Harry is a passive character who rarely makes the first move on his own. If Dumbledore had managed to find all Horcruxes and kill Voldemort somehow by 1990, then Harry would probably have had a very normal humdrum years 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 & 7 (I'm assuming Sirius still escapes in year 3). Harry would have been an average student (not interested in the academic excellence of Tom or Dumbledore) without any great ambitions other than Quidditch and becoming an auror. He's just an average sort of guy.

Tom Riddle had talent, had looks, brains, charm, everything, and it's likely that he could have lead the magical world into a new golden age of discovery, but he is not passive. Tom is definitely ambitious (also arrogant, narcissistic, etc.) and that helped him down a self serving path. Heroes need some ability to self-sacrifice for others and Tom utterly lacked that. Thus, we get a dark time of terrorism rather than golden age.

Dumbledore, like Tom, was the bees-knees of his generation, but his flaw is arrogance (youth) followed by a lack of trust in himself (when he became older) meant that while he had the potential to kickstart a golden age, he chose not to.

If either Dumbledore or Tom had had Harry's backstory and fame, they would have been willing to milk it for all it was worth and set themselves up in leadership positions. Neither of them would have been willing to walk to their deaths at age 17, neither of them would have actively avoided the spotlight, and neither of them would have been willing to be coached/influenced by a mentor.

Harry is passive which leads to him not working hard to achieve his full potential, no interest in growing his personal influence, and not screaming for attention. He is/was willing to self-sacrifice for others, did his best to avoid personal power (broke the elder wand, etc.) and didn't use his reputation to shoehorn himself into a leadership position, instead working his way up the auror command chain, albeit his natural talent with offensive and defensive magic and leadership skills helping him a lot.

This, I think, is precisely why he was a 'chosen one' - not because he was talented or powerful, but because he is one of the rare few perfectly willing to get the job done and then step back into obscurity. Who ever is in charge of handing out prophecies did not want a new golden age, they just wanted an annoyance dealt with.

​


** To be honest, it's quite difficult to pull off a proactive protagonist. It makes sense, given the initial ideas why Harry is that kind of person, and from a narrative point of view it paves the way to 'magic as problems' rather than 'magic as solutions'. (Sadly, only fifth and sixth books did not end with the latter.)

**** But that doesn't work that well if you have Voldemort and his cronies taking over magical Britain. For Harry to have the initiative, he needs to be in a position of relative strength. Sherlock can afford to investigate because he does not have an entire government hunting him while they are running a genocide eerily similar to the Third Reich prior to the Final Solution.

A proactive Harry either needs to have a significant advantage in combat ability or you need to disregard the takeover and its preparation in the last two books.

***** Back in first year he could have been more interested in what happened to his parents and why no one thought to check on him. Sherlock would have searched through news archives at the very least rather than just taking other people's words for it.

****** But he was 11 back then. The best you can hope is Harry realising that Dumbledore is manipulative (which he openly admits in canon) and therefore should not be trusted. It's not like an 11-year-old will suddenly out-NSA the NSA.

** This quote from OOTP sums up to me why Harry is The Chosen One.

“It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.”

From the moment he stopped hiding behind the gravestone and faced Voldemort in GOF he became The Chosen One to me.

*** A lot of people would have done that. It's no different than Harry's friends following him to the Ministry in book 5 or Neville and company actively protecting the younger students in book 7. Wanting to feel in control, wanting to believe that it is your choice is not rare. I get why you think he's awesome for it, I just don't see it as worthy of a one of a kind title and prophecy.

What is rare is having no interest in power even while you have every chance to have it. Harry didn't 'give up' the power associated with being the Chosen One because for him there was nothing to give up, it was something he just didn't have any real interest in. Dumbledore gave up power, Harry didn't see it as worth having in the first place.

How many people would give up the elder wand? Even if I had no plans to use it, I would keep it with me for 'safe-keeping' just to make sure no one else would get it.

You feel like these are admirable traits? Thinking that power isn't worth having, and that the Elder Wand shouldn't be carefully protected?

***** Yes. I realize too much of a trait could be negative, but I don't really see the persuit of power for the sake of having it or using it to impose your ideals on society as a positive trait - people are imperfect and the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I'd rather hand power to a Harry over a Tom or Dumbledore in most situations because he doesn't already have plans for it.

**** It happens to everyone don't worry. I think it's interesting that in the books Harry chooses to put the wand back in dumbledore's tomb, it's like he's acknowledging that there are people that are truly powerful in the world instead of dismissing the idea entirely. Harry rejects power but he believe in it which imo is quite a humble characteristic and just makes me love harry even more

** I disagree. Working his way up the Auror command chain exactly signals a Harry willing to take charge and to lead. This allows him to push his agenda and protect his interests with Magical Britain's official security force.

And if you look at what his other close friends are doing, you can see a very clear pattern:

- Hermione is the mastermind and she sets the policies, the overall direction of the country
- Ron runs a super profitable business, and I can bet that WWW is the top Ministry contractor (they were one even in HBP)
- Ginny controls the country's top news channel. Those who dare to defy them get hexed into St Mungos
- Luna controls the country's next largest news channel
- Neville is in charge at Hogwarts and will eventually replace the aging McGonagall
- Of course, Harry himself is charge of the security force and the top protector. He seems to be the top enforcer of Hermione's policies

They have a lock on all top positions in Magical Britain, and that doesn't look to me as “giving up power and retreating into obscurity”.

*** What I was implying was that Harry's position was something that he is naturally suited for - he has natural ability in DADA and leadership that kept his promotions steady - but he is/was not actively looking for power/influence in order to fulfill his masterplan for the wizarding world or whatever. Other than not going back for NEWTS (and he wasn't the only one I think a lot of his year had the same opportunity) he refused to use his 'Chosen One' status to get ahead.
