:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic but I can only vaguely remember what it was about. What I do remember is a scene where Draco goes down to the kitchens at Hogwarts and a house elf I think it was Dobby makes a mistake or breaks something and Dumbledore says he's meant to be punished and Draco's like he's my house elf I'll take the punishment and burns his hand in the stove/oven???? And then he leaves with Dobby??? And McGonagall was there and was like Why'd you let him do that Albus and Albus was like I didn't intend for that to happen but I don't think he trusts me or something.

Also it was probably a time travel fic where he'd freed Dobby or maybe Winky??? Or like a Smart! Draco or something like that e.g Empath Draco. Probably part of a series if anyone remembers anything about this fix please let me know.


** Chapter 5 of Survival is a Talent has a scene like this

#+begin_quote
  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
