The Order and the Death Eaters have had enough. After years of fighting without a clear winner, they decide to set everything once and for all. They are going to play a final game to decide the fate of the world, whichever team loses goes to exile, and leaves England to the other. Magical oaths are sworn and arguments about choosing a game are exchanged.

Each team chooses a game, with the possibility of a tie-breaker.

Voldemort (Death Eater's captain) is quick to veto Quidditch, as he doesn't play that. Dumbledore (The Order's captain) vetos "Who kills more mudbloods in the less amount of time", which Voldemort proposes. The vetos run out and they soon have to accept whatever the other team throws at them.

The Order, having a good muggle background, proposes football (UK so that's regular football, not that American football thingy). Voldemort complains but starts looking for shorts and football shoes. Voldemort proposes Gobstones, which he was very good at in his Hogwarts years.

In the case of a tie, it has been decided that the ultimate tie-breaker is to be Wizarding Chess. Where Ron will have to stand up for the Order in a match against Voldemort (who is big Wizarding Chess cheater)... only that each one of Voldemort's pieces is a Death Eater and each one of Ron's is one of his friends/family or Order Member.


** Please. In a crack fic, Dumbledore has to be his fanon characterization. In which case, Dumbledore's all about the greater good. He jumps at who can kill the more muggleborns. He says 30 seconds and promptly kills the muggleborns in the order. Voldemort loses.

** Voldemort proposes a friendly game of who can kill Harry first, Dumbledore answers with a fun and educational game of Horcrux hunting and destroying.
