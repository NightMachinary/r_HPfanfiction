Hi. I had a dream about a Harry Potter sequel a few years ago. The dream was so vivid it was like I was watching it in a movie theater! Harry was an auror, and the whole canon group traveled to Papua New Guinea highlands in pursuit of a mythical and recently spotted "white dementor", a very ancient and nearly 'cleansed' dementor, supposed to be living in a cave somewhere in the depths of the deep Papua jungle. It had attracted many hundreds of regular dementors, who flocked to the area after the closing of Azkaban (which happened shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts). Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Ron, Neville, George, and a few of the others were there, at a Native village just at sunset, gathered round the campfire, awaiting the spectral emergence of the White Dementor, who was said to rise up from the forest depths around midnight, trying to elude the obsessed dementors who followed it everywhere. This caused much chaos and panic among the local Muggle villagers.

***** No. Just what's here. I share it kind of in the hope, maybe, someone else take up the thread and do a kind of pasta... Also, maybe, someone else has had actual Harry Potter dreams they would like to share. I think a Harry Potter Dreams reddit would be awsome, but how many people have actually had one?

** Why would a bureaucrat (Hermione), a herbology professor (Neville), a quidditch player (Ginny) and a shopkeeper (George) tag along in an Indiana Jones style expedition to investigate a gathering of dark creatures? I honestly can't stand forcing together named characters when it makes no sense just because what, cameos are cool? Writing OCs is hard? I'd buy the ministry sending a top tier Patronus caster like Harry plus his auror partner Ron to escort a magizoologist like Luna to investigate the gathering of creatures traditionally associated to the british ministry, but not the Hogwarts classes of 1996-99 school reunion.

I mean, I'm not trying to be an asshole if you're just blogposting a cool dream you've had, but as a story idea it's kinda weak.

  Neville is a doing wizarding equivalent of post-graduate thesis on some magical plants in New Guinea and while staying there he invites the Weasley/Potter clan for a holiday at the resort town he's staying in, unfortunately only Harry, Ron, Hermione, George and Ginny can make it but they make the best of it and decide to take some time off from their jobs to finally wind down. While staying there during there one night, mingling with the locals, they hear about the legend of the "White Dementor" [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eawYBbP6zfs][from a rambling drunk]] and it turns out that one of the plants that Neville is studying is actually tied to the legend itself. But it turns out some nefarious local dark wizards are looking for the plant's origin and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dvj3JIIxhI][they kidnap Neville for his expertise and the kids for hostages!]] ! [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnyqQPzAAiI][Its a race time for the gang as they have to figure out the villains nefarious scheme, save the kids and Neville and figure if there's any truth to The Legend of the White Dementor!]]
#+end_quote

Now I'm not saying this is like a perfect way to solve all the problems with the premise or that this is the only way to do it, this is just a very obvious and basic foundation to a plot for a light hearted adventure movie. But the thing you do when you get struck with inspiration for a plot isn't just to discard immediately just because it's not fleshed out and hasn't had the entire story handed to you on a platter. This is not how inspiration works at all. What you do is that you figure out the basics of how to make your inspiration come to pass and see how you can fit and tie all the story beats together then if you can't do that, odds are you have a shitty premise to begin with but if you can, great! You have something to work with. You'd apparently be quite surprised by how many stories begin as nothing more than a flight of fancy in someone's head. And I'm not saying a fever dream constitutes a story on it's own but it's a bit of an over-reaction to discard a story idea just because it's a bit contrived in it's conception.

Doesn't sound so ridiculous. Neville would be useful and describing Hermione as just a bureaucrat is kinda insulting, considering she was an active resistance fighter. She'd totally come along if Harry requires her academic or magical expertise.

**** Yes, let's ignore their career and responsibilities (and kiddies if it's canon compatible, you're taking away two couples of parents), they'll just put their life on hold and conveniently party up for a new adventure when there's absolutely no need for them to do so. What, is the rest of the auror office on holiday or something? Are they just choosing to investigate Harry's worst fear as a group vacation project?

It just seems so awfully contrived to me.

****** Let's not be dumb here, going to Hogwarts for 7th year wasn't an option for them. Undesirable number one rings a bell? The second blood war was happening around them regardless of what they wanted, totally different from purposely going out of their way looking for trouble on the other side of the world disregarding their completely unrelated responsibilities at home.

Your comparison doesn't hold at all.

******* Since when is Harry a prefect? Obviously he doesn't need to go back.

But of course, he really needs to bring along Ron to search for the Horcruxes... and I mean, it makes total sense, the Weasleys just have to dress up their Ghoul in Ron's clothes so Voldemort won't suspect a thing. Not contrived at all. No sir.

Point being, canon is just as contrived, if not more ("oh yea, we have a petrifying monster roaming the school, but it's cool!" or "Harry has to go through an elaborate Triwizard Tournament and win it, so that fake Moody can tag him with a portkey!") and you are being overly critical. IMHO you are quite a hypocrite if you are a fan of HP and suddenly care about things being 'too contrived', which could be used to describe any and all of the canon books.

******** Yes, canon is contrived in more than one part. It's a pretty common complaint for the last two books.

It was much more acceptable when the target readership was little kids like the first 2-3 books, but it started to chafe as YA fiction.

Are you trying to imply that everything you enjoy is perfect and uncriticizable? Because that seems silly to me. The quality of the setting as a whole outmatches the issues by quite a bit, but the OP can't really claim credit for the series to balance out his plot idea, can he?

********** I do not mind any criticism, even if it was a dream. I am also a semi professional writer, and know the value of critiques as long as they are thoughtful. And most if not all in this thread are pretty keen and spot on.

That being said, I believe, if I can take liberties with my own dream, that in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts, the Restoration of Magical Liberties laws, & the dissolution of Azkaban Prison, came a period of readjustments to new rolls, while those involved in the war were still, for a time, in a sort of recovery phase of their own young lives. The events of the dream took place only a few months in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts. The cannon group, staying together sort of like an elite squad in an army, would have been tasked, possibly at the encouragement of McGonagall, Arthur Weasley, or Kingsley Shacklebolt, to ply their skills in an hour of what would surely be short-handedness in the Ministry at large, what with the sorting out of who was loyal to You-Know-Who and whatnot. These young warriors were skilled in magic, and would have been trusted with the very dangerous mission of tracking down and possibly dealing with the threat of runamock dementors in the wider, muggle world.

This, of course, leads to a lot of questions about what exactly dementors are, their origins, what they did, if anything, before being tasked as prison guards, and to what ends their movements in the wider world means. Here's a good explano: "History of Dementors (Everything You Need to Know)" on YouTube.

The theory about the dream is that a glowing, or "white", dementor is nearing some sort of natural transition between this realm and the hereafter. It may have done the task it was created for, worked off it's "karma", or simply lived to the end of a dementor's 'natural' earthly lifespan.

With the shuttering of Azkaban, the now homeless and by most estimations unwanted creatures may have felt the draw of this powerful dementor from far off, and migrated as a flock en masse to find it.

It may be readying to lead them into the next world with it as it transitions. It may also have been the first person to have ever been cursed in this way.

Also the dream was purely visual, and the actors from the films were the characters in the dream, so, being of a practical frame of mind, and staying within the confines of the remaining fragments of the old British Empire, Papua New Guinea is part of a protectorate mandate of Australia, & thus (theoretically) a part of the Ministry of Magic's wider global charge.

Also, the dementors are from Britain, so they are Britain's (the Ministry's) responsibility to deal with.

My extrapolation above might also qualify this as a work of fan fiction, despite the nature of it's inspiration or origin.

What's the point of posting a dream on a fanfiction forum? What's the point of calling it "sequel" if not to pitch it as a story idea?

Are you actually trying to pass this as mere blogposting, and implying it's a good thing? Because I'm trying to give the guy some credit here by thinking he wanted opinions on a story concept, rather than thinking he was posting stuff that would barely be on topic on [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]].
