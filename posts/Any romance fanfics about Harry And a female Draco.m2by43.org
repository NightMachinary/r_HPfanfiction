Honestly I just want to know if you guys have any good ones. I don't plan on checking out of the 4.7k stories full of slash


** So, I realise this isn't all that much of a help, but I'm currently two thirds of the way through writing a Harry/Fem!Draco story.

The reason it isn't all that helpful is that it currently isn't published anywhere, and it's probably still at least a month away from posting as I'm being a good boy and writing my new fics to completion before I start posting them.

So, yeah. Sorry about that. Not aware of much in this space at all.

** Odd thought: in a world where Draco Malfoy was never born, Lucius and Narcissa' Malfoy's daughter finds herself feeling butterflies flitting about in her tummy when she thinks of her nemesis, Harry James Potter.

Her parents shoot each other knowing, resigned looks when she rants about him at home.

** Ah yes I remember looking for these back before I used Reddit. I didn't find many btw. I do remember one where draco was turned into a girl cast out and had to live with Harry at hogwart. Can't remember the name though Good luck on your search though.

*** Ive read this before. Quite interesting actually. It is a shame that to find these kinds of hidden gem you have to search it in the ocean of slash.

**** Yeah thats why I kinda gave up on the idea of reading fem draco. Interesting in theory but a pain to find let alone find a good one.

***** Its gonna be hard. I tried using the search tool using the keyword “fem!draco” but its useless cuz the tool itself is not so usefull

****** I don't know how you feel about the wattpad platform but that may be a good place to start as it containes some of the more niche fics and if you find one you can tap on the tags to find more like it.
