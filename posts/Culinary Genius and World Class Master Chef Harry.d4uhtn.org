I think that most of us have probably encountered the skilled chef Harry trope; the Dursleys have forced him to cook every meal since he was 4, so by the time he's 15 he will happily impress people he cares about with his amazing cooking.

Are there any fics that really double down on this trope and run with it?

 

For example, Gordon Ramsay happens to pass by little Harry's lemonade stand, he tries some on a whim, and both of their lives are forever changed after his first sip. It's not long before Harry is known worldwide as Ramsay's protege. The two have a show together. Harry's got his own published cookbook and his lemonade is sold in every grocery store. This naturally translates into genius potioneering. Hermione is indignant about Hogwarts' army of slaves in the kitchen, Harry is enraged by the shit that they call food. Etc.

*** Wasn't it Ron who ended up being Iron Chef in that, though? I seem to recall Harry getting knocked out pretty early.

It's not Gordon Ramsay at Hogwarts OP wants, it's Chef Harry making culinary magic.

***** Maybe someday I'll finish reading it. It just hit me as a fluffy alternate HBP the first time I tried, not what I was looking for.

****** I recommend giving it another shot. I thought it was going to be just ridiculous fluff at first but it impressed me as it developed and I couldn't put it down.

******* Well, you're the third person in under 24 hours recommending it so I'll certainly take it under advisement. ðŸ˜ƒ
