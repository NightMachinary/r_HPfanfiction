** I hate when writers project real world prejudices unto the wizarding world. The wizarding world is not sexist, stop trying to pass Victorian era social mores as wizarding social mores. The wizarding world isn't backwards, its just different.

It iss virtually devoid of traditional racism and sexism.

They have their own prejudices involving blood and fantastical rascism to deal with. They don't need to be potrayed as some sort of stuffy Victorians with magic.

*** So much this. The first female Minister for Magic was in 1798, so sexism is a prejudice the magical world seemed to do away with not so long after parting ways with the Muggle world.

Another thing worth remembering is that the Hogwarts Quidditch stadium has unisex changing rooms, which is something you'd have to go to Scandinavia to see in the Muggle world. So the wizarding world isn't particularly prudish either.

***** It's from Philosopher's Stone Chapter 11:

#+begin_quote
  Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).

  Wood cleared his throat for silence.

  “Okay, men,” he said. "And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.

  “And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”

  “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
#+end_quote

It's not clear if this changing room has showers or not:

PoA Chapter 9:

#+begin_quote
  “But the match,” said Harry. “What happened? Are we doing a replay?”

  No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.

  “We didn't --- lose?”

  “Diggory got the Snitch,” said George. “Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it.”

  “Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.

  “Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he's trying to drown himself.”
#+end_quote

These could very well be the showers in the dorms, not the stadium, but the use of "still" seems to imply a normal routine of post-Quidditch showers and Wood is taking longer than normal.

If there are showers, I'd imagine they're cubicles rather than an open shower room. Hogwarts may not be prudish, but mixed gender showers stretch belief a bit far.

How? If Harry, and the Dursleys, were black, people would complain about the racism of having yet another dysfunctional black family. If Ron were black, everyone would complain about yet another financially poor black family depiction. If Hermione was black, people would whine about a black character having unruly hair.

It feels absurd because there was never any indication that racial demographics were being messed with for the story. The general rule for fantasy writing is that once you've picked out the stuff you want to make magical, you leave the rest alone. This way the audience can easily accept the fantastical by latching onto the familiar.

Who are these people? Someone on the street? Facebook trolls? People complain about everything. What are their reasons?

I know one good reason: sometimes things get called out because they don't go beyond the stereotype. A badly-written black character is bad representation. Stereotypes aren't bad; relying on them and not going beyond them is bad--bad writing to be exact.

Wait, wait, wait, are you saying having Black and Asian people /distract/ from storytelling? How is a white main character less distracting, or better, or however you mean? Why should a white perspective be the universal example? Classism isn't white-only. White isn't a default race. Why can't a Black person's perspective speak to White and Asian people as well? Because all of us non-White people are perfectly capable of absorbing white-led media all the time, but we hardly ever get the favor returned.

Imagine Hermione is Black. Neville and Snape are Asian. No racial demographics being messed with (I was only suggesting it as a hypothetical). No storylines are changed. Only physical description. Is that absurd? There are times where I'd like to see culture-specific issues addressed and there are times when I'd be ecstatic if there were just more characters who are stated to be of color. Hermione being black doesn't automatically affect the storyline any more than being white, it's all down to the writing. But in her example, I think it adds an interesting depth, considering her blood purity. There's no requirement that a story has to openly address her race AND her blood purity; the metaphor is already there with blood purity.

No. I'm saying that if the story, even on a metaphorical level, isn't about race, then there's no reason to screw around with it. Britain is a white nation, to the tune of 84%, so it makes sense to have the vast majority of characters be white. If the story were set in India, I would say the same thing except that "White" would be replaced with "Indian".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The plot? Sure, the subtext and audience attention? No. Remember that Hermione was picked on and insulted because of her mudblood status and almost anti-social character quirks. If she is black and this happens in a school that is predominately white, other character reactions would be misconstrued as racist. Which would distract from the other themes that the audience /should/ be paying attention to.

I don't think there's anything wrong with ambiguity on whether racism or blood purism is happening, because they parallel each other. I don't think it's distracting; I think it could strengthen the story, if written well. But I think this is veering into personal interpretation of HP and more hypotheticals, so I can agree to disagree.

**** I get what you're saying but at the end of the day Rowling was writing about children in the 90s at a British boarding school for (what she was assuming would be) an audience of British children. It's expected that the majority of the characters would be English and white because that is largely what the makeup of the UK is - white and English. There are some incidental Welsh characters, some Scottish characters, and also some BME characters, but largely everyone is white and English because that's her audience and the reality of the setting.

** Weird complaint. I mean, all HP fanfics are derived from a series where the three main characters are all white and straight. Since these characters are the "main characters", they're usually the ones people write about.

Hermione is absolutely a strong woman in a non-stereotypical role pre and post-war, in both canon and fanfiction. In fact, most fanfic authors are more willing to turn a blind eye to Hermione's faults than JKR is.

And if you think there aren't that many fics with gay characters or portrayals of homosexual relationships in fanfiction, you clearly haven't been looking in the right places.

The 3 main characters are straight and they are the only characters we really see relationships of. You could make the same argument about any random attribute that affects 5-10% of the public.

The reason Harry Potter doesn't make a big deal out of minorities is because it created its own in mudbloods and purebloods. The morals and lessons of this "bloodism" can be applied to any prejudice which is /the whole point/. Kids will read it and hopefully see their own prejudices in it and adding specific real-world scenarios into it will only dilute that message.

** Good lord, what a shitstorm already. I have no idea what question you're asking, nor what people in this thread are attacking because you're so vague that I feel like everyone's just projecting meaning onto your words? Harry Potter covered a lot of great social issues but it really isn't the best representation-wise, but to say it spawns bigots is way off. Again, have no idea what you're trying to say.

It'd be nice to have a reasonable discussion about some of the flaws in the series that fandom tries to remedy, because JKR does write a mother/monster dichotomy into her female characters to distinguish between good and bad traits, and devalues emotional characters like Lavender and Cho. Just because the wizarding world doesn't have our kind of sexism doesn't mean the writing doesn't inflate beliefs from our world. And HP isn't diverse in terms of race nor sexuality. It's not discriminatory for that, but it's just plainly not diverse in these qualities. It's how most of our media unfortunately is. Attacking past media for being a product of its time is non-productive. We should focus on how to encourage more diverse media for the future and question why we're /still/ whitewashing people who are canonically of color or not representing when we can (like Newt Scamander; JKR said his grandson was swarthy in an interview and you might not take that as canon, but casting him for /Fantastic Beasts/ was still a major opportunity to put a lead PoC into the HP world and it didn't happen. Nor for the rest of the cast).

But really, my top concern is whether or not you're drama-baiting because looking at your post history, I wouldn't be surprised.

The point isn't in this detail. A story doesn't HAVE to justify a black main character or more Asian side characters in Britain, as if it's cripplingly unrealistic to see them. That's what the demographic argument seems to say: "All main characters should be a white British boy with 1.5 siblings" as if one can't have a story in that 10% of minorities.

But there's a broader point too, which is that diversity isn't something valuable in and of itself. The reason why we value diversity is the principle of non-discrimination. Our society is diverse, which means that we expect the make-up of institutions to match that diversity. If they don't, then some kind of discrimination is at work. Diversity is valued therefore as a signal that society is just/non-discriminatory.

But if your society isn't diverse in the first place, then a lack of diversity does not signal discrimination. Indeed, to force artificial diversity where none exists in society is to discriminate, and so completely contrary to the reason why we're supposed to value diversity in the first place.

Diversity does not equate to our-world racial discrimination storylines. Most people in this thread believe the series doesn't have our kind of racism. Why should that change? It could, but it certainly doesn't have to.

edit: I feel like people are getting caught up in my offhand mention of more black bloodlines; I was thinking like a writer when I mentioned that, meaning it as a possibility or just a mental detail to paint a potential history of magical Britain. Entire storylines do not need to be adjusted for this. It doesn't even have to be mentioned. It can just be a mental detail of the author so it inspires their world.

She wrote a story about Harry. We can do the same, but we don't /have/ to.

For those who want a higher level of minority representation in their fics, it might be a good idea to compile a list of stories which have done so to date, and take it from there.
