The protagonist of my WIP is currently worried about being the target of a Legilimens, and she's wondering if there are any physical sensations associated with having your mind read - does it cause a headache?

Got me wondering if this would be a good prompt for chronic headaches/migraines, or if this has been explored before?

*** Yeah, I was thinking it'd be interesting if someone realized that their chronic headaches were caused by someone in their life being a Legilimens without their realizing!

**** Had an idea for a original story once where everyone communicated telepathically, but the main character was born without the ability - made for a fun thought-experiment but never went anywhere beyond the storyboard

** Nah you don't get headaches as such, but if yoy have prior experience and knowledge you'll feel a small tig at your head. Headaches and migraines are only caused by poorly cast memory charms.
