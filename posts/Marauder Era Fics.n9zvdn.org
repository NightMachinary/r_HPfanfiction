I've recently started reading All the young dudes and am absolutely loving the marauders and was wondering if there are any “classics” that are considered a must read for the marauders era ?

Or if anyone has any other good marauder era fics they'd like to share

Any recs would be super awesome !!


** This loosely connected trio by The Divine Comedian:

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. When the students of Beauxbatons Academy and Ilvermorny School arrive, the champions are in for three unprecedented challenges. Meanwhile, Remus still has feelings, James is still trying to get the (Head) girl, and Sirius has revelations.

  James celebrates Christmas by drugging himself on powdered thestral-hoof (as a joke), Remus visits Madagascar (it's sunny and it brings out his freckles), Peter takes up smoking (and quits), and Sirius flat-out refuses to read Nature's Nobility ever again (he would also like to make it clear that he detests the Christmas decorations in Grimmauld Place).  This version of events takes place from December 1975 to April 1976. There were some animals hurt in the telling of this story, but the boys would like to ensure you that the Giant Squid isn't one of them.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  COMPLETE! Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody decides to slack off on the constant vigilance just a teensy bit before Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. He's actually going to try to live a life. Not much romance... just pathetic attempts at it with tips from Tonks.

  Long haul Remus Lupin story. Book 1 covers his 1st Year at Hogwarts, and all its ups and downs. Making friends, keeping his secret, and trying to cope with being in the real world for the first time in his life. The world of Shifting Lines will eventually have Wolfstar.

Watch the trailer!Now complete!
