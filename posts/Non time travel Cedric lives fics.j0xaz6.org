Just looking for anything with Cedric living as long it's not similar to the Cursed Child. If it is time travel I would just rather he keeps living and it doesn't cause trouble.

Maybe with Harry/Cedric but I'm not picky about it. Any pairings that aren't Harry/Hermione are fine.

Oh and no bashing of any of the Weasleys. It might sound strange but I see it included in a lot of fic and would just rather not read it.


** There is a time loop so technically there's time travel but not the classic sense: linkao3(honey there is no right way) It's Harry/Cedric and very cute.

Cedric lives in linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) but he's not a major character in the fic. He and Harry are friends though.

  ‘Have you tried everything?' Hermione asked insistently.‘Yes! Every time I get to the cup and Cedric doesn't take it with me I go immediately back to my bed in the morning. But all the times he is with me, he dies and after I fall asleep I return too.'‘I guess it is obvious then, isn't it?' Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.'Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU
