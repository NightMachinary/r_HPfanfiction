** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1305839/1/Always-a-Bridesmaid-Never-a-Bride][Always a Bridesmaid, Never a Bride]] is an excellent novel-length Oliver Wood/Katie Bell fic.

So is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2449329/1/What-It-Takes-To-Win-Bell][What it Takes to Win Bell]]

I'd also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2542810/1/A-Look-To-the-Left][A Look to the Left]]

Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933691/1/Love-and-Quidditch][Love and Quidditch]]

What I'm trying to say is, if you're looking for anything, Oliver Wood/Katie Bell is a superb ship that always welcomes more sailors.

** I have the perfect fic for you. It was super long, very good despite some small grammar mistakes, and when it was over I cried. Not because it was sad, but because it was over. At least a week of my life went into this story, and I would do it again. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5356546/1/Their-Verdict-of-Vagaries][Their Verdict of Vagaries.]] I hope you haven't read it before, because it's great.

** I'll give you my standard recommendation for these types of request: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][The Alexandra Quick Series]] by Inverarity. Its consists of four books (thus far) and takes place entirely in America with entirely original characters. I consider it to be the best written 'fan-fiction' out there.

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?
