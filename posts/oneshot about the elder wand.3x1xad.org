The title is pretty self explanatory really. there was a story about the elder wand causing Harry's wands to die on him and eventually, he accepts it and he other Hallows after Ginny leaves him, with all of them thinking that he's a squib. It was part of a one shot collection I think.

Any help would be appreciated, especially if you could recommend fics like the one I mentioned or the lesser Saddness.


** That was one of mine, written off a prompt from [[/u/Taure]] on DLP. Here's a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/17/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][link]].

**** Thanks for the kind words.

I've a couple of sequel chapters penned. I'll try to edit and post one over the holiday if there's interest.

*** Thank you! And please update it, the premise for that story was awesome! Love how Harry just says, "Fuck it, let's do it!" I've re-read it way too many times. Does anyone have a link to the prompt? I want to know if anyone else responded to it. Bye, just wanted to say that the story is incredible, didn't actually think that the author would reply.

**** I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed it.

I suspect I was the only one since it was a TGYH prompt. (DLP runs an on-again/off-again 'Thank God You're Here' thread where folks can request a writing prompt and turn around a story in a day or so. It's usually done on request: "Hey, I have a long bus ride ahead of me--someone shoot me a prompt.")
