I hope I am doing this correctly. I'm trying to find a story where Harry and Sirius went through the Veil and wound up in a world where both became Lord Black, Neville Longbottom was killed and Voldemort was working with someone who wore a mask to fix things. Sirus and Harry are robbing the DEs and at the end have a huge party including naked broomstick flying.
