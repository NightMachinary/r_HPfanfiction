** Why do you need an invite for AO3? Is this something new?

*** No it's been that way for at least months. When I signed up six months or so ago it took me nearly a month to get my invite.

** just a really dumb question, but I don't understand AO3 very well: How do you get spare invites? I have an account and my friend wanted an invite, but I couldn't figure out how to do it. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask :)
