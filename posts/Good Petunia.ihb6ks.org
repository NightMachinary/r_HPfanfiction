Is there any fics that have Petunia as a good person? Or maybe Lily and Petunia make up and love each other again? Thanks in advance! :)

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magical Guardian)

Lily and Petunia reconcile while Lily was in school and remained close until Lily was forced to go into hiding, so the Dursley's don't hate magic and actually treat Harry like a nephew.

** - “The family evans by dirgewithoutmusic” linkao3(3073562) which has one of the best paragraphs in the whole fanfic scene:

#+begin_quote
  When Petunia was frustrated with Lupin's moping or Molly's frenetic energy, or the way Dudley tagged along behind the twins, Petunia would go tug the covering down off the portrait of Sirius's mother and they would scream at each other until Petunia felt her stomach settle.
#+end_quote

- [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/1963063][The Peculiar Resilience of the Refugee | Harry Potter for Grown-Ups by Squibstress]]

- “The memoirs of a wilted flower by Ideasofmarch” linkao3(22133374)

- “Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee” linkffn(12551744)

- “Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters” linkao3(10294436)

- “Petunia's Letter by mzzbee” linkao3(11676102) and its sequels (including mine “Petunia's Long Morning by mcepl” linkao3(18770464))

- “Two Witches In the Family by Quiet_Shadow” linkao3(14580930)

- and many others

However, all Petunia-oriented stories have to deal with the issue how the ugly caricature of a human from books is suddenly somebody who could be accepted by the reader of the story as a human being. There must be some at least minimal redemption story. The stories above made at least decent job in this department. There are some other stories, where I wonder why the character is called Petunia when she has nothing common with the person written by JKR:

- “Petunia Takes Charge by Leath1” linkffn(4067744)

- “Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5” linkffn(13052802)

- “By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept by Deco” linkffn(8864658)

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.

  The life of one Petunia Marie Evans had never been easy, and it hadn't been particularly pleasant for a long time either. In another world, one much different than this, Petunia was alone. Jealousy turned into bitterness turned into hatred - and hatred marks the soul like nothing else.This time was different. Petunia found a family, one that cared for her and loved her, when she was on the brink of loosing herself to her anger and it saved not only her life, but Harry's too.

  It's never easy to be brilliant, friendly, pretty, wonderfully talented Lily Evans' sister. Even when you're also a witch yourself. But Petunia Evans isn't one to just let herself fade in the background and be forgotten, not if she has anything to say about it (and she has plenty to say, even if she doesn't voice it out loud). Someday, she'll shine on her own, just wait and see! However, shining in a war-torn era isn't that easy when you're Muggleborn, and even more so when no matter what, Lily always seems to do everything better...

** linkffn(Royal Ward), sort of. She gets some character development that results in her starting to discipline Dudley and treat Harry better, but it takes a while to show up.

Some of the details of the fic might not be everyone's cup of tea (manipulative Dumbledore, mugglewank, decent-people Malfoys, and a dash of RPF since it involves the royal family) but I enjoyed it enough on the whole to add it to my watch list.

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.
