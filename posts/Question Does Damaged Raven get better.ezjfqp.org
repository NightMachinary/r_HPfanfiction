I was wondering if anyone who's read Damaged Raven by JustBored21 could tell me if it gets any better after the first 7 chapters. I really like the concept and hope it will be good, but so far there has been a stupid amount of bashing, Harry's actions have no consequence at all, and there have been just enough spelling/grammar mistakes that it's kinda starting to get to me.

Plus the part where ‚ÄòMind Rape' was said by someone about twice a paragraph for a whole chapter. It starts to lose its meaning if that's the only way to talk about it.


** I haven't read it but that seems like a total lost cause.

*** Haha, I don't know really. I could be over reacting. If you have the time would you be willing to read a chapter or two and tell me what you think, as a second opinion?

**** Yeah, that summary screams /terrible fic/ to me. Dumbledore and Weasley bashing together will never get you a decent story.

***** Yeah, sometimes you can get mild, and not too stupid bashing. Kinda like how most people are with Snape, and then you just get bashing characters for the hell of it. It's not the best way to write a story.
