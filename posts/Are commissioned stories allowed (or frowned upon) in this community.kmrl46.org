Just wondering as to the legality (as it is profit for copyrighted works) and how people feel about it.


** Fanfic for profit is straight up illegal.

*** exactly, it doesn't matter how you "feel" about it, if you are doing it you are likely to get sued if it gets any attention, hence if you do it you are an idiot

***** That's pretty much why it's rarely talked about. Fanfic is basically 'sort of tolerated' by most authors, so talking about things like that is what gets people like George R.R. Martin moving from "I don't really like fanfic and don't think you should do it" to "cease and desist, motherfuckers".

****** George R.R. Martin is against fanfiction? I mean there are still tons of ASOIAF fics out there and by [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] guidelines he is not among the authors that have expressed their disagreement with having fanfiction written based on their work

******* Very. He's talked about it on his LiveJournal, of all things, and maintained the opinion in a convention interview I saw of his last year. I don't know why FFNet doesn't have him on their list, but I think if he knew people were commercialising fanfic of his work, he'd very rapidly work to get on it and all that stuff would be gone.

*** Exactly this, I'm just counting the days until a layer from a large publishing house sees the free patreon money floating around and wins an easy case.

** Also the downvote is slightly hurtful lol, I'm not condoning fanfic for profit I was only asking about it.

*** Reddit algorithms sometimes manufacture downvotes, so it might not even have happened. Or it could be fat fingers.

Alternatively, some people are just jerks. But don't give the downvotes a second thought.

** Not a legal expert, but if it's a personal commission (you dm the author requesting a specific fic say based on a prompt, then they send you the fic after you pay them) absolutely nothing will come of it for either party. I'd imagine posting a fic for commission is more of a grey area, but nevertheless it's unlikely a massive publishing corporation or the author themselves would find out or care enough to dedicate resources to punishing the author.
