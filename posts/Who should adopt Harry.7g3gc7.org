Let's say that the Dursley abuse is noticed when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter.

Let's also say that the blood protections are weak because Harry's home environment is awful.

Who do you think should adopt Harry? Not who /would/ with political pressures and whatnot, who /should/?

The Weasleys, I'd say, are out. Financial problems, and I can't imagine Harry would actually be comfortable living with them for a few reasons. And in this case he's not already friends with Ron/Twins.

Molly may seem oppressively/aggressively affectionate compared to what he's used to, the horsing around with the kids would likely seem a little too close to Dudley, and just the general rambunctiousness would be too much I think.

The Tonks family, maybe? Cousins through Dorea and they have experience raising a kid already.

Then there's the issue with Harry probably needing good magical security.

I've seen fics use this as a justification for Harry being adopted by Amelia Bones, but I'm not sure how much sense that makes. As far as I know, Amelia has no real connection to the Potters. Also she's a single parent, and the woman has got to be absurdly busy all the time with her job.

So, what do you think?


** Fudge.

Fudge wants a popularity boost. Rescuing Harry Potter from cruel muggles is a huge win. Having Harry grateful to the Ministry is a big deal. Even if Fudge effectively hands Harry off onto a minister or aide the opportunity to be the favourite uncle of the Boy-Who-Lived is huge.

With regards to a potential story imagine if Fudge started to care for Harry. Fudge's sense of family vs Malfoy's gold. How would Harry's views be shaped? With the backing of the Ministry does Harry get a pass for underage wizardry? If Dumbledore vs Fudge flares up does Harry even go to Hogwarts? Who from the Ministry would handle his education? With Fudge and the ministry on his side Umbridge has no reason to dislike him other than not being a pureblood. How would they interact?

****** You haven't defined 'best'. Until I know what definition you're using its hard to justify. Best doesn't always mean happiest. With hindsight being raised by Moody might have been 'best' with regards to having him prepared. Living with a completely ignorant muggle family might be what makes him happiest or the Weasleys but does that make them the best?

Who should adopt? That isn't clear at all. Should? As in who has the right to or what would Harry want? You've clarified to me that you mean best but you haven't clarified what you mean by best. Its because you've asked for best for Harry I've said Fudge. Best with regards to hindsight is perhaps to have the support of the Ministry behind him. Best for his education might mean being adopted by McGonagal. Best of his quidditch might be being adopted by Oliver Wood's family.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7583739/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Most-Electrifying-Man][Well, the answer is obvious]].

Alright, now that I have a less serious answer out of the way, let's get serious.

First, they would probably look at family possibilities. Everything we see from canon tells us that Petunia was his mother's only living relation. On the magical side, we are pretty damn certain that James had no siblings, and we know of no other relatives closely related enough to matter.

#+begin_quote
  The Tonks family, maybe? Cousins through Dorea
#+end_quote

Highly unlikely. We know from Rowling that Harry's grandparents are Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, and that Fleamont's father was a Henry (Harry to his intimates) Potter. We also know from the tapestry in Grimmauld Place that Dorea's husband was a Charlus Potter. As far as I can tell, Fleamont was Henry Potter's only child, but was definitely his only son. So we don't know how closely related Dorea is to Harry on the Potter side, but we can make certain guesses. From the [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/black-family-tree][Black Family Tree]] we know that Dorea Potter is maternally Sirius's Great-Aunt and paternally his first cousin twice removed. So, theoretically this would put Charlus at two generations prior to James (assuming that Charlus is a brother to Henry Potter), which means that any grandchildren of Dorea's (no children that we know of, the Black Family Tapestry only shows Black's and their spouses) would be second cousin's once removed, which would be a fairly distant relationship, but still doable I suppose. But we also know that Fleamont and Euphemia were rather old by parenting standards when James was born, so the Charlus Potter may be from an earlier generation. Of course, if Charlus was only a cousin to the Henry Potter branch of the Potter family, any theoretical descendants of his would probably be considered too distant a relation to Harry to matter. This would also then rule out any of the Black family on the basis of the Dorea-Charlus connection.

So, if family isn't an option, the next would probably be friends of the family. Well, Lupin is out (werewolf), Pettigrew is (assumed) dead, and Sirius is a convicted felon imprisoned in what can only be described as Hell on earth. We don't know of any other friends of Lily (except the former-friendship with Snape).

So, if family and friends are not possible, what would be the key points for an adoption to go through? I would say the most important factors would be a stable family life, money to support a child/another child, previous/current parenting experience.

This rules the Weasleys out, as you have pointed out.

Amelia Bones has no children that we know of, and from what I can tell, Susan was raised by at least one parent. So while she would have a good economic situation, I don't know about the parenting experience and what-not, or anything about the home life.

Frankly, I could see the Malfoys getting it. They are fairly/very well regarded by society as a whole (and by the MoM), have a loving family (basically their only redeeming quality as human beings), a ridiculous amount of gold, and Lucius and Narcissa already have raised a child.

Of course, this all assumes you are working within a canon/near-canon world, and that Harry's living conditions will be decided by the Wizarding World and not the Muggle World.

Yeah Augusta definitely fills some requirements. Possible connection to the Potters. Financially secure. Presumably good home security, or at least she's more than able to purchase it. There's a kid Harry's age there already.

She's one of the better choices, but also she seems like she isn't a very nurturing person - not ideal for a kid, particularly an abused one.

** I'm gonna throw Dumbledore in the ring.

Yes, he's an old bachelor who's never raised a child before, but he's worked with children most of his adult life. He has a bunch of house elves to help him out, so it's not like there's any real physical work involved. He is the only one who can /guarantee/ Harry's safety from Voldemort apart from Lily's protection. He has a hospital wing and a phoenix on hand for any medical emergencies. He has a large network of trusted and competent adult friends and colleagues which he can entrust Harry to in case of emergency.

But maybe most importantly, he's a great wizard and used to being one. The public will naturally accept that Dumbledore has adopted Harry, it will seem like he belongs with Dumbledore. It won't set off any protest or custody battle the way that, say, giving him to the Weasleys might. And Dumbledore could show Harry how to handle being famous. Even if he didn't want to, or Harry wasn't at the level where Dumbledore felt comfortable teaching him anything extra as far as magic, just having the headmaster of the school as your parent would make you want to study harder, I'd think. And Dumbledore would always be there, within reach, if Harry had problems or questions.

*** I think the biggest problem that you didn't mention is that Dumbledore is /busy/.

The guy has like three full time jobs, he's already got too much on his plate as it is. He simply has no time to raise a kid.

If he quit his political positions then this may be a more feasible option.

Then there's also the fact that Dumbledore was the one who basically illegally placed Harry in an abusive home, then failed to check in on him at all over the course of a decade.

**** "Illegally placed" is pure fanon.

We don't even know if there are measures in place in the Wizarding World for any equivalent of child protective services or the like. There may not be any formal procedure for placing a child at all, and just give it to the nearest relatives is the thing that everybody does. That's how muggles handled things a hundred years ago, and it stands to reason that with a smaller population where these things don't come up as often the Wizarding World would still work that way.

We don't actually know if Dumbledore checked on Harry unseen or not. We know he had Mrs. Figg watching him, and we know he had instruments which, at least at a later date, told him something about Harry.

The bulk of Harry's abuse was verbal/emotional, the kind of thing that even today in most cases where CPS are actually involved in, the kids would not be taken from a home for. You wouldn't know he slept in a cupboard unless you were actually there at bedtime.

It's hard for us, today in 2017 to judge what people in the 1990's who are from a society operating on rules from the Middle Ages would consider abuse. Obviously we would consider it abuse today, but had we lived back then, we might not have.

Yes we have to make assumptions about how the wizarding world operates. Rowling didn't do much world building.

If Harry's childhood is not considered abusive, then nothing happens at all. They just tell him to keep a stiff upper lip.

But for the purposes of this post, I'm assuming that the wizarding world /does/ consider the Dursleys abusive.

****** I honestly think they don't. And even if they did, Harry is in the equivalent of the witness protection program, and lots of the ministry had been infiltrated with Death Eaters. Who would you trust with his location, when you don't know who to trust?

Also even if they did, Dumbledore may very well have followed the rules exactly and still ended up with Petunia as the guardian.

Abuse is overlooked by good people all the time. These days we have the internet and all kinds of lists of warning signs to look for. I grew up in the nineties- I'm the same age as Harry, actually, and back then that was not common.

What's actually to see? All verbal/physical abuse took place inside the home, because Petunia and Vernon cared what the neighbors thought. So what Dumbledore would see would be a skinny kid in baggy clothes. Well, plenty of kids are skinny, and baggy clothes were cool around that time- not to mention, wizards on the whole don't seem to understand much about muggle clothing in general.

Basically, as none of Harry's teachers before Hogwarts noticed or reported anything amiss, I think Dumbledore can also be forgiven for not realizing. Whatever causes the wizarding world to recognize the abuse- maybe Harry actually telling everything to Hermione and Ron, who report it?- seems to be something triggered by him going to a boarding school away from the Dursleys.

So yes, I'd still trust Dumbledore to take care of him.
