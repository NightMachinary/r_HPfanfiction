We all know that story you binge-read in one sitting. But what about that story that is so good that you don't want it to end, so you savor every bit super slowly so as to push back the inevitable end, no matter how far it may be?

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** The [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] series. I wait for the beginning of every month. I plan my week around it. No joke

*** I thought the story was unlikely to ever be continued, but just checked and there's a new story... I thank you for enlightening me to the continuation of one of my all time favourite series.

**** Yeah, the latest instalment was started, but the author decided that they didn't like the way it was going so they decided to re-write. Apparently it's all planned out tho now, and it is regularly updating; basically the first/second of every month. It's so good!!! ♥️

*** I'm pretty sure that fic is what sparked my interest in wh40k, as ridiculous as it seems.

Now that I know a lot more about the setting, I'm strangely disappointed that the author used Heathens instead of Heretics.
