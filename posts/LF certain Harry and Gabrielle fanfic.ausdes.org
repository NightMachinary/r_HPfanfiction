I believe the story consisted of a soul bond pairing Harry and Gabrielle together from the Second Task. Bill is dating Fleur in the beginning and Mr. Delacour is a strict, firm man. Harry slowly wins Mr. Delacour over while Bill fails to do so causing him to rage and blame Harry

Bill then leaves and Fleur begins to flirt with Harry with Gabrielle's permission.


** Umm, not sure if this is the one you're looking for. The plot points you asked for are all there but they're more of a subplot and rather separate from the main plot.

***** In the epilogue it is at the very end of Gabrielle's life. She is old and ugly, barely hanging on to her sanity long enough to lay Harry to rest in Merlin's tomb next to his idol. She dies, at peace because she finished her mission to lay him to rest, and 'wakes up' in the afterlife, is given the chance to go to heaven or 'be and do more' and then she undergoes the tests necessary to prove her worth to be by Harry's side in the 'something more' aspect of death, and they are reunited then.

The plot (for those who haven't read) for Hope is that during the second task Gabrielle binds herself to Harry as his mate, only in this fic's case she's rushed off and doesnt tell him until she's 16 (?) and he's 22 (?) at that point she has one year (?) to win him over or else when she reaches maturity she'll go insane. Very early in the story Harry and Gabrielle's friends and family subtly try to throw Harry into a relationship with her, and he figures out something's up.

It's a super enjoyable read, super-powerful harry who is humble, and intelligent take-charge Gabrielle who just wants his love and health.

It's different from what the person asked in that Fleur tests her allure on Harry at a dinner together but he brushes it off and is annoyed by it. It was moreso 'are you good enough for my sister' rather than actually flirting. Bill is also fine in Hope, he never yells or gets angry. He helps Harry understand Gabrielle better at one point, I think.
