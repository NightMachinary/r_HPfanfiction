:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a story where Sirius Black abuses Harry and Dumbledore knows all about it. Harry kills Sirius by blowing Grimmland place up. He gets deaged and is the heir to hogwarts. Bellatrix becomes his caregiver. I read it on archiveofourown.


** You know, I don't think I've ever read a fanfic where Sirius Black was actually a bad guy(beyond being a very shitty person as a teenager, anyway).

I've read one fanfic where apparently he /was/ the bad guy, but that fanfic is ridiculously dedicated to subverting expectations, and I got tired of it before I got to that particular reveal.
