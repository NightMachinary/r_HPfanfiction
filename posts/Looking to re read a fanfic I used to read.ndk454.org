:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fanfic that I read a lot when I needed cheering up and recently I've been needing a bit of cheering up however I can't find it, I ended up looking through every page of my ao3 history and can't find it however there where notes about 2 separate works now being deleted and I fear that it was one of those 2. Now I know some people download fanfics to read them and I do with some of them but sadly not this one, I'm wondering if anyone here might have it downloaded or know where I could find it. I sadly can't remember the name of it nor the authors name however it was in the Harry Potter fandom and was a Sirius/Remus one and it was a texting fic where Sirius texts a wrong number and it ends up being Remus and they talk back and forth and Remus knits socks and sends some to Sirius at some point before they meet up. They also make pancakes on the phone together I'm pretty sure, the author also included photos through out as if Remus and Sirius where actually sending each other photos and it was just very sweet and I miss it. So yeah if anyone knows of the fic and if it is still up and I just missed it or if anyone even knows the name that would help me to look for somewhere to download it at or if you have it downloaded even better, I'm sorry this is long btw.

** Sorry can't help with getting it to you but have you tried searching on Wayback Machine? I've found old deleted fics that way before.
