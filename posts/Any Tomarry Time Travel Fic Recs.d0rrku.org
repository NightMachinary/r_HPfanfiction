I know they're everywhere but I've read a lot of them and im dying for some original ones. Any of them would be appreciated.


** Here are some that I've enjoyed, though these are all works in progress. If you've read a lot of this pairing then you might have already seen some of these.

  When Harry lands himself in 1942 he officially stops caring. Surrounded by witches and wizards that are blissfully ignorant that there's a time-traveler in their midst, Harry resolves to make his own changes, which results in some interesting and unexpected consequences.

  After falling through the Veil at the Department of Mysteries didn't result in Harry immediately dying but being launched back into the past, Harry is stuck trying to navigate the time he knows little about. Not to mention that he's stuck with one Tom Marvolo Riddle aka Lord Voldemort at Hogwarts. Now Harry has to deal with retaking his OWLs and a basilisk on the loose. Harry trying to hide in plain sight his new name gets him in trouble with a Dark Lord obsessed with the Hallows.

  Getting lost in old memories is a dangerous thing for anyone, but in Harry's case the whole situation is slightly more literal than usual, and - as it always tends to be - much, much worse.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

#+begin_quote
  After an accident, Harry wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but Tom Riddle has a habit of making himself Harry's problem.
