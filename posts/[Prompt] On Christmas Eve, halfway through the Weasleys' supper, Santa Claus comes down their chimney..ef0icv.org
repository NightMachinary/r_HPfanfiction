** The flames in the fireplace turned green, and out of it rolled the most peculiar man. His long beard was tucked safely into his belt and his twinkling eyes were covered by spectacles. His round belly was trying to escape the most outrageous robes that Rose has ever seen in her young life. Red and white, with reindeers flying around in it.

"Excuse me, excuse me" said the fat man while making his way to the table.

He sat down and robbed his hands together in anticipation, "Well then, this is the Weasley house, right?" He asked and looked at Rose's grandmother, "I heard the most spectacular things about your cooking, Molly!" on his robe, a red nosed reindeer nodded vigorously.

"Granny!" She exclaimed, "how can you not recognize him? Mum told me all about him! It's Albus Dumbledore!"

"Wha-!?" he utters as he starts spinning up and away. He lands in a pile in the office of the DMLE. Looking up, he sees over a dozen people pointing wands at his face.

"Is... that?" Weakly asks a woman with pink hair.

"Yes, it's him. We need to-" A dark skinned man with a soothing voice rejoined.

"Call the Taxation office. Umbridge has been looking for this guy for YEARS now!" Said a tough-looking grey-haired man.

"Do we have to?" Begged the pink haired woman.

"YOU SHALL NOT HARM HIS SANTY CLAWSYNESS!" shouted a polar elf who popped in front of Santa before popping them away, leaving a towering pile of coal.
