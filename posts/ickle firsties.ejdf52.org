I can't be bothered to check but how many times does this phrase appear in canon but in fan fiction it seems like the characters are incapable of calling them anything but.


** " Wandering around midnight, ickle firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caught."- Peeves in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

To be frank, I was surprised when I came across this phrase in the Philosopher's Stone for I had associated baby-talk in Harry Potter with Bellatrix Lestrange.

*** Good catch, I didn't associate it with him to. Peeves is very overlooked, and because he isn't in the movies people tend to forget about him a bit.

Book 4: 1

Book 5: 4

*** I get the feeling you didn't exclude them by making the text search " ickle" with that space at the start filtering out other words.

Yep, and by a few different people, iirc. Petunia, the twins, Peeves...

** To be fair, when I was in High School in the naughties it was common to call first years ickle firsties.

Should specify, this was a High School in Scotland.

Is that actually how people refer to 2000-2009 in Scotland?

edit: I'm genuinely curious.

**** Not just in Scotland, its one of the common names for the decade. Though I misspelled it by accident. Should be noughties.
