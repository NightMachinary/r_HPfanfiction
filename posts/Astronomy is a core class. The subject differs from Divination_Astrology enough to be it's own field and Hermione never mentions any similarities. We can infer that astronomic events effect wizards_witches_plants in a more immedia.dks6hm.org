#+TITLE: Astronomy is a core class. The subject differs from Divination/Astrology enough to be it's own field and Hermione never mentions any similarities. We can infer that astronomic events effect wizards/witches/plants in a more immediate sense. Why don't we see more of this?

  Professor Sinistra looked around. "Mr. Potter, you're curious, and I think that's admirable. So I believe I'll now tell you why I believe it is that my class is core studies, and not an elective like Muggle Studies or Divination."

  Harry sat down, doing his best to look trustworthy and admirable.

  "Professor Dumbledore likes astronomy, and we have an Astronomy Tower."

  After a long pause, Harry blinked. "That's... it?"

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

*** Oh, this is such a great fic. It's a barrel of laughs and well written too. Still waiting for Dragon!Harry to really curbstomp something though.

** Because there is no canonical connection between magic and the stars outside of werewolves and maybe the odd potion ingredient. The class also seems to be centered around memorisation and the learning/writing star charts. And the only screen time the subject gets is the OWL exam where McGonagall is injured.

I feel like you can do quite a lot with the subject, but not a lot of original concepts as there is little which hasn't already been done to death in other fandoms.

**** It's difficult to come up with something that doesn't feel like you've taken the idea from fandom X. And most authors are not interested because canonically, it is not an important subject but unlike Runes, it is not really possible to make it potent as it would only empower other branches of magic. Astronomy would be a buff, not the ability which wins the day.

**** Well, the /why/ is because you're inferring its use in canon. It's never explicitly stated, outside of the weird centaur stuff, that wizards use astronomy directly.

For instance, it could just be a relic of old-timey 'science'/education. It fits right in with how we imagine reclusive scholars from the medieval times doing - sitting in a tower, looking up through their self-made telescopes, etc. So Wizarding education might have once included it because it was part of a well rounded education back then, and just kept around.

Part of it too is JKR taking inspiration from 'normal' current courses to put in a magical context - potions is similar to chemistry, ancient runes (the canon ones) to learning greek letters, etc. Astronomy is something that a lot of people enjoy, and is included in a lot of science classes - while still feeling a bit exotic/different.

Can it be expanded upon, like how Ancient Runes becomes a much more interesting course on rune magic in the fandom, or arithmancy becomes useful for making spells instead of just math-based divination? Of course. Why don't people do it more? Well, likely because it's not seen to be as interesting. Astronomy based magic, in my mind, would center around rituals/natural magic increasing in potency with the cycle of stellar bodies. That could certainly be interesting - but, for instance, I'd find myself more drawn towards fleshing out runic magic or enchantments before astronomy.

** I think it's a core class because JK didn't really think it through. Just look at the timetables o.O

A more serious possible answer: my head canon.

It's a science class, and more or less the same subject that we would take as a university course. Astronomic events don't effect witches and wizards, because that's divination and not science.

Then there's the relationship to Potions and Herbology... which is just like the relationship between various branches of science. Think chemistry vs biology (botany) vs physics or something similar. The relationship can be measured, and isn't open to interpretation... like divination is.

We learn about jupiter and its moons, and in history we learn about goblin rebellions and flame freezing charms. They're both non-magical subjects - they aren't interesting for kids to read about ad nauseum.

** Since there doesn't seem to be any practical magic involved, I'd guess Astronomy is entirely to do with magical theory; maybe the positions of the planets and stars have certain effects on magic, with some spells being more powerful under certain conditions. The reason with never see it is because, for the most part, it's not important for the minor level of magic they learn in school.

** My best guess would be that the reason it appeared initially in the books is because, while it's a science, it still has something mystical about it. Observing celestial bodies has been around probably seen humankind came along, yet even after all this time we still know very little about what's out there. In addition, it had been used as a means to structure our time, when to undertake certain activities (sow, harvest, rest) and most importantly (for the magical world) to determine when unique cosmic events occur that may or may not be associated with magical events (in many cultures the midsummer is associated with very high magical activity, in many cultures the time of the Halloween is associated with an opening between world of the living and that of the dead, etc).
