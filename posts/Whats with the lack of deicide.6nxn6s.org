We have godlike overpowered Harry but rather than slaying gods like a boss he bows to the man. Why doesn't Harry go full Zelretch on their asses killing gods and pulling pranks. I mean really godlike son of Prongs adopted nephew to Moony and godson of Padfoot not going full Zelretch; I think not.

** there are about 1 million harry potter fanfics web-wide. if you can't find a scenario you want, it is probably not because it doesn't exist, but because you haven't looked hard enough.

*** I know I came across something like this once, but damm if I know where or how to actually search for that fic out of the probably near million HP fanfictions that I have read over the last 10 years. Which is why requests like this are posted.

**** It's actually a discussion thread about why there are so few fics where Harry pulls a Kratos/Zelretch/Barry Allen. I've already posted a millions requests for badass!Harry who is Badass!Harry rather than Bitch!Harry; this is a discussion on why there are no Badass!Badass!Harry fics

** Considering how Fate likes to screw with HP, it certainly seems plausible that a godlike and pissed HP might decide to pull a Kratos....
