I would like to recommend this Self Insert by *Iroraz* into HP-universe as Lunas sister in Harrys year, who is a Werewolf.

/Jumpchains/ are SI fics where the SI '/jumps/' to different universes to gain power through Jump documents. The HP-jump is complete already, so you can enjoy a 'complete' story.

Which means that the setting for this story is 'survive 10 years in Harry Potter Universe and then continue to the next universe' which tends to lead to non-complex stories like this one.
