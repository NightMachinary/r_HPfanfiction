If you've seen Zettai Karen no Children: The Unlimited, you know Hyoubu Kyousuke is a complete badass.

Are there any fics where Harry is a badass esper like Kyousuke?


** I only know 'esper' from Simon Green's Deathstalker books, myself.

Although it's funny, espers in the Deathstalker series are humans with psychic abilities, who hide away as an underground community to avoid their extermination at the hands of a corrupt empire.

In the second half of the series once the evil empress has been overthrown, they're accepted as free citizens, but some 'elves' (Esper Liberation Force) are trying to take over the empire, seeing esper-kind as superior, and eventually end up using mass mind control to nearly take over humanity's home planet.

Perhaps Deathstalker and Harry Potter could withstand a crossover. There is a point (involving time travel) in one of the Shaman Bond novels where Molly Metcalf ends up mistaken for an esper (psychic) when she's really a witch (magic).

** I only know the word 'esper' from Alfred Bester's excellent /The Demolished Man/. Is what you're thinking of anything like that?

*** I'd say probably not exactly; a quick search engine visit gave me that the espers in the book are more about what one would call “telepathy”, whereas the ones in that other series are about that /and/ what one would call “telekinesis” plus an assortment of tangentially related abilities controlled with one's mind.

** Whoa I got really confused and thought that somehow I was still on the Magic the Gathering Subreddit. Unfortunately, that's the only place I've heard the esper term before

  What if Harry had been taken to Japan by his paranoid relatives, afraid that he'd blow up their house while they are away? What if he had answered a shady questionnaire? What if he became a Drifter? Rater M for crude language, some violence, and overall, just to be safe.
