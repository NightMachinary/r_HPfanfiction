I've recently read linkffn(the mountains of the moon) and I liked the concept of it. Unfortunately the author decided not to continue the story. Is there a fic that explores the same concept? Doesn't have to have the same pairing.

  "The Ministry must be seen to do something", and with that, Harry Potter's wand is snapped. Expelled in his second year, he is invited to a new school famous for being the home of one of the Eight Great Repositories of Knowledge. But with Voldemort alive and the Chamber of Secrets still open, he will need every resource his new school possesses to stay alive in the coming years.
