Hey all!

I've been looking for this pic, where the main paring is Lucius, Draco, and Hermione. Basically the war ended and Dumbledore gave Hermione a marriage contract that as soon as she touches it, it becomes true. Now, old houses like that of Malfoy have old magic and it's pretty common to have polyamorous relationships because if that.

I remember that originally Lucius was married with Narcissa and his father abraxas, and ir wasn't a good relationship. In truth Lucius was dracos half brother because of that.

I also remember some intense Ron bashing, and him being the reason why the weasleys never offered for Hermione.

So, if anyone can help me I would be very thankful.

If you have any questions or want further details please let me know!

Casting the Stake was inspired by the Bespoke Witch where she chooses the Weasley family instead. It also has Ron bashing. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11357806/1/Casting-the-Stake]]
