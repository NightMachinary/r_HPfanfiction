Her wand wood is a slighly fascinating detail. It is supposed to be willow (same as Ron's second wand that he gets in third book)

#+begin_quote
  According to Garrick Ollivander: "Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and Garrick Ollivander noted that the ideal owner for a willow wand often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity, however well they may try and hide it.

  While many confident customers insist on trying a willow wand (attracted by their handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic) my willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn. It has always been a proverb in my family that he who has furthest to travel will go fastest with willow."

Now, Lily is mostly an unexplored character, and while the characteristics of healing and high potential are certainly applicable to her, what intrigues me is the line about insecurity. What could she be insecure about? Her Muggle heritage?

edit: wrote unexplored as unexploded.

*** I was about to say the same thing.

And this is before she went to Diagon Alley and before Hogwarts. She was already worried, even though the only magical person she knew was Snape.

I gotta believe by age 11, this insecurity would have been more prominent.

** Yup, Lily does seem to have parallels with Ron. Her Muggle heritage would be one insecurity, although how it could be as crippling as Ron's, I don't know. We have to remember there was a war going on as well, where people like her were actively discriminated against. I guess in a world where you grow up reading books such as the Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, you'll worry about being a reject. So Lily might've ventured into this world feeling like she was blind, which is emphasised when she asked Severus if it 'made a difference - being Muggleborn'. To which he said no. I imagine after he called her mudblood that insecurity would've made a comeback, which would fuel her desire to fight for the Order and join it when extremely young.

I guess her insecurity would be never fitting into the Muggle world, nor the Wizarding one; she doesn't have the essential Muggle education and the normal childhood experience in Cokeworth, so it would've distanced her, somewhat. She's also an oddity in the Muggle world, and akin to an immigrant in the wizarding world. Rowling calls her popular, so she could've actively sought out acceptance, but still felt that even with so much popularity, she couldn't quite fit in, like Hermione doesn't, for one. It's also worth remembering that some people are just...inherently insecure, even if they have everything in the world, which could cripple their potential. Although how being popular in a time where the war was in full swing could've worked, is a bit counterintuitive. Maybe her insecurity could lead to envy, and you can turn it into her 'deadly sin'. You know, what with her green eyes and all, there can very well be some underlying symbolism.

** First just a quick laugh. I am quite glad that "Lily is mostly an unexploded character". Sorry, but reading that made me giggle a bit.

â€‹

Onto the serious bit about what Lily could be insecure about, honestly with the way Petunia treats Harry and the flashbacks we do get in canon, I feel somewhat confident that Lily was insecure about magic itself. She was in school during the height of Lord Voldemort's power, wasn't she? Muggleborn discrimination must have been rampant throughout, plus we get Petunia calling Lily a freak going to a school of freaks? I might be an only child, but even I think your sibling calling you a freak must have hurt.

*** You know, that's a very good point that I haven't considered before. As an only child I was probably underestimating the influence that a sibling can have on you, especially one that (in Lily's case) she apparently looked up to and was quite close with as a child.

She probably felt out of place no matter where she went - whether in the muggle world or in the magical world, no matter how much she was adored by her parents or welcomed by the non-discriminatory side of Hogwarts. She was just sociable and good at covering that insecurity up with an outgoing personality.

In that sense her and Snape's predicament, especially as children, are quite similar. No wonder she stuck with him for so long, even though his attitude towards muggleborns would have only gotten worse with time.

** She stayed friends with Snape even after he joined in with bigots that want people like her dead. And she complained about it, he turned it back around. It all feels pretty toxic and you need to have some insecurities to stay in such a friendship

*** I think she was pretty sure of herself at the point, sure enough to underestimate the influence of that group on her old friends. Personally if my friend began to see problematic people I would be worried but I wouldn't turn the back to him after so many years of friendship right away (especially if those people were people he see normally in class anyway, it's easy to think it is not serious).

Also, the entire 'killing mudbloods' wasn't a thing at that point, and not before than 5 years after that scene, Sirius said so much in book 4.

When Lily was 15 years old she was popular with a lot of friends, that was important, Rowling said. At that point, Snape was the one feeling insecure and running to the 'important' gang to seize up a bit of power.
