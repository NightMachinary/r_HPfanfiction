I'm looking for Fics, if there's any about, where instead of the Weasleys using a love potion on Harry, Harry uses a love potion on Ginny.


** Not sure anyone would think of writing a fic where Harry would need to feed her a love potion. Not as if she was head over heels haha.

But good luck in your search mate :)

***** I would read it. I would feel like a horrible person afterwards, but when people churn out dozens of fics which claim that they have Evil!Harry and it is really just him being angsty and torturing animals, I feel cheated. There is a definite lack of legitimately babyeating level evil Harry, and I think that should be remedied.

**** There was a fic where Neville was the BWL and Ginny was obsessed with him before she got to school, but as soon as she met him and started dating him (due to a betrothal or something because sure) realized he was an awful person.

It would be an interesting question to explore: was Ginny winding up with Harry mainly a result of her having the initial crush on the BWL? Or would the two of them got together regardless?

***** Ginny might have a crush on the BWL first, but it would be shattered relatively quickly given BWL's less than stellar behaviors. Eventually she found out that Harry was the true hero and...

The reason why Ginny was embarrassing herself for so long in front of Harry was because canon Harry confirmed or even exceeded her expectations.

***** Because I ship the pairing, (and of course, you're free to do it differently if you ship someone else) I would always write it as in canon, in which Ginny has a crush on the BWL and eventually falls in love with Harry Potter, no matter who the BWL is in the scenario.

** A fascinating request, are there any other role-reversal fics you were looking for?

Like, a young Tom Riddle who shares his soul with his friends to fight The Raja Pyre Storm, who sacrificed his own mother for power?

Or Ron Weasley the gifted academic tutoring a young muggleborn girl who's more interested in lazing around and chess than studying?

Or Dolores Umbridge going undercover at Hogwarts to investigate Harry Potter and prove Voldemort's return in the face of a power-hungry Albus Dumbledore?

Okay, I'm done. For now. I'll let you know if I see anything where Harry doses Ginny.

** Hpfanficarchive. You'll find a lot of twisted sick stories involving Harry using love potions to enslave witches there. Most of them I hate. Most of them I think should be erased from existence and their twisted writers placed on some watchlist. But if you are into that sick stuff, you can find it there.

*** Jesus, I keep seeing you pop up being butthurt about a lot of shit. I don't understand people like you. You don't like reading about rape? Fine don't read it, doesn't mean it shouldn't be written about. Writing is a way people can explore ideas and consequences. Just because someone writes or reads about rape doesn't mean they're a rapist. You can write about murder or self-harm or drug abuse without advocating any of those things. They are dark subjects that make people uncomfortable but that doesn't mean we should just sweep it under a rug and pretend it isn't there because it's distasteful.

Should we all go out and burn books like Lolita or ban movies like Deliverance? No because that's censorship and it's wrong. Should my mother be put on a watchlist because she likes watching Law and Order:SVU marathons even though they largely deal with rape, even of minors sometimes? No because that's ridiculous. Get a grip.

Its sarcasm. There was a post a few days ago about UndeadBBQ happily telling people that writers should be placed on watchlists if they write controversial topics and getting over 100 upvotes. I figured since this sub keeps thinking that its the connoisseur of all things fanfiction, I'd go around spitting some bullshit about how everyone should be censored and get some upvotes off of the idiots that don't understand overexaggerated sarcasm when they see it.

Clear enough for you?
