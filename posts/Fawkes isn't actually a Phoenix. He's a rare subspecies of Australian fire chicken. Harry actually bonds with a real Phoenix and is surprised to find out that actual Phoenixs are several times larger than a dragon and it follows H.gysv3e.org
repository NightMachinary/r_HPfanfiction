"Ohhh! A unicorn!" Girls swooned as they spotted a bright white unicorn.

"Careful 'ere, students." Hagrid said in a deep voice. "You see that one black hair on the tail?"

"Oh that's so pretty."

"That just makes it even better!"

"I know, right!"

"Tha' unicorn is from Australia." Hagrid finished his introduction.

A silence felt over the group and the girls who had decided to step a bit closer instantly drew back in fear.

"Ha.. Haa.. Hagrid!" One of the students whispered fearfully. "Don't go near it. You don't know how it'll kill you!"

"Ohh. Don't fret students!" Hagrid said jovially. "I'm from Australia too!"

** Last night I dreamed about about the American Thunderbird and as I petted it I marveled at its size. I woke up wanting to look it up because I had the thought that the Thunderbird and Phoenix were similar but in Fantastic Beasts Newt's friend was huge compared to Fawkes.

I decide to look at my Reddit messages and found this post. A dragon sized magical bird? After that dream I don't feel I have a choice but to add this prompt to my to do list. Warning: a thunderbird and Snape will make an appearance.

** How about Dumbledore knows that Fawkes is an Australian fire chicken and has done everything in his power, including taking books about real Phoenixes out of Hogwarts. With him teaching enough of the British Wizarding World about "Phoenixes" using Fawkes as an example that the new books printed in Britain use Fawkes as a reference and the old books are thought to be wrong.

Dumbledore perpetuated the lie that Fawkes is a Phoenix because an Australian Fire Chicken is a magical cross between a minka and a mulduwanke. The Minka is a bird, that featured in the stories of the Ngarrindjeri people of the Murray River in South Australia. The minka were believed to foretell death. The mulduwanke is a similar bird of the Ngarrindjeri, but instead of foretelling death it stole children. Both were believed to live in dark recesses. When an Australian Fire Chicken bonds with a magical person it is foretelling they are an extremely evil person who will steal magic from children. Also there is no way that the human can break the bond. So Dumbledore casts a very strong glamour that changes the looks of Fawkes and to mimic the burning days. He also casts a audio equivalent of a glamour to hide Fawkes cries. Also a male Australian Fire Chicken aka an Australian Fire Rooster is what can kill a basilisk, not a domestic rooster.

Harry bonds with the real phoenix sometime before he fights the basilisk and his phoenix is the one who heals him or bonds with him because of or during healing him. Or Fawkes kills the basilisk before it bites Harry.

Also the brother wands with phoenix feathers Tom's wand does use one of Fawkes's feathers but Harry's wand uses one of his real phoenix's feathers and either Garrick Ollivander was spelled to believe they were from the same bird in some way or spelled to say they were.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** there is actually a species of phoenix like bird in Persian/middle eastern mythology called Anqa(also called Simurgh in some stories.) and it is said to be large enough to carry full grown elephants to its nest in its talons.

In classic myths, Anqas are said to live in Khaf mountains but Some porteguese explorers that have visited madagascar are also known to give similar accounts of giant elephant eating birds(there was a giant species of eagle that ate elephant birds tjat lived in madagascar at that time.) Location of Khaf mountains change from story to story; some children tales give contradictary locations like south arabia or norther iran, but in medieval middle eastern mythology, khaf mountains are usualy depicted as a circular mountain range made out of emerald and jade stones that circle the world and prevent its oceans from flowing out.

Many other mythological creatures are said to live in khaf mountains such as Devs(persian word for giant.), PÃ¢ris(persian word for fairy), as well as manticores and djinns.
