*《Her name is Delphini Riddle, the Augury. The Resistance has sent an agent to the past after a brutal last stand against the Empire's forces. Their leader abandoning them to die in their compound as she and her superior: The Right Hand of the Dark Lord, descended on them for their final assault.》*

That should have been it. Breaking the back of the Order of the Phoenix and showing that even Dumbledore's trusted successors held no power or sway over their regime would he enough to deter the Resistance as a whole and truly cement her father's (and the Death Eaters) grip on the world.

*/But this... this was too much./*

Their leader was arrogant, as much of a chess master as the history books purported Dumbledore to be. She left strategy to her husband, she brought in all manner of beast and unknown plants from the last of the Lovegood's and the deadly Neville Longbottom. That day, they (and so many others) fell to either her wand or that of her superior officer and his men. An ease the likes of which even her father would struggle with present with every swish and jab of the Holly wood wand he wielded.

Everyone but ^{her,} as Weasley so smugly revealed at the end. Not realising the lengths they were willing to go to ensure her failure until HE pointed out that they wouldn't have been able to hunt her down if he had kept his mouth shut....

Her dear superior had reported to the Dark Lord the situation. Having already requisitioned the appropriate Time Turners and personnel to send to the past.

A mission, against his judgement, SHE was put in charge of.

Though the one they called Voldemort was there in the distance keeping a watchful eye in his progeny, it was her proud but teary-eyed mother and the man she despised (the man who held the Dark Lord's complete faith and trust) who her off on her trip to the past. Her superior. Her godfather. Her friend.

/The man who'd taught her everything she knew. Who'd loved her in place of family and friends. Who'd trusted her above all others. The general who'd taught her war and the father who'd taught her how to live beyond it./

Delphi had no way of knowing the depths of Hermione Granger's plan here in the past, but she WOULD ensure that her godfather would be safe to grow strong and complete his destiny. Allow him to grow into his strength, to aide her father and grow into the man who slayed Dumbledore and marched upon the world when, her father was too wary...

So, in 1991, she first squared off against the elder Hermione Granger on the hidden Platform 9 ¾. Stood between the vehement, stunned witch and the equally confused and terrified Harry James Potter.

In 1991, she began her task of moulding her would be godfather into the man who conquered the world...
