Getting sorted in Slytherin is the opposite of cunning, everyone is instantly suspicious of you.

If you were extremely cunning you would ask the hat to sort you into Gryffindor, befriend Harry and betray him at the perfect moment.

Because I like happy endings I suppose Draco eventually stops pretending to be a good guy and legitimately turns to the light.


** Growing up black

Tho i dont think there is any betrayal

** The only Draco in Gryffindor story I know is 'a Slytherin in Gryffindor clothing', and it doesn't entirely fit your premise. Draco is transported to an AU where Lucius defeated Voldemorte, Draco is in Gryffindor, and Harry is a Slytherin.

** I might be late, but linkffn(Time To Spare by EmySabath) is a good Draco in Gryffindor/light!Draco fic, although it's a time travel and very AU.

It's a good Harry Draco as friends fic too.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
