So, you know when you walk into a dangerous situation that hasn't quite become dangerous yet and you get that feeling just under your heart where you know that you shouldn't be there and that the smart thing to do would be to run like hell in the opposite direction? Are there any fics that capture that vibe?

Can be places, situations, etc. Just anything where characters walk over and realise they really need to get the fuck out already.

The ones I know thus far are Wastelands of Time, that one where Harry and Dumbledore climb down the magic stairs, and that one where there's an underground city of Undead that Harry seems to get along quite well with. I can't remember either of the latter two's names, but I'm fairly certain I have them bookmarked somewhere.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** linkffn(To Play the Devil by The Wayland Smith) has quite a bit of that with the Extremely Spooky Forest, and is generally frickin' awesome.

If "getting along quite well" is sarcastic and involves buckshot, I believe you're thinking of linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure). It's old and it's pretty great. It was also one of the early examples of a characterization of Luna that some sneer at today. "OH JOHN RINGO NO!" readers should stay away, but "OH JOHN RINGO YES!" people will probably love it.

  Part 1 of 'The Wandering Devil'. Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. Harry and Voldemort took oaths to end their long and bloody war. Over a century later, a convoluted plot forces the two (slightly out of practice) immortals into an adventure together.

** In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by bking4) there's a point where there's a real oh-no-don't-continue-this-will-not-end-well. Dumbledore has this realization but it's too late. It's fun and tiny bit creepy, all though it seems quite normal at first.

The entirety of linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] by TheDivineComedian) has an intense feeling of wrongness, with everything being /just/ off. It's more of a slow realization of how not right the situation is.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18456680][Styx]] by TheDivineComedian) is all oh-hell-get-out-of-that-fucking-house.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) is quite dark and there are some pretty uncomfortable moments where the entire vibe is jesus-tom-get-out-of-there. There's some points where Riddle realizes he needs to get out /now/, but it's always too late.

The summaries and first chapters of the rest look interesting! I've added them to the to-read list, so thanks for the recs!

Also, I love that the summary of Diablerie answer to 'what year is it' is 'september' first and the year second. Nice contrary detail there. :D

He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** i've read Wastelands of Time, but honestly the first fic that popped into my is from another fandom entirely: Fallout 3: Aqua Vitae By commandocucumber, which is obviously part of a series of stories that's a novelization of Fallout 3. including a section where a Brotherhood of Steel group journeys to Point Lookout. where they encounter problems with Ug-Qualtoth (think Cthulu) and it's followers. it's honestly pretty damn creepy. and pretty much a straight up horror novel.

**** and i actually misspoke. it's actually set after the events of FO3. and when the Lone Wanderer (an established badass at this point)) hears that they sent an expedition to Point Look Out, he freaks the fuck out because he's been there, and refuses to ever go back.

of the expedition sent there, three survive, with one of those three staying behind to distract the creature while the other two flee. and they only survived due to help from Obadiah Blackhall, who the LW makes a deal with in order to ensure their safe return. he returns the book he stole while on the island. he'd planned on destroying it, but after getting it, he was so traumatized and scared he just wanted to get the hell off the island and never come back.

the series also ties into the other fallout games in the main series, including appearances from the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, and making the Legion a much bigger threat than in the games, with Sallow just being the "Western" Emperor, and the "Eastern" one being very much into advanced technology, though i won't go into any more detail than that to avoid spoilers.

overall, while the story isn't quite on the level of New California Dreaming by Hotpoint; the basics of which is a current NCR Ranger, former 1st Recon soldier, is sent on a long term, long distance recon mission to find out what the hell the brotherhood is doing on the east coast. said Ranger is a relative of the Chosen One. named Cassidy (after the FO2 Character) Nagor (his uncle) Coyle. he arrives in the capital wasteland shortly before the events of FO3; at least Commando Cucumber's series isn't abandoned like Hotpoint's is.

****** no problem. Commando Cucumber is still one of my three favorite Fallout authors, along with Hotpoint and Deathhamsters (who did a novelization of Fallout 1).

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back.

Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

*** Oh, I have. Exquisite fic that life doesn't give us enough opportunities to rec, as I believe we've discussed before? I can't remember though - I'm terribly bad at remembering usernames and I apologise to you and whomever else it might be if it is not in fact you. :)
