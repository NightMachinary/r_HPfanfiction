I want fics where he's heir to every important family in the world. He has billions of galleons, uses magic no one's seen since the dawn of time. He's master of everything because he's so great and yet can't seem to resolve the plot quickly. Basically I want Gary Stu Harry. Bonus points if it's also a bashing fic.

Slash, Dark!harry and crossovers are fine. Please no genderbending, pottercest, romance/smut-centric plots or mpreg. I'd prefer no harems but that usually goes hand in hand with GS Harry. Thank you!


** linkffn(8670912) this has harry who is has a six pack at 11 because he trains all day and already mastered a bunch of fighting style from an old asian man who lives near him. he also is super smart and remembers everything since he is a baby and already had control over his magic as a baby. he also has a huge magical core that amplifies his body even more. he masters every kind of magic really quickly. and gets multiple animagus forms later on, one even magical. The potters are also founders of the ministry so he is one of the richest persons alive. In the sequels he gets even more overpowered. of course he also starts getting a harem(but doesn't have on yet). Its also a story I am embaressed to have fully read.

***** I admit that I enjoy it a lot when Harry becomes powerful, but 6 pack, ninja training, military training, sniper, dojo bullshit, I hate all that shit. In fact it's much more fun when even after he becomes magically powerful he and Voldemort are wheezing like a couple of grandpas running a marathon barely managing to throw a disarming jinx at each other after both running a very short distance to find each other but both pretending to not be tired to each other. Characters aren't people in stories unless they have weaknesses. I reiterate: I really enjoy ludicrously powerful Harry, but only after fumbling and many trials and tribulations and discoveries. Even then, he must not be good at everything. Just magic. Maybe even just some fields of magic.\\
Recently I've been thinking about writing a new story in which Harry is born magically powerful and will grow even more powerful, but overabundance of power is detrimental and extremely difficult to learn to handle because all magical education caters to the average witch and wizard. For example he constantly uses accidental magic without meaning to, like magic is almost leaking out of him. He keeps having to get a new wand because they tend to explode, much to the annoyance of McGonagall and especially Ollivander. All his spells are ridiculously overpowered and for Harry to cast a simple levitation spell he feels like he has to hold back a stormy river with his hands. Maybe all the students lift up into the air when he first tries etc. Maybe his overpowered-ness a problem he has to overcome. Maybe Dumbledore shares stories with him about how he also had similar problems when he was his age and how he had to find a special wand that actually limits his power a lot in order for him to use spells normally. How he has to hold himself back magically and play a sort of grandfatherly figure in order for people not to be afraid of him. How Voldemort maybe had similar problems but didn't want to have to hold himself back in the face of fear from others etc.\\
In other words, some cliches are fun. The problem is the execution. By the way, what do you think of my idea for a story? Overpower as a sort of handicap?

****** honestly this story sounds like it could be very good and intersting and I agree that a powerful character needs his limits. But there is a stigma associated with magical cores that would turn a lot of people away.

You could easily change the cause by looking at canon.we know in canon the power of magic is usually associated with inteligence and being studious.

Like Voldemort and Dumbledore being very outstanding students, Lily, James, Snape and Sirius were excellent student, Ron, hermione and Harry being all pretty good and in Hermiones case extremely good student.

Like you see the pattern. Maybe you could simply have Harrys Horcrux causing Harrys magic to behave like that of a fully developed and trained Voldemort with the control of a small child. He would basically be In a situation never seen before because usually nobody becomes powerful without learning to control that power at the same time.

******* I also despise the implementation of the "magical core" concept. It always makes me think that the people in the stories are submarines or star-ships or a mere stats on a character sheet. "Core power is at 103% and rising captain. If it gets any higher, it's gonna blow!"

I do however like to separate magical power and knowledge of how to apply and control that power. That doesn't mean I'll have to acknowledge or mention the detestable "magical core" nonsense.

Show don't tell. Maybe there's a test to lift a magically heavy rock as high as you can attached to a chain into the ground to help the teachers and students roughly determine your raw magical strength or something. Anything is better that Dumbledore or McGonagall using a spell on Harry and saying something stupid like "Gosh! I've never seen a magical core with such powah!" etc. Better to show power in the story as relative to other characters.\\
Regarding the horcrux. I don't want it to be the source of Harry's overpoweredness. I want it to be him. The horcrux can cause problems or be an obstacle or something, but I want all that Harry gets to become to be because he's born with a lot of power and because he learns to work hard to harness it and the help he gets from his friends as well, but until he learns that control and to accept help his huge power is a problem for him and the people around him.

Another idea I've been playing with the idea that Lily was a member of a witch cult that specialized in breeding for power, much like the Bene Gesserit from the Dune series and that Harry is a culmination of their experiments.

I also want to explore wand lore a bit more but I don't want to overwhelm the story with too many ideas too fast. Right now I'm just experimenting a bit.

Anyway; I know I come across like a sour grumpy old ass and that's because I am, but I'm thankful for your comment.

** linkffn(Core Threads) has the most ridiculously OP Harry in all of fanfiction ever, and while light-hearted and often humorous, I wouldn't say it's /crack/. (And it's quite a good story.)

** Well, one of the most powerful incarnations of Harry is the one in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][R trilogy]]. Not money or politics-wise, but magically, he's just at another level. *Warning, heavy spoilers for all three stories.*

By the end of the last story, Harry has amassed a varied array of skills and abilities. One of these is the ability to consciously and directly manipulate dark magic. Applications include:

- Dispelling all kinds of curses from people and/or objects

- 'Squelching' curses as they generate in a wand, leading to explosive results (for the casters). He kills a few dark wizards with this method.

- Curing werewolves.

- Curing people tortured into insanity with the cruciatus - he cures Neville's parents, but there's not much there, even after that.

The dark magic manipulation thing is explained in the second story as Harry being a /foci of the planes/. Essentially, he can access a parallel dimension filled with mindless demons. This leads to:

- Being able to summon and, in a limited way, control those demons. He sicks them into Malfoy Manor once, where they devour a couple dozen Death Eaters.

- Because Harry can enter and exit the dark plane at will and apparate within it, he can essentially enter any place, any time. Hogwarts, the Ministry, Azkaban, Gringotts, have all been broken into by the end of the series.

- At some point during the second book. Harry discovers that he can travel to alternate dimensions through the dark plane. This leads to a whole host of new problems, as you can imagine.

Apart from all that, Harry is a decent Occlumens and Legilimens, a Gryffilys animagus (like a gryffon or something) and he can learn new spells extremely quickly. And he can communicate with dementors.

Also the dark magic manipulation thing is at some point revealed to be the ability to manipulate a human's "potential to do evil". Which we are later informed through subtext is really an ability to manipulate human souls directly. Harry uses it to heal the damage the dark arts have inflicted on Snape's soul. And I imagine he could use is to horribly mutilate someone's soul and turn him into a drooling vegetable/dementor hybrid. But he doesn't. Because Harry is a good guy.

Oh and Harry is the only one who can read Rowena's book.

** Linkffn(Legends of Potter)

This was the first fic I ever read. It's not crack, and fits the rest of your description of Harry being ridiculously overpowered and wealthy and yet it takes a sequel (Potter of Legends) to finally take out Voldemort.

That being said, the writing in this one isn't great. It reads like a high school freshman wrote it, and it has a lot of fanon cliches, but since it was the first fic I ever read I was able to appreciate it for what it was.
