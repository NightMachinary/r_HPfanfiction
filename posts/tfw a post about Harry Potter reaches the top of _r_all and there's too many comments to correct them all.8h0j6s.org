** I thought it was actually quite funny. There was one comment that said the first line of the first book foreshadowed the whole series: "Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived" which is what Harry does throughout.

And someone also said the centaurs got angry at Firenze for saving Harry from Voldemort in book one because they foresaw that Harry must be killed by Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest which did happen, just seven books later. I hadn't noticed that before.

** I mean I personally agree with them hence more than a few of my stories. It's a long standing debate in the fandom.

*** I was talking about the comments, not the ShowerThought itself.

To clarify, I welcome the debate. But the comments are, like... Hooo, boy.

**** Worrying about correcting people on the internet is like worrying about penguins freezing to death: sure, a few might die of it, but they're far away and most of them will be fine.
