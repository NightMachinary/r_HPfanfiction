"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned", but a witch scorned would be even worse. I know it's completely out of character for her, but I really want to see fics where Ginny gets dumped by Harry, and then responds by going completely off the deep end against his new girlfriend (Hermione, Cho, Fleur, Daphne, an OC, even dear sweet Luna - whomever you like).

**** This fic starts out interesting, gets weird, gets /uncomfortably surreal/, and by the point you're really just hanging in there because you're in too deep to quit before seeing how it ends, it [[/spoiler][sidelines you by becoming an unannounced Star Wars crossover and ends on a cliffhanger]].

It has a sequel that feels bizarrely disconnected from the original story while also being inexplicable if you haven't read the first one.

***** Thanks for the heads up! I've seen this recommended before for other topics, and I will admit I'm interested in seeing /HP/ with a sci-fi twist.

Although you know what might be even more interesting? A /HP/ / /Dune/ crossover. I'm interested to see how the two "Chosen Ones" of Harry Potter and Paul Atreides would interact if they met.

****** That would be really interesting! I generally love crossovers, just not when they come completely out of left field. As for HP with a sci-fi twist, that's absolutely what I went into this fic expecting, and the first few chapters didn't disappoint. The beginning was genuinely compelling and had a fascinating concept of magic/sci-fi mechanics, but IMO it went off the rails after that. I'd love to see more of what this fic started out being.

"Do Not Meddle In The Affaires Of Wizards" is a bash-em-all revenge fic in which Ginny is deluded and rather nuts.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.
