There are actually two sides to this prompt and the first one is told specifically from Draco's point of view. The war is over and the story begins with something like an awards ceremony with Harry and others receiving the Order of Merlin. To both Draco and the reader's surprise he is called upon to receive one as well.

Apparently he did something to redeem himself during the war and from the comments that other people are making it's clear that he had a hand in saving a lot of lives. But we don't learn any of the specifics because from Draco's POV he can only dwell on the bad things he did as a Death Eater and can't understand how people can possibly forgive him. Even stepping up to receive the award he keeps expecting Aurors to jump out and arrest him, that the whole thing must be a setup to capture the last Death Eater even though rationally he hasn't been running and has been with supportive Order members ever since the war ended.

--------------

The other side of this prompt (which could use the same opening) is that Draco really is a fraud, or at least not what people think he is. Here we find out what really happened in the war. When the trio was captured and Hermione was tortured Draco just couldn't take the screams and so without thinking he stunned his aunt. Having just doomed himself with one little mistake he had no choice but to escape with Hermione and her friends and so he never gets into a duel with Harry.

Later, after Harry 'dies' in the forest and Voldemort makes his speech about allowing anyone who kneels to be spared, he makes an exception by calling out the 'traitor' Draco and attacks him intending to make an example for anyone who is still thinking of resisting. Draco fights for his life but to his own shock and amazement he finds himself actually overpowering and killing the most feared wizard in Britain (thanks the fact that the Voldemort is using the Elder Wand without knowing that it's loyal to Draco).

In the aftermath Draco is hailed as a hero, the man who stood up to Voldemort, and because of this his mother's actions are interpreted by the masses as being part of a coordinated effort by the Malfoy family. Draco knows he's a fraud and tries to hide from the hero worship he receives since the higher he goes the further he knows he'll fall once the truth is exposed.

However the trio are the only ones with enough information to do that. They (or just Hermione) confront Draco but quickly assure him that they don't want to expose him. Rather they want to help him embrace his celebrity for the common good. Apparently Draco has unwittingly become a role model for other young blood purists who are starting to genuinely renounce the old ways and pressuring their parents into allowing real reforms and an end to bigotry.

And so by agreeing to live a lie Draco can become a real hero of sorts.
