What are your favorite/least favorite tropes? For me it has to he one of the couples forgets to put up a silencing charm before "bedtime" their friends tease them the next morning.

Least favorite would have to be some combination of molly/Ron/ ginny using love potions on harry and/or hermione for whatever reason. Be it get their hands on the potter wealth, to force the big happy weasley family or what have you.


** Favorite: Harry becoming smarter and more skilled due to hard work, without him being overpowered or turned into a Gary Stu.

Least Favorites: Lord Potter, evil Dumbledore/Ron/whoever

** Honestly, I like a well written manipulative Dumbledore. Not necessarily bashing, just fleshing out a character who had to be a little manipulative for the common good.

My least favorite is probably evil Molly Weasley. She's not my favorite character, and I don't agree with her a lot of the time. I still can't see her being a woman who pushes her kids towards Harry just for his money.

** Least favorite: Weasley and/or Dumbledore bashing. I don't even read Harry/Ginny stories (unless it's a side pairing) because for fanfiction purposes I don't find it interesting but none of the Weasleys deserve that. And the evil!Gryffindor/good!Slytherin reversal. Like, why can't both houses be a little of both? Idk, it's a bit of a lazy trope. I also skip soulmates/soul bond and polyamory fics but that's not exclusive to HP.

Favs: Eighth year, Harry decides to do something else besides being an auror. Ron being an awesome best friend.

After that, he's going to buy the Prophet's paper and ink suppliers. He makes Moody editor.

** Hate: Parings that have no weight or have nothing to do with the plot of the story but its sure advertised in the summery and tagged so if your desperately searching for it you get excited only to read for 8 hours to find out the pairing tag was just because they have one conversation that one time in chapter 58.

Hate: 3 page fall in love for no reason love stories. I don't even like pre-book relationships. Like if your story is about nev/ginny then you better show they are in love, maybe tell how they fell in love, hopefully it has something to do with your story and its not just, Oh Nev how did I never know you were so hot, lets get married.

Hate: 1 date in hogsmeade = relationship courting. like damn maybe they just wanted to have a butterbeer it doesn't mean when you walk back to the castle one of you has a relationship betrothal that makes zero seance all ready filled out.

Hate: How no one can change their mind. Like Cho when she wished with everything that she would have gone to the yule ball with harry but then doesn't back out of her date and it is a auto disaster. Like oh my god I wished you would have asked me, I've pinned on you for 5 years but i cant' love you because this side character asked me to go with him and now im locked into a relationship with him with no way out.

** Favourite - Harry gets his head out of his arse in OotP or HBP and actually prepares for Voldemort. Dumbledore helps him on the path instead of being a Greater Good obsessed dimwit.

Least Favourite - Snape/Malfoy justification. Snape is an arsehole. Plain and simple. All that bullshit about regretting calling Lily a mudblood and he calls Hermione a mudblood in Deathly Hallows (in his memories while talking to Dumbledore's portrait). Malfoy is a coward whose only concern his is own pitiable self. Snape didn't fight for the right reasons, and Malfoy didn't give a shit about right and wrong - only himself. Fics with DHr, DMHP, SSHP, SSHG are absolute balderdash.

When Voldemort is killed by muggle means and the rest of the WW seems like a band of idiots too.

** I don't think I have a most or least favourite. Every time I think I do, a fic comes along that proves me wrong. Oh, I hate Potions Ginny and Molly, cue Faery Heroes; Oh, I hate WBWL, cue Three Black Birds; Oh, I hate Dumbledore bashing, cue His Angel. Oh, I love time travel, cue... half the time travel fics in the fandom. :D

It's not about the trope, it's all about how you use it. A good writer can make any trope work.

That said, I've not yet found a bad 'Gloriously Camp and Gloriously Evil Villain' fic yet. And I've not really been able to get around the Nazi-Victim tone of a Lily-Snape/Muggleborn-Deatheater pairing enough to find a good one of those yet. So, I suppose those are probably my best guess for favourite/not-so-favourite atm.

** My favorite trope (in any novel or fandom) is time loop.

For OC Harry, my favorite type is rational Harry, especially with grey or amoral Harry.

My favorite crossovers are HP with the ASOIF or GOT universe. I generally dislike all other crossovers as I'm not pop culture literate and don't watch many movies.

Least favorite: fix it fic with no time travel, just obstacles disappearing and enemies inexplicably becoming friends (often because Harry is ridiculously wealthy Lord Potter-Black). I especially dislike it when Slytherin characters are OC (mentor!Snape, Drarry, etc.).

  The Malfoy family is not pleased with the announcement of a Marriage Law, but they are determined to get the best out of it, of course. And the best is clearly Hermione Granger. Hermione, however, would rather die.

** My least favourite trope in any fandom is when the author plants the characters in a totally AU setting so all they end up having in common with the canon characters are their names.

I enjoy when authors take the time to give minor characters a ton of back story that isn't canon but you totally believe could be.

Neither of those are specific to HP though! My favourite stories to read usually involve Hermione and Draco post-war being snarky with each other!!
