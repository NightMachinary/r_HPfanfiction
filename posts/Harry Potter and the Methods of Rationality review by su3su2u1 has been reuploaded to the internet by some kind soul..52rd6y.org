** I agree with this review, a lot of people recommended this fic to me but after several chapters I just couldn't go on the author writes this as if he has the secret handbook to magic in the HP verse and he's teaching us the correct solution.

When in fact he's creating himself all the laws that allow Harry to do X awesome things.

Take the gold to silver to gold trick it depends on the goblins minting him silver coins at a cost of 5%, there is nothing in the canon about this as far as I remember the scheme only works because he has the goblins being idiots.

That's like when you're playing monopoly and land in jail you make your own get out of jail cards with pen and paper, that's not you being smart or funny that's you being a cheater and annoying.

Is it one of those things where fans of HPMOR were mob like fanboys at some point? I genuinely want to know because I don't understand why I've seen several posts that seem to decry the story.

It's not perfect, and it is obviously self indulgent, but it's well written and if you can get into it or buy into its message there are some great moments to be had.

****** Well its obvious that magic does work to some set of principles in canon... when JK Rowling introduces new types of magic or spells, everything more or less feels consistent and nothing is world-breaking. The departures in HPMOR is a contrivance but only so when rationalist Harry asks "what are the principles that make magic work?" The results are consistent. Science, for Harry, is a set of methods for asking the question about the rules, not the rules themselves. If no such rules existed in canon, HP would be unreadable.

**** Okay. I can see why people would be against it because of fanboyism. I think maybe I read it too late to get caught up in that.

I can also understand the arrogance thing, but that does also come down to how the reader personally interprets it. It didn't feel arrogant to me because I never felt like or considered the story to be speaking to me to begin with.

It helps that I knew nothing of the science so I couldn't assume that he was wrong about that.

And as for the departures from canon, I think I'm the perfect target audience for that kind of thing.

I know a lot of people prefer stories that either keep the world as similar as possible, or only experiment with small changes, but I'm part of the (sometimes perhaps arrogant) crowd that /prefers/ AU's that /fix/ canon.

So it probably appealed to that side of my tastes.

In no way is HPMOR supposed to be realistic. Harry's behaviour is not meant to make sense in terms of realism or plot. Because it's fanfiction and EY does whatever, because he wants to shove some rationalism into our mouths.

******* Ignoring the existence of the author notes, no, he did not do it overtly.

That said, as much as I did enjoy that story, I can say that it can be quite ... arrogant, yes, at times. And that one is one of those moments when what is but does not have to be seen as arrogance by readers combines with author notes about it being even more arrogant, and the end result is that ... well, his attitude honestly was quite insulting as far as many people saw it.

Don't get me wrong, I did find the concept of dementors as beings of death---not like HPMoR was the first story to have that twist anyway---and the Patronus 2.0 to be quite cool and overall fairly enjoyable, and had it been, you know, explored well in the story and played for something ... I don't know, less grandiose, I guess, than it got played for in the end, it could have possibly been great. But it wasn't, even if for some people it was enjoyable, all because of his (the author's) “I know better” kind of elitism.

And this elitism and that arrogance are the very root of the issue for many of those who say that HPMoR is bad. Too many things, instead of being played to benefit the plot in some way, enrich it, are instead played for ... some kind of “hahah, I'm right, you aren't” thing. Which is just sad because I've read some of Yudkowsky's other works and he could have done way better.

Probably a major point, there.

If your way of teaching lessons is to give wrong information, you're going to lose credibility from anyone who can see through that. Since it makes it look like you don't know what you're talking about.

After all, wasn't the point of the story that Harry was supposed to be an avatar of rationality, and that we would see how a rationalistic perspective would have a huge effect on the wizarding world? That's how the book was sold - instead we got a lot of self-righteous intellectual circle-jerking disguised as wisdom, and the main response to any critique is "you just don't understand".

What exactly do you mean by that?

I mean, the whole thing is narrated mostly from the point of view of Harry, and is is a series of repeated instances where he has a long internal monologue, arrives at some conclusion, and then is repeatedly proven wrong! It's not by accident that Harry is wrong about science and logic, it's by design (with the notable exception of the photons thing in chapter 95, which I assume was corrected in later edits).

Have you read it until the end, where [[/spoiler][Harry turns out to be a huge idiot that almost destroys the world multiple times, kills a bunch of people, realizes how much of an idiot he has been the whole time, how much more carefully he needs to think and act, and that he's at the very beginning of his journey as a rationalist and has only survived the whole thing thanks to Dumbledore doing all of the heavy intellectual lifting?]]

Edit: I actually found a quote from Eliezer specifically about the squib thing (transcribed from audio):

#+begin_quote
  And I will also observe, although Dumbledore had no way of figuring this out, and I think Harry might not have figured it out yet because he doesn't yet know about chromosomal crossover, that if there is no wizard gene, but rather a muggle gene, and the muggle gene sometimes gets hit by cosmic rays and ceases to function thereby producing a non-muggle allele, then some of the muggle vs. wizard alleles in the wizard population that got there from muggleborns will be repairable via chromosomal crossover, thus sometimes causing two wizards to give birth to a squib. Furthermore this will happen more frequently in wizards who have recent muggleborn ancestry. I wonder if Lucius told Draco that when Draco told him about Harry's theory of genetics.

Furthermore, chromosomal crossover only really comes into play when there are two alleles on the same "leg" of a chromosome. The fic states that there is only one gene (allele) responsible for magic inheritance (ie. straight-up Mendelian inheritance).

*** As someone who found this on my Goodreads recommended list, I was pretty curious when I read it like 4 years ago.

I liked the new flavour that the author had brought to the world of Harry Potter fan fiction, but when it started following canon 1st year, with Quirrelmort and what not, it lost its appeal quickly. Then, when you look at it, when you're 11 years old, you aren't mature. Your mind is still like that of a child -- magical, or normal -- and will not be able to understand the intricate meaning behind philosophies.

More than that though, the main problem that /I/ had with the fiction was that it never seemed to pull me in, draw me into the story. It was like the fiction was just focusing on dialogues and actions, but never anything more. There were no forms of imagery, no personal touches that would make the story memorable. So when you get back to the story after a break, it's more like you'll feel /meh/ and never get around to reading it.

I gave the book quite a few tries actually. It was recommended very often by many people on various sites, so I figured there must be something to it. But each time I tried getting back to the book, one thing kept putting me off.

The author is well read, that much we can see. But if he /is/ well read, then while he includes his little tidbits of knowledge in there, he could have as well improved on the plot. But all the author ever did was build upon the entire HP plot from the first book. His theory of magic may be something new, sure. But the author's work seems to give off the vibe of arrogance. He uses the plot from canon when he deems it's good, but when it isn't, he just turns his nose up at it.

I might actually give it another chance tonight and see if I can get past chapter 4, which is where I stopped because I couldn't be bothered to read any longer.

Harry's unusual behavior is actually an important plot point, which I won't discuss further because spoilers. Rest assured that it isn't a simple failure to write an 11-year-old, though. Whether his schoolmates behave credibly, judge for yourself.

If you're struggling to enjoy it at that early stage, may I recommend [[http://daystareld.com/hpmor-remix/][DaystarEld's remix]]? It's a somewhat extended version of the first few chapters, with a slightly softer and more respectful Harry and more gradual introduction.

I can heartily assure you that HPMoR does /not/ slavishly follow canon :D! Yes, Eliezer sometimes used canon elements - though almost always in a very different way - and other times mocked them. It is very much its own story.

Personally, I found it to be an excellent piece of work - though not, I'll grant, for everyone.

**** Unfortunately(?), most of them are like that. I really think only a few of what are considered good fics actually portray 11-13 year olds authentically (for example, Alexandra Quick). I'm reading Prince of Slytherin right now and all these 12 years olds talk like they're 30 and are taken seriously by people ten times their age.

Doesn't mean I can't enjoy it, I just need too... let it slide?

**** I think if you don't enjoy it past the first 4 or 5 chapters your time is better served with other stories. HPMOR is not all time great that I would insist you try and soldier through because of how good it is.

If it clicks for you you'll love it, otherwise it'll either bore you or annoy like it has many others in the thread.

*** Parody and mockery of the original series done by someone who hasn't actually read the original series and who has to go off community collated info on the wiki.

He takes the piss out of 'clearly stupid' things in canon that he doesn't actually understand the canon version of.

It's also quite cliquey, especially early on. A lot of the humor of the first few dozen chapters is based on you understanding the science and logic that he's only barely and vaguely explained, which makes it feel like it's intentionally excluding anyone who isn't smart enough.

Basically, anyone who reads HP fanfiction is generally a fan of the original series. Anyone of that subset who is not particularly great at logical thinking or who has a very limited scientific background finds a fic which is intentionally and badly mocking something they love based on flawed assumptions, and which makes jokes that they can't quite get from the info in the fic. Is it really surprising that they react quite strongly and negatively?

******* I thought it was a joke. You can't use the "standard" solution /as/ a standard because it has a permanent cost that stacks (which Harry probably didn't yet know at the time, but Riddle did). You can use Riddikulus or stinging hexes all you like as long as it doesn't come too quickly for too long, but choosing to make fiendfyre the hammer you use to solve every problem is simply untenable. Laughably, even.

Note: In theory, you couldn't ACTUALLY use Riddikulus over and over again forever. You'd eventually be inured to everything you could possibly find scary. That's a problem with using poorly simplified examples to prove a point, though, not a problem with Riddikulus.

Edit: Chapter 107, so yeah, Harry knew. Sorry!

The snark and insults directed at the author are tiresome unless you share the su3su2u1's opinions already. I do agree with his points that actual scientific exploration of magic falls by the wayside in favor of Death Note--style plotting, and that the conclusion's stated reveal of "Harry was dangerously wrong the whole time and Hermione is the real hero" doesn't stand up against seven books' worth of scenes showing the opposite.
