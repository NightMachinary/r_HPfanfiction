Under the UCMJ, a solider who

#+begin_quote
  without authority goes or remains absent from his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to remain away therefrom permanently;
#+end_quote

is guilty of desertion and

#+begin_quote
  shall be punished, if the offense is committed in time of war, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct, but if the desertion or attempt to desert occurs at any other time, by such punishment, other than death, as a court-martial may direct.

** Firstly Harry told Ron to leave, in a fit of anger. If a superior tells you to take a hike, you do it.

Secondly Ron intended to return the moment he apparated away, but by the power of Rowling, he had apparated into a group of snatchers. So by the time he managed to talk his way out, and return, Harry and Hermione were already gone. So, no intent to remain away permanently.

Thirdly, Harry is not actually his superior. He might be the chosen one, but Hermione and Ron are the Hogwarts prefect (Carried over into military AU, id say that counts as sergeant, with the head boy/girl being Ensign. Semi Religious positions do not carry over into military command sctructure, except perhaps in a supporting role such as chaplain or a PR position).

So Ron outranks Harry, and is of equal rank to Hermione. So Harry has no business court martialing him, for perceived wrongs. He may report his actions up the chain, but Harry's own words/behaviour before Ron left could be seen as mutinous

Fourthly, given the lack of success they were having in fulfilling their primary mission, destroying all Horcruxes, Ron's action of regrouping/getting in contact with the rest of the loyalists, would have been quite correct.

If true, this would definitely be a defense raiseable at trial.

In law, intent means the intent at the moment which the act was committed, not how the the person felt a second afterwards. Voluntary return would be a mitigating factor during sentencing, but it would not change the fact that he originally left.

I don't think the structure of Hogwarts School, a civilian institution, would matter in the orgonization of Harry's army.

Ron was the one who made the commitment to Harry ("I'm with you to the very end") to join his fight. In AUs this is often done in the form of a formal oath. Therefore, Harry would be the superior.

** "See you in court" growled Harry

Ron laughed so hard he fell on the ground clutching his sides followed by Hermione,Ginny and the rest of the DA members

Molly wiped tears of mirth from her eyes as she thanked Harry for cheering her up momentarily following Fred's death

"You truly are a Marauder" chuckled Professor McGonagall

"Fucking adorable" said Acting Minister Shacklebolt

Harry fumed with rage before bursting into laughter himself after realising the absurdity of what he had just said
