So, I don't know if this has been asked before but I'm super curious about what you guys would consider the ABSOLUTE BEST HP fanfiction on the web. I mean it can be from fictionpad, Archives of Our Own, fanfiction.net, or any other personal websites or obscure fanfiction sites. It can be a really long fic or a one-shot. I'm looking for new things to read and I want to see what others think is the pinnacle of HP fanfiction writing. I am even tentatively accepting crossovers if it's really that good.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]

Basilisk born is hands down the best fic I've read. Still a WIP but is is 100% worth the read. I've read it twice, and I never read things twice.

** It's really hard for me to say since I love a ton of fanfics. However, I think I'm going to go with The Prince of Slytherin.

** I haven't read many in my two years of being in the fandom, but of those I have read, I would say Philophobia books 1 & 2 written by aeliziadubois is by far the best-written fic I've had the good pleasure of reading. It is an oc x Remus Lupin during the Marauders era, which I normally don't go for because romance is not a genre I enjoy, but this is the exception for me. It's somewhat cliché, but it has a great plot and I'm kinda a sucker for the Marauders era lol. I will admit, there is a bit too much profanity, but that just adds to the character I suppose.

If you're interested in reading it I'll link it here [[https://my.w.tt/2ifu8vpL38][Philophobia book 1]], and here [[https://my.w.tt/XSw34ioN38][Philophobia book 2]] but before you start reading, beware of themes of physical, emotional, sexual abuse, and self-harm. Seriously, there are some dark themes, especially because the original character is a Black sibling and because they're in the middle of a war.

But if you don't have trauma with that sort of thing or a feint heart, it's definitely worth the read and maybe even reread. :)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1628140]]

A high quality au in which Tom Riddle grew up with another magical child at the orphanage. Well researched historical details, compelling OCs, a gripping plot (especially in Grass Crown, which is part two of the series), and a good depiction of how TMR could realistically fall in love that doesn't whitewash his evil deeds and psychopathic tendencies

** I loved two stories equally :

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10101403/1/Fixing-Past-Mistakes][Fixing-Past-Mistakes]]

Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? COMPLETE

(a severus goes back in time and raise harry, amazing story !!!)

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1019294/chapters/2027039][Emancipation]]

What are dependents left to do when betrayed by those they trusted most, but to find a way to become masters in their own right. Set after Department of Mysteries fiasco in Order of the Phoenix.

Translation into French available here: https: // [[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]] /s / 11803029 / 1 / Emancipation

(warning : slash, M rated, and others tropes - powerfull harry, bashing and others .... BUT well written. It's a guilty pleasure !)

** My favourite fic by far was All the young dudes on AO3. Its a slow burn wolfstar marauders fic that follows remus from just before Hogwarts to around goblet of fire and I looove it!! The writing is great, the story is strong, it's rather long which I like and I actually burst out laughing on the bus from it (I got some weird looks lmao) it was the fic that got me into fanfiction, and I re read it recently and it was just as good as I remembered
