Preferably not way too far off from canon and still during their school years. I don't care if there is smut. Thank you in advance!


** Linkao3(Azoth by zeitgeistic) is one of my favourite fics of all time. It's more or less canon complient, but disregards the epilogue. Set during 'eighth-year'.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

** I read tons of Drarry and you can see my whole rec list [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][here]] once you run out of these.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/28580][A Thousand Beautiful Things - verse]]This series is amazing. It starts as a war-AU where Draco is trained by Snape and becomes a spy for the Order. Then after the war, even though he is given an Order of Merlin etc. no one (in the public) seems to believe that he really wasn't a death eater and the ministry tries to seize all of his inheritance and Malfoy Manor. During his case against the ministry, Harry is struck by a mysterious curse that only Draco knows how to break, but he cannot tell anyone that he is trying to break the curse (for reasons explained in the story). This is one of those wonderful fics that is almost shakespearean in its misunderstandings and that could only be set in the magical world due to the magic involved. It is so good. It also has a nice extended cast of characters (including artist Dean, a great Seamus & Dean friendship and a Dean/Hermione relationship!)

- [[http://frowl.org/transformation/index.html][Transformation]] - "In Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, he must face the consequences of the attack on the Department of Mysteries and the effects of Voldemort's return. And in doing so, he finds that even your enemies can teach you valuable lessons - about the world, and about yourself." This fic is great! It follows canon through OOTP, but where it goes in 6th year feels like canon even though it's all totally AU. Draco's characterization is spot on and the author doesn't try to redeem him with OOC fluff.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/41961][Paradox series]] - This is a great time-travel premise and the execution is super well done. Basically, 40 year old Draco is sent back in time to his 16 year old body and as he starts to change the past, he starts to forget the future. Draco is suuuuper in character and the slash elements are interesting and believable.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5163386][Mental]] - Long Hogwarts 8th year fic where a spell causes Harry and Draco to be able to hear eachothers thoughts. Pretty quickly they learn how to control the link and become friends and then slowly develop feelings for eachother. This fic has an EXTREMELY slow build but it was believable and sweet. There are tons of parts that made me smile and laugh out loud. I am a sucker for this genre - long fics where Harry and Draco have to work together or are forced together for some reason and this one is one of the best I have read. Highly recommend!

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/192712][Lettered]] - This is a 3 fic series beginning with this fic where Draco and Harry are secret pen pals during their 7th year. Harry doesn't know Draco is his pen pal for most of it until he does. The plot device is brilliant because the author does a cool thing where the only letters are Dracos. You have to fill in yourself what Harry might have written between. The sequel is 20 years later when they find eachother again. And the final fic is a year later, still from Dracos POV after Harry gets kidnapped. It's very well written and the author has such a clear voice for Draco that his character is nuanced and super flawed.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5113505][To Love a Loather Arch Enemy]] - A really sweet Harry/Draco get together fic set when Harry gives Draco back his wand after the final battle. Although probably OOC and unrealistic, this fic was just so sweet and heartwarming that its faults are easily forgiven. As I was reading, I was smiling the entire time.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164][Eclipse]] - this is an old fic, written pre-HBP (maybe even pre-OOTP?) but it holds up really well. Draco abducts Harry from school and takes him to the dungeon at Malfoy Manor to wait for voldemort. He undergoes a huge (and very understandable and well written) character change and decides to betray the Death Eaters and escapes with Harry. They go on a long camping trip to try to walk back to hogwarts and slowly become friends and then even more slowly, develop feelings for one-another. This fic was such an emotional rollercoaster! I loved so much about it - the slow build, the believable character development, the fairy circles, the really good potions and Old Magic descriptions, the loyalty of Harry after he gets back to hogwarts - just everything. Great fic.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4039174][The Name on Your Forehead]] - This is one of the best "a spell forces them to kiss" fics I have read. It is funny and well written and there is a cute twist at the end too.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594][Temptation on the Warfront]] - "Draco Malfoy is forced into hiding with the Golden Trio and dragged into their search for horcruxes. What ensues is a journey of redemption, unexpected friendships and an unwanted, turbulent romance with Harry Potter." I really liked this fic. The AU was very similar to canon (which was cool) but different enough to keep you on your toes. Harry and Dracos slow angsty buildup was also great and pretty believable.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2693312][The Light More Beautiful]] - This story has an interesting plot device I haven't seen anywhere else - Draco and Harry lose their virginities together 6th year due to an accident with lust potion. Then Harry helps Draco leave the country to get away from the war and Draco doesn't come back for years. That's where this story picks up.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/344335][It Starts with a Spin]] - 6th year fic with house unity parties, truth or dare, spin the bottle etc. I LOVED this fic. Harry and Draco feel really in-character despite the circumstances and the extended cast of characters (esp. Seamus) are so fun.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/754708][Bond]] - an oldie but a goodie where Draco and Harry are accidentally bonded during (I think?) 6th year. One of the very best bond fics I've read for any pairing.

- [[http://bigbang.inkubation.net/bbb3/reparo.html][Reparo]] - This was rec'd to me with the note that it is "THE Eighth Year Drarry fic." I don't know if it is THAT great, but it still was really good. In this fic, The trio go back to hogwarts after the war, but no slytherins (of any year!) go back and their house is completely empty except for 3 first years who are sorted into it. Worried about what will happen if Hogwarts only has three houses, Harry goes to Malfoy Manor to convince Draco to come back to school.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5673128/1/Two-Sides-of-the-Same-Coin][Two Sides of the Same Coin]] - This fic is a usual "Draco and Harry get together during 8th year" fic. What sets it apart is that 1) there was no forced "bonding" or anything like it to force them together 2) the angst and slow build to get them together is perfectly done 3) the writing is really good 4) Romeo and Juliet is a big part of this fic which I loved.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812][Helix]] - this is one of my all time favorite Christmas fics. Each chapter is one day in december of 8th year hogwarts. Draco and Harry are assigned to care for the breeding of the frost snails (a magical creature created by the author for this fic) and slowly become friends and then fall in love. This was slow and deliberate, the writing is so so so good.

  The Weasley twin's latest invention, a glitter-bomb that causes the name of your crush to appear across your forehead, wrecks havoc among the students of Hogwarts. As usual, Harry's the one who bears the brunt of it.Excerpt: Malfoy's eyes narrow and he comes to a stop, only a few paces from Harry. ‘I wouldn't expect you to understand,' he spits. ‘After all, your whole face is one big spell-gone-wrong, isn't it, scarhead?'Harry ignores the insult, opting to change the topic instead. ‘So, whose name is it then, Malfoy?' He asks, and as soon as the question is out Malfoy's eyes slide from his and a glorious red blush creeps up his neck. ‘Someone embarrassing, I bet. McGonagall? Madam Pomfrey? Your Father?' That last one might have been going a little too far, Harry thinks, but really, he just couldn't resist.He's never been able to resist when it comes to Malfoy.

  Harry felt Malfoy's breath on his lips as they came together over the bottle, hands firmly planted on the floor as though they each needed their familiar soil, refusing to cross into enemy territory.   Except that Malfoy no longer felt like his enemy.   Malfoy felt inevitable.

  Someone casts the Imperius curse on Draco Malfoy, and whatever the instructions may be, Harry finds himself an unwilling target. The encounter leaves Harry torn between pleasure and revulsion. As they fight in the aftermath, a tense game begins in which they deny their reactions and use any evidence of arousal as a weapon against each other. Draco/Harry. 8th Year.

*** I've read almost all of these and they are GREAT recs. Twist of Fate is one of my all time favorites and is pretty much completely canon compliant (EWE) which is very very rare for a hogwarts era fic (pre "8th" year).

  Chaos: when the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future. One gene varies, one neuron fires, one butterfly flaps its wings, and Draco Malfoy's life is completely different. Draco has always found a certain comfort in chaos. Perhaps he shouldn't.

  When Pansy Parkinson bets Draco Malfoy that he could never seduce Harry Potter, Draco quickly learns that games of deceit, dishonesty, and desire can have deadly consequences. Written for the 2013 round of the bottom_draco fest and adapted from the 1988 film "Dangerous Liaisons" (and its 1999 modernization, "Cruel Intentions").

  Back at Hogwarts after the war, a defeated Draco Malfoy is prepared to settle for life's simpler pleasures: snark, sex, and Slytherin scheming. That is until Pansy, newly in possession of Malfoy Manor, offers to return his ancestral home. Just one condition: he has to win, and break, Harry Potter's heart to get it. That's no problem. Draco's got this situation completely under control. Completely. At least until he doesn't.
