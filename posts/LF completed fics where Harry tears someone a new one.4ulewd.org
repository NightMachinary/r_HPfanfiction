Yes its bull and unbelievable but its a guilty pleasure for me. Its usually paired with Dumbeldore or Weasely bashing but as long as Harry tears strips out of someone and the fic is finished I'd like to read it.

  Instead of Durmstrang Academy, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was invited to take part in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. When Ilvermorny arrives at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore is shocked to see the long-thought-dead Harry and Lily Potter appear, as well as the missing Sirius Black and Remus Lupin.

**** Off the top of my head I can remember four ones that I like.

The Rise of the Wizards, Lily's Changes, Angry Harry and the Seven, and Three to Backstep.

Dumbledore is nuked to hell and back in Lily's changes. Lol.
