Come on, we've all been there. In our wee pre-teen/teenage years when we first discovered fanfic, we had to have written some truly bad/cliche plots that would make more seasoned reader/writers cringe. So what was your poison?


** Starting stories and not finishing them. That's why I'm now actually trying to finish a story (though with room for a sequel) entirely before I start posting it. No need to add to the clutter of unfinished stories. It's actually a bit easier to write too with no one (except for my patient proofreader) expecting anything.

** Oh...god...

I was 12...13 ish. I wrote a Mary-Sue In love with Draco...

Which lots of 12 and 13 year olds do. But mine got picked for one of those threads that would completely tear you to SHREDS! It was a long time ago. It was one chapter. And those people destroyed me with very vaild.. and not vaild and super mean criticism.

I deleted that story. I deleted that account. I even left that email address. It was humiliation at its finest.

It was the golden age of HP fanfiction, and I got to enjoy the fruits. And I got to enjoy over 80 people having a very good laugh at my expense. Wish I could remember the name of that forum. I'd like to go there and tell them that in 03 and 04. They were assholes...

** When I was 13 I wrote a horrible fic where Dumbledore threw Harry in Azkaban at the age of 6 because he had a suspicion that Harry would become a dark wizard. It was the prelude for what I thought would be an epic dark!harry/Wrong BWL fic + lots of bashing. At that time, I thought it was awesome. Remarkably, most of the reviewers liked it! (It got to 20k words before I abandoned it)

** I have two stories still up on ffn that I think are around ten years old now. Each only one chapter so I didn't really have time to fall into established tropes or clich√©s too badly, but one of them has the "convenient character death to make two characters bond even though they dislike each other" thing going on. Like, that's all it was. But people liked it? Idk.

But it was upon rereading those ages later that I realized, I'm just not a 'character' writer. I can't do personalities no matter how I try- can't even do it in D&D. Oh well.

Honestly though, I applaud you for writing, and growing as a writer. If I wrote, I'd finish a chapter, feel good about it, and then look back and realize it is "orbs", "coal-black eyes", and  a shopping trip every other paragraph.

** The prime fanfiction mistake I've consistently made is writing to make a point about something. The problem is that it gives the fic a rather temporally limited appeal. Almost inevitably my own tastes move on or the point being made no longer feels important, and I'm hit with a crippling dissatisfaction with what I wrote. Alexandra Potter is full of these: the level of inequality I put into the HP society, the point I was making about the cruelty of innocent children who aren't mature enough to think about others before they act, the fact that children often change friendship group during their school years, exploring the idea of immature kids with dangerous magical abilities etc. Each individual element felt like it was legitimate, but it added up to create a much darker fic than I intended.

The other major mistake is to write a fanfic based on an idea for an opening, not an ending. If your prime interest is in the opening of the fic (aka the "plot bunny"), then finishing the opening will excise the plot bunny and you lose the desire to finish the fic.

The worst mistake I made was combining these two errors into one story. In The One He Feared, I wanted to make a point about how it is that Voldemort can be able to out-duel so many Aurors but still not be able to simply take the Ministry by force. So I set the fic up so the first arc ended with Voldemort trying a frontal attack on the Ministry and it failing. This involved an epic Harry v Voldemort duel.

Unfortunately I realised after finishing that scene that I had already achieved what I had wanted to achieve going into the fic. To make matters worse, the epic duel meant that there was very little I could do that would top it for the fic's actual climax. The plan I had to make a point about how Harry could not defeat Voldemort through strength alone, even if he had Dumbledore's ability with magic, suddenly felt rather empty. It's one thing to have a clever idea about a point to make, it's another to write a fic that's paced in a way that engages and entertains. Having the biggest duel early on in the fic may be clever, but it doesn't constitute good writing.

** The problem was, I was my own worst critic. I would write something, MAYBE post a little bit, and then I would immediately delete it. It's still a nasty habit of mine. I've read a few of the things I've managed to stash away on my computer, and it's honestly not THAT bad. I wish I could break that habit. I would be a better writer if I'd let other people actually critique it other than just labeling it a lost cause myself. When I was a kid, I used to write all the time. I wrote stories about Harry before I even knew fanfiction was a thing. By age 10 or 11, I was an incredible writer (you know, by middle school standards). A teacher accused me of plagiarizing, and then, after a tearful interrogation, she realized I was just really good for my age. Unfortunately, however, she acted like she had found a prodigy. She forced me into competitions, which I did very well at (even earning money). I thought I was destined to grow up to be the next great American novelist. Nope, now I just work in education (which I love, don't get me wrong). I'm trying to relearn how to enjoy writing. It has it's ups and downs. NaNoWriMo seems to help a lot, especially since you aren't allowed to delete anything.

As for awful plot lines...I had one where Harry had a blind daughter, another about an American at Hogwarts falling in love with Remus Lupin, a hilarious Lily and James story following the plot of Dirty Dancing...just typical 12-year-old daydreams of what I thought life and love was supposed to look like.

I recently discovered one I wrote when I was in seventh grade about Sirius Black in Azkaban. Surprised the hell out of me. I had so much potential.

While I was doing that FFN sent me an email of a private msg from the guy saying that he had reviewed his wrong internet tab, and his review hadn't been meant for me. Of course I got the email well after I had deleted everything. Very embarrassing.

** Tainted pumpkin juice.

If I could redo it (and still generate interest for a story already told), I'd skip the idea of Dumbledore adding a loyalty potion to the pumpkin juice served at the Valentine's Feast. More accurately, the story suggested that the taint had always been there but no one had noticed until it was implied by Gilderoy Lockhart that love potions make the day more special.

The whole thing was inspired at a time when Dumbledore was supposed to be a villain in the story. I've grown out of my pop-Machiavellian-Albus phase.

** I have one story up on FFN and it was terrible. I'm not gonna bother linking it here but based off my user name and description you can probably guess at it.

Harry's twin is BWL and he's neglected, becomes super powerful, trained by the founders and soul bond with Ginny because why not.

I basically tried to hit all the worst cliches. Yet a majority of my readers seemed to actually enjoy it and I don't use the e-mail anymore but I occasionally check the reviews and it gets a new one every once in a while asking for an update.

It's never getting an update it was a flaming pile of crap and I rightfully abandoned it.

That story did teach me a lot of things. Don't release a story unless it's finished. Make sure the entire story is consistent. It's ok to change things but make sure the rest of the universe reflects that change. Bashing is ok in small doses but don't completely change a character just to vilify them. If I ever write and finish another story hopefully it will be better.

** I think it was around '04 that hpff blogs were extremely popular (where I'm from). Most people made up a character and stuck them in the story, and almost everyone was MS/GS.

My character was a beautiful, tall, slender blonde, an Animagus Pure-blood with some sort of muggle peerage, who was Harry's girlfriend but also Draco's best friend and Dumbledore favoured her as well. I think the plot wasn't bad, and I did finish the whole thing with a spectacular battle at Hogwarts, but.. I killed off my own character to torment Harry and show how much he loved "me". It was really long too.

Once someone from school recognised it was me writing, I was terrified for weeks.

Other than that, I posted a HHr story to Mugglenet, told from Draco's perspective that was meant to make people cry. I refuse to read it now, but I think it was wayyy over the top with the dramatics and angst.

** Years ago, I was writing a Twilight fic (Yes I know!) and got the term 'imprinting' wrong. It was so bad that I had one of the actual characters actually explaining that they were confused about imprinting just as a way to explain that I was confused. Probably OOC has hell! Basically just ruined the whole thing.

It is still published on FFN. But I am just ignoring that story and writing Harry Potter fanfiction. Which I am SO MUCH better at.

2) Albus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore. Do you see it? Do you /see/?

3) Starting aforementioned AU at Year 1, giving Harmony/Drarry/Snarry shippers a good while to catch feelings if their pairing doesn't show. I've been PM'ed already, by family no less.
