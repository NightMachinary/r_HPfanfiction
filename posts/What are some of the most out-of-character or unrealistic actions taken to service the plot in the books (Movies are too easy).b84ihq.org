For me, one of the major ones is Dumbledore somehow being away for hours on end at the Ministry and not being able to rush back to stop Quirrel at once on PS/SS.

People say that he wanted the Trio, Harry especially, to solve the mystery themselves but Quirrel easily could have gotten the stone somehow or killed Harry through other means.


** - Everyone (adults) just being cool with Harry joining the Triwizard tournament that they specifically only wanted adults to enter. There should have been a public outcry and consequences for Dumbledore and the Ministry officials. Instead it's treated as if it's all Harry's fault.

- MgGonagall being useless or absent in scenes that Harry could have really used his Head of House in. Like after his name is plucked from the Goblet, Snape of all people follows him to interrogate but McGonagall is nowhere to be found. Ignoring Umbridge's abuse of the students. Really when you distil her actions out of the narrative she's kind of terrible.

- Harry not opening the mirror package until the last possible moment. This is a boy who almost never received gifts, surely he would have been eager to find out what it was, no matter what his mood was when he received it.

- Hermione not believing Draco was up to something bad in 6th year. More realistic would be her cooking up schemes to find out if Draco had the Dark Mark.

- Everyone (Trio and friends) getting engrossed in schoowork and quidditch while Voldemort escalates in 6th year.

- The Order of the Phoenix leaving Harry at the Dursleys until the last day. With Moody calling the shots you'd think they'd sneak Harry out earlier and have a polyjuiced ambush waiting for the Death Eaters.

- Bill & Fleur's wedding not having any real security. Not even 2-3 Order Members staying apart from the celebrations just in case. Everyone was caught by surprise.

- Wearing the damn Horcrux around their necks instead of packing it away.

**** While I didn't grow up in a warzone, there was a military coup in my country when I was 12. I know what you mean about not remembering the big things while clearly foucusing on and remembering the little things. But Harry and his friends are at the centre of it all, they aren't civilian bystanders. They had just embarked on (and largely failed IMHO) a paramilitary operation the year before where they went up against the leader of the other side.

I found it implausible how the DA just stops meeting as soon as Dumbledore returns. I'd expect fearful Muggleborns and other DA members to be working on their blasting curses and other defensive measures, not the seeming naivety we see in the book. There should be an increase in hostilities with Draco and the other Pureblood bigots, not the reset we see in book 6. Draco was complicit in their torture just months ago and next we see people treat him as if nothing happened.

I know if I were a Muggleborn during this time I'd have plans/tickets to skip the Channel and a confringo just waiting for a Death Eater to eat. I'd be plotting to either run, fight or both. Of course I'd probably be killed by snatchers but the intent and plans would be there. Just a throwaway scene of Dean being nervous, talking about tracking down his birth father, or Hermione comforting Dennis Creevey would have been enough.

*** Some "can" be explained by the scenario.

- Leaving Harry at the Dursley was part of a plot. Voldemort knew where Privet Drive was, they knew from the start that he would try something the moment Harry leaves and chose this moment in hope it would be too obvious. Some could argue that if you were Voldemort, you would get pretty much anyone available for this day because either he leaves and fight or he doesn't and easy kill, but meh scenario (and maybe some Imperius curse from Snape to put the plan in the head of Mundigus if I remember well).

- The whole plan for the wedding was to be discret, with Harry "not being here". Putting special protections in place or a guard would be like anouncing to the world that Harry Potter was at the wedding.

***** Don't forget that, despite the ongoing inflitration, the Ministry was still, at the time of the mariage, "fighting Voldemort". Making ambush or attacking someone in his home in the middle of the night is one thing, making a full assault against tens of wizards, a lot of them purebloods (and not all Blood traitors) and a lot of foreigners is another.

For Voldemort, at that time, attacking the wedding would have needed him to use most of these ressources (ressources already engaged in the taking of the Ministry), encuring heavy losses for both side, especially if the Auror were contacted, and probably forcing the French to intervene (you can ignore the Brits when they have some internal troubles, but not when 10 of your wizards been killed or maimed just for attenting a wedding), for the little chance that Harry Potter was present, and that he did not use the previous fight to flee. It was not worth it.

Taking the Ministry to make Harry a fugitive, and then crashing the wedding with the full aid of the law was the right thing to do, and that was what they did. Harry may have escaped, but at least they had no looses in this operation.

**** There's some discussion that the writing of the books after Goblet of Fire were affected in some way by the films. You could argue that this chapter of Deathly Hallows was written with the film adaptation in mind, because it doesn't make much Watsonian sense, but it's a thrilling action sequence.

The Order had people in invisibility cloaks guarding Harry's house. Surely they could have had a few people doing the same with no one being the wiser?

**** Another one I forgot to add was how the Dementor almost kissing Harry on the Hogwarts Express was just shrugged off as just something Dementors do. Their second attempt at kissing him during the Quidditch game is also similarly treated like it's no big deal. Dementors gonna dement. There was some minor pearl clutching, but nothing really impactful was done about them.

Harry is the main reason why the Dementors were placed around Hogwarts in the first place (from Teachers/Ministry perspecctive). For them to be seen actively trying to harm him, the main person their presence is supposed to help protect, is ridiculous. Dumbledore and Mcgonagall really should have pressed this issue more. Imagine a Daily Prophet headline "/Boy-Who-Lived Nearly Kissed Twice By Dementors!/". Fudge's resolve would melt faster than his namesake.

** Too many to count in last two books, but the most glaring one is putting a Horcrux around their necks. It doesn't make any sense. It's not like Harry didn't know what Horcruxes could do to people (Diary, Ring). To hang such a thing around their necks was completely insane and utterly stupid. Why the other two didn't have the slightest objection is also beyond me.

IMHO, this development is one of the *worst plot railroading* I've read in fictions. It turns otherwise intelligent characters into drooling idiots with room temperature IQs, and its purpose is supposed to have one of them cave in under its influence and basically run off.

The Locket's destruction scene does however show that Locketmort can, to an extent, influence people /near/ his physical form without having to touch them. I don't find it far-fetched at all to suppose that it was /him/ who planted the thought in their mind to begin with that carrying him on their necks was the only way.

***** Nah, it's a fun theory but it doesn't work: if Harry's Horcrux was active in this fashion, why wouldn't it A) have turned him evil, or B) have turned his dormmates evil? or, for that matter, just plain Ron and Hermione? It's much more reasonable to believe that the Love-Protection mumbo-jumbo kept Scardemort fully contained.

Besides, Horcruxes don't randomly make you commit evil acts, though they encourage that kind of mindset. They also actively manipulate people to act /in the Horcrux's interest/. How could it possibly have been in Scardemort's interest to get the Dursleys to abuse, and thereby endanger, the body he was inhabiting? In truth, if Scardemort /had/ been in a position to influence the Dursleys, I'm pretty sure it would have /improved/ Harry's living conditions.

And if they wanted to destroy it early, I'm sure they could have gotten in contact with Dumbledore's Army and told them about the dead basilisk. Even without a parseltongue, dozens of motivated students should have been capable of figuring out a way inside. Ron managed it after only hearing it once or twice nearly five years prior- so all they had to do was put Harry in front of a snake, have him say "open," and have somebody nearby smuggle the pronunciation into Hogwarts. From there they'd only need to smuggle a single fang out.

Actually, no. Whatever Dumbledore's real plan was, a crucial piece of data is that he believed Professor Quirrell could not /possibly/ reach the Stone, thanks to his "you have to want it for its own sake without wanting to use it" setup in the Mirror of Erised. Indeed, this would have worked like a charm if not for selfless Harry blundering in. But even if you think Dumbledore predicted Harry would be there, he had previously taken steps to determine what Harry saw in the Mirror, and was under the impression that Harry would see his parents again --- hence the Stone was safe even if Quirrell should attempt to use him.

But I frankly do not believe Dumbledore meant for Harry & Co. to face Professor Quirrell, let alone Lord Voldemort. He did intend for them, and any other daring students who wanted to do so, to try and challenge the Third Floor Corridor, but not in an attempt to defeat Quirrell, I don't think --- just out of general Gryffindor bravado, and preferably at some other time of the year than the one Quirrell would choose to make his move.

By my analysis, the Corridor was meant to kill two birds with one Stone, so to speak: it was both an exciting and instructive obstacle course for the students (who would, upon arriving in the final chamber, assume that gazing into the Mirror /was/ their reward, and then head back after a while, little knowing what was inside), and a perfect trap for Voldemort's agent (/they/ would grow overconfident at how easy it was to beat all the other protections, possibly in the knowledge that a child had done it, and then stand around in front of the Mirror, desperately wondering what obvious trick they're missing, until Dumbledore could swoop in and capture them).

Considering we are later told that the Flamels were easily convinced to destroy the Stone for the greater good, my headcanon on this matter is that they were /utterly/ tired of life at this point, only held off committing suicide because of the social stigma, and therefore /jumped/ at any opportunity to endanger their Stone for a greater cause, granting them the death they wanted while also making it a honorable, heroic sacrifice.

I'm not so sure. The Wizarding World changes in five centuries, yes, but not as much as the Muggle one, owing to the much longer average lifespan of wizards. Its /culture/ seems to change even slower than its social structure, at that.

Besides, I said "social stigma", but it could just as easily be religious reasons, if you want to dive into the rabbit hole of "what sort of religious beliefs do Christian wizards hold, exactly?". The historical Flamel was famously a devout Christian who donated massive amounts of money to the Church --- and it's no secret that Catholicism, like, indeed, most branches of Christianity, greatly disapproves of suicide.

(As for reclusiveness, that doesn't work: we know that in the early 20th century at least, Flamel was still a well-known face in Wizarding Paris. And even if you want to ignore /Fantastic Beasts/ on this, there is the fact that he and Dumbledore discovered the Twelve Uses of Dragon's Blood together, which was apparently a very famous and publicized event.)

The keys would be a painful but not mortal obstacle, and the Devil's Snare was easily bypassed by first years. The chessboard only knocked out those who lost to it, and the "poisons" could have easily been sedatives. Lastly, Dumbledore had alarm spells set up to inform him the moment a student accessed the corridor- it only failed because he was away on Ministry business at the time.

If eleven year olds could pass with some difficulty, it's likely that sixteen year olds could do it with ease. If a student got reached the mirror, then Dumbledore probably would've arrived and had a similar "greatest desires" talk just like he had with Harry in the forbidden classroom as a teachable moment.
