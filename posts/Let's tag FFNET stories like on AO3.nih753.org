Heya, we could talk endlessly about how and why is either side superior but let's not.Today I would like to have some fun and came up with a game/exercise for those who want to participate.

​

It do be quiet easy. Pick a fanfic from FFnet and tag it like an AO3 fanfic.You can tag exactly like on AO3 and include everything or just write a name, author and some tags under it.

​

I'll try to edit in my contribution after I finish with school for today.
