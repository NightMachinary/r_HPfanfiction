Granted, I've seen a few Ginny bashing fics in the times when it was not yet clear whether Harry will end up with her or not.

So I am really curious now.


** Bashing is rather loosely defined. It ranges from "Ron the Death Eater" to "extremely jealous Ron" to "slightly/cannonically jealous Ron" to "Sidelined/written out Ron".

While I come across the first two... It isn't rare, but not common? Maybe 1:20 for Harmony fics, and half of those it is just a way to narrow the golden trio to the pairing. Even less in other ships.

Number two is almost exclusively found in Harmony fics, but you'll find the first one in crack fics as a 'gag'.

**** *shrug* I view it as bashing only if it is essentially commentary on the original characterization in the book (or possibly fanon characterization).

It isn't bashing to give a character a different characterization. No more than it is bashing Harry to make him an edge-lord overpowered rebel. I've enjoyed fics with evil!Ron, they are not necessarily bashing.

It is when the author is using the characterization to preach their opinion of the character in canon or in fanon. "Harry should never have been friends with him" "he is a bad friend" etc, and using their characterization of him to try to make those points.

So, the difference between "Harry's friends were not good friends and I am going to show it" vs "Harry Potter, but where his friends have less loyalty"

** Take a ship involving Hermione with anyone but Ron. Be it Harry, Draco, Severus, whatever floats your boat. You'll inevitably run into fics that bashes Ron.

While I don't really care all that much for SSHG, I don't /mind/ it unless it's teacher/student, and since I read a lot of Snape fics in general, I inevitably stumble upon a fic or two with Ron-bash. Just a couple of days ago I read linkao3(Pelicular by DeepShadows2) which had Ron-bash. I personally don't recommend the fic, just showing an example of ron-bashing, I didn't like the fic all that much.

In general, from what I've seen, shipping is by far the biggest reason characters are bashed, since it's the easiest (and worst, from a perspective of writing quality) way to get rid of competition. While I can sort of get it for ships where the canon relationship is very much legitimate and mostly flawless (I can't find fault with Molly/Arthur at all, for example) where you struggle to find real flaws you can use to justify breaking up a canon relationship, it makes less sense for cases where there are flaws you can exploit to explain why a relationship doesn't work. Romione? Hermione kept nagging Ron about fixing his idiosyncrasies (eating with mouth open etc) which could drive Ron spare over time, and Ron had very real problems with jealousy on multiple occasions and didn't really seem to get over his insecurities about his worth for Hermione. Hinny? Easy, the Weasleys is Harry's family in all but blood, so you could simply reason that Harry saw Ginny as a sister. Jily? There was a very significant period where Lily didn't care for James at all, all you'd have to do would be to give them less reasons to interact, or make her more firm in his opinion longterm. Remadora? The scene at the end of HBP sort of implied that Remus was encouraged almost to the point of coercion into it ("isn't it wonderful that Tonks likes you? you should be together with her!").

Much better than bashing the competition IMO. Ron doesn't need to be a money hungry bastard, Ginny doesn't need to be a mistress of love potions, James doesn't need to be the Gryffindor version of Lucius Malfoy, and Remus isn't just Dumbledore's errand boy.

** It depends a lot of what kind of fic you are reading. You are way more likely to see some Ron Bashing in an Harmony! fic that in a New Gen! fic. That being said, it feels like I'm seeing less Ron Bashing fics now that say, 2 or 3 years ago, but I coudn't say if it's because people are bashing him less or if I'm just better at selecting fics to read.

Anyways, some tropes like Harmony!, Haphne!, Slytherin! Harry or Manipulative Dumbledore! have (or at least used to) a lot of Ron bashing (you couldn't read an Haphne fic without Ron yelling "/But she is a Slimy Snake!/").\\
These one are not too much of a problem (they are predictable so you can quickly drop the fic if you don't want to read bashing), I'm a little more annoyed at the "surprise" one. Like, you are reading a crossover fic where Harry is stuck in another universe, without any chance to come back (at least quickly), everything seem fine but then you reach chapter 4 or 5 and "/Harry missed his friend Hermione, but not Ron, he always been a bad friend anyways/".

On other he just asks if Harry trusts her, he say yes and then he shrugs and goes "Fine, then."

Both reactions seem more in line with canon than him throwing a tantrum about Slytherins and Slimy Snakes.

If anything it's Hermione who would be more in character being suspicious and wanting to do some investigation on her own because she wouldn't trust boys to not be charmed by a pretty girl.

**** . . . It's probably useless to say it because at this point, people either love or hate Ron and nothing will make them change their mind but:

*Ron being a good friend:*

- Telling his mother Harry may not get any present at Christmas so she skits him a sweater
- Following Harry into his quest for the Philosopher Stone and sacrificing himself (at 12) so Harry and Hermione could continue
- Following spiders into the Forbidden Forest with Harry until a nest of Acromantula, even though he is arachnophobic.
- Following Harry into the Chamber of Secret (ok, he had to save his sister in this one so only a semi point)
- Standing in front of Sirius Black on a broken leg and telling him he would have to kill him first to hurt Harry
- Following Harry into yet another suicidal quest into the DoM
- Following Harry into his Horcruxe quest even though he was the one that had the most to lose (all of his family)
- Generally getting along with Harry

​

*Ron being a bad friend:*

- Not talking with him for a month in GoF because he was afraid Harry did something without telling him (playing on his fear of only being "Another Weasleys" and "Harry Potter's sidekick" rather than his own man)
- Leaving Harry during the Horcrux hunt (when he was hurt, hungry and "corrupted by the Horcrux) and not coming back for some time because he was caught by Snatcher and couldn't escape before they moved to another place

​

Conclusion: Ron is an amazing friend and the world would be a better place if more people were like him.

***** I agree with /most/ of your "pros" list. You left out a few on the "cons" list, however:

- Turning his back on his best friend who was in mortal peril because he didn't feel he was getting the recognition he - Ron - hadn't earned (GOF).
- Abandoning his closest friends because he was mad and hungry, then blaming it on the Locket horcrux despite Hermione and Harry wearing it just as often.
- Ruining the biggest social event in his best friend's life (to that point) out of petty jealousy and cruelty. The idea thaf Hermione would EVER look at Ron as a romantic option after how he treated her at the Yule Ball makes me lose so much respect for her as a woman.
- Ignoring his little sister in CoS when she was lonely and adjusting to a new school, leaving her vulnerable to Diary!Mort (tbf, all the Weasley boys are guilty of this)
- Joining Harry in shunning Hermione, who had no other friends, for being worried about Harry's safety during the firebolt incident.

See? I'm not saying Ron is a villain, or that he /should/ be bashed. Canon!Ron provides plenty of examples to show that - while far, far from evil - Ron is just an average joe that isn't up to the task of saving the world. Which is fine - the Wizarding World needs people to stock shelves at Weasley's Wheazes. But I would /never/ tolerate someone like Ron as a friend in real life, because I expect my friends to be loyal and to stand by me when I need them. YMMV.

Golly your list is SO one-sided lol! Just out of fairness, I could easily make a "negatives" list out of the whole Trio, who are infuriating in their naivete and callousness. The real heroes in HP are Neville and Luna.

Ron was shunning Hermione before Harry did because of the Scabber incident, he didn't "just" join Harry.

For your other points, I don't really agree with them, but my opinion is more of a matter of interpretation than anything else. So I can understand why people could think something else.

As an example, Ron may have left during the Horcrux' hunt, but he was the only one who "could". Harry was the "Undesirable N°1" and Hermione a "Mudblood", their only path of survival was by taking Voldemort down, while Ron, as a Pureblood could at least survive in the new regime.\\
I also think that he had more to lose if caught. Harry is an orphan and Hermione sent her parents to Australia, if caught they would only die while Ron could take his whole family in his fall. So I kinda understand why the Horcruxe made more damages with him.

I think it has more to do with him not trusting Harry to tell him the truth, and then not speaking to him for a month, it made no sense based on what we saw in the previous books.

I agree with him and Hermione though, but I think that both committed mistakes between themselves and maybe just chose to forgive them. But I don't recall how he ruined it, if during it he was just glaring, it was after it they screamed at each other. I would say he was an asshole for ruining it for his date.

Same thing for Harry, but he gets a bit of a pass due to all the stress he had going on in his life, and just outright bad upbringing and not having a positive male role model until Sirius.

Ignoring his Sister, eh, he was what? 12? Do you think 12-year-old boys pay attention to this kind of thing? Ginny had always been the family darling, if anything, the must've thought she had been doing well, and he had faith in her capacity to defend herself.

And he also had a LOT of things to worry about that year, the flying car ride, Harry being a parselmouth, the attacks, investigating the Chamber of Secrets, the spiders in the forest, and classes on top.

Wanting a 12 year old kid to have the emotional perception to think his little sister is being lonely while dealing a lot of stuff is simply unfair. Totally not his fault, at all.

You can throw that with the other Weasley's though, Fred and George weren't worrying about that, were older and (hopefully) more mature, and they should've looked out for her. The same thing for Percy, IIRC he was a Prefect.

The Firebolt incident is what happens when people miscommunicate, Hermione was being her usual high handed self and just went straight to McGonganagall without saying anything to Harry. From his POV it looked like she was selling him out. From the other's perspective, she had just ruined Gryffindor's chances of Winning.

******* You are choosing to look at it from Ron's perspective, which is fine. But from Harry's or Hermione's POV, Ron is objectively not a good friend. I've made that point to others who say "big deal, i'm fine with that", which is totally cool. I personally wouldn't be able to forgive someone who just abandoned me like that.

Personal example - 2 years ago, my apartment building burned down. I was fine, but i sent a text to my closest friends saying "hey, my place burned down. Dog/gf/i am okay." One of my oldest friend, that i'd known for 15 years, never replied. I tried calling him a few weeks later, then a few weeks after that. No response. 3 /months/ later he called; said he was "embarrassed" for not responding right away, so he avoided me. Just like that, he wasn't my friend any longer. You can't just ignore someone that you call a friend and expect it to be okay.

Compare that story to Harry/Ron, and remember that Harry came close to dying each time Ron walked out. He's just not someone that's worthy of forgiveness to me. Again - not a villain, not horrible, just someone not worthy of the worship he gets from canon lovers.

I don't think Ron though Harry was in any real danger in Tri-Wizard until he saw the massive dragon. Harry, however, learned about it when Hagrid showed him, and the only persons who supported him where basically Hermione and Neville.

The big problem for me is how Harry forgave him quickly.

In the Seventh Book, he was under the influence of the Horcrux, that was stronger in him because he wasn't as resilient as Harry or Hermione. And he was more vulnerable to it.

To his credit, he did try to come back as soon as he was outside the horcrux's influence, but he was captured.

I think all friendships have high and lows, the GoF stuff would be a low, and would require some serious talk, the DH one...it depends on how bad the Horcrux's influence was, and we are told it was pretty bad.

I normally don't think Ron is as good as a friend as some people point him out to be, some go as far as saying he's the "Hear of the Group" lol, which for me just means they haven't read the books in a while. I think Ron is a good friend, loyal, but like everyone else, he has his flaws.

Hermione isn't perfect either, no matter what people say, she's cruel, hypocritical and mean at some points. She was also pretty arrogant at the start. But she's also very loyal to Harry, and was always there to help him, and always wanted to do what she thought was right.

That's why in some of my fics, I either have Harry have a larger group of friends and get closer to other people, or just having both of them as acquaintances. Bashing them is totally unecessary, there could be situations where Harry is different and even canon Hermione and Ron just don't click with him, or different circustamces change who Harry's first friends are.

Love them.

Frankly, I've been a Weasley-skeptic since book 4.

I played along, give him props for going to the DoM, sang "Weasley is our king" with all the other Gryffindors, cheered him on, etc.

But when Rowling had him mimic parseltongue in book 7, because he heard it once, when he was 13 years old, I just kind of became done.

As far as I'm concerned, Ron can get his shit pushed in if it means I get a positive story for Harry, same for Snape, Dumbledore or any other character who's Main Cast in canon.

That said, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18196214/]]) is a good fanfic that I love that doesn't bash Ron at all. Go have fun.

*** Frankly, there's a reason the vast majority of these Ron-bashing fics happen in book 4 - his blatant disloyalty and jealousy pre-First Task is about as out-of-character as any fanfic's, unless you make the assumption that there's something different roiling underneath the surface.

Once that starts rattling inside your brain, certain conclusions are easier to draw, and those conclusions rarely become Ron-positive.

Adding to that, since Rowling always wrote Ron to be a sort of savant with far more talent in specific ventures than he'd ever had drive (apart from Quiddich, where even the most stalwart of critics will have to admit he trained his freckled hiney off), fics that focus on Harry training himself up to match the challenge he's up against very quickly sideline Ron, even in post-Triwizard stories.

My point, if I TL;DR it a bit, is that Ron is easy to bash because Rowling wrote him as an unsympathetic character in the 4th book, which many people consider to be the point where "shit got real";

If you need to see your "best mate" nearly get Reign of Fire-ed by a Hungarian Horntail to remember he's not a bad bloke and probably didn't lie to you about /not wanting to die for glory/, you're kind of a tosser.

Then people roll back to book 1, blame Ron for Hermione being in the bathroom with the troll (somewhat justifiably, even if he didn't do it intentionally and was just being a dumb, 12-year old boy), and that whole attitude just festers.

In Book 4 he was pretty OOC to think Harry wanted any kind of attention after he saw the things that happened in the other three years. But I guess they needed some drama.

Him needing to see Harry almost getting vaporized for him to realize that is pretty bad too, and Harry instant forgiving him is weird.

And about PS and that whole thing with the Troll, it's really not his fault, he had no way of knowing a /Troll/ was going to invade the castle and Hermione would be caught be it alone. All he's guilty of is being an ass to her.

  Ron pulled Harry aside after dinner. "Hey mate. I was thinking. Could you teach me how to say 'close' in Parseltongue? That way, if Bob ever got out of control you wouldn't be the only one who could do anything about it."

  Harry nodded in earnest agreement. "Good idea. We should teach Hermione as well."

  "Sure, sure, but I really think I've got a knack for this. Listen; ~gardener~. No wait, that didn't sound right. Umm... ~open~."

  Ron's pronunciation was a bit rough, but it got the point across. "Oh hey- that's brilliant! You remembered that from all the way back in the Chamber?"

  "No, you talk in your sleep."

  "I... I do? What do I say?"

  "How should I know? 'Open' is the only thing I recognized."

  "Oh. Well, 'close' is... ~close~."

  "~Fruitbat~."

  "No, ~close~."

  "~Nest raiders~."

  "One more try- ~close~."

  "~Close & wriggle seductively~."

  Harry clapped Ron on the back while suppressing a cackle. "Ahh... yeah. That'll work."

** As much as I do enjoy a bit of Ron bashing, it's mostly out of frustration. I just wish Rowling gave him a better chance in canon. He sort of never quite seems to develop as a character as much as he should. Harry is going around learning everything, Hermione's of course studying ahead, but Ron just keeps getting caught up on the same issues. What happened to him being good at strategy? How come he didn't teach Harry to shave or act as a big brother when he had such a great opportunity for that in his character? That said I've been trying to write the tropey ronbashing out of my works, because it's a bit of a cop out by now, and when fic writers actually write him well he can be magnificent.

Anyway if you want to see some serious Ron bashing, look up Keira Marcos. Pretty much all of her stories have him as an actual villain, and they're quite fun

The thing about Ron bashing that I don't often seem to see discussed is that as a trope it is usually more critical of Molly Weasley than Ginny and Ron. This goes anywhere from Ron and Ginny actually being Dumbledore's progeny by Molly to her coddling the two youngest children and trying to get them married, no matter if it takes some potions to work. it's sort of a matter of Ron is so lazy he can't even come up with his own ambitions. They're pretty fun but it's almost become fanon that Molly wants Harry to marry Ginny and Hermione to marry Ron, but that's just a part of the Weasley bashing thing. They also make Ron say ‘mudblood' which is wild, considering his response to it in book three

** Almost any Harmony story, unfortunately. I don't hate Harmony pairing as an idea, it may be even more natural from all we know from the books, especially because [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][Ginny is so poorly written]], but the constant bashing just makes those stories painful. Even in better ones (like “Escape by SingularOddities” linkffn(11916243), or “Notebooks and Letters by chem prof” linkffn(3867175)) there has to be a stupid lazy useless Ron in the background. In “Thank You Ms Bones by old-crow” linkffn(3230439) the author even blames Ron for his being starved to death, because apparently “If he'd ever bothered to learn anything from his brothers, rather than his endless obsession with chess, he would have picked the lock the first night that he was there and escaped.”

*** I'd argue that Ginny, in canon, is not so much poorly written , as... pretty much /not/ written. This isn't a character, it's just ten pages of random shit throughout 7 books.

I hated Ginny from 2003 to 2008 or so (but that that was more about the multitude of shitty fanfics that featured her). After that period I was pretty much neutral... it's not until I read The Changeling in 2012 that I realized what an injustice had been done to her character in canon. Shame on JK.

*** “Almost any Harmony story”...I don't know about that. There are plenty of Harry/Hermione stories that I have read that don't have any Ron bashing whatsoever. However, if you read Charlie/Hermione stories (my preferred ship at the moment), there's a ton of Ron bashing, especially given the fact that there aren't many Charlie/Hermione stories in the first place.

** Ron bashing isn't just defined as taking every single one of his flaws and using it as justification to shit on him when others like Hermione (who has plenty of her own flaws) get a pass, it also counts when his positive traits are taken from him and given to another character, such as what happened in the films, and the more common one that I actually find more annoying, when the author completely sidelines him and practically removes him from the plot. I just want to read a story where Harry has his best mate with him (also another point, Ron does not say "mate" anywhere near as much as he does in fanfic), and if the story's going to showcase his moments of jealousy I'm fine with that, but they better quickly make up.

*** Personally if an author doesn't like Ron, I rather have him become just a passing acquaintance to Harry than bashing.

In "raised by others Harry" they just didn't become friends.

Post-Hogwarts, it easy to write that life let them grow apart.

Lot of my school best friends I haven't seen in years. We moved, worked different hours, developped different interests and hobbies, choose partners that we don't really like, raise our kids in such différent ways that it makes it a bother to be all together.

Any of those things could happen between Ron and Harry, despite their strong friendship.

During hogwarts it's harder to do. But you could play the different interest angle (Ron is more into chess than in canon and become very involved in a chess club.)
