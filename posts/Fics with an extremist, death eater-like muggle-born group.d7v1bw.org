** I've always been curious to see an inversion of the Order-DE antagonism after the war. Voldemort and his Death Eaters were mostly Slytherins, hence Slytherins are evil. A Gryffindor recruits a band of zealots willing to "cleanse" the country from Slytherin "evil". Perhaps someone slighted during the War, losing his/her family.

*** That's essentially the plot of the alternate reality in "Warrior's Heir", except that the movement began pre-Voldemort in response to deaths during Grindelwald's campaign.

** Haven't read much of it (because it's not my kind of thing) but [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfE6l6RtZAsYlo4cG9IOG9nWnc][*/Dangerous by blacklotus/*]].

Gdocs link because original site it was on is gone.

Here is a description of it by a user named finebalance.

#+begin_quote
  Once you get past the premise, Dangerous is a brilliant post-DH dark!Hermione fic that is rather well-written, unexpectedly sexy, and unrelentingly interesting.

  A short summary: After 10 years of minimal contact, Harry returns to a wizarding Britain where Hermione is a terrorist (a violent dark lord with a muggleborn following), muggleborns are openly attacked, and peace and reconciliation are further than ever. Hermione is actually brilliant, but scary; there's a dissection of the often skewed nature of Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron; there's an exploration of societal prejudice and violent resistance, as well as the consequences of many things casually mentioned and rapidly forgotten in book 7 (muggleborns in Azkaban; student's being tortured in Hogwarts).

  The world is bleak and the author holds few punches. Naturally, as it is with fics that center around any particular character, Hermione is too smart, and the past a bit too conveniently explicated to her advantage - though, in the later chapters Harry does begin to counter that narrative.

*** I dislike it when authors do that to Hermione in fanfiction.

There's been multiple times in the books where her character was wrong, but they point to the event as if she was perfect/the victim.

Honestly, it reminds me a bit of Snape.

Edit: I was talking about explicating the past to her advantage, and that it reminds me of Snape fics where everything is shown to be the Marauder's/Lily's fault. I didn't get a chance to finish the thought. Not the whole badass dark lady Hermione part (even if it's not always my cup of tea).

** There is nothing (to fear) is a series of shorts/one-shots where Tom Riddle gets sorted into Gryffindor and forms the death eaters as a pro-muggleborn organization. Pretty fun read!

** linkffn(12398271).

It's a pretty weird fic, and there is a muggleborn group that is extremist, but it's a more or less semi-major semi-minor plot point in the story.

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
