It's by Saucery, called "The Secret-Keeper" I think? It's a oneshot, dub/non-con, ends with Hermione refusing to be shamed and thus Snape ignoring her in the end.


** If it was on fanfiction.net and you have the story ID (the number in the URL), I can probably find it my archive, which has a lot of stories.
