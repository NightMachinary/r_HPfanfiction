Hi is there a version of all the harry potter books, but told from Malfoy's point of view (not talking about comedic recreations of the story, looking for something that fits in with the original story)


** I am seriously contemplating doing this

** I considered writing a list of potential titles for all seven books, but they would have been comedic recreations, and more importantly, not actually stories.

Yea, I have seen things like those, which is what sort of compelled me to ask for something like this... but not the comedic recreation, an actual story that fits in with the original books
