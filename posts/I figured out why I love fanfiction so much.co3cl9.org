Because I hate the ending of Harry Potter so much. It is unbelievably anticlimactic. The battle Happens, everyone is in the moment sad and happy, but we don't see or hear about anyone's specific reactions other then Harry's, even though I am as invested in the side characters journey as I am Harry, he goes to sleep (I think after being up for an ungodly amount of time?? Did he sleep anytime after leaving shell cottage??). And then it just skips!! Whoo who happy ending!!!

All this world building, and world destroying during the war, and then we see absolutely nothing to build it back up and explain what in wizard God's name happened to anyone else before having kids at the same time.

Maybe it fooled me to be a satisfactory ending when I was 10 and it was the 7th book I ever read, but I can't believe a series so beloved by myself and everyone else ended this way.

I don't know what point would be a good ending, I am not a writer. But I just can't believe it ends with Harry going to bed. THIS IS WHERE IT ACTUALLY ENDS. THE 19 YEARS LATER IS AN EPILOGUE, A EXTRA BIT.

Edit : (What happens when Harry wakes up and remembers everyone he has lost? Is he depressed for years? Days? Where does he go immediately after? Does Hermione and Ron go with him?? Is it just a few weeks of Harry getting looked after by krecher and avoiding the world? Or does he help clean up? How does the ministry heal? Almost every single employed has done awful things, and there is barely any good people left. When does Hogwarts start running again? Do all students repeat their year due to not completing it properly?? How many muggle born kids were killed or saved? How many new ghosts?? When does Harry and Dudley reunite? What happens to his aunt and uncle? Do they become more tolerant of wizards or hate them more?? When do all the couple's get together officially?? When did they get married?? We're do they live?? Are house elves treated better now??? We know Hermione becomes minister, but does she actually do anything? When do Ron and Harry become aurors? Does Neville have kids too? Did lavender brown actually die? How many death eaters were left? How long did it take to find them all?

Some questions are answered online, but I hate having to dig deep to just find basic answers, I didn't have internet for years when I first read these, stuff like this should be in the book, or at least a new book. I would love to see the cast as adults trying to deal with everything)))

I read more fanfic then I can remember but I can't think of a time I was more disappointed with an ending then refinishing the series today.

But obviously , this makes it perfect fanfiction material. Would there be less fanfiction if the ending was better? Could I have had my beloved fanfictions and a less vague ending?

Holy Dumbledore I just want to know what happened in those 19 years.

Sorry for the rant if anyone ends up reading this


** The last two books are quite bad. Dumbledore is either self-delusional or utterly stupid, the idiot ball is passed like a bong and required for the plot to work (no one believing in Death Eater Draco, Dumbledore not doing anything about it, Harry not taking action on his own), literally no one considers that France is less than 50 miles from the UK and you could make that trip within half an hour on a broom, nevermind apparation or simply taking a ferry or plane. Harry and Hermione forgot about Tesco, which had more stores in 1997 than there were Death Eaters around (the random store in Leeds or Norwich could not be watched due to DE manpower limitations). The Muggleborns are systematically deported and hunted by death squads, the Death Eaters get a slap on the wrist at best if we go by Malfoy's fate (judging by Scorpius, he got at most 7 years). But sure, all was well.

I respect writers who try to make the best out of that dumpster fire, but IMO a fic pretty much has to diverge before 6th year in order to not be limited by the crappy arcs set up by Rowling for the finale.

*** The fact that nobody believed Harry when he said Draco was a death eater was unbelievable. The only problem anyone had about it was Dracos age. Like Voldemort wasn't the guy he tried to kill a baby and a 14 year old. If I was Voldemort I would be recruiting as many Hogwarts students as possible. He clearly doesn't care about ages.

Not to mention Harry is right almost all the time, and Ron rides the I Hate Draco Malfoy train hard too, but this is where he draws the line???

All your points are true too. I have too not think about anything just to slightly believe the story.

Like Hermione couldn't pack a bunch a tins of baked beans at the very least? She remembered every single thing but non perishable foods??

This all sucks because I have been a die-hard fan for nearly a decade. I want it to be good and I want to love it sooo much. But I just can't like the last couple of books that much.

**** Hermione went from "Malfoy might be it - let's steal ingredients, make this illegal potion, assault his goons, steal their identity and then infiltrate Slytherin" to "nope". Brewing Veritaserum might even pass as potion NEWT training, so that's one huge missed opportunity. Or Harry simply tearing Malfoy's robe in the great hall - No one will give him shit for it after he exposed a member of the magical SS in the middle of a school full of children.

Hermione: Let's just fucking wreck his shit. Full Gitmo.

Draco: I might not attend Hogwarts next year. I've been given a special assignment by Voldemort himself.

Hermione: That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

***** In fairness, she was 13 when she came up with the polyjuice plan, so I think it's reasonable that she'd be a bit less reactionary at 17, but there's no excuse for her dismissing out of hand the possibility that a guy who openly supports Voldemort's ideals and whose family was heavily involved in both the previous war and the beginning of the current one /might/ be working for him.
