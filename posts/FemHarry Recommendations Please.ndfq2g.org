Hey everyone üòä please share with me your favourite Fem!Harry fanfics. I'd prefer ones where Harry is turned into a girl via a potion or spell mishap over Girl Who Lived but I'll happily read anything you recommend. My OTP is Drarry so anything with that is definitely a plus ü•∞ and a good dose of Weasley bashing is always fun


** Does it count if Harry /wants/ to take the potion in question?

**** In that case, in a bout of shameless self promotion, I offer you /Harry Potter and the Continuity Crisis/.

It's not actually Drarry, and tbh, not much Weasley bashing... Though there is some Dumble bashing.

LinkAO3(Harry Potter and the continuity crisis)

There was another one, which I loved (and isn't mine) where Harry was slipped a potion by Fred and George and ended up liking being a girl so stayed.

And another very similar where he took it as part of "a prank".

But alas, I have forgotten the names of those....

There is also /With a little help from my friends/, which has a mostly cis-boy Harry who ends up having to dress as a girl for reasons. He does, by the most recent chapter, end up taking a potion to change his body. Ron ends up trans in that story. Again, no Drarry or Weasley bashing, but it's kinda fun. Sirius ends up a woman.

  The summer between her fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have been difficult for Harry Potter as she has spent too long being able to mull over her feelings. She's confused, and hurt that her friends haven't spoken to her, and with a slight crisis about her identity she's had nobody to turn to.We join her on her last evening before rejoining her friends.You know the characters, you know the settings, but with a *slight* tweak of fate, her life begins to diverge from canon. I hope you enjoy, and this is my first fanfic, please be nice... It won't be explicit but there may be mature aspects, hence the rating. I'll put a warning on the chapters if it goes above a teen in actual content.As of chapter 31, fifth year is complete and we're back into summer.

  On October 31, 1994 -- The champions for the Triwizard Tournament are announced. From this event, a great chain of events are set into motion that will change some lives, give Harry Potter some new chances, strengthen some friendships, and open doors that had never been opened before.

** Well, she's born female in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), but /isn't/ the Girl-Who-Lived; there was no war. Draco is one of her best friends, and has expressed romantic interest, but thus far she's done her best to avoid romance.

** If you don't mind self recs, I'm writing a female Harry/Girl Who Lived series, the first two years are fully posted, year three is being posted, and year four is with my beta while I start year five. It's not exactly bashing but it's not particularly Ron Weasley friendly.

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.
