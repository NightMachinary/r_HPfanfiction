** It does have a plot, but just barely. Radaslab couldn't have been bothered to write at a faster pace or to keep details of the plot correct, so there's a lot of plot holes and the entire story moves at a snail's pace. If you can look past both of those things, though, you might find it to be enjoyable.

** IIRC, there is plot, but consistency is a bit of an issue.
