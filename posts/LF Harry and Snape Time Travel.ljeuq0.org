I'm looking for fanfics where : - Harry and Snape time travel after they died - They return to their younger body (it doesn't have to always start on Hogwarts years. Harry and Snape could return before Harry came to Hogwarts) - I prefer that they don't know each other did time travel at the beginning - When Hogwarts start, Harry always looks at Snape with eyes of understanding and Snape gets confused LMAO - The fics can be drama or humour but please NO ROMANCE

I already read To Recollect The Future. So I'm looking for another fic. Thank you


** I was going to rec /Recollect the Future/, darn.

The only other one that at least kind of fits your requirements is /More Than One Way to Skin a Cat./ It's a bit crack-ish, but I thought it was funny and clever and surprisingly sweet or wholesome. There is definite Snape confusion. The tone is rather different from Recollect the Future though. It takes a while for Harry to come into the story. linkao3(20383987).

  Betad by Eider Down.Bleeding out on the floorboards, Severus greeted death as a friend.He wasn't expecting to wake up. One moment he was drifting away, and the next he was aware of his body again, just as sore as before. It felt approximately the way he imagined coming back from the brink of death should feel like, which was to say, fucking awful.Stuck in the past, inexplicably in the infant body of Harry Potter, and with his addled cousin by his side, Severus finds himself walking a metaphorical mile in a very different pair of shoes.A time travel fix-it. Likely the oddest Severitus (Sevitus) you'll ever read.
