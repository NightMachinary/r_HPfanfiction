How would Fleur's high opinion of herself ("Look how awesome I am and grovel at my feet you peasants") be balanced with the hidden warm and kind-hearted aspect of her personality?


** I feel like that Fleur being a bitch is mostly fanon. We don't even actually see her, specifically, being rude and disdainful at Hogwarts during the tournament. I think that's just Ginny and Molly being their usual, judgmental selves and projecting onto Fleur. All we really see is a young woman, confident in her abilities, and who is fiercely loyal to and protective of her loved ones.

*** Actually, agreed. Fleur comes off as being haughty at worst, not bitchy as I incorrectly described her as.

*** She does come across as a bit of a bitch when she's introduced, but once you get to book 6 she's fairly likable.

Fanon doesn't make Fleur bitchy all that much. They make her sad about her looks. In the books, Fleur goes out of her way to look down on Harry and Hogwarts during the Yule Ball. She was also very "outspoken" about the appearance of the burrow.

**** Her one comment about Harry being a “little boy” which I mean I would have been shocked if I show up to this supposedly prestigious and exclusive tournament and find out some scrawny 14year old, who looks perpetually confused, just got in. And once the situation is cleared, she keeps to herself. That's a hell of a lot better than everyone else at Hogwarts (even Harry's supposed friends-other than Hermione) In the books anyway. I disregard a lot of movie canon because it annoys me, tbh. As for her talking about the burrow, I don't think one mean comment -probably made out of frustration that your future mother-in-law irrationally hates you /just/ for being pretty and French- counts as a valid mark against her character.

Her goodness and loyalty far far outweighs those few comments imo. Just look at how distraught she was when she thought her little sister was hurt, and how genuinely grateful she was to Harry for thinking to save her. And then how she refused to be swayed away from Bill's side despite his family being a bag of douches to her. And then /she still/ decided to risk her neck to help Harry and the Order. When she was pregnant and could have decided to ask Bill that they leave the country to be with her family in France for a bit. It would have been perfectly reasonable, too. She /chose/ to stay

***** Molly doesn't dislike Fleur for being pretty and French. She disliked her because Fleur was the final nail in the coffin for her view of Bill as her little boy .Molly was beginning to feel the pangs of empty nest syndrome and having Fleur around accelerated those feelings. Molly would've reacted the same if Fleur was a mousy Hufflepuff girl from Chelsea

****** Oh for sure about it being about Bill, but her being strange and foreign couldn't have helped. Also, Molly is canonically quick to judge (and harshly) and then never apologizing when she's proved to wrong. Honestly, I forgive Hermione and Ginny for being judge-y because they're legit teenagers and I mean they have to endure their crushes going all moon-eyed whenever she's around. Them being a little salty is, while kindachildish, makes sense at least since they're literally kids. Molly has a history of being rude and dismissive of literal teenagers from crap she reads on witch freaking weekly and Rita Skeeter tripe (who she /knows/ is a cancer, but she believed it anyway) I like Molly for her willingness to bring in Harry as her own, but she's super annoying as well :/

****** Don't get me started on Molly...there are only a few HP-Characters I like less...seriously, doesn't work despite her family having money problems (even after Ginny left the house for Hogwarts!), thinks she's the world's parent of the millenium (the opinions of others don't count, she is always right...kind of like a dumb version of Hermione who focused on being a rabbit rather than become Minister for Magic!), thinks everybody is her workforce (why was it the kid's job to help her clean up Grimmauld-Place? Do it yourself Molly, you have magic, while you don't allow the kids to use it, despite the house being warded!), she hampers her kids education (they could do magic at home, because the trace doesn't work when adult wizards live at a place, as well!) etc. etc.

Never said they didn't. She can be all these things at once. It's what makes her an interesting character.

*** Well, she calls him a little boy!

There's also the thing that she never cleans up her English - I mean I myself am not a native speaker but I am quite proud of not having much of an accent (if anything my accent is American - too much US-Television, especially Stargate and Star Trek and other TV-Series!) - which comes accross as bitchy ("I don't need better English, I am French and beautifull...now lick my boots!")

If she could at least back it up, but in the Tournamet Fleur isn't super great...Cedric is better than her and so is Harry, despite his age/education disadvantage!

**** There is... so much wrong with this attitude behind your “logic” that I can't even... idk if I even have the effort to explain to you why everything you just said is so so messed up. I think I'd rather you figured it out yourself. I can't hold your hand through you figuring out how to not be so judgmental.

** Can you give an example (quite of her being that way)? I don't think we saw that in the books. And even if she were, being good looking and knowing it does not make you an overall terrible person.
