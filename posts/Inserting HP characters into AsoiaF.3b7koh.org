** I absolutely hate crossovers that cross more than one character. Sorry.

**** I've always felt that the best way to keep conflict is to cross over at age 14. Harry at the end of GoF would be best. He knows enough magic to be useful--shield, some hexes and curses, some transfiguration, some useful charms--but he can't do the stuff that's world-breaking (apparition, legilimency, imperius).

Ensemble casts just feel messy to me. Inelegant, arbitrary, convenient. They also reduce the interest of a crossover, which is the discovery of and adjustment to a new world, and in particular interactions between characters from the different worlds. What's the point of putting these characters in ASOIAF if you're replacing all the interesting ASOIAF characters with them? It feels borderline insulting to the ASOIAfverse to mutilate their universe so much my transposing so much HP into it. I always feel like crossovers should be written with respect for both fandoms involved.

Also, they tend to be written in such a way as to have the characters just going around making 4th-wall-breaking observations of their new world, winking at the audience, enjoying "witty banter" that's just not funny, breaking the tone of the world, breaking realism, and being just annoying in general.

**** Easiest way to nerf magic without actually altering the magic system (which upsets many people) is not to give them wands and make them have to use their magical knowledge to figure out new ways of casting magic. Make it so their knowledge and experience of magic is still applicable (HP wizards seem to have innate magic, not environmental magic, so it would still follow the same rules), but they have to develop new tools to use it.

  Draco - Viserys Targaryen

I used to think there would be /no way/ to kill Viserys off sooner through his own idiocy, but by Jove you've done it.

** Interesting Idea. Best cross over that I have read with ASOIAF is The Prince that was Promised or The Black Prince now.\\
What is the goal of the story though. What kind of arcs do you want the characters to go through and grow as a result? Example might be Harry and Hermione learning valuable lessons that this world is not theirs. If you are just in this world you will get wrecked. You must learn how to balance justice and power in order to be an effective leader and achieve the goals you want. ASOIAF is a much harsher world compare to HP and I hope your story can reflect that.

**** Interesting, however in this case Tommen would be super OP because he has access to the best players in the game. All he has to do is imperious the key players and all the sudden game is over. In ASOIAF its the political players that matter. The one that acts first and have access to the players will be really over powered with no literal means to stop them. In this case, any one that starts from Kings Landing will be OP by default.

****** The characters would probably start with very limited magical power because technically magic in ASOIAF was weak when the story started.\\
I didnt see Myrcella as an important figure because Daphne was not important nor magically powerful in HR world. Why would she be equal or as important in this world?\\
If people were able to break the spell through will power, than there must be consequences for Tom. Would be too easy for Tom to find this out the hard way and gets killed right away which defeats the purpose of having him in that world.

** /reads this through and pauses at Harry - Robb Stark and Tonks - Jeyne Westerling/

You sadistic writer... Mind you... I could see that as being a very plausible death for Harry and Tonks in that universe anyway. XD

** This is kind of fun! I think I'd put Harry as Jon Snow, or maybe as Daenearys, simply because I think of Robb as dead, and a dead end, and those other two more likely to win and save the day. I can see Diary Tom as Tommen, sure, but also an adult Voldy as either Roose Bolton or Tywin Lannister.

** Harry as Robb Stark would be a great fit; a popular, successful, but acts rashly and is ultimately doomed to lose the war and die due to not being able to see how his decisions could create enemies of allies. Draco as Viserys is great. The rest... not so much.

** Have you considered simply having an ISOT event, rather than character reincarnations? Have Hogwarts suddenly appear somewhere in Westeros (bonus points for it replacing Harrenhal). Watch the players of the Game of Thrones scramble to deal with the disturbances the appearance of Wizards have caused, while nobles all try to marry off their sons and daughters to these powerful new sorcerer. After all, the Valyrian Freehold was ruled by families who held sorcerous powers, so the canny nobles would seek to obtain this power at all costs, especially once they realize just how much power these "wizards" wield, compared to other practitioners of magic.

For inspiration on something like this, I would recommend reading 1632, by Eric Flint. The plot is that an American town from 2000 is sent into the middle of Germany during the Thirty Years War, and then we follow various characters as history is changed.

The best part of something like this is that you can easily have PoV characters from both universes - and I simply do not feel that a fanfic truly has ASOIAF in it unless we see some of the characters we know and love.
