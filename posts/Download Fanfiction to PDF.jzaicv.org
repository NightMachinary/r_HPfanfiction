I was wondering if anyone knew of sites I could download fanfiction.net to PDF or text without a program download as I use a tablet. FF2EBook,FicSaver, and FanFictionDownloader don't seem to work. Plus, Omnibuster is no longer available ðŸ˜¢. Thanks!


** For specific fics, you can check to see if they're on Ao3, which has the download to pdf function automatically available. I have also gone the agonizingly long route of saving each chapter to PDF.

**** If you're on AO3 there should be a "download" button in the upper right corner. In the same section as "next chapter" and "chapter index," etc.

**** Which browser do you use? There should be a "print page" or "download page" option (check the "share" options too, if you can't find any of those). I do this using the Chrome app on my phone (Android) and it works just fine.

** Why don't just install an epub reader on your tablet? On Android I can throw any format to [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.obreey.reader][PocketBook]], if this is an old tablet or no support for Playstore, you can sideload [[https://www.apkmirror.com/uploads/?q=aldiko-book-reader][old version of Aldiko]]. If it's an iOS, Apple Books supports [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201478][adding your own ePub]] or you can just use [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocketbook-reader/id805488884][PocketBook]] that doesn't involve jumping through hoops.

I noticed you mention "or text", I just tried [[https://ficsave.xyz/][FicSave]] and [[https://fanfictionloader.appspot.com/][FanFictionDownLoader]] to download the text version from a short FF.net fic with 6 chapters, both work well (though FicSave is way faster). Keep in mind FanFictionDownLoader will definitely die soon due to GAE billing changes.

You can also use one of those online epub to PDF converters, though I really implore you to use epub instead, pinching to change font size directly, using custom fonts, any background and text colors, etc, they're far better than PDF.

** I don't know how to do it on a tablet directly but if you can get access to a PC then a program like fanfiction downloader which does PDF and other formats, would work then connect the tablet to the PC with the USB cable and copy the PDF to it.

If it's an android tablet it should show up and be accessable like a USB stick or hard drive but if it's an iPad it's a little more diffecult but I'm sure there are planty of youtube tutorials.

If you have a mac I'm not sure if the software has a mac version but you can check the website.

Sorry I couldn't be more help,
