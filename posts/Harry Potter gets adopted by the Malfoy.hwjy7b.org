After the death of Lily and James Potter, Harry is orphaned and left to a very distraught Sirius Black who brings him to Grimmauld Place, with no idea of what to do of him. The very idea that Peter sold his best friends, his brother-in-wand, infuriates him and decides to chase him, resulting in his imprisonment. Kreacher, too old to take care of a baby, sends her to one of the few branches of the Blacks that he knows of, his mistress Narcissa 'Cissy' Black and the house of Malfoy.

There, he is taken care of in secret and grows up in secret, an adoptive brother to Draco with frequent rivalries but also a great political asset to Lucius Malfoy, who tries to mold him into an unconventional ally that could redeem him in front of the Wizarding community of Great Britain.

Eventually, his Lord returns, only to learn that the Potter scion is close, very close to one of his most faithful lieutenants, but what he doesn't know is that Lucius will bring Draco and Harry to be the Dark Lord's betrayal and defeat, respectively, and regain their independence once more.

Obviously, Harry's school years begin with a panicking Dumbledore who didn't know what had happened to him after Godric Hollow cottage's disappearance, only to discover he is at the hands of the Malfoys /(ensues political war between kind-yet-scheming-grandfatherly-figure and the deatheater-in-command/); sorting in Slytherin, which is a scandal in school and the Daily Prophet, for a Potter to land in the house of Salazar and making him even more determined and ambitious in making a name for himself, not being the result of a sacrifice; Ginny Weasley who wanted to marry the Boy-Who-Lived getting rejected harshly because she belongs to a clan of Blood-Traitors; eventual Haphne pairing; etc.


** Dumbledore to majority of Gryffindors,Ravenclaws,Hufflepuffs,Order members and Hogwarts staff : "Ok,so the Potter kid is an absolute dipshit. We gotta do this ourselves. We'll kill all the Death Eaters and destroy all the Horcruxes while they're having a verbal wankfest in their commonroom. Then we capture Voldemort and use a Compulsion Charm to make Potter finish him off. Sound like a plan ?"

Everyone else : "Totally"

Dumbledore "Epic"

*** Unfortunately I have the ideas but I'm not good at writing them.

First, I'm not fluent enough in English to have my wording faithful to my ideas. Second, I've already tried and the ten chapters I've put on a previous fanfiction trial over Fanfiction(dot)net is a definite failure in my mind.

Hence the prompt.
