I have read many fics where one or more students (usually the Golden Trio) up and decide that something /is Their Business/ simply because it interests them or has something to do with someone whom they know or are aquaintenced with. (Philosopher's Stone, anyone?) I have read countless fanfiction over a variety of fandoms where the distinctions between *Secrecy*, *Deceit*, and *Privacy* is completely blurred over. I have read /plenty/ of fics where a student is up in arms because his/ her friend is /hiding something/, so that must mean that they are either *(1) Not To Be Trusted*, or *(2) Being A Bad Friend Because They Don't Trust Us And That's Wrong Because We're Supposed To Be Friends.* It's so dramatic and idiotic. Like... are people not allowed to have personal boundaries? Because their personal boundaries get stomped and trampled on all the frickin' time. And then the character whose privacy has been invaded (or, worse, exposed to the masses) realizes that /he/she needs to trust his/her friends Because That's What They're There For./

Are there any fics where ANYONE actually gets comeuppance from being a pushy brat who doesn't know when to leave well enough alone? Any fics where a scolding actually sinks in, or where they actually push someone (be it a friend or an authority figure) too far by delving uninvited into that person's private affairs?

This mindset of "We are FRIENDS; and THERFORE we /Must Share Everything/ because /We Need To Be Able To Trust Each Other/"... it just... gets to me... so much.... because it is so blatantly and unapologetically invasive and disrespectful, I can't even.


** This tend to only happen with Hermione bashing fics, and is usually only a way for the author to bash her, and not to actually do something about this trope

** I would love to see this. I've read a lot of fics lately where Ron and Hermione demand to know EVERY detail of Harry's life and I can't imagine putting up with that.

*** And it's immensely satisfying when he tells them to bugger off.

** It sounds like the sort of stories young people who are learning how to navigate social relationships might write. I see a lot of these kinds of negotiations going on in the Middle School where I work. Learning how to be a good friend and respect a person's need for privacy takes a long time and usually involves many missteps. I cringe thinking about my own stumbling around that I did at that age.

** I see this ALL THE TIME in Harry Potter crossover fics. Which ever character(s) go(es) to Hogwarts end up as DADA professor or transfer student. Because the trio doesn't know them and they act differently(even though it's usually stated they're from outside the country) there is instant suspicion. Cue stalking, eavesdropping, B&E and the character ends up spilling their life's story along with all the info as to why they're there. It's annoying. The only exception I've seen is a FMA/HP crossover with fem Ed where after the trio gets caught in her office she rips them a new one. After Harry says he deserves to know everything, she goes on a tirade, kicks them out, and the trio gets ZERO info. It was supremely satisfying.

She chews them out in chapter 6 towards the end but the whole fic itself is a good read. I recommend it.
