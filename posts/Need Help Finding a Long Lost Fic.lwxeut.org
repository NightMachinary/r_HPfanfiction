:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
[EDIT 3:] This question has been resolved and the events listed take place in two different fics entitled Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic & Harry Potter and the Four Founders

Wondering if anyone here has ever read a fic that had the following events take place (I know that most of the following events took place in the same fic, and I believe it's possible that they all did)

- Number 4 Privet Drive is attacked and Harry narrowly escapes while the Dursley's receive a horrid death including their eyes being removed before they die

- Someone (Dumbledore I believe) receives a letter from somebody named Blazewing which later turns out to be Harry taking on a nickname in memory of the Marauders

- A love ritual is performed to help Harry defeat Voldemort. As part of the ritual, Draco hesitantly but willingly agrees to sacrifice himself for Harry, however it turns out only a drop of his blood was needed for the ritual (EDIT: This one has been resolved)

- I think (keyword: think) while said ritual is taking place, Harry is receiving a much worse yet similar death to the one that I mentioned earlier which was inflicted upon the Dursleys

- (THIS ONE COULD BE UNRELATED BUT I THINK IT'S THE SAME FIC) Harry and Draco organise to duel each other in the great hall with all of Hogwarts watching. Draco attempts a killing curse and nearly succeeds but Harry manages to pull off some ridiculous shield that protects him from the AK (EDIT: This one has been resolved)

- [EDIT:] I also recall Draco removing his dark mark to prove his loyalty to the side of the light but he was forced to take it again and instantly informed Harry and Dumbledore. This led to them going to Severus and with him, planning to fake Dumbledore's death in a very similar fashion to his canonical death

- [EDIT 2:] I further recall that Occlumency had a role in the story (and no I am not thinking of the fic, Searching for the Power). Luna had her mind organised like a zoo, and there was a Hellhound type beast in her mindscape which represented her love for Harry. Later in the story during the final battle, Harry performs an animagus transformation into the same Hellhound from her mindscape

If anyone knows what fic/fics I might be thinking of, I would really appreciate the answer you may have. Thanks again everybody, have a good one ‚úåüèΩ

  The morning after the ministry fiasco, something amazing happens to Harry Potter. He discovers not just the truth behind his heritage, but also the unique and pressing obligations that come with it. Powerful Harry, multi-ship, no slash. Inspired by Gryffindor's Heir of Magic.

**** No problem. If I remember correctly it does handle Draco and the various dark marks (removal, return of) and him spying for Harry

** The golden shield that repells an AK during a duel with Draco sounds like a scene in the story Harry Potter and the Heir of Magic by LordBladeDSF.

  Voldemort killed Harry the first time around. So, Merlin sees fit to send him back to change things. What will happen when Harry comes to Hogwarts, with the power to change the world? Harry/Harem, Super/God-Like Harry, Time Travel, AU.
