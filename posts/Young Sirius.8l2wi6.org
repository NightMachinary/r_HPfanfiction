Almost all the Marauders' era fanfics include a Sirius playing beater for Gryffindor. Is this canon? it bothers me, because i think i remember him saying to harry something about /watching/ James play. I could be wrong though. Still, Sirius doesn't strike me as a Quidditch player.


** I don't think he played. I think James was the only one that did.

** It's never stated one way or the other.

Even the 'watching' comment could refer to early years, and then Sirius joined after James.

** It's not canon that he was a quidditch player, let alone a specific position.

That said, my headcanon was that he played for a year or two, not the whole time he was potentially eligible, and either as beater or chaser. I don't see him as a keeper or seeker.

** Meh, there's no canon answer to this. I've written him as both playing and not - either spent so much time being forced to keep whilst James was practicing that he ends up a Keeper in his later years, or else playing the bad-boy to James' jock-boy and being too cool for organised sports.

I'd agree with girlikecupcake though that I don't see him as a seeker, but I personally don't see him being a chaser when James was so likely to show him up at it. Sirius was James' partner, not his sidekick after all.

** I could have sworn they mentioned it in OotP when they had the discussion of Remus being a prefect, but it's been so long since I read it. It's probably fannon

** I love this post because it gives me an excuse to link you this one-shot based entirely on this debate about whether Sirius played Quidditch or not.

And I don't see Sirius as much of a jock when he was younger, but I think that if he were, he definitely would have played beater.

  Sirius, flying: a one-shot. "Mr. and Mrs. Black never bought their sons broomsticks..." and Sirius Black never played in a single game of Quidditch at Hogwarts. Though, because James Potter was his best friend, he DID try.

** It's never said anywhere that he played at all. It's very much a dealers choice. I think in some cases, it's a call-back to fics we've read where he is. In my case, I gave him the role after leaving home as a bit of a cohesive team statement, a good outlet and because James had annoyed the ever loving crap out of him for literally years about trying out and he gave in.

** I'm of two minds.. on one hand, I don't interpret Sirius as a particularly sporty type.. but on the other hand, he might have done it just because James was.
