I like Grindelwald okay. That's the basis of my request. I am looking for some fics with characters like him. Um, someone who's seductive and manipulative. Someone you can see yourself joining without context.


** I don't see myself "joining without context" regardless of charisma, but I did find Professor Quirrell to be quite...impressive?...in Methods of Rationality. He doesn't actually like very many people, but he's highly intelligent, speaks well, and knows how to read people. A born manipulator.

The story is quite long, though. It's on fanfiction.net, but the best mirror is at [[http://hpmor.com]]

** That's why learning from history is important.

Generally, those charismatic demagogues say one thing and do the other. What they promise is very different from they deliver.

But there are times when the status quo is no longer acceptable, when the existing regime must be overthrown, when a revolution is a necessity.

The time after the Battle of Hogwarts is such one. That incompetent and malicious failed state aka the British Ministry of Magic must be thoroughly purged and rebuilt from ground up.

*** Well, sometimes Grindelwald does exactly as he says ;). linkffn(Reformed, Returned and Really Trying).

Edit: [[/u/starfox][u/starfox]] there's a typo in the story summary, "one wizard left continue" should be "one wizard left to continue".

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.
