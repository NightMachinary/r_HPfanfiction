I'm looking for a fanfic about Dumbledore's post-Hogwarts years. I basically want to read about what he did in between Hogwarts and when Voldemort turned Harry into a horcrux. I'm still pretty new to fanfic, so sorry if I sound like an idiot.


** Check out Taure's fic, whose name escapes me at the moment. The one where Fawkes gives Harry his memories.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

*** I read it, it was really good, but the ending did confuse me a bit.
