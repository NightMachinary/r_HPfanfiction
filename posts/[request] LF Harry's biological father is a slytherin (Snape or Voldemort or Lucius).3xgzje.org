There are a lot of Guardian/Mentor Snape fics out there and a quite a bit of biological Snape, though not as much (I read maybe 5 fics?) and I was wondering if there is more? (Trying to search through ffn goes mostly to mentor/guardian snape or sometimes Remus or Sirius raised and thats not what I want.) SO Requirements: * BIOL. father is a slytherin.

*Harry finds out PREFERABLY late(r), as in maybe 3rd year up

*kidfics are fine too though, as in raised by said father/ found out as a kid/ got rescued from Dursleys etc

/but I really want the element of surprise so I'd rather he somehow finds out and 'le gasp' omg how did *that/ happen

*How they became his father is irrelevant to me (one night stand with lily, actually not lily's either like in linkffn(Crovus Black) etc. all is fair game)

*longer fics, say 30k up

*I'd love for him to be charmed to look like James if possible, that charm wears off (not necessary but always a cool gimmick) Ideas? Cheers :)

  Because of a student death, new measures are being taken to screen students for abuse. With Dumbledore facing an enquiry, Snape is in charge of making sure every student receives an examination. Abused!Harry. Character death. Sevitis. In answer to the "New Measures for Screening Abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. Yes, it is a "Snape is Harry's biological father" story.

*** I was going to suggest these! Seriously, I kept passing up Digging for Bones because of the summary, but after I finally read it... Damn is it good fic.

And In Blood Only is possibly one of my absolute favorite fics of all time. Seriously. It's soooo good. The characters are fantastic, and there's so much character growth. And the characters feel so true to form! Ugh. This fic is just so good.

*** Blood Magic is one I reread. It's a hot chocolate fic for me, really. The dialogue is completely brilliant, and the details just really draw me in. And while it obviously departs from canon, it manages to keep enough of Snape's backstory canon compliant for me to not get frustrated at him having a completely incorrect backstory.

  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.
