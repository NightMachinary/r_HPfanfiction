I have read several stories where Harry goes to a different school and they are usually much more realistic and challenging schools. Are there any stories where Hogwarts is actually challenging with good teachers and a hard curriculum?


** I've got to say, I feel bad for the dorm masters. No wonder they're not involved, they're all teaching core classes from first years straight through graduation. That's a lot of grading.

Are there any stories where Hogwarts is a more plausible boarding school? With school matrons, weird mandatory extras, and all that?

** Its disciplinary and security issues aside, academically, Hogwarts already is a good, challenging school. Hogwarts curriculum covers in 5 years what Durmstrang and Beauxbatons cover in 6. Outside of DADA, teachers are at the top of their professions and are at least adequate pedagogues (even Snape), and even in DADA, students are, generally, managing to learn enough to do well on the OWLs.

Canon Harry, in particular, finds the curriculum plenty challenging: he is constantly complaining about how much work he'd been assigned and is often shown putting in a great deal of effort into learning new spells. Now, consider that Harry is actually a significantly above-average talent: Hogwarts is not an easy school for anyone.

Now, I can't speak for all "different schools" Harry attends in fanfic, but much of the time, the reason they tend to be shown as more "challenging" is that these fics tend to be about how much more badass "their" Harry is than his canon counterpart. (Heck, the most famous exemplar of the genre --- /Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/ by the Santi --- actually has "Nathan" Potter go through canon adventures in Hogwarts, with the author going out of his way to show the superiority of Durmstrang-attending "Harry" every time they meet. [1])

The reason they might come off as more "realistic" is that these fics are usually very serious and drop the whimsy and the satirical elements of the canon books.

--------------

[1] I'm not saying that it's a bad fic. I think it's a very good fic, and its vision of Durmstrang has become my headcanon for it; but that doesn't change how it treats Hogwarts.

**** Good question; I could've sworn that I was on firm ground with this, but on double-checking, what we get is the following line from HBP:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜At Beauxbatons,' said Fleur complacently, â€˜we 'ad a different way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then --'
#+end_quote

At that point, she gets interrupted, so we don't get to learn anything more, and it is far from given that French equivalent of OWLs isn't one year more advanced than the British OWLs.

There is another piece of indirect evidence: that Cedric was a 6th-year when he entered TWT, whereas Krum was already 18 during Quiddich cup and has thus almost certainly had more years of schooling. We don't know whether Fleur was older than Cedric, but the balance of probabilities that she probably was (since most students of age would have been in their 7th year of schooling). That a Hogwarts 6th-year was considered competitive with Beauxbatons's and Durmstrang's (probable) 7th-years is suggestive.

Still, the evidence is much weaker than I had thought, and in retrospect, I shouldn't have made that claim with the certainty I had. My apologies. The rest of my case holds up better, I think.

******* Well that explains it thanks ðŸ™ƒ

I thought hover menus were pretty much phased out because of the issue they pose with mobile browsers. Would be nice if the 3D Touch on iPhone would recognize a soft-tap as a hover and a subsequent soft-tap or a 3D-tap as actually tapping the link, so that functionality is the same for everything unless it's a hover-able link in which case you get the hover first.

Quick search showed [[http://usabilitypost.com/2010/05/12/css-hover-controls-on-iphone/][this]] article explaining how to get around hover links. Too bad the website designer didn't look that up for an easy workaround for iPhone. I don't think ".link" works on other OS so I guess the issue is still there. Website devs should just stop using it without an accessible alternative.
