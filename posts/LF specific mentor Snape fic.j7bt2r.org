on ao3. it wasn't very long when I read it, 2-3 chapters and I was just wondering if it had an update but can't find it now. Harry was a child, before Hogwarts. don't know at what age.

I believe in the description Harry was describing his cupboard and how it was his safe space and he liked it. in the first chapter it was from his POV and there was a stranger looking at the cupboard (with him in it) and it made him angry, because it was his cupboard and he liked it and he was looking at it with contempt. the stranger was Snape. then Snape I think set fire to the house and took Harry with him, maybe there was blood on him so he killed the Dursleys for sure. in the next chapter after taking Harry to his house, Snape went to Minerva and they talked, though I don't think he told her the true. Snape was a wreck. when he came from Minerva Lucius was in his house and the chapter ended on the cliffhanger.

so it was only the beginning of the story and no mentor yet, just getting him out. I was hoping there would be at least one new chapter to it. hopefully it wasn't discontinued, it was good.

I remember it being written in a specific style with quite a lot of purple prose similar to older literature. so not HP style or usual fanfic style. very descriptive.


** if someone is interested, I found it. linkao3(24233929)

it's only the two chapters and the author deleted their account. so... it's discontinued. so sad, it was really good. why can't we have nice things. /sad

  The door cracked open behind Harry."Come, Mr Potter, it would appear that we have outstayed our welcome tonight."Harry thought that Severus looked a lot better, he had stopped his shaking and his eyes were focused right again. He ignored the drops of crimson, slowly seeping through the strange robe's sleeve, falling to the stone below, wondering if maybe Vernon though Severus was a Freak too.Now- Harry vaguely noted- the lady on Number 8 was moving. Running, in fact, towards him."Yes, sir." Harry whispered, eyes wide and so bright in the shallow moonlight.He didn't think that Severus heard it over the wail of nearing sirens, but he took Harry's hand none the less.~~~Severus was not made to be a father, he did not want to be made a father. And yet, somehow, he ended up with something of a child. A strange child that soaks up his knowledge like a sponge, a strange child with an uncanny ability to read him, a strange child that acts as a beacon for all those who wish to kill him. ~~~
