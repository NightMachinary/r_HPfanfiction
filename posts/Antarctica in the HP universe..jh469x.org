I was wondering, what is the role of Antarctica in the HP world. It is an ice-covered desert for the mundane people, but is Antarctica different for magical people?

Perhaps a sealing ground for all the nightmares of humanity, or a sealed portal to the other dimensions. Or maybe it is not possible to effectively use magic in Antarctica because of a combination of ancient lingering magic and the magnetic south pole's effects. Or maybe Antarctica is the lost Atlantis, erased from all known history.

What are your thoughts on this? If you believe that Antarctica is not special, then can it not be used as a place for building up a secret base? Travel is not an issue if you have portkeys/know apparition.


** I like the idea of it being a sort of Neutral Sealing Ground that everyone collectively agreed to Stay The Fuck Off Of because the Great and the Good all use it to dump their Magical Equivalents of Nuclear Waste and Lovecraftian Monsters there.

"Where do Vanished things go?"

"Antarctica, professor."

"...what?"

Even Lovecraft himself got into that a little bit, with a dash of the Atlantis thing, in the Mountains of Madness story. Arctic Explorers run across the dead remnants of an Ancient Civilization of Monstrous Beings. But that is not dead which can eternal lie...

I say 'everyone' collectively agreed, but that'd just be government and law-abiders. There'd probably be a fucktonne of scavengers and dark wizards there, trying to pilfer or dominate what got sealed away.

Oooh. I might actually try write that. That sounds fun.

** Not sure about canon but there's probably a lot of magical creatures and sentient species probably living there. In a few fanfics there's an elite academy there and one deleted novel whose name and plot I can't remember the ICW unspeakables use it as a special containment facility.

** There's a secret magical facility on the south pole in Linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy). It's on solid ground below the ice, straight under the Amundsen-Scott Station which causes some problems.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

** My 14 year old OC was a Garry Sue from Antarctica. It was a secret dragon preserve that was spelled to be cold only on the boarders. Only 1/3rd of the continent is accessible to muggles.

Edit/clarification: OC was from when I was 14 the OC was not 14 years old

** I think there's a good chance most wizards don't know Antarctica even exists. I'd bet only muggleborn and certain academic circles are in any way familiar with it.

Antarctica wasn't discovered until the the mid 1800's, and no landings were made until near the turn of the century. This is all well after the Statute of Secrecy.

There's probably a couple magizoologists embedded in the research bases canvassing the coastline for signs of magical creatures in order to cover them up before the muggles see them.

As far as anti-social dark-wizards go, there are much better options for places to set up a secret base that aren't quite so ridiculously inhospitable and inconveniently hard to get to even with magic.

** It is a very inhospitable place, maybe too much even for a permanent magical settlement. As far as things living there, even magical things, the amount of available food, needed calories/magic just to stay alive likely means you wouldn't have anything more than penguins. At least, as far as creatures of flesh go.

Now, that doesn't mean that things didn't live there in the past, the continents have drifted, it might have been full of life at one point. If you can get through the ice, you can probably find very interesting fossils or possibly even dormant/enchanted sleeping creatures depending on how your fanfic's magic works.

Plus sides for a Hermione/parents/Harry trip to Antartica:

1-Likely no dark wizards!

2-Interesting fossils to secure or use in magical rituals/really cool familiar ideas if they're still breathing/asleep. (Or you could use magic for that, as in you found an extinct species of animal? use a ritual to force a similar animal to give birth to the extinct species instead of her own.)

3-With a wizarding tent, charms, and a bottomless pantry you can likely survive. Combine muggle heating unit with unlimited fuel supply!

4-the British Ministry of Magic has no authority to tell you not to use magic! Summer spellcasting: use it for training, fun, and exploration!

5-How long has the land been frozen/not see life? interesting stones/magical reagents.

6-Lost civilizations! Maybe?

7-Stagate: SG1 crossover! A bunch of possibilities, they find the stargate under the ice, they look up and see the battle of antartica, they find a ancient spaceship/lab/prison/anything you can imagine!
