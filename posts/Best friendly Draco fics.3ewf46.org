  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

  #+begin_example
            In which Draco Malfoy returns from the future and nearly falls the hell over\.
          "103: My commander is not old enough to have fought in the Civil War, and I should stop implying that he did\."\- 213 Things Skippy is No Longer Allowed to Do in the U\.S\. Army
          The first part of this fic — through the end of Draco's first year — was written entirely during National Novel Writing Month 2010, and has been edited only in the loosest sense of the term \(notes and such removed, bits about head crabs in the forbidden forest expunged, et cetera\)\. If Draco seems a bit OOC, realize that this Draco has been through all seven books as written in canon \(minus the epilogue; while I like little Scorpius, he's not exactly here, is he?\), and for his enlightened self\-interest is attempting to make a change\. He's still a little prat, and hopefully he'll grow a little more as the story goes on\. So there that is\.As I transfer this over to Ao3 from FF\.net, I'm also taking a stab at minor editing \-\- and I'm combining what was once "The Last Second Chance" with the beginnings of "Advancing To the Rear" and continuing from there\.

*** I've had With Strength on Steel Wings recommended before but I put off reading it and I can't remember why. Does it feature sexual violence, or it a Draco/Hermione ship? I tend to avoid both.

**** No sexual violence, and I don't remember whether there was any D/H in that story, sorry. I think the latest chapters had the overused [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension][bickering = romance]] bullshit drama though.

Non-related, but you can add [[/s][spoiler]] to your blacklist as well.

Yeah that is why I dislike Ron/Hermione too. Two people don't get along, they must be in love. I think its degrading to the characters.

** Innocent -> Initate -> Identity

Has a friendly Draco that is part of the /'Golden Trio'/ but it doesn't happen until Initate when they finally get to hogwarts.

But i dare say that this may be the best friendly draco i have ever read as it's realistic. non-slash and non-ron bashing are always a plus

*** I really love this series. Innocent is all pre-Hogwarts for anyone that is interested. It is slow burning, but well worth the effort.

*** They watched the musical on YouTube titled "A Very Potter Musical" which happens to feature what I think is a hilarious version of Draco Malfoy.

** Hm, not a golden trio but it definitely features a friendly Draco. Super angsty and pretty violent, but one of my favorite stories! Its DM/HG, completely AU. Really, really well written though. More plot than romance, though the romance is necessary for the plot. Maybe give it a go.
