Ever since I realised that Harry got his quick seeker reflexes from dodging punches and frying pans when growing up, I have been finding it hard to enjoy quidditch in fanfictions...


** While he did hone his reflexes by dodging punches, he also pretty clearly inherited good reflexes from his Quidditch star father.

So it's not all bad-- some of it's one more gift from the man who loved him and died so he could live and enjoy Quidditch.

** So, he turned something negative, into something positive.

Something that was supposed to put him down(agreession) he turned around and used to make himself stronger.

It would have been better if it didn't happen at all, but since it did, he got something out of it.

** Oh..Oh God..

I- I never thought about it like that I-

That hurt.

Anyway, I say we should still enjoy Quidditch, because Harry enjoys Quidditch. He had an awful childhood but at least now he's doing something he loves and is good at!

** Ah, I can see Oliver Wood now: "Harry, if you can dodge a frying pan, you can dodge a bludger!"

*** There's a quote in one of the books where Harry "carefully stays out of Vernon's reach from past experience" or something similar. JKR couldn't detail a bunch of physical abuse and child beatings in a kid's book, but there are heavy allusions to it.

**** There's that, Harry running away from Dudley and his friends when they go "Harry Hunting" (not sure if it's explicitly stated but it's implied they beat him up), and I think OotP has Petunia try to hit him with a frying pan she was washing, which he dodges. Oh, and Vernon encouraging Dudley to hit Harry with his Smelting's cane. There might be more but while they likely didn't beat him senseless there was definitely some level of physical abuse towards him.

***** It was CoS when Petunia swings the frying pan at him.

But lets not forget that Vernon tried to strangle Harry at the start of OotP. Harry struggled for breath until Vernon had an accidental zap of magic. Which by the way I just realised... why didn't the ministry react to that?

****** Got that's even worse. Like, not saying it's fine to try and hit a 15 year old, but a 12 year old is a lot more defenseless.

Also, the entire underage magic/Trace thing in canon is never really explained well and has so many holes in it. They can detect House Elf magic, but not realize it's a House Elf's so blame it on Harry. But then there are a bunch of adults using magic around Harry at Number 4 in later books and that's fine. But there's a part in canon (I think) that explains that they can't detect specifically underage magic, just magic that happens to be around a child, so kids from wizarding families can freely do magic at home and the Ministry doesn't know if it's them or their parents. So they leave the parents to discipline their children if they use magic outside of school. So why not when the Order use it around Harry at Number 4?

****** I've always had this head canon where the Trace doesn't automatically send out a letter unless it's something serious. For example, hovering a pudding in front of several Muggles (it wasn't mentioned in the letter, but I feel like it would be taken into consideration none-the-less), or casting a rather conspicuous spell such as the Patronus Charm. The Ministry didn't mention anything about the Lumos Harry used in PoA, even though they had just detected him blowing up Marge; same for the Lumos he cast to find his wand (another subject entirely), even though they probably would have loved to nail him with anything they could get.

*** He's partially right because he spent a lot of time running from Dudley and his gang during the games of Harry hunting, so Harry would have probably adjusted to be aware of his surroundings and change direction quickly
