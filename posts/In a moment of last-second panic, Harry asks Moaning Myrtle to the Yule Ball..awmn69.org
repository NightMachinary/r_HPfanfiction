** That'd be great, I'd definitely read that.

One of the things I really dislike about Harry is that he has the spine of a flobberworm. He gets forced to do all kinds of shit, and he doesn't even go Capslock until the 5th book. Forced to live with the Dursleys, forced to be in the Tournament, forced to do the ridiculous "weighing of the wands", forced to open the ball, and he just takes it. And takes it. And takes it.

It's time someone introduced Harry to the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance][malicious compliance]]. Does his partner have to be female, or human, or alive? Ask Moaning Myrtle, or Winky, or /Peeves/. Ask someone from the outside, like Tonks or Mrs. Weasley. Hell, ask Narcissa Malfoy, that should piss off a lot of people. A blow-up sex doll might also satisfy the stated requirements. Perhaps Griphook can be rented by the hour.

Or just show up alone.

"Where's your partner, Potter?!"

"I don't have one. You've forced me to be here, and here I am, under protest. I will now do my utmost to make a mockery of this ball, this entire tournament. You will /rue the day/ you forced me to participate."

I never understood why he tried to win.

*** *Malicious compliance*

Malicious compliance is the behaviour of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following the orders of a superior knowing that compliance with the orders will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order's intent but follows it to the letter.

For example, when a group of firefighters were ordered by management to wear the unwanted self-contained breathing apparatus that they were being issued with for safety reasons, they took to wearing the equipment on their backs while ignoring it and breathing normally. This made their work less efficient than if they had not been wearing the breathing apparatus at all.

*** He actually never tried to win, I don't think. He turned down two opportunities to win - waiting to save Gabrielle, instead of winning the second task, and trying to let Cedric take the cup first. He won because Bagman and Crouch Jr wanted him to win, and did their best to help him. He had it very easy in the lake and in the maze, and in the first task, just wanted to stay alive.

** Now that would be nice meme, on par with taking Hedwig to Yule ball.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Though Grey lady (Helena Ravenclaw) would be better choice imo. Everyone's going to so stunned.
