Or anything really where the muggle world is a huge part of the story. I've already read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Grow Young with Me and Behind blue Eyes by Paffy and a few others where Harry grows up in the muggle world but is raised by other persons, and as a fan of urban fantasy I have to say that I would love to read more fics like that. (Btw, for those who kindly sent me recs when I was in the hospital, I've just got out and I barely got bored thanks to you all, so THANKS!)


** linkffn(Memorium by Aesop) - About muggles affected by a bad cover-up of Death Eater activity.

linkffn(Strangers at Drakehaugh by Northumbrian) - This new family in the neighborhood, the Potters, Harry and Ginny? Very odd sort.

  The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

** linkffn(emperor by Marquis Black) is largely set in the Muggle world, and involves breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Long running war fic, very different from something like Grow Young with Me, but is generally very liked on this sub

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
