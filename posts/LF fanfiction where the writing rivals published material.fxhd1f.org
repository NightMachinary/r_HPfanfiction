** The rights and Wrongs series by LovesBitCa8. The right thing to do is the first one, and it's absolutely beautiful. It's dramione, btw, if that's an issue. The writing itself is phenomenal, but the way the whole story is crafted, and the way all the plot ties together really works wonderfully.

Link to my (admittedly sleep deprived) review: [[https://ficrecsandshipwrecks.tumblr.com/post/181044453255/all-the-wrong-things]] The sequel is finished now but wasn't at time of review.

There's also a beautiful AU of this world that's a much darker Voldemort Won story called The Auction. It's currently in progress, but worth the read if none of the elements involved upset you. It's very dark, and not for everyone, so please keep that in mind.

P.S. Sorry I forgot how to embed links into text.

** I also have another Suggestion. Again, Dramione.

This one is Lady of the Lake by Colubrina. I haven't written up a full review, but it's my favorite political mastermind fic. There's order bashing, and other darker themes that go along with taking over the government, but it's not trope heavy, or poorly handled. There's some suspension of disbelief involved with the order's behavior, but it all works with the story. The author did a lot of research into making it as realistic as possible, and her goal with writing the story was to make a voldemort-like main character that people would sympathize with and root for. The story itself is really satisfying, and the level of care put into the development really shines through. It's the fic I find myself going back to time and time again when I need some familiarity, and something to engage me for hours on end, as a distraction from the real world. It's on ffnet and was recently moved to ao3 by the author, so you can read it on whichever platform you prefer.

This one also completely lacks smut, which I think is a bonus, but others might disagree. I really could go on about these fics for hours, so I'll leave it here.
