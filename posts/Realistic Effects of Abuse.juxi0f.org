** Have you read [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal]], by BrilliantLady?

Harry realises early on that the Dursley family like everything to be "normal", so he pretty much makes that his code in order to try and please them. It does work to an extent, as they don't treat him nearly as terribly as they do in canon, but they still aren't great. Harry himself doesn't even seem to believe just how awful they are, and only starts to realise as he progresses through his years at Hogwarts, and notices that most children's home lives aren't similar to his at all. It is a slow progress, even to the point where the story is now he still hasn't turned his back on the Dursleys yet.

To give one example of the type of abuse he suffered under the Dursleys, Harry spends most of the story thinking he's lactose intolerant due to being sick as a child after drinking milk, and then Vernon tricks him into thinking this so that he won't take any treats away from Dudley. I'm pretty sure Harry still doesn't actually know this is what happened. I might've gotten some points wrong since its been a while since I read the story, but that is the general idea.

** Saving Harry by the seeker has what you ask, as well as /I think/ Brutal Harry. Chary Potter and the Years of Reluctance by hippothestrowl doesn't have as much focus on other people observing Harry's abuse, but his personality is very different because of the abuse.

** Linkffnet(Storia: These Cuts I Have [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/31]])

Does this in a realistic way. It's a post war fic with Canon pairings, I enjoyed this a lot and recommend it 10/10. I especially liked it because it explores the canonical neglect/verbal abuse of the Dursleys and the consequences it had on Harry without having to make up violence and even sexual harassment like other fics I've read.
