Since the Triwizard tournament would've taken place during Harry's 7th year, it got pushed a year back due to the war in Britain (even though Durmstrang is hosting). As a result, all 7 and 8 years will be spending a year abroad. And one of them will be chosen a champion for Hogwarts in the tournament....


** 1. I feel sorry for whoever ending up as Beauxbatons or Durmstrang champion. The Hogwarts champion would probably be pretty . . . intense considering he would be a survivor of the Blood War/ Hogwarts Battle.
2. If Harry is part of the Hogwarts group, is there any chance for him to not be chosen? His track record speak for himself.
3. In a case where Harry truly ends up as the Hogwarts champion (again), good luck to whoever charged to create a Task considered "dangerous" by Harry without killing his opponents. You can't ask him to face a dragon when he rode one (while stealing from one of the safest place of Britain) mere monthes ago.

**** The war in Britain was far more open and violent, less people just laid down which meant the DEs didn't take over in a day but rather had to wage a war, Harry has been in several high stakes battles, has somehow even MORE Scars and is tired of everyone talking about Voldemort, so he enters a second time ("The first under his own volition!" as he likes to tell literally everyone) as his first personal attempt at gaining some Glory that isn't Fleeting School shit or saving their world.

** Is it every 3 years? That seems short, given how big the tasks/preparation is.

** Turns out, nobody undid the Confundus Charm Crouch placed on the Goblet, so it picks Harry as a fourth champion AGAIN.

*** They might have to change the name then, the Quadwizard tournament doesn't have the same ring to it though.
