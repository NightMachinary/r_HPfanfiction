Or as I like to call them, Rape Potions. I also find it interesting that only women seem to use them in 7 canon books, as far as I can remember.

Even though Voldemort's mother used Love Potion on his father, and it ended up as horribly as realistically expected, they still don't really explore it.


** right? when Hermione said love potions "aren't dark on dangerous" ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜–

"An Hour of Wolves" by thebiwholived has Harry dealing with the aftermath of a Love Potion administered by Romilda Vane. it's still ongoing, but it's incredibly well written and i can't recommend it enough!

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

******* Love potions as a concept are /ancient./ Some real-world ones were just bogus/placebos, while others were primitive date-rape drugs. JKR probably just mindlessly included them without - as usual for her - considering the cultural ramifications of such a thing existing in a functional, easily-accessible form.

****** I think the books do show some of the issues around them - Voldemort's conception for instance, or Ron getting slipped the love potion. Neither are portrayed in a good light, IMO.

That being said, she does put it as a 'normal' thing of life in the WW. IMO, it follows the same trajectory that most of the WW details do - where she put it as a throwaway detail early on (Lockhart referring to it, Molly Weasley saying she'd made some when younger, etc) - probably drawing mostly on the idea of them in european traditions/folklore. But later on, when it gets more serious/adult, she's forced (or decides) to build upon them further and try to integrate them into the world.

Though, I guess it's not always shown as something fully accepted - people didn't seem to like the gossip that Rita was spreading about Hermione using love potions on Harry and Krum, for instance.

****** i think JKR understands the problem. didn't she choose this to be the way Tom was conceived specifically bc of how vile it is?

but again, the attitude surrounding love potions in the books is really weird. on one hand, Dumbledore considered Merope's use of a love potion akin to the Imperius Curse. on the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any regulation regarding them as Fred & George sell them openly in their shop, and other characters who touch the topic (Hermione, Molly) think they're not a big deal.

maybe the modern potions aren't as dangerous?

******* We know that there are various strengths of love potions, and that Amortentia is the strongest. The one Ron takes seems pretty powerful too, but I don't think it was actually that.

A personal headcanon of mine is that the potions Fred and George sell have a very limited duration and an effect weak enough that they can be resisted. Perhaps they also only key them inside the shop before selling? That strikes me more like prank material, tbh. Like, go to the shop, get a potion keyed to you, then feed it someone you want pranked. All of the sudden, they /notice/ you, maybe make some weird attempt at flirtation, it runs out and they're left confused.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

The second focuses on Hermione's reaction with Harry's story in the background. The author doesn't shy away from the nasty side effects of love potions, as well as the ethics of it.
