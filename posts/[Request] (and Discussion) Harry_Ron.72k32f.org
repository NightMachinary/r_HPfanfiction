Now to start with: I am not really interested in this ship on a personal level (I'm far from crazy about slash generally). However, it just occurred to me that there seems to be basically no stories with this pairing, which is... a bit odd, considering Harry and Ron are /best friends/ which is usually the fertile breeding ground of yaoi shippers. Does the fandom really hate Ron that much?... So, have you come across any stories with this pairing? Preferrably non-smut.


** I don't think he is hated, more like not considered good enough to be a part of main romantic ship, meaning neither smart nor handsome. People are shallow like that:(

Shame really, as you said Harry/Ron would have made a lot of sense.

*** I mean, you do have to bring /something/ to the table in a relationship. He isn't extremely handsome, he isn't very smart, but those would be fine if he was caring and considerate for example, but he isn't. Even that would be fine if he was wiling to work on himself, but he doesn't seem particularly willing to self-reflect either.

he's kind of a stubborn ass who's prone to jealousy and whose opinion on romance is probably that romance is stupid, unless it's to get the girl (but not to make her Happy, just to get with her, you know?).

Most of those qualities are pretty much fine in a male friendship. Guys are asses around each other all the time and don't usually need sensitivity. At least not from all their friends. But in a romantic relationship? It would probably just be unfulfilling, one-sided and at times grating.

Then again my perception of Ron might be tainted by fanfic at this point, I'd have to reread the books to see if I'm doing him a disservice.

**** Comments like this confuse me. Ron is an intelligent character- just not in a book way. He's certainly no thicker than Harry as we know they got the same grades in their OWLs, except defence?

Ron cares heavily, but was not always very good at showing it. We see in later books he does try harder, especially with Hermione. He falls asleep comforting her by holding her hand, he buys a book to help him out.

I just can't see how you claim he isn't caring or considerate. Or how he has nothing to offer a relationship. I don't feel like we've read the same series.

***** Maybe you're right and I've just taken my portrayal of Ron completely from fanfic.

The thing about the series as a whole, though, is that pretty much every single character at some point does something that I would find very hard to forgive IRL. You just don't notice it because almost everyone is so messed up it's hard to see what normal would even be in those situations.

I personally subscribe to the theory that Harry is smarter than Ron he just does fuck all because he's been consistently punished for achieving anything throughout his life. Furthermore, he grows up so neglected that the first person who's nice to him, Ron, would immediately become someone who Harry would want to please and emulate. So when he sees how Ron treats someone who does care about academic achievements, Hermiony, he obviously gets even further motivated to fuck around and do nothing for the rest of his school-career. Hell, Ron probably would resent him and act all jelous if Harry actually started out-achieving him acedemically, and Harry probably knows that deep down.

So yeah, I think Ron's probably a terrible influence on Harry when it comes to schoolwork. Not by his own fault to be fair, but if Harry had had different friends, he might have been far, /far/, more driven to achieve.

I'm actually fairly certain that Hermiony herself subconsciously started acting like more of an airhead when she got attracted to Ron to be more compatible with him. That's neither Ron's fault nor morally wrong, but it does rankle a little bit and adds credence to my view of Ron as basically a crab in the bucket.

To sum up, I think Ron is a fine chap, but if someone like Neville had been Harry and Hermionies friend instead of him, I think they both would have grown up to be infinitely stronger, self-assured and accomplished people.

****** I'm feeling even more irritated by this comment. In life, real life, people aren't black or white in morality. JK has always been very showing of this.

Furthermore, characters should not be purely good or perfect. Harry has a poor attitude to learning, you subscribe to a theory, I go with the facts. He is a child, he wants to do well in school, but he isn't interested in being the best. Why? Because he'd rather play Quidditch or hang out with his friends. I think after a lifetime of loneliness, this things meant more to him than schoolwork. Also, by saying that he's friends because Ron is nice to him completely and utterly misses the point of the whole train scene. Harry chooses to be friends with Ron, he chooses him out of the several people he comes across. Perhaps that is because he was nice to him, but isn't that how all friendships are born? Not to mention, Ron shows himself to be kind, friendly and I think in the way he's insecure and overshadowed Harry can relate to him. I think Ron is someone who from the get go makes Harry happy. Makes Harry laugh. For someone like Harry, that is certainly more important than schoolwork.

The way you say that Harry stopped doing homework or trying because Ron doesn't completely irritates me as it implies that Harry can not make a choice of his own. Even after all of his struggles we know, from the books, that Harry would never do something he didn't agree with- we know this because of how strong his own morals are. Ron would be a more likely character to change his behaviour based on others, but Harry would not. Ron is eleven when he makes fun of Hermione. I work with eleven year olds. He is a typical kid making fun of someone he is envious of, is that right? No. Does this make him into a bad influence? No.

Who stands up for Hermione against snape? Who compliments her and always thanks her for helping?

Also saying Hermione became an airhead is an insult to her character. The only time she ever changed how she acted was in the goblet of fire- because she wanted to look nice. That is not something you should use against her. I'm struggling to find any other instances.

I'm not sure you've read the same books. I won't insult Neville, or I will try not to, but I don't think in the first book he could have added anything that Ron could not. He certainly could not have been the friend that Harry needed from the start. Later, I think he brings a lot to all their friendship. But he couldn't in PS

#+end_quote

He isn't interested in being the best because he doesn't like fame. That's a fact right? It's mentioned a lot. Why does he feel liek that? because he doesn't like to be in the spotlight. Why doen't he want to be in the spotlight? Becuase every time in his life when attanetion was on him it resulted in his suffering. Every time he had freinds they would get beat up by Dudley, every time he did good he would get starved and shouted at and maybe more, every time the teachers liked him more horrible rumors would be spread about him. He hates attention because he was abused, not because he ws "just a kid". If he hadn't been abused he might have been a lot more like James, or at least not someone who flinches away from the limelight because he's been conditioned to fear attention and think of himself as worthless.

I think that should be fairly obvious considering what we know about his past.

I totally agree to you about the train scene by the way. I shouldn't imply Ron is somehow in the wrong there. Those part about him are great. What I dislike about Ron is his willingness to completely betray Harry whenever he feels somehow overshadowed by him. Sure he's insecure about that and he admits that, but that doesn't make it okay to act that way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

What do you mean? He can't! He's never been able to make a choice for himself. Think about his upbringing. Whenever he "choose" to do wel in school he would probably get berated starved and maybe more! You can't act like the second Harry gets away from that he somehow regains his self-confidence and starts acting in his own best interest!

Think about it. If Harry had had caring and loving adoptive parents, they wold have encouraged him to do well in school. He would have had a completely different attitude and probably been at least academically competent. He certainly has the drive to at least accomplish things when he really needs to, so what's so absurd about suggesting that he might have been more driven if that hadn't been literally beaten out of him?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

You're absolutely right about that. Which is why it's so curious to me that he basically achieves nothing when there'no pressure on him to right some wrong. It seems to be the only thing that motivated him, he literally has zero, probably less than zero, regard for his own interests, and that just saddens me. If he could have lives to not only be great when it comes to others, but also when it comes to himself, I think life would have been far better for him, and I resent the influences that I see as taking that away from him.

#+begin_quote
  I work with eleven year olds. He is a typical kid making fun of someone he is envious of, is that right? No. Does this make him into a bad influence? No.
#+end_quote

I never bullied anyone at eleven, even lightly. If I'd had had friends who did though I don't think I would have been confident enough to stand up to them, however. And that's the thing. I wouldn't be able to blame that on those friends, but I can say that if I didn't have those friends I wouldn't have been put in that compromising position. When Ron make fun of Hermiony, that's what it feels like to me. Harry being too scared of losing Ron's friendship to do what is right and be on her side. Being on her side enough to make Ron actually change that is.

All throughout the series it struck me that Ron isn't always nice to Hermiony, because her bossyness rubs his inferiority complex completely the wrong way. Harry always seems to be Switzerland in these situations while it seems to me that he should be in Hermionies side. So, that kind of leaves his "moral conviction" a little more gray when it comes to things resulting from his abuse no?

I'm not! I love that. She fucking finally does something nice for herself and lets loose to have some fun. As a lonely bullied kid who has had very little friends that is amazing to me. Of course what happens next is a prima example of what I mean about Ron being a crab in the bucket. The moment it seems like Hermiony is acting confidently of her own regard his insecurities come to the forefront and he does his level best to ruin her evening in any way he can. Now talk to me again about how he isn't a terrible influence? She finally opens up and he destroys it for her.

The airhead thing comes after that. When she starts doing stupid shit like confunding Cormac to help Ron. The old Hermiony, who lived by her own rules and convictions would never do that. But she stopped living by her own rules slowly but surely as time went on and once again, that's just sad to me. That's what I mean by becoming an airhead, acting different that who you are for others.

Certainly. I think the dynamic would have been odd at first. But Neville has always been a great guy with a spark of greatness in him. I think Hermiony would have been good for him, and I think Neville teaching Harry about the wizarding world would have been an amazing way for Harry to grow into his new situation and Neville to learn that he can be appreciated for who he is. That's how I envision that going. He would have also been an amazing source of information, and perhaps more importantly, nuance, for Hermiony when it comes to learning about her new world. If he'd entered the compartment on the train I think that's the direction their conversation might well have taken.

******** ...."Hermiony"?

Er. Well. In any case. You definitely have been reading too much fanfic. There's this fan-prevalent image of Ron as a slacker who doesn't want to do schoolwork and acts as a toxic friend to Harry who would obviously be a much better student and not break any school rules if it wasn't for Ron. But this just doesn't fit the books at all.

First of all, Ron does not shirk schoolwork. He actually works just as hard at it as anyone else -- he's sometimes shown struggling with it, or getting it wrong, or complain about the amount of homework, but he still DOES it. He doesn't try to get others to do it for him; the most that happens is that Hermione proofreads and tells him what he got wrong.

Second of all, Harry never follows Ron's lead in ANYTHING. Check the books. RON is the follower; Harry is the leader. Granted, Ron goes along with pretty much everything Harry does, but in 90% of the events Harry is the one with the ideas, and the one who takes the initiative.

As for Ron being mean to Hermione.... Hermione is even meaner to Ron. They each give as good as they get.

********* You might be right that my perspective is skewed by fanfiction. But didn't he take divination and care because they were easy? And didn't Harry follow him in doing so? That seems to support that image.

I might need to check up on the Ron/Hermione dynamic, but what stands out most in my mind is fourth year and when he abandoned them on the hunt. Both of those seem to me like a character flaw that clearly hasn't changed over those 7 years. He's jealous and he's not above tearing people down so they don't make him insecure anymore, and that just seems so wrong to me.

********** Actually, there's never any reason given for why Ron signed up for Divination and Care of Magical Creatures. The "he did it because they were easy" is fan speculation.

Harry signed up for the same classes as Ron because he had no idea what he wanted academically, he didn't think he was good at anything except Quidditch, and thought that if he was going to suffer through extra classes at least he'd have a friend with him.

And as for Ron's abandonment... one thing people seem to forget is that in both cases Harry is being a TOTAL jerk towards him.

In fourth year, Harry is the one who attacks, throws badges and hurls insults. Ron just pulls away and sulks. At first he tries to congratulate Harry on being part of the Triwizard Tournament, but Harry can tell he isn't being sincere and begins snapping at him -- he'd taken it for granted that Ron would believe him about not putting his name in the Goblet of Fire, and now that Ron asks "look, how did you do it?" Harry loses it and calls Ron stupid.

Afterwards, he refuses to make up with Ron, even though Hermione promps him to do it -- and when Ron gets worried and comes to check on him and accidentally interrupts Harry's talk with Sirius, Harry lashes out at Ron, throws a "POTTER STINKS" badge at him and says "there, maybe you'll get a scar on your own, that's what you want!"

What a great friend Harry is, huh? I don't see why Ron could possibly be angry with him for any reason.

During the Horcrux Hunt... two things. Ron is wearing the Horcrux, which is enhancing his negative thoughts. He's just heard that his sister served detention in the Forbidden Forest. He's worried sick about his family. And now he hears Harry just laugh about it, as if he doesn't care.

And this leads to Harry and Ron both taking their frustrations out on each other. Harry, who ISN'T wearing the Horcrux, directly tells Ron to leave. Twice. The second time, Ron takes him up on it.

Ron isn't a saint, but claiming that his two falling-out with Harry are all down to his character flaws is just absolving Harry of any fault. Ron's insecurities and self-loathing certainly contributed, but Harry's temper and tendency towards taking Ron for granted contributed equally.

You definitely need to reread the Books, especially DH.

Ron left mostly due to Horcrux Locket's influence. Just minutes after taking that thing off, he already wanted to come back. But he ran into a Snatcher gang and was held up. By the time he got free, Harry and Hermione already left and Ron couldn't find them again. He was so ashamed that he didn't dare to face his parents, and camped out at Bill's place for two months.

And who came up with the brilliant idea to put a Horcrux around their necks, Harry Potter! He had as much to blame for Ron leaving as Ron himself.

In general, I think people like the Enemies-to-lovers trope since there's more conflict and angst. Sexual tension can get amped up in the right situations. There's also a challenge in attempting to get two characters who hate each other together. Shipping is usually about stuff like that than what makes sense.

** I have read a few with this pairing. It is uncommon mostly because there is no conflict or tension. That is what makes a good romantic story.

Even with a Remus/Sirius pairing, of which there are TONS of fics, there is inherent tension and conflict. There is the canon thing that we know Sirius almost got Snape killed by Remus when they were kids. There's also tension of it potentially causing problems for their friend group, and Sirius's family not approving (either of being gay and not making an heir and also because Remus is a halfblood werewolf).

With Ron and Harry, it is fairly clear that there would be little or no issue for their friend group (Hermione is definitely liberal). Also Ron's family would not care at all that Harry is a halfblood or about heirs. I guess you could write the Weasley's as intolerant towards gay people, as canon doesn't say, but it really does feel like a stretch.

I can't even wrap my head around this concept. I think that from what we see in the books, the conflict in Harry and Ron's relationship far exceeds that of any other canon friendship, including Remus and Sirius. It is rather ironic that you would say there's no inherent group conflict, when Ron ditching the horcrux hunt happened precisely because of the group conflict.

It was both. The conflict with himself was /because/ there were actual underlying issues with Harry and Hermione. Ron's insecurities didn't exist in a vacuum. Harry reassured Ron after he returned, both that they were miserable after he'd left (combating Ron's insecurities about his necessity to the group) and that he only loved Hermione like a sister. The issues already simmering were brought up by the horcrux.

Besides, most issues are ultimately issues with yourself. Sirius treated Remus as he did because he was an extremely short-sided and impulsive person ruled entirely by his emotions - which is a personal issue. But it is also an issue that leads to conflict between him and Sirius, so in these cases I don't really see a meaningful difference between a personal issue and group conflict.

  Dating's tough when you're Harry Potter. Ron watches his best friend go through some very bad dating experiences, while going through some awkward ones of his own. H/R slash. Please note the rating and warnings inside.

*** I have to disagree that there wouldn't be any issue with Hermione. Not that she'd be a bigot or anything, but I think she'd start to feel like a third wheel if it happened while at Hogwarts and most likely a little heart broken because of her crush on Ron. She'd also want her two best friends to be happy and would be trying not to let them know she was conflicted...

** I've read a few by shedoc and they're very sweet. And not explicit, if anyone's inclined to check them out.

I think there was a lot more Harry/Ron in the early years, and it had its own archive, but those fics weren't saved when the archive died. I'd love to see more.
