** Ask and you shall receive.....

linkffn(The Taste Of Your Magic by Annoy mouse)

No vouches for quality, it fits your criteria however I vaguely remember this being a GP. Its abandoned unfortunately.

The very fact that I'm able to rec this shows I read too much fanfic :)

  [HIATUS!]Deliciously Dark. Evil too. Bellatrix finds baby Harry left with the muggles & discovers his unusual accidental magical trait, one that she finds... Very Appealing. She decides to keep and groom him to be their next Dark Lord, and enlists the aid of Narcissa. Harry/Bellatrix, quasi-harem for a reason but H/B/N overall. M for a reason. THESE CHARACTERS ARE EVIL

  AU. Narcissa is actually the source of the Malfoy family's wealth---and not because she inherited the Black fortune, either. She's an in-demand spy and assassin. But now she's retired, and intent on using all her skills to make sure her baby boy gets what he wants. If that's Harry Potter, then Harry Potter he shall have.

**** Draco is male, but Harry being gay is not really a big deal in the story, since the focus is on Narcissa.
