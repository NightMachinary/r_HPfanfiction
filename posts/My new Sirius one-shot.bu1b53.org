A prompt here inspired me to finally post a little story I've had in draft form for a while. Now readers are like, “How could you do this to me? I'm bawling!” I didn't think it was all that tragic compared to canon. I'm kinder than Rowling, which I realize isn't saying much. For those who like bittersweet stories, here it is:

*** Thanks! I should send all the readers who are crying about this over to my other story, The Marauders' Apprentices. Lots of Fred and George, and I plan to include only the canon tragedies, pretty much.

**** I'm not crying; it's more bittersweet for me. It's actually a happier ending than Sirius gets in the books. I think I'd feel differently if Sirius had shown a desire to stay human; if he'd been actively fighting for it and lost it anyway. Then I'd be bawling. Instead, it seems like he decided for himself that he would prefer to live as Shadow and I can respect that the decision brought him joy in the end.

***** He could just walk to Hogsmeade like the students do. Pubs are open later than students' bedtimes. He was probably curious if any Death Eaters were still around and after him, so he'd be interested in the news. Or he could just wander around the Hogwarts library and stuff. Look in a mirror in his human form every day, so he wasn't shocked by suddenly seeing a face he recognized only as his father's. We don't know that he didn't do these things.

Why would the DMLE be on Peter's case? They thought he was dead.

Sirius had his humanity damaged for 12 years. Peter was just hanging out for 12 years.

Could I please get a link to this other traumatizing story you mentioned? Sounds great.

******* I mentioned the Hog's Head specifically because it's a place where customers regularly conceal their identities. Hagrid won a dragon egg from someone who never showed his face. Peter wouldn't go around introducing himself by name.

********* It's not my job to tackle your other points. You're acting like there's some sort of canon proof that if Sirius saw what he thought was his father's face in a mirror, he wouldn't flee from that in a panic via whatever escape route was available to him. This is all conjecture. Go write a fixit to my story if you like. Have Sirius obediently follow Hermione's schedule and get his sanity back. Have fun.

Anyway, thanks for the link.

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.

*** Thanks!

I guess I'm going for American spelling, like the books that were published here.

AO3 does this weird thing of adding spaces around my italicized words.
