I'll start.

Remus.

If every character was a flavor, he'd be "natural", with a side of "bland". Yeah, he's a were; and that comes into the story once (Other than the whole soap opera with Tonks)

I just find him really, *really* boring.


** Okay, I'll go.

Ariana Dumbledore.

Either in canon or in fanfiction, she seemingly exists solely through her consequences on her brother. And that doesn't /bother/ me as such, but for /once/, I'd like to see a fic where she has actual characterization and agency, you know, rather than just being there looking all "Oh look I'm so frail and innocent, big brother Albus please help me, /ooops/ I'm dead welp bye".

Could be Ariana herself or her Portrait, but /some/ development, please!

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.

***** Well the official plan was to convince Dumbledore, and if that didn't work, convince Sirius by telling him how terrible everything will be in the future (this, understandably upsets him and he agrees to help). He had to pretend to get back into the Black Family's good graces and they'd just take three out of the five currently made horcruxes. Somehow, they convince everyone she's this famous pureblood from Austria who is engaged to Sirius, which helps them also gain favour with the Blacks. I don't know, I liked it a lot at the time mostly because it inverted the Hermione time travel cliches that were really popular when the fit was written and made the extended Black family realistically likable

In the sequels, which becomes a Harry/Ginny story instead of a Ginny story, you start to see her come out of her shell post-war and she resembles canon Ginny a lot more as the story goes on, without compromising the growth she goes though during the story.

*** I always thought that ginny was in love with the Harry from Ron's letters rather than the boy who lived. You gotta think Ron wrote home during all of SS/PS talking about His best friend who:

- Saved a girl from a troll
- Dove 50 ft to recover a friend's item, and then made the quidditch team
- Won 2 quidditch games
- Saved the stone
- key in Gryffindor winning the house cup for the first time in years

That's awesome for an 11 year old, and I can totally see Ginny's crush being for that reason initially. I think after the crush was just reinforced because she was saved by Harry.

Your hero, a twelve year old, risked his life, saved you by killing a monster that would make veteran aurors wet in their pants and then defeating a version of the Dark Lord. I doubt any girl could recover from that.

Same for Hermione a year earlier: no friends and about to crushed to death by a hideous monster that would make most of us wet in our pants; suddenly two 11 years old charged in fairy style fashion to save you, and one boy used the very spell you showed him off earlier in the day. Could any girl recover from that?

Ginny definitely has a severe case of crush and hero worship at beginning. I don't think she would ever be free of that. After all, what Harry had accomplished was indeed very heroic.

To Ginny's credit, she earned her hero's love and respect through her own actions. What she had done in Year 7 was very heroic too. She (and Neville) braved terror and torture, led the students and drummed up just enough manpower to win the Final Battle. Unfortunately, JKR only wrote a few paragraphs about that and the Movie completely NEGLECTED to mention that. As a result, too many readers/viewers simply forgot her contributions.

*** Sacrificed himself on the chessboard to help his two friends move forward, went into a basilisk's lair to save Ginny, stood in front of a mass murderer and told him that he'd have to go through him to get to Harry, apologized when he did wrong after the first task, stood up to his peers in Harry's defense after there was an entire summers worth of slander against him -- then flew to London on death horses to save his best friend's godfather... I mean sure, he's not really in touch with his emotions, but not many teenage boys are.

Honestly, Hermione is the insensitive one if you take into account all her actions. She judged Harry for not knowing his name was in books, was rude to Ron when he was just trying to learn how to do the levitation charm, refused to believe Crookshanks was after Scabbers (then refused to believe that he killed Scabbers), tattled to McG about the Firebolt, kept a woman in a glass jar for who knows how long, mutilated a teenage girl's face for cooperating with authority figures, gave severe PTSD to Umbridge... she was a stone cold savage who had no remorse.

It's got a Slytherin Ron (and Harry and Hermione) which is pretty unusual, and also develops Ron's chess skills more, largely due to a tragic accident in his family (don't want to spoil anything here). One could argue that he's almost intellectually on par with Hermione in this series.

The series also has the "Lord Potter" trope in it, but it's actually done realistically? Strange, I know, but good.
