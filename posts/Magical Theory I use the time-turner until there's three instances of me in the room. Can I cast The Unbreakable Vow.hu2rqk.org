To clarify, I would perform all three parts without another persons aid, only using my temporal clones.


** Personal take:

No. Because the vow is between two people and bound by a third. If you're all three people, it's not a vow between two people and bound by a third.

*** But what is a person? Are you the same person you were 10 years ago? 5 years? 1 year? A month ago? How about a day ago, or a few hours ago? About every ten years every cell in your body is replaced with a different cell. Your experiences and memories shape who you are, yet human memory is extremely flawed. What you know and have experienced now is different that what you knew and experienced in the past, and some things you knew in the past have been forgotten by the you of now.

So, would this really be three copies of the same person, or three different people who share the same name and face?

**** I feel like the vow is bound to a person's magic, so that even when they use the time turner they have already taken part in one part of the vow, which means they can't be another part of it.

** I guess??

I see no issue. I don't think you need 3 /individuals/ for it to work, in my mind the spell just requires 3 people, /physically/, for logistic reasons. Someone who promises something, holding the hand of the person you're promising it to, and someone to work the magic from the outside.

But I don't see why you'd ever need to do that..... wait, no, unless you need a truthful excuse for doing/not doing something. Like, if there's a situation where you need to testify under veritaserum that you can't do something because of an unbreakable vow and the only person you trust if yourself. But if you have access to a time-turner in the first place.....unless you're actually using the vow to cover your use of the time-turner??? Idk, sounds overly complicated but you do you.

Or if you're so unmotivated you need to be Literally Dying before you do something, so much so that stealing an actual time-turner to make an unbreakable vow with yourself to clean your room sounds like a perfectly reasonable solution.

** Perhaps, provided that you don't lose your mind in the process. Also remember that the book version of the Time-Turner puts you in or near the position where you were at that point in history (it's not like the film where Harry and Hermione stay in the hospital wing and leave from there).

So that makes things a bit trickier unless you stay in the same room for hours on end, covering the earliest and last point of time-travel. But then again, people were said to have gone mad when meddling with time.

Just seeing a double of yourself, and that person seeing you go back, and the third person arriving at that time, and most of you needing to make sure you're in the spot where you travelled from (which shouldn't be a problem if you keep to the same room for many hours at a time) is likely enough to mess with your head.

** Seriously?

You go to the trouble of stealing a time turner from the ministry, break all the rules of time and the first thing you do is say, "Hey, let's do a sketchy ritual who's sole purpose is to increase my chances of death"‽

If you have two time turned copies of yourself the Fidelius Charm is so much more useful.

More helpfully: it's fanfic you decide the rules that aren't explicitly stated in canon. And also some that are

** I'm of the opinion that you can't bind your magic using your own magic. I imagine it would be the equivalent of trying to tie a knot with taffy - it's just going meld back together and return to normal. You need an outside power to accomplish any sort of binding. I think this is the cleanest excuse to prevent a fic from falling into terrible magical vow shenanigans.

** Normally, no, but I could see this working (narratively speaking) as an end-game thing---a desperate scheme or a final plan by a protagonist after a lot of build-up and learning, and assisted by some special circumstances involved. Perhaps with every jump back in time, they ‘game the system' by intentionally changing who they fundamentally are with a masterful use of Mind Magic or Soul Magic, creating three people who are simulteanously different in terms of identity and yet connected by some high-level esoteric concept of personhood and fate, finally collapsing the whole spiritual mindfuck when the time loop ends with a successfully cast Vow, which by itself would in some way be special---a Vow to yourself, one that cannot conceptually be broken ever due to its Unbreakable essense, in turn bequeathing the one who holds it with some small aspect of the Immutability itself. Or something among those lines.

** The First time traveling harry would have to cast the vow. So he is not affected by it in the first place.

The Second would have to Give the Vow so he wouldn't be affected either.

and the Third would have to receive the Vow

At the end of the harry one and two turn there time turners becomeing harry 2 and 3 an hour earlier and are joined by a new harry 1, while ole harry 3 stays.

And if it sounds confusing, well so is time travel.
