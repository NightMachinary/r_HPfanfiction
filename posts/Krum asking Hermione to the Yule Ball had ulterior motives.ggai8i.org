That whole Yule Ball part felt way too much of a wish-fulfillment for Hermione. Or some 90s teen movie.

Here is an international sports star, asking a teenage girl out, who is not beautiful, but he notices how intelligent she is. And then, she suddenly transforms into this beautiful girl because she removes her buckteeth and straightens her hair. And she becomes "what he will sorely miss?"

Like, really? Since when did Krum have the time to notice Hermione? How would he know if she is smart or not? He was at Hogwarts for few months at most before the Yule Ball. Why would he want to be with a 14 year old instead asking someone closer to his age?

But what if he had ulterior motives? What if he asked her out to know more about Harry, seeing how well he did in the first task and with all the crazy rumours about him? What if he wanted to sabotage Harry? And because I don't want to fully assassinate Krum's character, I think it'd be more believable if Karkaroff forced him to do it.


** I don't know. I think Hermione is smart enough to notice something like that. They remained penpals after GoF, which shows that he was really interested because there was nothing to be gained from it. Info about Harry was no longer relevant to him and a romantic relationship was unlikely.

*** I'm saying what happened in canon doesn't feel believable. Not that it didn't happen.

As for Hermione being "smart enough to notice something like that"? She was a full blown Lockhart fangirl, she couldn't see what an incompetent idiot he was. She didn't believe Harry in sixth year about Malfoy.

That line is probably in every Harry romance fanfic.

Also, let's not just assume things. There was never any suggestion that Krum liked Hermione because she didn't care about his fame(and the only reason she doesn't care about his fame is because she's not into Quidditch. Otherwise, see Lockhart). It is also really hard to have a good relationship when one party barely has any interest in the thing that is the bread and butter of other party.

See, the more you think about it, the more unbelievable Krum and Hermione's relationship gets.

#+end_quote

I completely disagree. Sometimes, especially when your bread and butter is something very competitive and high stakes, it's lovely to have your partner completely separate from that world.

I'm in academia, and it's more common for relationships to survive if only one of the partners is in academia, or at the very least in very different academic fields. The competition and politics involved makes it really hard to be in the same area!

Also, it's very easy to care about your partner and how their work life goes without caring about what they do for work very much. My partner is in electrical engineering and frankly I don't care a whit for what he actually does, but I care a lot about how his work life is going and about his trials and successes.

I can very much see someone like Krum, in a job that is high pressure and competitive and involves a lot of press attention, that having a supportive partner who doesn't really care about Quidditch in their own right but does support him unconditionally would be really attractive.

** He notices her in the library where he's presumably preparing for the tournament. It's often assumed that he up and asked her to the Ball and that was the first time they ever talked but there' no proof of it? We have no idea how much time they spent together before he asked her -- for all we know they could have spent hours together before that. Why also assume that he asked her for some one reason -- intelligent or beautiful or not a fangirl? Why couldn't it be all?Haven't you ever met a new person that you just find likable/attractive even just after exchanging a few phrases with them, whose company you find naturally enjoyable? Without the need to create the lists about what you specifically like and dislike about them? The fact that they stayed in contact after the 4th year pretty much proves that he found her interesting enough.

2-3 years is not a large gap at all, I knew enough couples with such an age difference back in school.

Hermione was taken as "what he will sorely miss‚Äù bcs it was a convenient solution. It's the same with Cedric and Cho, and Fleur's date would have been probably taken if her sister wasn't there.

‚Äúsuddenly transforms into this beautiful girl‚Äù. A few simple cosmetic changes can alert how people see someone a lot. Take away a heavy bag to improve posture, put on some flattering clothes, make a hairdo, put on some makeup and here you go -- a completely new person. It happens in real life (especially on proms) often enough.

*** It's definitely murky area with the age difference of Hermione and Krum. Hermione is the equivalent of a 9th grader getting asked out by a guy old enough to be a college freshman (He was 18 during the summer of Goblet of Fire.)

Then again Rowling is really bad at math/doesn't mind the age difference, as seen with Tonks and Lupin as well as Bill and Fleur. Also she doesn't mind cousin romances, as seen when everyone assumes Tonks loves Sirius.

The snogging subplot of half blood prince makes it creepier though.

That's not how it works. Just like law has "innocent until proven guilty", fiction has "non-existent until proven otherwise". You can't just assume things that we have no proof or even slightest implication of. Everything points out that the first time they talked was when he asked her out.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Because Hermione was not beautiful. And it was never suggested that he liked her because she wasn't a fangirl. It's actually never explored why he liked her. The relationship is underdeveloped as hell. Really, the more people try to defend it, the more it becomes clear that it didn't make any sense. It really was just wish-fulfillment for Hermione.

And what were these a few phrases? We never get to know. Rowling was bad at romance. But this was too close to self-insert level territory.

That's true. But it's more obvious by Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione than anything else, I would say.

In the end we see the whole thing from Harry's pov. Ofc there wouldn't be any sense to go in detail on Krum/Hermione relationship when it has no bearing on the general plot of the series and don't even feature the main character of the series. ‚ÄòHarry Potter' is fantasy and adventure, not romance. Romance in the series exists to create a more well-rounded, realistic world. Readers don't need to know what exactly happens ‚Äòbehind the scene' in some cases, it doesn't make those happenings less valid though.

** To be honest, they were both in school. It isn't really earth-shattering that he'd be interested in her. Most other girls were fawning over him and not allowing him to work in peace. Hermione, on the other hand, kept to herself, and as we all know, spent a lot of time in the library. Its not far fetched to think that he would have seen her reading/doing her work seriously, earnestly in the library day after day and built up some feelings for her.

** While I agree with your wish fulfillment thought there is nothing to suggest the ulterior motives you are coming up with.

The story is told from Harry's perspective and JK wanted for it to be a surprise reveal so of course we aren't going to see any of the moments you are talking about.

When the moments do come they show Krum does care for her. When he talks to Harry it is clear he is jealous. And it's a small point be but Hermione was 15 I believe.

** Honestly, Krum as a character skeeves me out as I look back on the books as an older individual. As an 18 year old, he decides to ask a 15 year to the Yule Ball. While I suppose that technically isn't wrong in anyway, it still feels a bit wrong to me simply because the maturity levels are very different between a 15 and an 18 year old. When you're in your teens, I think 3 years is a pretty big deal.

‚Äã

When he reappears in DH, he is 21 years old, empirically an adult. Basically the first thing he does is inquire about Ginny, a 15 year old (albeit about 2 weeks until 16), basically asking if she is single. That is no minor age difference. At any age, 5 years is a lot. But he is empirically an adult expressing interest in a child. It is possible that he thought she was older than she actually was, but still.

I'm wondering if Rowling intended this while writing the books, with the implications flying over Harry's head. But Pottermore states that Harry was still friendly with Krum years later, so I suppose not.

*** Where I live it's pretty common for 15yo to date 18yo and so is in UK (or so I heard). Krum calls Ginny beautiful which is hardly creepy, considering he doesn't even have an idea how old she is. For all he knows, she's 18. It's actually pretty difficult to guess someone's age, that's why you need your ID to buy alcohol or some such. There's often no telling is someone is 16 or 25, especially if they're dressed up.

Was there really nobody closer to his age who he found attractive? /Why/ did he find her attractive, exactly? And when you're a teenager, even a couple of years can feel like a huge gap because of gaps in emotional maturity, for one reason. As horrible as it might sound, it feels a little more believable that Krum asked her to the ball to get closer to Harry.

** From the Doylist perspective, I think that it was economy of characters more than anything. Krum had to take /someone/ to the ball, and he had to have /someone/ to rescue for the second task, and Hermione fit the bill. Also, IIRC, Rowling also wanted an opportunity to explain how her name was pronounced to the reader.

It's disturbing how many Harmony fics in which Harry and Hermione don't meet until Year 5 make Krum be someone who takes advantage of Hermione.
