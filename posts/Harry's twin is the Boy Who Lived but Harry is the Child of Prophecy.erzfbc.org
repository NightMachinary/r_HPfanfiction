- /Everyone/ who knows of the prophecy, believes that Harry's twin and his scar is what the prophecy refers to, but they're /all/ wrong.
- It's Harry and the mark is something completely different. It may not even be a physical mark.
- Maybe Harry isn't at home at all when Voldemort attacks (just to avoid the typical tropes).
- So which line of the prophecy is not applicable to Harry's twin? "*The one with the /power to vanquish the Dark Lord/ approaches*". Can be anything you want.


** Sounds fun, and could be a great subversion of the normal trope. Can't wait to see what people come up with.

** It all gets even more complicated when there's multiple prophecies involved. And nobody knows who's really the boy who lived.

*** I did say, no Death Eater apologism, didn't I, and this fic is the poster child of that trope. Not to mention the egregious amounts of James bashing and Slytherin-wank.

**** Actually, you didn't. I, for one, agree with all your criticisms of the fic, but if you don't specify what you aren't willing to read, you can hardly fault others for not knowing.

**** So, you obviously have not read this story, and just said that based on the summary. Some death eaters are evil. Some are less. Slytherin gets shown, good bad and ugly. Just like hufflepuff ravenclaw and gryffindor.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
