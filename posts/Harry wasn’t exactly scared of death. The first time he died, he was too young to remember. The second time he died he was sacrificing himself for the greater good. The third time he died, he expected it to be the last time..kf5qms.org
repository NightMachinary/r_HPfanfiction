#+TITLE: Harry wasn’t exactly scared of death. The first time he died, he was too young to remember. The second time he died he was sacrificing himself for the greater good. The third time he died, he expected it to be the last time.

** ...And?

That's basically how tons of time travel, dimension hopping, and crossover fics start, especially ones that rely on MoD shenanigans.

** And Harry is actually immortal. He has the power that Voldemort knows not since Voldemort was never able to reach his goal and become truly immortal.

**** How would this affect his sense of taste? If so, could you disguise poison as particularly dubious goulash? We know he can't smell. I doubt he knows what goulash looks like, so sight is out, taste is directly linked with taste, so that sense is crippled. His hearing shouldn't substantially affect his chances of eating the "goulash," and Little tom riddle was taught manners as a child under fear of death, so he would never eat things with his hands, thus touch is disabled. Poisoned Goulash, It's the perfect crime.

***** Well, we dont know if he can smell or not. All we know is that he tried to turn into a snake. And we don't know if his nose holes work.

**** They weren't doing very well but while Harry and Hermione were muggleborns and realized things where about to get deadly (deadlier?), Malfoy did not.

Voldemort grew in a muggle orphanage but his lack of a working nose made him ignore the particular smell filling the mudblood's hideout. and after Malfoy screamed the fiendfire incantation, he only had a moment to laugh at the puny shield cast by Potter before an explosion decimated his body.

When potter spoke about a gas main blowing up and killing the dark lord, every wizard trembled. What could be so awful that forced obliviators to erase potter's memory to replace it with a standard muggle excuse for wizarding battles?
