Hello. I'm new here, but I'd really like the communities help. I started HBS this morning and was so into it that I have now finished it, but I didn't see that it was still a WIP. I'm now waiting till the author updates that, but in the meantime, I'm looking for similar fanfic.

I read a similar thread where someone asked the same question, but didn't specify what they were looking for. The most important part, is that I like a Powerful!Harry, not god-like, but definitely strong as he was in this book. Next, I'd like a lot of dueling. It doesn't have to be centered around it, but if it is in copious amounts anywhere in there, that'd be nice.

Example would be obviously HBS, but like The Santi's Boy Who Lived.

To summarize, I'm wondering if you know other fanfics (hopefully well written), which have a Powerful Harry who is still smart, but not to a god-like extent, dueling and fighting is involved in the story.


** Also a WIP, but you might dig what there is of linkffn(Champion by OctaviusOwl). It has a similar tone of higher stakes and uphill battles.

*** Thanks, I loved it, the dueling was nice, and like others said, it was OP!Harry, but you know what, I don't mind that too much, it's a guilty pleasure. Hope it gets updated soon though.

*** Great story, though in my opinion Champion suffers from the problem of making Harry too OP. [[/spoiler][Harry is able to talk to the dictator of his world one on one and walk away with an attitude. He faces off against a death eater that's the DADA professor and walks away easily. He's also able to overpower the seventh year head boy while being a fourth year. The same seventh year that is considered the "best" the school has to offer.]] After a while the story starts to feel ludicrous.

**** It's been a while since I read through it but isn't Harry a 6th year and his brother in 4th? Not that this isn't much better when related to your concerns, but it isn't an 'overpower enemies by sheer awesomeness' kind of story.

Guess I'll have to re-read it and find out.

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

*** This is really good, but iirc there hasn't been a great deal of duelling yet (other than the two non-specific-to-avoid-spoilers /things/). That said, based on the story so far there will be a lot of it in the future and there has been a lot of discussion about magical fighting.

**** Yup, the scene's only been set. That said, I worry about if the author will be able to finish the story. Its set on a phenomenally ambitious level because Harry, Hermione and the rest need to grow at realistic, albeit "faster" levels and their enemy is the thousand year old king of the magical world. I hope the author can write the story without rushing but at the same time speed it up slightly.
