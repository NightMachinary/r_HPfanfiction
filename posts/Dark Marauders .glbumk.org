** My favourite Dark Marauders story and probably one of my all time favourite Harry Potter stories is */The Innocence of Wolves/* by */Gateway Girl/*. It starts during their school years and continues on to the years afterward.

Summary

#+begin_quote
  AU. The Prank goes wrong, Severus Snape dies, and the Marauders dispose of the evidence and get away with it -- and after that, what can't you do? While Remus falls for Sirius, the Marauders become the Free-Blood Guards, working to destroy Voldemort's servants.
