Both are completed works and set following in the battle at Hogwarts. Enjoy.

** To be honest. So far I can't recommend any of the story's. The writing feels wrong in style and plain boring at other times.

However the story might be good and the plot well thought but the writing doesn't allow me to enjoy them

** Thanks for you comments. I'd appreciate hearing some elaboration on the good/bad points of the writing style and how it might be made more suitable for a wider age level. Sorry the stories did not meet your expectations.
