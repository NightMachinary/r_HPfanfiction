I've had a lot of trouble lately trying to find fics that don't treat the reader like a child who needs every little part of the story explained to them. Every time a character frowns then it is explained in minute detail why they are frowning. Writing is like becoming a salesman. If you want to be good at it then you need to know when to shut up and let the customer/reader imagine what the product/story at work. If you explain every detail to the majority of people then you will chase them away as the way you paint it with your words can never compare to the way their imagination can fill the picture with all the senses.

That being said, hit me with the best fics that sucked you in because the author invited you into their story rather than shoved it down your throat. The less known the fic, the better as I have read most famous fics. I prefer no slash as the main pairing because I struggle to relate to slash fics. If the fic is incomplete and isn't regularly updated then there is a high chance that I won't touch it as I am don't like the pain. Many thanks, ladies and gents!


** Besides the obvious lack of technical ability (grammar, spelling, punctuation, composition and direct speech) this is the biggest, most global flaw in all of fanfiction. It's the main reason why most fics are way too long for what is in them. There's nothing wrong with verbosity when it serves a purpose (GRRM proved that), but repeating the same piece of information in 10 different ways is ridiculous.

I would recommend DP&SW, but you probably already know it since it's so possible and it's somewhat controversial. Also lorien829's fics are relatively concise, but it probably comes with the territory of using a lot of dialogue to drive the plot. I'm sure a fic like Shadow Walks would be at least double the length when written by most other authors.

For some reason it's usually just one-shots like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5508237/1/Caveat-Inimici]]) that are unafraid to just describe a situation. I understand the temptation: If you write a long story you want as many people as possible to be able to follow along. Sometimes I check the reviews for HPMOR or DP&SW and find it staggering how many people have no grasp of what's going on (and the majority of those is still invisible, because they are probably to embarrassed to ask).

Isn't being too wordy (or spoonfeeding readers) an entirely different issue from show vs tell?

Telling & concise:

#+begin_quote
  Harry came out into the snowy grounds. It was a very cold day.
#+end_quote

Showing & wordy:

#+begin_quote
  Ancient hinges creaked in protest as Harry shoved the heavy double doors with a grunt, letting inside a gust of frigid January wind that took his breath away. For a moment, he debated staying cooped up in the castle until spring, but the sight of the glittering fresh snow on the ground lured him out. He stepped over the threshold, absently tugging down the sides of his knitted cap to better cover his ears.

**** That's not how I understand the difference between showing & telling at all. Both of these are examples of showing (though in a perfect example I'd avoid the inner monologue from the second example, that's telling). Telling usually involves a lot of clumsy exposition through monologueing or giving away characters thoughts all the time.

#+begin_quote
  "Hey Hermione, remember when I went out into the snowy grounds? I really didn't want to go out because it was so cold, but I went anyways. Man what a day that was. Wish you were there."
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  Harry went into the chamber. He was afraid, remembering the last time when he went down here, fighting a giant basilisk and barely surviving the encounter.
#+end_quote

Your second example is just bad writing, trying to include unnecessary details. I'd take the first one in a heartbeat over the second one. It usually just comes across as pretentious if it's overdone and in every scene. A book is not a movie and "Harry came out into the snowy grounds." is perfectly serviceable. "Harry came out into the snowy grounds with a scowl on this face." may even be enough to figure out that he'd rather stay inside. In your example you as the author are just telling me that Harry has this internal debate. That's telling instead of showing.

Another example:

#+begin_quote
  "ENOUGH!" yelled Harry and kicked the chair across the room.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  "ENOUGH!" yelled Harry angrily, his handsome features twisted in violent rage. He jumped out of his chair and with a lot of force extended his leg, kicking the chair so that it flew across the room.
#+end_quote

Both of those might be considered showing, but the way the second one is written, as if by some cold observer narrator, feels a lot like telling and pulls you out of the action. We can infer that he is angry and that he is using his leg and force to kick the chair, it's unnecessary telling. Actually unnecessary (or even worse when they are necessary) adverbs for direct speech ("said angrily", "said cheerfully") are one of my pet peeves in regards to showing vs telling.

Nah, I don't think there's a simple rule of thumb to always avoid adverbs like this. They can have a purpose, in particular "seriously", for example when someone says something that could be taken as a joke, to make it clear how it was delivered.

You can make anything work and there are probably readers who will enjoy different types of writing. I really like Patrick Rothfuss' prose, which IMHO is just beautiful and to the point.

** Absolutely! But, on the flip - I have had so many readers message me and ask me what a character's hair colour was, or what short they were wearing. I dunno, use your imagination! It's to the point where at some point in every fic I've had to write an author's not explaining to them that I don't think that they're idiots so I'm not gonna treat them as such. If I don't explain what exactly my character is feeling, you're not reading closely enough to see the clenched fists and the twitch at the corner of their eye. People man... People.

"Don't just say she's pretty, describe how she's pretty!" No. It's an internal narration of a character looking at her and thinking 'well she's pretty' it's not him analyzing all of her features. Also, I clealry want you to think she's pretty so I'm not going to describe something that you then might not find pretty.

** Quite honestly, "show don't tell" is one of the most overused bits of advice in all of media criticism, and not because it's the most pervasive problem.

What most annoys me is that nearly every time this statement is made, it is never explained why it's preferable. It's just stated as this unchallengable truth.

Let's just take the OP's chief reason for why one should "show don't tell":

#+begin_quote
  If you explain every detail to the majority of people then you will chase them away as the way you paint it with your words can never compare to the way their imagination can fill the picture with all the senses.
#+end_quote

Most people (at least that I read) do not explain every detail. They explain details when they're relevant and let you assume those details persist until they tell you otherwise.

And I will dispute he claim that one's words cannot paint the picture better than the reader's imagination. Imagination is hard to use to maintain a detailed picture, because unlike the written word, imagination is very detail omitting. Imagined pictures of a scene necessarily (because people are limited) omits most detail and zeroes in on the most important details and leaves all else vague and amorphous. It's there but it's not /really/ there. Telling the reader these details allows you to truly fill in the gaps that imagination ("showing") would take much longer to do.

Try this exercise: Imagine a tiger right now. Now what did you picture? A generally large, cat thing, has stripes. Orange probably, but maybe white if you're being cheeky.

Now stop and do not change the image you imagined. Now tell me, how many stripes did the tiger have? No need to say, you didn't imagine that detail, so it didn't exist, because it was irrelevant to the overall picture, so vagueness was acceptable.

That's how I view this whole "show don't tell" shtick. There's no absolute superiority here, nor is there even really a general advantage of one over the other. It all comes down to execution. I could tell you all sorts of things about that tiger, give you a clear indication of it's mood, personality and such. But showing things like that tends to take much longer than telling (unless you just fob off all that to the reader's assumptions, which is a bit lazy), and even then it can all be for naught if one can't do it well. Whereas with telling you can immediately know if it's done decently or not, and thus avoid wasting your time with poor payoff.

I hope this didn't come across rudely, just felt I'd offer a dissenting view. "Show don't tell" has become such a trotted out affirmation that it honestly annoys me more than it probably should. It's usually just lazy criticism hiding the fact that one is affirming their preference for one style of writing over another.

*** I apologise for not being clearer about why it is preferable. If you read any of Sinyk's works and then compare them to fics like A Cadmean Victory it would demonstrate my point quite nicely.

I prefer show not tell because I enjoy the skill of an author taking me to places that become very real in my imagination. If an author steps me through every thought of each character, especially with poor execution, then I struggle to get engaged with the story and I end up skimming it to get to the next plot point and not enjoying the process that it took for me to get there.

I suspect that a lot of what you think that I consider "telling" is actually what I consider "showing". Many people (as you said) only explain the details necessary and do not repeat them, expecting the reader assume those details persist until they tell you otherwise. This isn't what I am talking about. I am talking about authors filling you in with unnecessary details about the main characters (or even worse, the minor characters) that aren't relevant to the story at all and sound unnatural when brought up in conversation. For example, in Sinyk's latest work he goes over the details of every meal that is consumed by the characters in the story. However, if Synik simply made a small comment about the excellent French cooking as a side note instead of filling a whole paragraph with the details then it would keep the flow of the story. If Harry's a chef and that is a major plot point, then they should make an emphasis of one or two meals when you are establishing the fact that Harry can cook and you want the reader to know how well he cooks. Once you have established that fact, no need to rub your readers' faces in it. Or rather, no need to describe every detail of the same tiger in detail over and over again, to borrow your reference.

I will clarify my claim - I find that words cannot fill all the gaps in the imagination unless you ruin the flow of your story. It is nearly always sufficient to stop describing pieces of the picture after you have set the basics of the scene rather than getting into the nitty gritty of why the third no-name person in the room was wearing a different perfume. Tolkien knew every detail about his world, down to the language, armour, culture, etc, yet he didn't stop and explain why each culture was doing things differently, he just assumed the reader was intelligent to pick up the it was a different culture and thus behaved differently. I wouldn't dream of holding anyone to Tolkien's mastery, but he demonstrates how an author doesn't need to rub his reader's face in too many details, just enough for the reader to appreciate the pictures he is painting. He also demonstrates writing to different audiences marvelously. With TLOTR he wrote to a particular age group and intellect level, yet The Hobbit is so different and as is The Silmarillion.

Now, as for the superiority of showing vs telling. When describing a tiger, I would find it far more engaging to read this:

#+begin_quote
  The grass parted with barely a whisper as the giant cat sprang out before them. It paused, cocking its head as vibrant, green eyes examined the travelers. It prowled slowly around them, showing off its brilliant striped coat, orange and black rippling in the speckled light. When they took a hesitant step forward a vicious growl sprang from its throat as glistening fangs appeared in a dangerous snarl.
#+end_quote

Than to read this:

#+begin_quote
  The scary looking tiger jumped out of the brown grass without making any noise. It stopped, tilted its head and looked at the travelers with green eyes, seeing if they were a threat or even prey. It took a long time to decide and started walking around the group slowly. The travelers decided to take a risk and step forward but the tiger opened its mouth and growled loudly at them, angry at them for not waiting for it to make its decision. It showed its fangs to scare them and make them realise that it was the king around here.
#+end_quote

Now, the first was what I would consider showing, using descriptive words that trigger imaginative and emotional responses in the reader's brain whilst the second used more words to tell the reader exactly what was happening. I would consider the first a superiour technique as it didn't tell me as much information, but made me feel it instead. Does that clarify my point?

I am not sure what you would call good telling as I feel it may be closer to what I would consider showing. However, you are right that a poor writing style with great execution (characterization, dialogue, etc) can trump a better style with poor execution and both style can be ruined.

Is it lazy criticism? Perhaps, but I would expect a beta to go into detail with the author and I don't feel compelled to beta every fic I find. I personally used the phrase as I was making a request and wanted to find fics of a particular writing style which I personally find more engaging. Sinyk is extremely popular and I think he appeals to his audience who like every detail laid out. If it works them then that's their choice. However, as a long time reader, I feel entitled to compare author skill as shown by the way they engage their audience. As a critic though, my opinion can be discarded by the author if I miss the point in their art.

Don't apologise for a different view point, I appreciate your comment. Thank you for your time in writing it and for sharing your point of view.

#+end_quote

No because there's a mismatch here. You're comparing showing a little with telling too much. Broadly, telling is for narrative, showing is for scenes (especially dramatic ones). But because of that, showing takes longer to do and it covers less in-work time than telling does (which is why telling is usually better for narrative).

I like what Card Orson Scott says about this is his /Characters and Viewpoint/, as chapter 15 makes the relative uses and advantages of each technique apparent:

#+begin_quote
  YOU'VE NO DOUBT HEARD THE SLOGAN "Show, don't tell." Under some circumstances, that advice is good; under others, it's exactly wrong. Story- tellers constantly have to choose between showing, telling, and ignoring. Of these, showing is what you do least often; but since showing is also what takes up the most space, it deceives many critics into saying "The good writers show much more than they tell." Critics say this because they examine only the text; we writers know better, because we deal with the story.

  The very terms are misleading. How can you show anything in fic- tion? The story always has a narrator. On the other hand, in theater and movies you show almost everything. That's because plays and films are dra- matic in form. The action unfolds in "real time" while the audience watch- es. Fiction has a narrator, a storyteller. Instead of the audience seeing events directly, they are unavoidably filtered through the perceptions of the narrator.
#+end_quote

[..](Scott gives an example of both here)

#+begin_quote
  What difference does it make? Notice that the second version, the scene, takes longer, though it gets through far less overall information and covers far less time than the narrative version. At the same time, the pure narrative seems like a mere prelude. It is leading up to the story. We expect it to be followed by a scene.
#+end_quote

[..]

#+begin_quote
  Which one of these is the "right" choice? Either one could be right; either could be wrong. Factors like rhythm, pace, and tone come into play---these are outside the scope of this book. However, if the author wanted the reader to get a feel for the murder victim, to remember him as a character instead of simply getting the narrator's attitude toward him, this or some other scene would be essential. Characters are made more real through scenes than through narrative.
#+end_quote

Sorry about all that quoting, but it's to make a point I perhaps made poorly before. None of these have any real advantage over the other. They have places where they're more useful than the other. I wasn't saying that "show don't tell" is inherently lazy criticism, just that it's so often used as a critical shortcut, a mantra that is rarely further developed but stated as a fundamental flaw. E.g. "What was the problem with this work? Oh they told rather than showed." To me, it's an issue of using these techniques when they're more likely to be effective, rather than insisting on the general superiority of one over the other.

***** I think you've hit the nail on the head there. I am referring to authors who tell rather than show when they should be showing. Or, they tell too much when something simple would suffice. "Show not tell" doesn't work in every part of the story as you don't want to show some very simple parts of the narrative as you don't want the reader to focus on those parts. Show is used for when you want your audience to use their imagination or hint/suggest at something that they might not pick up otherwise.

I have no problem with telling small parts of the narrative. I do have a problem being told every person's thought so nothing is shown through conversation and subtle facial expressions that don't necessarily give away all of the characters feelings.

Thanks for your input and clarification!

  You came, you saw, you survived. But at the end of the day, you're still children. It doesn't matter how many battles you've won, how many Dark Lords have been triumphed, or how many personal travesties become medals of honor. You deserve better; the Sun is out now.

  ONE-SHOT: And there's music pulsing in bass-heavy shockwaves up the notches of her spine and there's salt on the insides of her thighs and the hollows of her hips and she isn't Pansy Parkinson anymore, no, she isn't a girl who hides or runs or escapes, no, she's someone else she's someone new she's someone who's breathing and fighting and alive.
