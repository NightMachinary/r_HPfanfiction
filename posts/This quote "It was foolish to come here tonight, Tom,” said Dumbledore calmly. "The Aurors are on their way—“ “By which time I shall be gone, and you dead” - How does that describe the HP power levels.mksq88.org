I mean, if both Dumbledore and Voldemort are titans of the magical world, why would Dumbledore even say that?

Why would Voldemort be afraid of the aurors and Dumbledore threatening Voldemort with them?

Are they not as powerful as they appear or is it something else? (bad writing on part of JKR is a given, so let's forget her non-consistent worldbuilding, it would just lead to madness).


** In addition to what's been said, Dumbledore gave Voldemort as good as he got. If Voldemort is surrounded by Dumbledore and a bunch of aurors with no backup, he's dead or in a cage.

**** Except it doesn't work that way. Magical battles aren't like chess where a Grandmaster can play versus 10,20,30 people at the same time and win vs all of them. Sure Voldemort and Dumbledore are head and shoulders above almost everyone else but there is a limit to how many wizards they can take on at the same time. Maybe they start struggling at 1v5 or at 1v10... fuck it let's make them REALLY overpowered and say that there would have to be an 1v20 situation to take them down.

So at the end of the day in a skirmish/guerilla warfare scenario which the Wizarding War is you would have the 2 Magical Titans cancelling each other out and the side that had the most "normal" level fighters would eventually win. That's pretty much the reason why Voldemort and the Deatheaters don't really start winning until after Dumbledore is dead and even then they use infiltration tactics rather than direct warfare.

***** Hell, we already know Voldemort is about at his limit with three highly skilled opponents- Mcgonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn dueled him to a standstill at the Battle of Hogwarts. Slughorn must be pretty good to survive, even with help- and we know Flitwick was a dueling master while Mcgonagall is a master at transfiguration

I'm not so sure. They had Harry's protection, making Voldemort's spells ineffective. Had this factor not been in play it seems highly probable that he would have disabled or thrown one off kilter (and he does so to all three after Bellatrix dies) and then rather easily mopped up.

Should also say, it was Kingsley, not Flitwick, and while personally I don't think four is enough, conceivably four to six trained aurors might get that all important blow in.

**** Hard to say. The following is plausible, I think:

- Voldemort vs. any number of Aurors ⇒ Voldemort wins
- Dumbledore vs. any number of Death Eaters ⇒ Dumbledore wins
- Dumbledore + sufficiently many Aurors vs. Voldemort ⇒ Dumbledore /may/ be able to pin Voldemort down enough for an Auror to get a lucky spell in (or vice versa)
- Voldemort + sufficiently many Death Eaters vs. Dumbledore ⇒ Voldemort /may/ be able to pin Dumbledore down enough for an Death Eater to get a lucky spell in (or vice versa)

** While JKR writing is rather questionable at times, I think Voldemort's fear of the Aurors arrival to the fight is based on numbers. While he and Dumbledore ARE titians in power and skill level, any fight against multiple opponents is hard. Trying to focus on more than one person can be overwhelming when they can attack from different directions. So tossing in the unpredictable of magic and spells it CAN be a challenge for anyone.

*** Considering that his Death Eaters were captured in the DoM and everything that happened that day, I really doubt it. It would take insane amount of stupidity to ignore the escapees of Azkaban attacking the Ministry and not connecting the dots, especially as many of the combatants on the Order's side were Aurors and could testify.

I could accept that explanation, but it feels cheap to me, for the following reasons.

Voldemort is there, he is just about to kill Harry Potter and he is concerned about being revealed? Something he already gambled on by appearing personally? I don't see the logic in that. Being discovered is his last priority at this point. He just wants to get the prophecy (which he knows has just been smashed) and kill Harry. Killing Dumbledore is just the bonus at this point. I don't think he gives any consideration to being discovered at this point.

*** Well, that would be acceptable, but he committed them to infiltrating the Ministry itself because he was obsessed about the prophecy for months (Harry's dreams). He was way past secrecy at this point, just about getting the prophecy and when that failed (just before the quote mentioned) he just wanted to kill Harry and later Dumbledore. I can't see him caring about secrecy at that point. Which makes the Auror comment very interesting.

** I think the interpretation really changes on reread. We know that Voldemort hates the name Tom, and after Book 6, we know that Dumbledore is aware of this.

It's a taunt. Quite simply, it's Dumbledore saying:

“I'm not scared of you, I deny your chosen name, and I'm very obviously distracting you, both from Harry's presence and the coming Aurors,”

We see that it works too- Voldemort switches his attention.

I don't think Dumbledore believed Tom would be afraid of Aurors, but perhaps of what they represent; potential witnesses of his return.

Voldemort's been on the down low for over a year, possibly gearing up to take the Minostry from the inside (since he's been having important figures Imperiused all the way to Book 7)

In my opinion it's a true statement to Dumbledore power, he knew he can win and not only win but to defend Harry while fighting Tom.

He simply played with Voldemort, while the later kept trying killing him and Harry.

** Actually I never thought it was about aurors capturing/killing voldemort. I always thought it was said because Voldemort didn't want to expose himself until he built back his army, vetted his followers for loyalty or completed some other plans (he's been gone for long time, so some of his loyal followers may have deserted his side). The minister and the prophet was denying his resurrection vehemently and if he is seen by a group of aurors, its futile to keep denying afterwards.

He only came out when most of his followers were down? (don't remember the scene exactly) so maybe he was desperate to get the prophecy as well as kill the boy at the same time. He appeared when he got confirmation of Harry's sighting, cuz he believed if he kills the boy then the other plans will fall into place by default as he will be invincible.

Thats what I think but I am heavily influenced by fanfictions.
