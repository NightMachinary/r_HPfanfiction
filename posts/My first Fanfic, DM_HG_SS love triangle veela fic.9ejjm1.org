** First off, congratulations on (almost) finishing a fic. That's quite an achievement!

Unfortunately, most people around here won't be able to get past the first few paragraphs simply because of lines like this:

#+begin_quote
  she'd learned to tame, and transform it from those puffy locks into beautiful silky curls

  [her eyebrows] didn't need any plucking or coloring; they were perfect

  Her dark-brown orbs shone when the light hit them, making them even brighter
#+end_quote

To be honest, I stopped reading at this point. This type of lead-in reeks of tropes. I know some people enjoy those tropes, so don't worry, you'll still draw a readership, but I'm afraid it's not my cup of tea.

** Look up Granger Enchanted Survivor group or The Death Eater Express group on Facebook for readers of that pairing :)

*** It's like a bad trope collection just judging from OP's post.

- Death Eater whitewashing?

Check

- War criminals escaping justice

Check

- Racially motivated terrorists suddenly having a boner for someone they consider beneath them?

Check

- Prophecies to justify an unbelievable pairing?

Check

- Love Triangle?

Check

- Soul bonds?

Check (at least it sounds like that from the whole "love of two souls thou shall find theeself" part)

- Creatures?

Check

- Fanon Veela bullshit?

Check

- People using their school houses long after graduating?

Check

- Female MC can't decide between two guys, which realistically would lead to her getting dumped by both?

Check

- Female MC is a dick to her current partner?

Check

- Draco in leather pants?

Check

***** And yet you aren't denying that even just half of the list is true. And at least on this site, pretty much any of those would be a reason not to read it.
