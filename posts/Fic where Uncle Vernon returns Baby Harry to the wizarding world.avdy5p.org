I remember the fic as having Uncle Vernon refusing to take on baby Harry, and looking for the equivalent of a wizarding orphanage. He may end up entering Gringotts, and ending with Sirius being cleared/ released from azkaban to take custody of Harry

Any leads would be appreciated.

*** Eeks. Forgot this. Is there any other one where he isn't raised by goblins but by Sirius?

**** Can't remember the name of it but there was a fic that inspired Harry Crow and that might be what your thinking of.

** I've read something like this before. Is it the same one where Vernon turns into an accidental hero?

Edit: I've found the one I read. It's called Defending Sirius Black by Luiz4200. I haven't read it in years, but I do remember enjoying it at the time.

linkffn(Defending Sirius Black)

Edit (again): It's not nearly as good as I remember. Some of the characters seem more like caricatures of their canon selves whereas others act completely out of character altogether. The transitions from one point of view to the next leaves a lot to be desired and the dialogue is pretty weak. Still, the premise is fun, and if you're into the Dursley's not being abusive guardians, this could be worth the read.

I agree the writing could be better. But isn't the premise interesting?

** None that exactly fit your description. At least I haven't read one doesn't mean it's not out there somewhere.
