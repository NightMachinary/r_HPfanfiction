:END:
Looking for a fic for weeks

I remember that Harry either went back in time or was super smart. He runs into Hermione and tells her not to buy all the books she has because they're too advanced. Her parents agree and Hermione wants to get revenge on Harry. I think it ends up with her cheating academically but I'm not sure. I can't find it and it's been stuck in my head. Thanks!


** Did you have any luck finding this? I remember reading it and it's driving me mad because I can't find it!
