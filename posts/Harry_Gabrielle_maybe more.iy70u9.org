I'm looking for a fic that I'm 100% sure is on Fanfiction.net. It may have Harry/many pairing but the only one I remember is Gabrielle. I also remember that she sort of died during second task but Harry done something and she lived later very long. And I think that she had two animagus forms: basilisk and sth else


** I kinda remember something like that. Could it be Harry/Hermione/Fleur/Daphne/Gabrielle?

** Harry pours his magic into Gabrielle so she lives again. She can turn into a basilisk and a Phoenix. Imma go back to my favorite list and look for this fic.

  4th Year - Starts with Harry's selection as a champion. Harry is different he is angry, intelligent, and he absolutely does not want to participate in the tournament. Harry has a secret that he has shared with no one and new Harry is released and the pay-back begins. Strong Powerful - Harry /Fluer/ Daphne - Hermione later in the story.
