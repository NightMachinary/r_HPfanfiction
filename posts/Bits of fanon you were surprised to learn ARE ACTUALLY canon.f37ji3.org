When I read in fics about Zabini's mother, the black widow who has married seven times, and all seven husbands died in mysterious circumstances, it was so obviously an absurd piece of fanon that comes up in Slytherin-centric fics. So, imagine my surprise when I read this, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Blaise_Zabini%27s_mother]] - and found that it actually comes from HBP (though the 'Black Widow' nickname is still fanon, I think)!

So, what other fanfic tropes look obviously fanon, but are actually canon?

*** There are two things (in a canon sense) I have trouble with in CC. One, Harry's scar hurting. Two, this. And hopefully I'm misremembering the scar thing.

My solution? Cursed Child is a Skeeter book. Voila. Everything in it actually happened but nothing specific is believable.

I'm pretty sure the Trolley Witch appears in the books too (off the express) but CC also makes her seem like an automaton so it doesn't really add up. Which is exactly the same as reading Skeeter's news articles (which /are/ canon) and concluding that Harmony is canon.

*** That's going to depend on how you define canon.

In the books we see /tents/ that are magically expanded within them to the size of a flat and Moody's trunk has seven compartments but all we know about them is that the first six of them only held normal amounts of trunk stuff . The last and biggest compartment isn't a flat. It's a deep, bare pit of a room large enough to hold an unconscious man and enough oxygen to stop him dying. Moody /survived/ living in there for months but I don't think he enjoyed it.

OK so there's a trunk with it's own little world inside it in Fantastic Beasts but honestly, I'm pretty sure the invention of trunks with flats in them predates those films by a decade, if not more.

**** I'm pretty sure trunks with flats started from a reasonable extrapolation of Moody's trunk. We know that the space inside an object can be expanded. The one that's shown is a quite drastic expansion of a tent, with the implication that this is a very basic expansion and more extensively expanded models exist (IIRC, it's been a while since I read /Goblet/). It's canon that a trunk can have multiple instances of its own innards accessed from the same point, see Moody's trunk (also in /Goblet/). There is no word on whether instance overlapping and space expansion destructively interfere.

Therefore, the flat-like trunks and even the trunks with /multiple/ flat-sized compartments are not entirely unreasonable.

Crouch did have to interrogate and get hair from Moody regularly over the year. But he also had to sleep and teach and do other things. Which means Moody might well have been locked inside the trunk for hours at a time, which could still pose a threat to his life from suffocation or CO2 poisoning.

*** I mean they're obviously possible

Space can be magically expanded and contracted (King's Cross, Hermione's beaded bag)

Moody's trunk exists

Newt's fucking planet-in-a-box exists

It seems to me though that these things are most likely extremely expensive or have to be made yourself. Another possibility is that the charm is difficult to cast at greater strengths, to the point where few people are capable of performing it. It probably follows some sort of math, requiring more skill and concentration as the inner volume multiplies.

Any writer adding these absurdly powerful items needs to keep two things in mind:

1. If this is so easy to get, most people need to have it.

2. If not everyone has it, then it needs to be hard to get.

Tbh not sure what else you wanted here. They failed with the giants. We get Grawp (unfortunately - never liked that subplot). And the giants that attack Hogwarts later. And the ones that attack muggle villages that we hear about. If anything, I could do with less giants. They were boring imo.

Sure, but indy!Harry fics would use less time to set up the entire story for the year. Given that Harry is an abused kid that just left an abusive situation to live alone with copious money he has sole control over & absolute freedom before going back to school, he uses that time pretty tamely.

Sure, but from a writing standpoint its a bit of a strange choice to spend so much time on something that never comes up again. Arguably it also tokenizes Madame Maxime given that we never get even a throwaway line to refer to her again, as the only surviving Head of any of the major wizarding schools by the end of HBP. Compare if JK had introduced Luna for OOTP and then dropped her with no further reference for the rest of the series. It's especially odd given that JKR's writing style generally brings back past characters & ties off loose ends e.g. Lupin, Moody, the epilogue, even Mrs Figg!
