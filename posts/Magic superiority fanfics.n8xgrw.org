Hi, I'd like fanfics where magic is superior to science. Or generally wizards superior to muggles.

Not entirely a joke. This is kinda just the default position of the HP world so it's hard to find fanfic that satisfies it specifically. If it's not an AU Mugglewank fic, then you can just assume that it follows canon in this regard.

That said, here's a couple of non-Mugglewank fics where wizard-Muggle interaction is particularly prominent:

Another good one. Really goes into the magic and the wizard-muggle dynamic is noticeable, though it isn't the primary focus of the fic I think.
