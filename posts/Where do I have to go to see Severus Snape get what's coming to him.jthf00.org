I want a fic where Severus Snape gets fucking destroyed. I want to see him a broken shell of a man, I want to see him get fucking killed, I want him in Azkaban, I want him Kissed, hell, I'll take embarrassing death via cauldron fuck-up or just fired for gross incompetence in teaching.

Rise of the Wizards does this

A Father's love in DisobedienceWriter's drabbles does it.

Where can I find more, preferably written competently or well?


** The Art of Self-Fashioning has Harry deal with Snape pretty directly, though be warned it's a fairly violent fic as well.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

*** I tried reading this after a recommendation in a similar thread, but I found it to be quite long-winded. I've read to just before the middle, and as of yet the only violence being perpetrated has been against the Lestranges. It features a lot of buildup and anticipation, but found that it felt stuck in its start blocks. It's still a very well-written work, so if one can take the pace, it's probably a superb fic!

** Eh, canon already killed him. He's a deeply unpleasant man, yes, but that also gave him many miserable years. He's responsible for Lily and James' deaths, but he devoted his entire life after that to stopping the monster who killed them.

I kind of think he already got what he deserved.

If you want a fic that leans into his horribleness, though, Nightmares of Futures Past was started before book 7 and makes no excuses for his behaviour, getting him fired from Hogwarts fairly early in. He's ignominiously killed offscreen in linkffn(A Friend Indeed by kb0) when Voldemort dies. On the other hand, The Peace Not Promised puts him through some long-term character growth.
