Really like the dynamic going on in some fics where harry is good friends with the twins.

Could anyone rec me some longer fics? Bonus points if its obscure.

Slash is allowed, femharry is also allowed. Doesnt have to be a carnal relationship, just friends/besties is just fine.

  Warnings Inside. Dumbledore ought to have known better than to leave an orphaned Harry Potter in the hands of the Dursleys. A twist of fate has the boy-who-lived living with criminals. Sly, cunning, street-smart, sorted into Slytherin where his housemates have been raised to hate him, will Harry survive? Or maybe it's the House of Snakes that doesn't stand a chance.

** They have some epic prank cooperations and battles throughout the linkffn(Pureblood Pretense) series. (Though they're not the only ones.) The Twins appoint themselves as "Rigel's" PR managers from second year onward. She's less enthusiastic, sometimes helping and other times inclined to retaliate when she feels they've gone too far.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
