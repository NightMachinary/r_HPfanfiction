*** This is a great fic IMHO, because it highlights how annoying privilege can be. Neville isn't at all a horrible person in this, just an unthinking one. I love that it's all from his point of view.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
