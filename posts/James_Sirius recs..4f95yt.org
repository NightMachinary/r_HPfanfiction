Can be platonic, romantic, etc., as long as their dynamic plays a large part


** You can look through [[http://jamesandsirius.livejournal.com/][this LJ community.]] It's been dead for a couple years, but posts span from 2012 to like, way back in 2004 or something crazy.

I was going to come in here and start linking a bunch of stuff, until I realized 99% of it is smut, and more often than not involves Remus in a threesome capacity.

As far as actual stories longer than 5k go, linkffn(10206680) is probably your best bet. I haven't read it yet, but it's probably pretty good.

If you go to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Sirius+Black%2FJames+Potter&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][Ao3]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10&c1=4&c2=7&pm=1][FFn.net]] and sort by pairing you'll probably end up finding a lot of decent oneshots. FanFiction.net will result in less smutty ones though.

James/Sirius isn't a pairing that has a lot of novel length stories to it because people like James/Lily so much. A shame if you ask me.

** This series: [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/48782]]

The first two are one shots, sort of establishing things I guess you'd say, but the third is a long humour/romance fic. The rest are smutty outtakes from the third story.

** Try anything written by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/905164/guns-and-butter][guns and butter]]. I particularly like XX: Not a Love Story.

For platonic relationships, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4466268/1/The-Anatomy-of-a-Bromance][The Anatomy of a Bromance]] is amazing.

  James and Sirius. "Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy that he thinks his booty is fly?" An inside look at one of the closest friendships the world will know.
