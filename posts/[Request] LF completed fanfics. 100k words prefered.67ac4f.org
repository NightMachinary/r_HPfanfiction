** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): My favorite time travel. Bellatrix is not bad, and yet still recognizable as her canon version.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/][Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince]], linkffn(5677867): The story that got me into HP fanfics.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10645463/1/][Hail Odysseus]], linkffn(10645463): This is a very broad bash fic with some over the top sex and violence. Not one of my top favorites, but worth reading.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Very emotional dimensional travel, close to 100k words.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Great Ron/Hermione romance under the shadow of a very sinister Lucius Malfoy and highly manipulative Dumbledore.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** From a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/64wwcr/comment/dg7bqu1][list]] I made a while ago:

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]] (195k words)

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.
#+end_quote

It has all the elements I wanted from a potential sequel to Harry Potter. It has an enticing, original plot. Interesting and well-developed original characters and accurate portrayals of important canon characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione etc). Ignite and its sequels ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327625][Starfall]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332775][Oblivion]]) also have some very well thought out mysteries and moral dilemmas.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]] (53k words-sequels over 100k)

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
#+end_quote

Written by the same author as Ignite. The author is very good at crafting likeable, realistic characters and interesting plots. This is 'technically' a prequel to Ignite. Sequels ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=259003][Shade to Shade]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293286][Falls to Shadow]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=318952][Beyond this Place]])

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]] (55k-sequal over 100k words)

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
#+end_quote

Post Cursed-Child and stays true to canon personalities well. It is a nice family oriented story. Has a sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12121323/1/Put-Your-Curse-in-Reverse][Put Your Curse in Reverse]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] (196k words)

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
#+end_quote

It's incomplete (first year completed) but is a well-written AU with an interesting plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12001201/1/Let-Perpetual-Light][Let Perpetual Light]] (60k words)

#+begin_quote
  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.
#+end_quote

An original take of the events in Godric's Hollow. The characterisation of Grindelwald and Dumbledore is well done.

Recently I've read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12330043/1/Tell-Brave-Deeds-of-War][Tell Brave Deeds of War]] which is 54k words. It's seventh-year from Ravenclaw characters' (Terry Boot, Michael Corner and Anthony Goldstein) perspective. It's an enjoyable read and is fairly canon-compliant.

#+begin_quote
  There's a war going on, and Death Eaters have taken Hogwarts. Michael isn't brave; Terry isn't wise; Anthony isn't a leader. Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. There's a war going on, and it's time that they figured out what's right, what's easy, and what they want to risk. [Set during Deathly Hallows.]
#+end_quote

There's also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]]

#+begin_quote
  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon. Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best General (Chaptered).
#+end_quote

One of my favourite Ginny centred fics. The author had a real grasp of the character, it's also one of my favourite 7th year fics.

I read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569/chapters/12150143][Seven Names]] recently as well (73k words):

#+begin_quote
  Seventy three years after being forced out of the magical world, Sarah Jean Taylor is finally coming home.

  And there are quite a few people who want to talk to her.
#+end_quote

I was very impressed by the exploration of war crimes in this fic. It's an AU with a slightly different version of the war. There is also one chapter that's potentially my single favourite chapter of fanfiction.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/][Asking for Roses]] (129k):

#+begin_quote
  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.
#+end_quote

A very sweet Hannah/Neville. It's reasonably canon-compliant.
