I made one of these purely about ongoing Hermione timetravel fics [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/66imst/my_hermione_ongoing_timetravel_compendium_of_the/?st=jdu6ez58&sh=5c6da5d6][about a year ago]] and it was relatively well received, so I figure why not give it another go and look at what has been updated in the last year. I would always be interested in AU and xovers as well though, generally the themes are quite similar. Timetravel is a HUGE obsession of mine, probably because I have so many regrets in my real life, and Hermione just seems to lend herself well to new situations in fanon. I know some people can't stand her or find her OP/Mary Sue, etc. I enjoy many of these fics, and how authors try to make their own variation, since there's a very high risk of them getting same-y. As far as I can tell, she is the most common timetraveler, I would however be interested in good recent fics featuring other timetravellers. I have ordered it according to update date in my fav list, it's the easiest way for me:

- Yesterday is Tomorrow (everything is connected) by Kneazle: A promising start to a fic that will apparently be HG/JP, a sister-of-lily reincarnation story. From the title alone I'd have thought it is not canon-divergent and a timeloop, but the pairing makes it that I'm not sure. Very short so far anyway linkffn(12830596)

- Oblivion by Nautical Paramour: Nautical Paramour has written a LOT of Hermione fics, some timetravel some not. Here, she's thrown back in time to save Regulus. NP writes very well, so even though I don't always personally agree with how she decides to get Hermione do her thing, it's always entertaining. linkffn(12747797)

- Strange Attractors by Orange et Blue Morality: Hermione is flung back to Tom Riddle's school days for reasons unknown. Does a good job of characterising Tom as the ultra-smart, mega-creep that I like to imagine him to be. Interesting explorations of magic and stuff! linkffn(12734980)

- Six Pomegranate Seeds by Sezit: Easily one of my top fanfics of the last few years, has to be read to be believed. Totally different take on a back to the past story, since Hermione's priority - as a reincarnated Rosier the same age as original Hermione who is STILL AROUND - has nothing at all to do with Voldemort but rather a sentient Hogwarts. Very, very well done. Stages of canon are there, but she's far too busy doing other things in the background. Read it even if you're not really into Hermione timetravel fics, I've recommended it a few times on here already and will continue to do so. When I see an update, I drop everything to read this. linkffn(12132374)

- The Ark in the Storm by IrishIris: Interesting premise with Hermione something akin to a werewolf, but not. Goes back to marauders era and goes to the school there. Has had some very funny moments, some sad ones, I've really enjoyed my time so far. linkffn(11779160)

- The All New Adventures of Hermione Granger in... The Chance of a Lifetime by Hippothestrowl: Old Hermione goes back in time to first year. The reasons are multiple and intriguing, and I like most of the shenanigans that have been happening, and some of the changes so far. She also tries to fix magical society at the same time as attending school. However, I feel like at some point it went completely off the rails, and I've decided to stop reading until it's done to give it another chance. linkffn(11453335)

- Champion by I M Sterling: Hermione gets sent back in time to save Tom's soul, so Tomione. Has had some incredibly strong scenes, and an interesting take on Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Hermione is super badass in this in a very cool way. She basically fixes Slytherin a little bit as well. It's been an epic read and I think is complete, although there have been hints of a little bit more. linkffn(11790377)

- Falling Through Time by Kait Hobbit: Hermione goes back in time and falls for a certain Weasly, I like it. Can't say it's been incredibly memorable so far, but sweetly written. I'm having difficulty remembering details. Linkffn(11418202)

- Quantum Entanglement by CaspianAlexander: Everything went wrong, Hermione goes back in time. Reincarnated Hermione, not many of those in this list so far even though it used to be the leading trope in this genre?! Anyway, she's now a Black, and has a serious axe to grind. Lots of action, Severus Snape ship. I like it when they're the same age! Linkffn(11405979)

- When the Time Turns by Mahawna: A slightly different take as yes, Hermione goes back but also, Pansy Parkinson! No Hogwarts, this all happens when they are adults. linkffn(12562928)

- Blood and Gold by ObsidianPen: Hermione goes way back to the 1950s and gets sucked into the world of Slytherins. Pretends to be an American who attended Ilvermony. She becomes a Smith and joins high society etc. Has good and slightly annoying bits but give it a go (tomione!) linkffn(12386885)

- Give them Triumph Now by lizzzsunshine: Hermione is sent back. This is already at 116K words so not a short one like a couple of the ones previous. A bushy-haired addition to the marauders, a fair amount of angst included as well as sweary fun. Still going, it's a fun Sirimione Linkffn(12055716)

- Of Time and Saints by Temporal Knight: Doesn't really focus on Hermione but more on Harry and Jeanne d'Arc, but she is along for the ride as well. It's a completely mad story with AU and a goddamn medieval saint. Go read it if you haven't already. linkffn(12655931)

- The Other Evans Girl by El Montgomery: Lily-twin Hermione after all is lost in the original timeline. She is back to change things and attracts the unfortunate attention of both Dumbledore and Voldermort due to our favourite overused plot device: prophesy! A good fic nonetheless, I've enjoyed this a lot. linkffn(12588166)

- Butterfly Effect by Nekolvr111: Hermione is Shipwrecked after second year I think and grows up on a rough island with mad scientists and monsters. Then, she goes back in time to replace her original self and fix things as they all went wrong without her of course. Badass Hermione, basically. Interesting writing, interesting characters, give it a go linkffn(11556766)

- The Longest Prank by Marauderjunkie: I've really enjoyed this. OP-Hermione goes back to the night Harry got his scar. It gets more and more interesting from there. linkffn(12615476)

- Tempore et Spatio by NovaCalla: Not really sure this qualifies. Hermione reincarnated as McGonnagal's daughter, a toddler that just kind of appears from a different dimension. Funny! And interesting Scottish brogue. Linkffn(12242852)

- Curiosity and the Cat by SpindleKitten: Hermione goes back in time. Sirius and Moody feature heavily. linkffn(12610192)

- Two Things Are Infinite by Solanales: I remember really enjoying the start of this, but of course it's been a few months since the last update. However, I've kept it in my lis so it's worth checking out. linkffn(11961026) it goes back to Marauders ear.

- Time Immemorial by Fawkeslady: Hermione goes back, can't remember anything, Snape and a few others have to legillimise her to try to sort out her brain. All very interesting and has a great little adventure in Middle Eart (in her head). linkffn(12495244)

- A Bit of Sky by ShayaLonnie: ShayaLonnie is a good writer so you can be sure it's worth a go. Hermione Harry and Draco go to Marauders era. linkffn(12273702)

- The Future isn't Set in Stone by NinjaPenguinLover: Great Nom de Plume! Hermione goes back in time, becomes Lucius Malfoy's sister. Is for James Potter's enemy for some reason, can't remember. It's been a while since an update but at 33K words we can live in hope, as they're usually quite slow getting chapters out. Linkffn(116043139)

- Requiem for War: Doesn't update anything near often enough for my liking, but a very intriguing story. Hermione Goes to 1974 to change the course of that war after the second one goes pearshaped. Includes adoption to Dagworth-Granger and elder Potters. Really hope they continue writing! Linkffn(12243561)

- Hermione's Solution by SeaTurtle77: She goes back in time, adopts Tom and works at Hogwarts. What more do you need? The writing is pretty decent. linkffn(11731536)

- Somewhere in Time by ashenrenee: Hermione lands in 1981 and becomes the focus of a new prophesy. I remember enjoying all 10 chapters that have been writtten so far. linkffn(12243418)

- Red Right Hand by Nautical Paramour: Hermione goes back in time to adopt Tom when he's just a baby. In true NP style, she is challenged by the prevailing culture at the time which is super old-fashioned and would look down upon a single mother. I absolutely hated the ending, but I suppose this is always going to be a matter of opinion. It is a good story though! linkffn(12304702)

- The Past Isn't Set in Stone by LiveLifeLikeMe: This has been going for a little while and I'm enjoying it, although it's beena while since an update. Basically, Hermione goes back in time, becomes ultrapowerful but has yet to tap that power. linkffn(11574914)

- Of Ticking Clocks and Beating Hearts: A little too "whackyrandom" at times but otherwise a good bit fo fun. Hermione goes back to Marauders era, is a Slytherin, etc. Linkffn(11212346)

edit: seems I've made ffnbot explode and it's only linking some of the fics even after I split the post in two. Any ideas?


** Other interesting fics that feither either no Hermione or no Timetravel:

- Why Timetravel Should be Illegal and Other Morals by Mugglesftw: I believe the author hangs around the forum here as well. An interesting fic that features an OC (SI?) who is religious, coming from our world today into HP-verse when Harry's a little kid. An American stuck in England for a little while, I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say there is fantastic exploration of Hawaii's magic, and the bible. Some people find it too religion heavy and are jumping off, but they're being oversensitive in my opinion. It's interesting to see how it mixes. linkffn(12738075)

- The Selwyn Secret by kirsant: Another take on the "oops Hermione is a pureblood?" style, I've quite enjoyed most of this. It's not done yet and it has its flaws but you might enjoy it. linkffn (12752466)

- They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by LucyLuna: Several people get thrown back in time, starting with Snape and Lily. Kind of flew off the rails at some stage and I'll give it another chance some other time. Still, has some pretty cool scenes you might enjoy. linkffn(12386916)

- The Winter Witch by Kneazle: Hermione gets thrown into the Game of Thrones universe, without really realising it at first. She helps out Robb. I've enjoyed most of this so far, give it a go! linkffn(12689889)

- The Peace Not Promised by TempestKiro: Snape gets thrown back in time fic. Not bad, linkffn(12369512)

- A Witch in the Family by ANGSWIN: Hermione helps John (from Sherlock) adapt to the idea that he has a witch as a daughter. Very sweet. linkffn(12819887)

- Spellbound by Methos2523: Tony Stark finds out he has a daughter when her parents are killed and he gets a notification about it. It's Hermione, she's already attending Hogwarts. Fun story! linkffn(12828240)

- The Length and Breadth of Skyrim: A Witch's Tale by BakedOvenFreshStories: Hermione goes to Skyrim! It's beena good bit of fun. linkffn(12775152)

- The Elvenqueen by PristinelyUngifted: Hermione is reborn into the world of the Lord of the Rings. I enjoyed this, it's fantastical in all the right ways and nearly complete. linkffn(12005496)

- New Gods Rising: Hermione reincarnated into the GoT world again, this time as a Baratheon. Well written, I've had a good time with this linkffn(12700628)

- Sense of the Soul by Umbre Calamitas: Ron goes back after Hermione sacrifices herself for the ritual. Very good writing and story. linkffn(12478804)

- The Heart of Asshai by lizzieafterdark: This is an exciting beginning to a crossover that never materialised, 2 chapters only. still interesting and worth a look. linkffn(12466180)

- Best Served Cold by sakurademonalchemist: harry goes back in time, but there is one differene: hes´'s an auditor now. Everyone quakes in their boots. Enjoy this crackfic. linkffn(12149140)

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking.

Another one I liked (though the plot towards the end does become a bit vague and confusing) is Out of Time by Rurouni Star.

** I have to say this is an amazing list! I have read pretty much 80% of it at least! I would recommend a time travel story linkff(12456580). Aevum Praecantatio by ditzymagic. It is extremely well-written, above 100k, and the author updates every two/three weeks. Hermione and Lily are the main characters, but it's more Hermione-centric. The Sirius in this story is definitely a surprise! I have been following it for a year now. Each chapter is super long, so it's always worth the wait!

  In which Hermione falls down a rabbit hole---she wakes up with no idea of what happened or how she got there. Also, why does it have to be Hogwarts again? If this is a prank by another Unspeakable, she'd pay it back seven-fold once she got back. Yet it's never that simple.

  With the wizarding world destroyed beyond repair, Hermione would do anything to fix it. In her case, 'anything' will include time-travel, monthly moon symptoms, and breaking all the rules with a certain group of troublemakers from the past. AU Marauder era. RL/HG. Rated M for language, violence, and adult situations.

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, like tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids... Everything was wrong. 1950 was never her intention.

  "Can you be good for máthair, mo grá?" Minerva asks the small child with unshed tears pooling in her eyes, handing her a bag with her necessities and a letter. "You remember what to do right?" She nods. "Make sure you give this back to mommy when you see me next okay?" Minerva says crouching down to look into her eyes. "It's a game and if you give it back to máthair you'll win!"

  Hermione Malfoy is the cherished and sheltered only daughter of Lord Abraxas Malfoy, and lives a peaceful life at the center of her brother Lucius's world. But when, at age six, strange dreams and visions of another life begin to plague the young lady Malfoy, it becomes clear that she is not what she seems-and neither is the world in which she lives.

  When blackness overcame her senses, Hermione knew she had failed. It was game over. However, while she had never been sure of what to expect of the other side, a twenty-years-in-the-past Hogwarts surely hadn't been it. Now, with the chance to change the future, Hermione must choose her moves carefully while trying to avoid the one she wishes to see the most.
