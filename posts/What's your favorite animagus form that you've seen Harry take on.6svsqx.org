  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** A Sparrow.

And the way the author wrote it, I really liked the explanation. A sparrow is brown and rather boring, yet they have a group dynamic and look after their flock. Its not a beautiful falcon, alone circling the mountains for prey. A sparrow can do and fly without anybody really taking notice, yet it is not a pidgeon, or a crow. People like sparrows. And Harry likes to be liked, he just dislikes to be noticed for show and shine, but likes to be noticed for his genuine care for people.

** There was a semi-crack fic that I think was called Lord of Chaos where he's a bunny animagus and because of it is incredible at sex. I laughed so damn hard at that scene.

Also in Heroes Assemble we just found out his animagus form is a sparrowhawk, which is hilarious because Tony Stark has been referring to Harry as Sparrowhawk, a la Earthsea, practically since the beginning.

** What fic was it where he became a..... shadow panther? Something like that. Yes it's magical and blah blah blah magical Animagi but I liked it a lot.

Basically a panther-thing that could hide in shadows and was very vicious.

**** He's done it in a lot of different fics. Though of off the top of my head I can not recall any.(Even when checking my favourites list I can't find it -.- )

Besides the Rune Stone Path I mean to believe he's had it in a H/Hr fic where Harry travelled to the past and was specifically forbidden to tell that he was from the future. It just came up in a couple of scenes towards the end of the first fic and that was it. Just harry shadow-travelling and mauling Death Eaters from one end of Hogwarts to the other. The sequel fic is Hermione travelling back in time and helping Harry, I think that story got abandoned pretty quickly.

  An assortment of Harry Potter one shots. Though listed as "Humor/General," the collection also contains Drama, Horror, Family, and Tragedy, as well as a few experimental fiction stories as I work out my stylist chops. Contain crossovers with several fictional worlds, including the Cthulhu Mythos, Starship Troopers, Star Wars, and James Bond.

** I generally hate animagus shenanigans in ff. It's never relevant, and if it is, it's because of some stupid bullshit. So I prefer it to be a throwaway animal without any 'utility'.

There are some exceptions, Weed and A Black Comedy were already mentioned in this thread.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

It was an Avengers crossover, and as I recall, it had quite a bit of impact on the fic; Harry quite regularly used his animagus form. The fic's unique enough that [[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mishipeshu+fanfiction][you could probably find it with a quick google for Mishipeshu fanfiction.]]
