Looking mainly for stuff on Wattpad or FanFiction.net because I have the apps, but I don't mind reading on AO3 or anywhere else. I love these three together (consensually), even if Lucius is an evil shit most of the time. No real explanation except that I've read everything I can find and was hoping someone would know of something I haven't read. Please and thanks!


** Ohhh I just read a good one of those actually.

Its sweet in places and blisteringly funny in places and it has an absolutely excellent plot. I wish the author had written more but sadly this was their only fic.

*** Thanks! I've just started reading it and I'm in love! For some reason, I've seen it multiple times, but always skipped it. I guess it took you recommending it to make me read it and I'm so mad that I've skipped it for like two years now.

**** Ha, that's happened to me with a number of fics. I think the most impressive one was Lay Me Low, which i ended up loving to bits.

I think Mundungus42 also has a few SS/HG/LM fics, and Shiv did some too I think.
