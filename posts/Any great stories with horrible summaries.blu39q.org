I've started to wonder how many good stories I've missed by not reading them because their summaries stunk. Can you all recommend some for me? I'm really curious. To narrow it down preferably no slash, no horrific spelling errors, no lapslock, and no OP Harry. I'm fine with hearing they don't really exist as well.


** Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) The summary describes the first few scenes and nothing of what happens beyond. Sirius raises Harry while on the run, Tonks goes through auror training with Moody, Remus tries to help other victims of Greyback to prevent them from joining him, meanwhile everyone is looking for Harry and kidnapper Sirius. The Malfoys obviously want to exploit the situation for themselves. Umbridge is Umbridge. Oh, and the Serpents Sworn cause trouble.

**** Huh the first one is actually my favorite of the series by a lot. There's a bunch of interesting stuff happening and while there isn't a very cohesive plot there's plenty of cute slice of life to keep me engaged.

In contrast the others feel a little too much like cannon rehash for me.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** When a friend recommended I read !linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) he had to work very hard to convince me that is was actually worth a read, as neither the name nor description are compelling.

That said, it's one of the only harem stories out there that gives each girl a distinct personality and role, and it's got some very interesting magic and politics. It's also a fun play on a Peggy Sue story in that Harry is not the first person to be sent back in time to fix things. His WBWL brother was sent back first, but is still around in the new timeline wondering how things keep getting so off track.

*** What was great about that story? Dumbledore ignored obvious signs of neglect, and even saw Harry being let out of a locked cupboard. The rest of the story was just a retelling of the time Dumbledore met with Tom Riddle, just replaced with a bi-polar Harry Potter.

**** I found the summary to be the best part actually. The story itself is stupid nonsense that makes no sense from any point of view. It's a superficial "what if?" that is neither interesting, original or actually thought out.
