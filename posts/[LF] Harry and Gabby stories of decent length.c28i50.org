** How has Hope by Jeconais not be recommended yet? In my opinion it's the definitive Harry/Gabby story.

** Mine gets a lot of positive feedback and I think it's pretty good; at least better than 90% of the garbage that this pairing produces. I love this pairing myself, so I wanted to try and do it justice. It's 80k words in right now, but it's a WIP. I update at least every few weeks though. I'm going to probably update weekly in the summer. It's the first story in a trilogy. linkffn(13160344) hope you enjoy!

#+begin_quote
  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

** Pretty much cannon. If there is bashing it will be slight, and only because I'll be following the timeline from cannon.
