I want to first preference this by saying that I do not think Hermione is a "Mary Sue" or a bad character. She has great qualities (loyal, clever, intelligent, hardworking, caring) as well ones that are not so great (overbearing, over-competitive, argumentative). I also think her character is a great foil to Harry and Ron's.

I say all this to say that Hermione /can and has/ been wrong in canon. However, it just seems to me that JKR does everything she can to soften the blow for her.

- Hermione is dismissive her cat attacking Ron's rat: Oh, well, Ron's rat is /ACTUALLY/ a death-eater, but not just any death eater, no. This is THE death eater that betrayed Harry's parents.
- Hermione is jealous of Harry in Potions in book 6: NO, she weary of the book. And again she was proven right, as Harry uses as spell in said book that almost kills Draco.
- Hermione attacks Ron with the birds: The last image of that chapter is not Ron scattering injured, but a sob being heard from Hermione as she flees. And in the next chapter Harry and Hermione have nice conversation and don't even mention the incident. Then, later that chapter, Hermione laughs at Ron after he botches a spell, Ron imitates Hermione "jumping up and down" trying to answer a question in class and Hermione runs away in tears. All of this to reinforce that Hermione is REALLY the victim!
- Hermione turns in the firebolt to McGonagall behind Harry's back: Harry only has two thoughts and one interaction with Hermione before they are friends again. And his thoughts are rather favorable (she's well-intentioned, and how tired she looked).

Hermione never felt challenged to me as a character. She just wasn't put through the wringer like Harry and Ron were.

Ron's well known book 4 and 7 incidents left me with questions. Questions about if he can do the difficult task of putting himself second and Harry first, no matter how slighted he feels.

Harry jumping into the DOM battle, not even thinking of the mirror, and getting his friends injured and his godfather killed. Harry speaking Voldemort's name, after Ron constantly told him not to, led to Hermione getting tortured. This left me with questions. If Harry can reign himself in and think before he acts. If he can really be the leader that he needs to be to get the job done.

Hermione just never really had this. From book 1 through 7, the Hermione you saw was the Hermione you were going to continue to get.

As as result, when I put the books down, Hermione's character felt a little incomplete to me.


** I agree... Hermione is a great char, but as the series went on she sort of took on this "the person who accomplishes everything" role.

Partly it was for narrative convenience (don't know something, or need to do something? Hermione's read about it somewhere!) but I also think the movies subtly influenced the writing of the books. You get a lot more "Ron's a doofus" and "Hermione is perfect" moments in the later books, after the movies had started coming out.

There were moments where Hermione WAS presented as, if not in the wrong, then at least not handling things as well as she should have. She botched the entire house-elf liberation thing, because while her goal of ending slavery was noble, she spent all her time telling the house-elves what they wanted instead of listening to them.... and of course, she was dismissive and at times directly hostile to Luna just because Luna had ideas that clashed with Hermione's. But nothing ever came of this. Luna has no problems counting Hermione as one of her closest friends even though Hermione didn't really do anything to earn this...

...and the story with the house-elves looks like it's going somewhere, but then it just sort of doesn't, and in DH Hermione is suddenly the one who knows all about what it was like for Kreacher, and Ron thinking about the house-elves in the Battle of Hogwarts is treated like this big moment for Ron.... except this doesn't really match with how things have been up until then, because Ron has been a lot better with house-elves than Hermione has. He gets along with them, he compliments their work, he gives Dobby presents. He even gives Dobby his socks to be buried with. While he hasn't been all "end the slavery," he's related to the elves on a personal level that Hermione plain hasn't done. Showing concern for them and not wanting them to be hurt in a war is perfectly consistent with how Ron has been with house-elves this entire time.

But somehow DH had to twist this to Hermione having been right all along and Ron needing to learn another lesson. Huh.

I do think you're right... Hermione was never actually forced to confront her own flaws the way Ron and Harry were. Either the flaws were quietly ignored, or she turned out to have been right all along.

In my opinion, Hermione's bigggest and most consistent flaw is that she does not consider other people's feelings. It's more important for her to be RIGHT than it is for her to be considerate. The narrative does include a few token scenes where people rightfully get upset with her because of this (no, Hermione, when someone is crying because her pet rabbit has been killed, that is NOT the time to "logically" point out that Divination is flawed!), but beyond those token scenes there really aren't any consequences for Hermione whatsoever. On the occasions when there are, it's usually turned around so that Hermione is presented as blameless or at least in the right.

*** Yeah, I think Hermione is not treated the same way as Ron and Harry are plot-wise partially because of the way JKR uses her to be "the one who gives information." It's like "Harry with his best mate Ron go on adventures and Hermione helps." Which gives Harry and Ron narrative room to address their flaws but makes Hermione fall into the trap of being a perfect character.

I hope I don't cause drama by saying this but honestly, this is a big reason why a lot of black/PoC Harry Potter fans don't think Hermione can be read as black. Handing out badges, calling useless meetings and telling oppressed people how they ought to feel just reeks of #WhiteWomanFeminism, so it really doesn't fit with Hermione being black IMHO. Not to say that black women/girls can't be bad at activism, but Hermione is shown as brilliant in so many things and for this to be the thing she sucks at, would be pretty bad.

  ‚ÄòIt was bad,' said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the table top, looking pale and sweaty. ‚ÄòMalfoy called her ‚ÄúMudblood‚Äù, Hagrid---'

  Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.

  ‚ÄòHe didn'!' he growled at Hermione.

  ‚ÄòHe did,' she said. ‚ÄòBut I don't know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course...'
#+end_quote

Hermione also comes off as confused rather than offended or outraged at being called a mudblood by Draco Malfoy. She recognizes that it's rude, but the story doesn't show much of a reaction other than observing "Draco is a bad person", instead of, "Wow, the wizarding world is prejudiced too", as you'd expect in someone who is a minority in a 95%+ white Anglo-Saxon society.

#+end_quote

Then there are instances of actual real world /racist/ racism in the books, not just fantasy blood supremacism, and that's not remarked on by the trio later on. And again, it's used as a way to show that Draco's gang are evil little shits rather than dig deeper into the attitudes espoused by wizarding society.

******* With regards to "Anglo-Saxon", its widespread incorrect usage actually led to the EU Court of Auditors issuing guidance on its use in EU publications:

#+begin_quote
  In English, the term ‚ÄòAnglo-Saxon' is generally used to describe a member of any of the West Germanic tribes (Angles, Saxons and Jutes) that settled in Britain from the 5th century AD. Also, particularly in America, it is used to denominate white people, usually of the Protestant faith (‚ÄòWASPS'), thus excluding large swathes of the population of that country. It follows that there is no such thing as an Anglo-Saxon country, or, as in the example below, an Anglo-Saxon agency or Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Furthermore, the Anglo-Saxon language ceased to exist in the 12th century (I am ill-informed about Brussels, but the last known speaker in Luxembourg was St Willibrord, 658-739). This term is particularly inapplicable (and, I gather, irritating for those concerned) when used to describe the Irish, Scots and Welsh, who partly base their national identities on not being descended from the Anglo-Saxons (everybody seems to have forgotten about the poor Jutes), and verges on the ridiculous when used to include West Indians or people like the incumbent US president, who, in EU terminology, would be the leader of the Anglo-Saxon world.

  Example

  "The Anglo-Saxon group of agencies reflect (sic) the previous dominance of Anglo-Saxon capitalism which was not disrupted by two world wars and the specific operational issues relating to Asian economies."

  Alternatives

  ‚ÄòEnglish-speaking' when referring to the countries or the people, ‚ÄòBritish' and ‚ÄòAmerican' (‚ÄòAustralian' or whatever) when referring to agencies, capitalism etc. The term may, however, be used if you are talking about something like the (presumed) ‚ÄòAnglo-Saxon conspiracy' and you will often find it used ironically in this way in the British press (usually in inverted commas). However, it has negative connotations and should be avoided in any serious writing.

As for "Caucasian", its use to mean "white" is just wrong, being an example of completely outdated anthropology (its origin in meaning "white" was as part of an anthropological theory in which all humans belonged to either the "Caucasian" or "Mongolian" races).

*** i think, we can all agree that the Plot of Book 6, the Characterizations of all People included, is not the Best one. Its like The Author was Realizing, that she was already at the second-to-last Book, so the Story was nearly finished and she had to redirect the Plot and the Relationships (Harry-Ginny as an example) to make it fit for her Origin planned Ending. The Thing that neither Hermione and not even Ron (ESPECIALLY Ron) get suspicious about Malfoys behaviour (yes, they checked him at the Beginning, but they assumed it was harmless) is OoC and even the Order Members as taken by Arthur as an example: "Harry, i doubt that Voldemort would do such a thing", "By all respect, Mr. Weasley, do any People actually KNOW what Voldemort is thinking?!" So true at Harrys side. Arthurs spoken doubt was amateurish. If he see it that way, then nobody would be criminal, even if there are clear Proves and traits that lead to said Person, but "s/he wouldnt do such a thing". So Voldemort was just an injustified Victim in the last decade or what?!

So yes, the Book was a Forced way to keep the actual Plot in line. If the Trio would have stayed together and investigated more on Malfoy, he and Snape would have been uncovered earlier. By the way, no Member does any apology to Harry for acknowledging that he was right the whole time. All acting as "well, shit happens".

I don't expect nor want such a blatant dilemma in every fiction I read/watch but here, all of the important and recurring characters had /some/ character development except Hermione Granger who, in short, only learned a bit of tact (or resignation) while dealing with others.

Honestly, I feel that Crabbe/Goyle had more character development, beginning as a mute bodyguard and ending as an arsonist for magical Hitler (even if, granted, most of that character development is off screen).

But the utter acceptance of full on slavery from everyone else is... gross, and I don't think that the "But they like it being enslaved!" is a good argument, or (more importantly) a good inclusion in a book series for children/young adults.

#+end_quote

Hermione's in the wrong here, no doubt about it. She does not take steps to make sure Crookshanks will not encounter Scabbers--even bringing him up to the boys' dormitory, effectively enabling her cat to attack Ron's rat.

Granted, it's a mystery series and an observant reader will have noted things that were peculiar about Scabbers in the first place, but that doesn't change the fact that Hermione is arguably callous towards Ron in regards to his pet.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is jealous of Harry in Potions in book 6: NO, she weary of the book. And again she was proven right, as Harry uses as spell in said book that almost kills Draco.
#+end_quote

I'm actually a little sympathetic to Hermione here. While experimenting with Potion ingredients is dangerous, and she's right to be cautious, it's also a very important part of the subject. Hermione dismissing it out of hand is narrow-minded. That said, she's not wrong that Harry is not actually studying the book to understand the ways the modifications actually work.

What's really bad is that when things go pear-shaped, Hermione can't resist the opportunity to say "I told you so," after Harry critically injures Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione attacks Ron with the birds: The last image of that chapter is not Ron scattering injured, but a sob being heard from Hermione as she flees. And in the next chapter Harry and Hermione have nice conversation and don't even mention the incident. Then, later that chapter, Hermione laughs at Ron after he botches a spell, Ron imitates Hermione "jumping up and down" trying to answer a question in class and Hermione runs away in tears. All of this to reinforce that Hermione is REALLY the victim!
#+end_quote

This was awful. Hermione has no right to retaliate to Ron's romancing Lavender with violence, especially since she never made it clear to Ron she thought of him romantically. And she doesn't apologize for laughing at Ron's mustache during the Transfiguration lesson--and I'm surprised McGonagall tolerated their bickering.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione turns in the firebolt to McGonagall behind Harry's back: Harry only has two thoughts and one interaction with Hermione before they are friends again. And his thoughts are rather favorable (she's well-intentioned, and how tired she looked).
#+end_quote

Once again, Hermione's got a more sympathetic motivation--someone sends Harry a ludicrously expensive present and does it anonymously to boot? When there's a deranged criminal after him?

But she does come off as self-righteous. Going behind Harry's back is bad enough, but to not even say /why/ until after is worse. She forms her hypothesis almost immediately and she doesn't say so until it's already done, when Harry is too angry to listen to her.

** The bird scene. This scene always fucking gets to me because it is so clear if the roles were reversed, the fucking backlash and venom that Ron would have gotten would be wild. As it should be, because it is never alright to harm someone because your feelings are hurt. The way Hermione got framed as a victim there always infuriated me.

Hermione was my favorite when I was growing up because she was so smart and sure of herself, and duh of course way better than Harry and Ron because she was the brains. But as I got older and reread the books, its clear that Hermione never fucking learned from her mistakes, because no one in canon wanted to hold her accountable for her actions.

She threw a fit in Divination because it's the only subject she didn't get? That's fine, the professor and course are useless anyway (Never mind that in HBP when Harry was complaining about Snape, she shut him down). She permanently disfigured a teenager because she made a mistake and snitched? Oh that okay, Marietta, a whole teenager of max 16 years, deserved it. Never mind that was implied Umbridge threatened her mother's job and Marietta never consented to this punishment, and couldn't because Hermione didn't tell anyone about it. She belittled Ron knowingly in ways that affected him most? Well, Ron's a dick, so he obviously deserved it, even though while Ron teased Hermione when they were younger he ALWAYS made it clear he was on her side. She derailed Harry multiple times (Draco, the Deathly Hallows, wandlore in general) and was found wrong? Oh well, it's okay Hermione can't know everything, and shouldn't have to apologize or admit that she was wrong or that there are certain parts of magic that she just doesn't understand.

‚Äã

I just.... it shouldn't be so hard for there to be some accountability with her character. Like Hermione is good character, I talk mad shit, but I do really like her still. I just hate the lack of accountability she has and that fandom and Rowling seem to have for her.

In GoF, Ron was Jealous of Krum and he showed temper tantrum, which is quite normal among teenagers.

But Ron gets bashed for it hard, because he was being an immature git and he publicly humiliated her. He hurt their goddess. //sarcasm//

But in HBP, when Hermione reacts even worse, they easily change their tune.

If you see the para before Hermione unleashes the canaries.

#+begin_quote
  The corridor outside seemed to be deserted. ‚ÄúHermione?‚Äù He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.
#+end_quote

Now, in this, if you remove the author's obvious coddling, this para...

Doesn't it give the vibes akin to a butcher sharpening his knife?

Or a murdering megolomaniac stroking his snowy white cat while sipping earl grey, as he watches his intricately laid plans unfold?

Nah, the second one obviously went too far. üòÇüòÇ

Anyway, Hermione was clearly practicing that spell beforehand. She intentionally wanted to damage Ron. It's not an impulsive, spur of the moment attack, like many Hermione worshippers would like to think.

It's a planned, cold hearted retribution.

It is lot similar to /someone acid attacking a girl when he sees the girl he is +obsessed+ in love with, snog another boy./

Hermione's attack, it screams of /"If I can't get him, then no one else can!"/

That... is really disturbing.

But when loads of Hermione worshippers try to find excuses for Hermione, and when even JKR condones that attack....that really is a disturbing trend.

/Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight./

These events make it clear that Hermione has seen the Ron and Lavender snogging.

So, unlike Ron, instead of confronting them, she extricated herself away from the party. And Harry having a sinking feeling follows her.

Now a common excuse many Hermione worshippers at this juncture, use is that /*Ron was merely jealous in GoF while Hermione was truly in love with Ron in HBP.*/

Bullshit.

It's just Harry was aware of budding feelings between Ron and Hermione in HBP, while he has no clue about them in GoF. With that cleared..let's get back into the topic.

/He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this./

And let's assume that she was practicing /avis/ conjuration spell (also taught in sixth year) to distract herself, which is the most reasonable and plausible explanation.

But these...

/‚ÄúOh, hello, Harry,‚Äù she said in a brittle voice. ‚ÄúI was just practicing.‚Äù/

/when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, ‚ÄúRon seems to be enjoying the celebrations.‚Äù/

And this

/‚ÄúGerremoffme!‚Äù he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it./

Makes it extremely suspicious.

True, I might have exaggerated when I said, that Hermione was practicing that spell beforehand solely to hurt Ron, but still,

******** I mean Hermione isn't a psychopath. But I think the issue is that she was let off lightly with the whole attack issue. And scarring Edgecombe (though she deserved it). For all her brilliance, I'm surprised that she didn't try preventing betrayal. That being said, I always saw her as a sane Bellatrix Lestrange.

  It's the magical equivalent of trying to distract yourself by practicing spinning a basketball, and chucking it at your love interest and their snogging partner. Hardly psychopathic, you're ridiculous.
#+end_quote

Did you even read the book?

/The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face with his hands/

/but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach/

PECKING AND CLAWING AT EVERY BIT OF FLESH THEY COULD REACH

Now how on earth is that equivalent to chucking a basketball at your love interest?

#+begin_quote
  What is this bullshit claim that the bludgers were the target of an oppugno spell?
#+end_quote

Oppugno jinx makes an object to follow the target and attack him no matter where he goes.

So it is reasonable enough to deduce that the rogue bludgers were jinxed with oppungo spell.

And even though it is said that elves have their own magic, they can still use some wizarding spells. For example Dobby used hover charm to levitate and move the pudding. They may not utter incantation or use exact wand movements, but their intent is all the same.

Dobby jinxed those bludgers to keep attacking Harry and only Harry, wherever he goes.

Even after knowing and seeing first hand how devastating an oppungo jinx could possibility be, if not used responsibly, Hermione still doesn't hesitate to unleash that jinx against Ron in that fit of anger, while on the other hand, all Ron does is show a temper tantrum when he was in exact similar situation during GoF.

It shows that while Ron's "retributions" are usually harmless, Hermione's on the other hand are cold, calculated and disproportionate.

I'm not saying that Hermione is evil. I'm saying that Hermione doesn't consider the limits or consequences of her actions sometimes.

******* They're little birds lol, way to be dramatic. It'll hurt but not cause serious damage, especially with the whole MAGIC thing that lets them play sports 100ft in the air while actual cannonballs are targeting them. It's equivalent because magical people have different standards for violence, you're being purposefully oblivious to this very obvious fact.

"Reasonable to deduce" is doublespeak for "making assumptions" - you're doing some weird Twitter-Rowling shit where you theorize about things that could technically be true but aren't in the actual books. Literally everyone thinks you're out to lunch for comparing little birds to steel bludgers.

Hermione's was not calculated - she was walked in on; it's not disproportionate - you managed to forget that magic exists and for some reason you're in love with the idea that little birds hurt as much as steel bludgers; and while she said her lines "coldly", storming out of the room in tears after throwing the first thing at hand at Ron is hardly a cold action lol.

******** Harry climbed into the common room. Ron and Hermione were having a blazing Row.

"I can't believe you would cavort with the enemy," yelled Ron.

He stormed past her to the staircase, paused, and turned around.

"AVIS! OPPUGNO!" Ron bellowed. The birds shot towards Hermione like golden bullets, pecking and scratching at every available bit of flesh.

"Ow! Stop, please!" Hermione yelled. She screamed in pain as Ron shot a look of vindictive fury and shot up the stairs. Harry thought he could hear a sob.

Here's the situation in reverse.

*** I think you're reading too much into the bird attack. Hermione was clearly hurt and fled the scene because she didn't manage to deal with the situation in any other way than to remove herself. Then later on she felt cornered and lashed out.

There's no way she could have anticipated Ron and Lavender barging in on her. The bird attack simply was her absolutely losing it. Yeah, she should have gotten /some/ flack for this later, and there really should have been a moment of recognition that maybe she needs to work on her temper, but to think that the attack was premeditated is to look for malice where there is none.

Hermione, obviously did with the bird attack, but also Harry in OttP when he gets Hedwig to nip at Ron and Hermione until they have scars from it because he's upset. But oh no, Ron is clearly the abusive one.

**** While I don't see any of them becoming abusing (thought they would have a lot of disputs), I would still back up Ron in case of conflicts.\\
Hermione is, from the start, more versed in theory, she can study spells, learn them and maybe even invent some, but she doesn't have the "fighter instinct" Harry or Ron have. Add to it the years Ron spent as a Auror and he is way most likely to win in case of fight (thought as said before I don't see him ever fight Hermione for any reason. Hell he is the kind of guy I see sticking to defense Charms if an Imperiused Hermione was trying to kill him).

** Dismissive of a cat attacking a rat.

Does the "smartest which of the generation" know what cats /are/....?

I had a kid like that in school. He could memorize and recite useless crap, but had no common sense, no real comprehension, no social skills, and he was insufferable on top of that.

My stance on bullying is early - and often. Builds character, and either makes sure you don't grow up to be a wanker later, or gives you thick enough skin that you don't care.

** I sort of feel this way about Snape. Sure, he's hated at first, but then it turns out he was ~misunderstood~ to the point that Harry NAMES HIS KIDS AFTER HIM. She also never showed James grow or improve, we just take Sirius's word for it that he did.

Edit: I also feel like Hermione was the least fleshed out of the trio. We barely see her parents or her familial relationships. We don't see her boggart, we just hear her say that it's failing her exams. We don't know how she feels about Harry always being in the limelight. We know nothing about her childhood, and very little about her hopes and ambitions for the future, just that she doesn't want to work at the Ministry. I think JKR sees her as more of an insert than a character that exists fully within the narrative. But I also think that Ron, while he does get shown to be more flawed, also gets forgiven very, very quickly once he admits wrongdoing. Almost immediately, a lot of the time, unless it's Hermione holding the grudge.
