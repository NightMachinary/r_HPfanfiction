:END:
It was kind of a reboot of book 5 I think. Harry is sent to Snape's house for summer for some reason, he found a fantasy muggle book there, it was the favourite book of Snape when he was young, Harry likes it much so Snape let him to have it. When Harry goes to Weasley's house for the rest of the summer, he talks about it with Hermione and Ron, they say it's nice his time in Snape's house was pleasant enough, but they're worried Harry is uselessly raising up his hopes with Snape because he wouldn't change his attitude in school only because right now they were getting along. Do you know the title?
