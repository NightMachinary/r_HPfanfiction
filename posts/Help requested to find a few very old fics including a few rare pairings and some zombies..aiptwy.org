So I remember these stories were all from the same author and they were on the authors live journal so I may be out of luck but I figured it was worth a try.

1) Set at Hogwarts and before the books were fully published. Voldemort sets off an old voodoo curse that brings zombies to the school. Harry and his friends have to try and survive basically a Dawn of the Dead situation. Was very dark, lots of character deaths.

2) Another dark fic by the same author where a disease or curse is killing people. Mostly from this one I remember a terrible attack on the Daily Prophet. Had Ron/Hermione but also Luna/Percy.

3) One shot by the same author, I think titled something about company ink. Featured Luna/Fred/George. Both twins were secretly doing Luna in the back room of the shop. Was a one shot.

All stories were very mature almost explicit. I know it's a long shot since I don't think these lived on ffn or ao3 but I figured I'd try my luck. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!


** Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders ;)

+Think I [[https://audswritesfics.livejournal.com/1455.html][found a lead]]. Does 'audswritesfics' sound correct? It looks to me like that person isn't the author, but compiling a list of stories.+

+I'm not familiar with livejournal, but I finally tracked down #3 - however, the link to that one on their page just leads to a 'SinFree.Net' and won't load anything :/ The person who compiled the list says that 'Syn' is the author of 'The Company Ink', but there's no link to 'Syn's profile anywhere and I can't seem to find it, so I couldn't find anything similar to your #1 and #2 mentioned, sadly.+

+Hope this SOMEHOW can help even a little, even though I can't find an author page for Syn/'The Company Ink'. If you do find out, could you please let me know? They all sound really interesting and I'd love to read them!+

+Edit: I kept digging and think I found Syn's livejournal, now under [[https://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=cicatrixstories][Cicatrix]].+

+EDIT 2: HERE IS [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/30814.html]['The Company Ink']] ! Having trouble finding the other 2 because I can't easily get summaries for the others, but will keep on digging.+

+EDIT 3: [[https://cicatrixstories.livejournal.com/11851.html][Wake the Dead]] , your #1 story with zombies. Note, this is just the prologue, and livejournal doesn't seem to have a 'next chapter' button, but at least we have the title now!+

FINAL EDIT: Okay, I'm pretty sure I have all the chapters of all 3 stories found now. I also started to get the hang of the website - I made an account in order to get the fic summaries to display, but best I can tell there still is no (consistent/accurate) 'next chapter' function, so I just compiled all the chapters for all of the stories in my 'memories' tab (???), [[https://fairygodcat.livejournal.com/memories][here]], for anyone wanting to read them and not have to dig around to find the next bit. I saved them all as 'public', so they should be visible - let me know if they aren't. I'm not sure if you need an account to see the list or not.

******* Totally agree! I think part of it is most of these were written, I believe, before Luna turned up in the movies. Evanna Lynch is amazing as Luna which makes it hard to not imagine her when reading the books now or thinking about the character in general for writing a new take.

It's interesting to see a version of her from before Evanna's take on things. Not that I would ever trade her. She IS Luna Lovegood.

I'm still amazed you found it. I legitimately spent an hour googling this morning before I stumbled on the sub and posted for help!

******** I love Evanna and wouldn't trade her for anything, but I DO think her soft/sweet/spacey voice she used sort of made a lot of authors make her even more naive/ditzy/out of it that book-Luna ever actually was! Book-Luna is still a person, albeit a weird one with strange beliefs and a (outward) lack of care of what others think - she gets short with Hermione, offended when her dad or The Quibbler are attacked, etc. Movie-Luna just has a way of seeming so friendly and spacey that she doesn't even NOTICE things like that.

I spent roughly an hour-hour and a half looking, I think, and I almost gave up after finding that first livejournal that was a list of stories and mentioned Syn. In part, it was because I found LJ a bit annoying and clunky to navigate, lol! But I kept re-reading your summaries of the stories and it made them sound so interesting that I couldn't just leave it there.

Also, welcome to hpfanfiction, and stay awhile :) I've had more luck finding amazing stories on here than I've had looking on my own recently and there's a lot of really good character/plot dissections and discussions that pop up!

********* I'm definitely going to spend some time here. I've recently gotten back into HP fanfic and its been great.

Totally agree on Luna. You're spot on.

On a final great fanfic note, if you haven't read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10672917/chapters/23626929][Debt of Time]] you should do so immediately. I'm sure it's a well known one but I found it about a month ago and it sucked me away from my other fandoms and right back into HP. I've been trapped in HP world ever since catching up after a several year hiatus into other in universes.

*********** If you prefer it, Debt of Time is actually also on ffn and can be read through their app. It is, however, censored for mature content, so more graphic parts are missing or have been rewritten for a lower rating. That won't impact your ability to fall in love with the plot though so. I actually read it on ffn first then went back to uncover missing scenes on ao3.

All of that said, I totally agree about the interface. I read on ao3 but rarely find new things there.

***** Aw, that's great that you like them!

So I found these I think my senior year of high school which was forever ago. I was very very very deep in the internet looking for fanfic after a lot of good stuff was purged from ffn.

If I remember right, this author is prolific and very very good. The Wake the Dead fic might honestly be one of the first zombie cross overs with Harry Potter and just took my breath away. Once I saw your edit about the site name it all came rushing back though. The author also did some great fanart which I'm digging for now.

This is just so wonderful and a blast from the past. I'm so glad I found this sub while googling myself!

****** I remember hearing about a ffn purge in the past - but it had occurred after I briefly abandoned the site. Came back a year or two ago and UGH, it looked so weird and I couldn't find a lot of old things that used to be there.

Wake the Dead left me feeling so...I suppose not 'unnerved' but just shocked? I wasn't expecting a happily ever after, per se, but I wasn't expecting THAT either. I loved it - I don't see much stuff like that around.

The Company Ink wasn't my cup of tea but I'm diving into some of Syn's other stuff now. I wonder whatever happened to Syn, if he/she is still active somewhere or is a redditor, even..

******* There was a big ffn purge for smut and other dark themes. If I remember right some of it started with a fic called [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/4220/1][Lust or Love]]. It's a good fic that got reported and spawned a few new sites like the now closed unknowable room. If you haven't read it I do suggest it. It's a James and Lily story but a little unconventional.

All the dates on these posts are making me feel very old.

I think Syn ended up moving into real original fiction. I have vague memories of preview chapters of a book being put on her site at one point. I hope that's true but it was a long time ago so I could be confused.

Either way I hope they notice a spike in live journal traffic and realize their stories made an impact. Obviously I remember them fondly after almost 15 years.

Thank you again! It's been a really shit week and this was just a big pick me up 😊

Because I'm +an incredibly creepy weirdo+ +a stalker+ very inquisitive, I found out that Syn is [[https://www.amazon.com/C.-J.-Baker/e/B004RKH368/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1][C.J. Baker]], author of quite a few books that look well-received if not widely known, and she was active (at least in putting her books on amazon) as of early 2017. Her FB hasn't had a post since 2013, but it could just be set to private after that.

That being said, we could probably get in contact with her and let her know how much staying power her older works have! :)

There was also some info in her amazon seller page about her as a person, and tbh her life sounds awesome! I'm going to try contacting her too, to let her know how much I loved Wake the Dead (and I'm sure a lot of her others as soon as I finish them!)

** After looking at what [[/u/ProblemmPixie]] found. I trolled through the wayback machine and found what I think is the last working version of the SinFree site. Didn't seem to have Wake the Dead but I haven't checked every link to see if it has a different name or something.
