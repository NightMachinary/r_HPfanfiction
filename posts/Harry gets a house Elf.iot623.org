** I misremembered and thought Harry and Hermione got an elf in Arithmancer. But I think only Hermione got one (Dobby), though the Dobby helped Harry with some things too.

It bugged me that the elves in that story all talked like Jar Jar Binks but I guess you can get used to that.

The story is very Hermione centric (that was fine with me) and tries to transplant Muggle science and math into the wizarding world (IMHO not that successfully). The elf content is not all that big a part of it but it is there.
