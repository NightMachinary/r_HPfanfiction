I have just finished reading Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince and while it was enjoyable, it follows the book at little too closely.

I quite liked reading from a different perspective and I think the "7th" year at Hogwarts with the Gryffindors/D.A. standing up to Snape and the Carrows can make for great adventures.

Does anyone knows something like this or close ?

Thanks!


** I wrote linkffn(Not From Others)

A few points to consider - although you do see brutality from the Carrows in my fic I am of the opinion that it escalated as Snape struggled to control them and keep up the pretense of being a death eater. The other teachers would also do their best. My fic is not as grim dark as Dumbledores Army and the year of darkness because I just don't think that is realistic and throws up questions like why would anyone send their kids back after Christmas.

** In my opinion the best fic in this niche is linkffn(4429131) where Hogwarts is not a pleasant place to be but yet does not go over the top and remains still rather light hearted. Worth a read.

  Ginny's war was very different to Harry's war but just as important. The rebellion by the students of Hogwarts put the members of Dumbledore's Army into daily dangerous situations with Death Eaters.

*** I read it years ago and I thought it was really enjoyable. It's dark compared to canon, but not horribly dark on the fanfic spectrum. It spawned sequels and spinoffs. The author knows how to write a story well , which is the most important thing. If I remember right, he a nut and quite unpopular among â€˜fandom'. But as someone who just wants to read well written characterizations and a plot that moves and is engaging --- I do think this one is worth a read. Maybe even just below the tier of classics. (I have not read the sequels so no idea about those).

  Ginny does not want to spend ten months locked in a castle while her family risks their lives in a war. Harry might have dumped her, but she's not exactly safe. Hogwarts is more dangerous than ever before...but at least she still has Neville, Luna, and the rest of the D.A. She'll need all the support she can get, because the war is not ending anytime soon.
