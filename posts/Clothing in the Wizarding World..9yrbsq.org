** Google houppelande. The google image results, especially the line drawing from Wikipedia, are legitimately what I picture most wizarding robes looking like, more or less. Also, while the google results are reasonably plain versions, I've seen some ridiculously fancy stuff done with those clothes and if I were an artist I'd do a Yule Ball scene with everyone in brocaded silk and goldwork and seed pearls because that's totally what would be going on. Also, I can tell you from experience that the first time you dress that way it feels distinctly odd but it quickly becomes very comfortable and it's surprisingly easy to exist and work and do normal things while in that type of garb, and, especially if you've been wearing it for a week or two straight, it feels even weirder going back to mundane clothes than it did trying those in the first place - which makes the wizarding characters' awkwardness with muggle clothes make absolutely perfect sense, in my opinion.

*** Researched clothing styles through the ages a half-dozen times to pin down what JKR seemed to intend for these costumes. Never saw (or followed up on) the word [[https://www.google.com/search?q=houppelande&num=20&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPn__y5ePeAhXHmq0KHW0HDmUQ_AUIDigB&biw=1707&bih=1014]['houppelande']].

**** It wasn't so much the resemblance to earlier muggle clothing as it was being a part of a historical re-creation group (the Society for Creative Anachronism) and seeing people wearing this stuff. The first time I saw an outfit in this style, it immediately clicked in my head that it was like the vague image I had of wizarding robes. I'd always imagined that they didn't wear muggle clothes under generic robes like most wizard costumes are because they wouldn't have been so ignorant of muggle clothing if they did, and this gave me a picture of how that would work.

** My headcannon is that there's a lot of variation and that the variations carry sociocultural meaning. Most robes are probably very customized/bespoke, given the general economy. Wizards also dress pretty wildly in the muggle world, so it makes sense there'd be a lot of individual variation in style.

I also tend to imagine women's formalwear being somewhat medieval or like the robe a la francaise, but with more robe-like backs & sleeves (and without functional corsets.) My headcannon is that robes are big--like bigger than someone's body underneath, so wearing them open over clothing is both practical and flattering.

** Usually, I assume that the Hogwarts school robes are like the ones in the books. For Auros and Hit-Wizards as well as duellists, I assume they wear robes that look more like trench coats - cut to allow easy movement. For everyone else: A mix of both for most, and whatever they want for the rest.

In "Patron", though, wizards wore much more magical clothes - the more magical, the better. Floating robes that didn't touch the skin, illusionary fire, transfigured smoke, clothes that changed as you wore them, liquid clothes - anything goes. Students wore the standard robes until year 6, at which point they wore whatever they wanted under an open school robe. Spells on robes also helped with defending against curses and were a status symbol.

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I think Wizarding clothing is based on middle-ages and Elizabethan era fashion - t-shirts and other 'modern muggle' stuff is only worn by rebels or those newly introduced to the Wizarding world.

**** That's when the two societies split. While muggles changed fashions due to changes in lifestyles (more factory work, break throughs in transportation, foriegn influence, new textiles, female empowerment, etc.) nothing much changed in the wizarding world - magic allowed for more equality between sexes, literacy and education rates were aleady high, clothing prices were due to amount of magical effort to produce clothing rather than actual physical material, no major revolutions, etc. Also, due to longer lifespans, wizarding society and tastes don't change as quickly as muggle society making traditional clothing more relevant. Even if they do change, they wouldn't go in the same direction as muggles - I would think that (especially for the first few decades after the statute was implemented) wizards would take pride in being different from muggles.

****** A big part of it is also the book 1 descriptions of what wizards were wearing. But for me, I've visited a few countries and even in ones where sweaters and jeans are a thing, there is still distinct differences in style. Also, Britain held India for years but somehow British style never quite transferred to everyday people. Considering it is a hidden magical society, I really don't see why fashions would be the same. I think it was mostly because the movies had a limited budget for wardrobe that so much of 'muggle' clothing was incorporated. If you see the Pottermore drawings of school uniforms, they're full on robes rather than private school uniforms with opened robes.

** I use everything! :) In my head canon people really just where whatever they want to, so you could have someone in pure robes next to someone else with muggle clothes, or somebody with the more fantastic beasts pants and suit stuff going on! :) Because yes I don't think muggles invented pants so it should not be all robes, all the time really. They should have magic pants of their own!

** Clothing, in my opinion, depends on the situation. Hogwarts and certain jobs certainly dictate a peculiar type of clothes as it is part of tradition, or because in their duty, Aurors or Hitwizards, and or Officials represent the governant body - the Ministry. I think in casual setting robes are not required.

** I'd like to think that it is a varied and diverse as our normal clothing. There are different fashions, styles, cuts and cultural backgrounds. Conservative, adult, night and provocative youth clothing.

I let myself be inspired by the books, the movies but also quite a bit of other sources.

** Personally, I go with the idea that robes are quite similar to the western styles of dress in the early 1700s since the Statute of Secrecy had only just gone up around then. So lots of long frock and overcoats like banyans and kaftans for the men, and women would have long frock coats over dresses or long fitted tunics.

** Given the portrayed eccentricity of witches and wizards in canon, I imagine there is a great deal of variation in style of robes ranging from dressing gown to kaftan to houppelande to yukata. Underneath, those raised in the magical world wear a shift and often tights (in addition to pants or lingerie), both unisex clothing options before the Statute of Secrecy.

Given the lack of plastics and thus elastic material, lacing becomes far more common, made more convenient by the presence of self-lacing enchantments. Robes are generally cut from a single large piece of fabric to make enchanting easier. As for footwear, I imagine leather boots and cloth or leather shoes as the favored options. Boots, again, are much more appealing when you have charms to lace them up for you and regulate temperature.

Jewelry would be very commonly worn among wealthy adults as wearable enchanted items which can be fit into many outfits. The Weasley twins prove that this sort of enchantment is not impossible, but I can imagine a situation where the best enchanters want to make as much money as possible from their skills and place their enchantments on extremely expensive jewelry, limiting their availability. Also, in my head canon magical Britain and indeed the rest of the area formerly colonized by the Roman Empire is not well known for that style of enchanting, focusing on wand magic instead. High quality enchanted jewelry might be imported from places like magical Persia and India instead.
