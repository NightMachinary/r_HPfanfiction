*** Below are spoilers that encompass all the previous chapters*!*

Here are my old notes on it, for anyone interested:

#+begin_quote
  In the beginning of year 4 Harry discovers that his personality and memories were being messed with. He eventually starts training with Barty, discovers that Moody is fake, starts corresponding with Voldemort and by the end of the year briefly travels to him using a portkey to resurrect him and make an unbreakable vow of mutual non-agression and partial protection. Voldemort is a scholar that eventually lets Harry live with him and even invite to them some of his friends.

  Neutral!Harry, rational!Harry, rational!Voldemort, Manipulative!Dumbledore, Ron bashing, Dumbledore bashing, critique of the British wizarding community.

  +The story is abandoned likely because author has health issues and no free time.+
#+end_quote

The only thing I remember not liking about this story was how Harry (I think) defended the purebloods' entitlement to magic through the “mah culture” argument.

Also, I'm really glad it finally got updated. Its writing was of a very high quality, AFAIR.

**** IIRC Harry is rather neutral on that argument, even though he sees the points of both sides (don't reproduce with muggles, wizards have a different culture that needs respect vs using muggles utensils to write, having a muggle education or muggle clothes are better than wizarding ones).

*** I think it was about Harry not wanting to fight against Voldemort and maneuvering to accomplish just that.

I'll be honest though, the update was pretty underwhelming.

** Got to chapter 6. Fake Moody ended up being a child psychiatrist, social worker, and high school guidance councilor in one. Who knew?
