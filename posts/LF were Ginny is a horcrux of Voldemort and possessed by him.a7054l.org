I'd read this fic years ago, I just forgot it's title. Volde-Ginny calls himself as Morsmorde or something like that. It's epic in length probably with 100k to 200k word of length, and I'm not sure but I think Voldemort has multiple living horcux in this fic just like how Harry Potter is also a horcrux.


** She wasn't possessed, but I'd recommend Harry Potter and the lost demon
