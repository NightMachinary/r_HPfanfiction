Harry Potter did his best to remain out of sight while the Dursleys were finishing their dinner. He quietly went over his studies as his relatives continued to feast and drink merrily. While there was great animosity between them and Harry, the truth was they were afraid of him and his new abilities. Uncle Vernon's sister, Aunt Marge, had come to stay for a week as she resided in a large house in the country side. A wealthy women, she spend most of her working life breeding pedigree bulldogs and taking vacations to exotic countries in the far east.

"Usually it's just a fry-up for me what with twelve dogs to look after," Aunt Marge continued, pouring herself another brandy. "It's certainly been stressful these last few weeks, we're currently at the peak of the Estrus period and the mess is extraordinary. But I think Dr. Harvey-Grigg's latest book aptly describes the relationship between the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive mutations and the increase in the inbreeding coefficient." The others all nodded in agreement. "I certainly hope that later on when the dogs are going through diestrus that none of them will show signs of pseudopregnancy though. But that won't be a problem for Ripper here now will it?" Aunt Marge laughed, Uncle Vernon chortled as he too took a sip of brandy. Even Petunia couldn't hide a faint smile. "Anyway," Marge continued, "Harry Potter's father was a drunk and unemployed wastrel," she took another sip of her brandy and wiped her mustache, turning over to Vernon she said "and his mother was a bitch." The others all nodded in agreement.

Harry Potter, having overheard the conversation, became enraged. He burst into the dining room with his wand, pointing it at Aunt Marge. "No one talks about my parents that way". Aunt Marge's glass shattered in her hand to reveal the end of her finger having swollen to the size of salami. "My father was not a drunk and unemployed wastrel. In fact, he was a great and powerful wizard named 'James Potter'. My mother, Lily Evans, was also a powerful witch. I take great pride in my parents and am dismayed to hear you disrespect them as such. So," announced Harry, drawing himself up to his full height, "as punishment: you shall be blow."

Aunt Marge started blowing as the rest of her fingers blowed. Dudley, who had earlier sneaked off to the living room to watch TV, was eating chips on the couch oblivious to all this. One of Aunt Marge's buttons popped off her tweed jacket, flew into the next room and hit Dudley right in the head, causing him to fall off the couch. Both Vernon and Petunia were paralysed with surprise at what was happening to Aunt Marge, and Harry Potter just continued to look on with satisfaction. Aunt Marge was now completely blow and had lifted up from the table.

/BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH! /BOING/ AH!

Aunt Marge was bouncing on the ceiling, slowly making her way to the door. "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!" She flew outside. Vernon ran after her and grabbed her foot, but he was lifted off the ground as well. "Don't you dare let go!!!!!" Yelled Aunt Marge, but Vernon had already dropped to the ground. "NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"

Harry Potter calmly packed his suitcase and left the house with Vernon still yelling and Petunia still waving to Aunt Marge in the backyard. As Harry Potter walked along Privet Drive, a little black dot could be seen floating around in the sky...

"And then I blew her fat with a spell," said Harry.

"Wow, that's really cool!" Laughed Ron. "What happened next?"

"She flew away."

"Serves her right. I hope she died," grumbled Hermione as she took a sip of her goblin coffee. "I can't imagine how awful that must have been for you Harry, having to listen to somebody say such horrible things about your parents. I too feel heartbroken."

"That's quite alright, Hermione. I'm getting better. I won't deny that I'm still really bothered by what I overheard, but I think that in time the emotional wounds will heal."

Something caught the corner of Hermione's eye as she peered over to a table at the other side of the room. "Is that Dudley?"

"Yes it is," said Harry. "Let's go be mean to him." Ron and Hermione grinned in unison. "Yeah!"

The trio got up, walked across the room and sat on either side of Dudley. "Hi /Dudders/," mocked Harry. "How's your head?"

"Still bruised a bit," replied Dudley.

"We saw your grandma pop," announced Ron.

Dudley looked up. "Oh, ok."
