:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read this fanfic a while ago and I cannot remember the title and all of my searches are coming up blank. It's a severitus, biological I believe. And there is a theme that young men can have long hair if they are the head of household, otherwise short hair is a sign of respect to their fathers. In this fic, once Harry is able to come forward as Snape's son, he makes a point of cutting off his hair with a dagger (specifically for cutting hair). Anyone know which fic I'm talking about?


** Yes, I know what you mean! I read it recently but I can't for the life of me think what it's called!! It's quite good iirc.

** Blood Magic by Gateway Girl linkao3(10678911). The hair-cutting doesn't happen until near the end of this 84-chapter fic.

Hair has social significance in this fic. A male with long hair is indicating he has no senior male relatives. Harry grows his hair long because they have to hide that Severus is his father, and symbolically cuts it when it comes out and he acknowledges the relationship. There's also a female student who wears her hair short to indicate she's not seeking a husband.
