I would like someone to try to extend from this story linkffn(4564885). It it interesting in that it merges the scientific perspective of what magic is and how it works with the traditional side of learning it as a wizard/witch. The problem is that it ends where both sides could learn each others discoveries and could create a lot of possibilities. Thinking that Britain and America could learn that they are really advanced humans that can change Zero Point Energy, and that the stargate team could learn the scientific aspect of all the knowledge of witchcraft and even rituals. Would also be funny to see how "purebloods" react to these discoveries by "muggles".

This is one thing I have seen sort of lacking in any cross over or HP fanfiction. The only thing even remotely close is the methods of rationality saga, but it is only harry as a scientist, not looking at things from an extra-terrestrial view.

Think this would be a nice challenge as a writer and something I would be eager to read. Not for me to write as im just a end user with no creativity :P.

Thanks.
