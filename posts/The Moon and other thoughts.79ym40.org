I have read quite a lot of fan fiction. This is also how I first encountered this 'dilemma'.

About how 'muggles' has been to the moon, but wizards haven't.

This has always confounded me. In my mind, this was something that wizards has already done. There are dozens of stories about men and animals on the moon, all of them with some 'magic' in the background. To me this felt obvious.

So this is why I can't get the thing about proving the worth of muggles because they have been to the moon. Since, why is that anything special. The pure-bloods might get impressed that they have finally done it, but it is not something that special.

I feel the same with Science to prove muggle superiority. Why would the wizards not know about it? And why listen to something that is obviously 'wrong' in this world with magic.

Wizards can prove that gravity is not, in fact, some unbreakable law. Every second year student can break it. Life after death is real and every wizard know it. Invisibility is just a 'swish and flick' away.

This just makes reading these kinds of stories very..... hard. It feels like some stories just assume that wizards are complete idiots, and don't think further than that.


** If their Astronomy class was any hint, Wizards hadn't gone to Moon or any other extraterrestrial objects.

Maybe the laws of Magic were vastly different in outer space? Maybe the very existence of magic required it to be in close proximity of living beings?

*** I think a fic has "ley lines" which allow wizard to use magic. Since the Moon has no such lines, no magic can be used to get there.

Interesting idea, though the fic is mugglewank, even if I enjoyed it.

Not how that works. Wizards can cast spells to levitate things, make them hover, even make them fly, but that disproves gravity about as much as an airplane does.

I don't really get what your point here is. You start out complaining about the common fanon convention of wizards being impressed or disbelieving about the moon landing, that go off on random tangents about things magic can do.

***** The /Tale of the Three Brothers/ was a fable, not a rigorous historical account.

When Harry met Dumbledore in limbo, Dumbledore himself -- one of the greatest Wizards of the modern era, and perhaps the most successful seeker of the Hallows -- thought it more likely that the Peverells /created/ the Hallows, as opposed to being /gifted/ the Hallows by a personification of Death.

(Of course, you could argue that Harry didn't /really/ meet Dumbledore in limbo, or that Dumbledore was a hallucination of some sort. But if that were true, that wouldn't exactly bolster the position that Wizards and Witches have proof of the afterlife.)

This is not an argument against you but, if the afterlife doesn't exist, how would the resurrection stone really work? Would it just be an illusion of what your mind expected to happen and if so, if one does not believe in the afterlife would no one show up?

Edit: I have worded myself very strangely here. When I say 'afterlife', I mean the whole thing with souls passing on to 'heaven' or something. This was why I assumed that the ghosts were proof of an afterlife.

******* The Stone has some power to call upon the shades of the departed, but that doesn't /necessitate/ the existence of an afterlife.

For example, it seems to be that an artifact like a Pensieve can retrieve information from the past which would otherwise be lost -- even though you only remember the past in first person, a Pensieve can use your memories to construct a detailed third-person viewpoint of the world around you at the time of the memory.

If you can retrieve lost information from the past, then you can retrieve the minds of the dead (or a decent approximation). Every thought the dead have ever contemplated, every experience they've ever gone through, and every facet of their personality is still in the past, where it might (hypothetically) be retrieved.

(Of course, that's only one possible explanation. I think the /canon/ explanation is definitely that an afterlife exists in the Potterverse, and the Stone can tap into it, and the Stone is evidence of an afterlife in canon. But most people have never handled the thing, and can't use it to find that evidence.)

Ghosts don't actually know anything about life after death -- or rather, they don't know anything about life after death in a realm beyond the world of the living.

You can become a ghost and remain in the world of the living /or/ you can pass on to the next great adventure. There's no indication that you can pass on and then come back later as a ghost; ghosts can only speculate about what the afterlife ('heaven') is like, just like the living can only speculate.

*** Things can be charmed to just hover in the air and they just stay there. No air flowing in a certain way. It will just stay there. Ghosts.

Yes, I completely went of tangent. I have gotten tired of these fictions where, just because 'muggles' has done something that was big for them, wizards 'obviously' haven't.

Go to the moon. Only possible for muggles because they have science. The biology of everything. Only muggle born will come up with the theories, because wizards have too little 'logic. And explaining why science is awesome to Wizards. No point, they wont get it.

It just feels like, in these stories, everything that can be done is because of these muggle born students. Everything can be done by them.

That blood purity thing is obviously wrong because muggles.

Ps, this should not get taken to seriously. I am just tired of not being able to find any fictions where the original population of the magic world, wizards and witches, have any worth.

It is just "They are wrong, because science." and "Of course they all fuck their siblings. They are pure blood.".

It still doesn't do even that. Yes, gravity is the attractive force between two objects that's a function of their masses, and having something levitate doesn't change that. Like maglev trains, flight, or the thousand and one different forms of levitation in science fiction, all it means is that there is some other force in the system that is in equilibrium with the force of gravity. At best it's a "huh, there are more kinds of force than we thought".

I don't know why people think HP magic completely turns the laws of physics on their head. There are far weirder things in real-life physics than half the spells in the series.

I'd take a hippy-style Volkswagen van and enchant it to independent sustain human life. Flying is clearly possible. Permanent Bubble-head charm around the thing somehow is a must. Preferably some way to simulate gravity so you don't atrophy your muscles. Small protego around it to protect against space-radiation.

Then just fill a trunk with supplies for a year or two and make for orbit. Since there's no gravity any old aguamenti out the back done often enough will probably run you up to a respectable velocity. Once there just arresto momentum and presto. Magic's pretty OP.

*** How I, a complete idiot, would first try to get to the moon using magic.

Requirements:

A hunting tower (or any tower with a moderate hight to it), 20-30 Wizards or Witches, a portkey and a pillow.

How to perform the experiment:

1) Climb the tower.

2) Have all 20-30 'Magicals' banish me at once. (They stay on the ground.)

3) See if I went to the moon. If not, use the portkey.

3) Repeat step 2 with more Wizards or Witches until I reach the moon.

4) Land on the pillow.

I have now landed on the moon. I can go home at any time I want with the portkey. . . . . . I feel like an idiot for having written this down.
