Hey there,

I'm currently looking for a dark!Harry fic. I don't care if it's mentor Voldy/father Voldy or anything like that. I'd rather have a Dark Lord Potter though. It may involve all kinds of dark magic (blood/soul/necromancy etc). Either completed with 300k+ words or, preferably, ongoing and updated regularly. I understand that especially the word count may be quite specific, but I thank everyone wanting to suggest a story in advance!

*** I think you meant [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11868509/1/The-God-of-Death][The God of Death]] It's by I Am Atrocity. I'll give it a read. Thank you :)

**** I really want to get into it, but it's a Dark Harry raised by Voldemort who hates muggles/muggleborn...and is still paired with Hermione.

Does no one else see the problem here?

***** It's...odd, yes. And through Hermione Harry will overcome his hatred and build a new world for wizards and muggles alike. Everyone lived happily ever after and the whole class clapped! On a serious note,I think the author will find a way to make this work. At the very least, it's quite the interesting pairing for this setting.
