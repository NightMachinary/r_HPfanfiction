** Absolutely this linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon).

I actually remember this little conversation whenever I hear these types of requests:

"You don't care," Edgecombe snobbishly retorted. "We get it." "No, you don't," Sirius said. "It's not that we don't care, it's that we don't care about people like you."

"Some of it's that we don't care," Harry corrected. "But it's also fun to point and laugh at the truly retarded aspects of any form of government that includes us. "I hardly think this is the appropriate time for this discussion," Albus interjected despite being curious what the Lords Black had to say.

"No, I think this is a fine time," Harry said. "Don't you think it's worth noting that had we lost last night's duel, there would be a Voldemort seat here on the Wizengamot? Does it not bother more people that an idiot punk kid could slip on a ring on a whim and suddenly have the ability to inadvertently entrench the Dark Lord into the primary legislative body?"

There were a number of shocked faces glancing around.

"Surprise," Harry mocked.

** Why not both? linkffn(8045114)

Harry is taught by Lord Black that his lordship is a responsibility to be taken seriously. I don't read the lordship fics often because most of them are trash, but this one does just about as well with the trope as can be done, IMO.

linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn)

Both have Slytherin!Harry and Lord Potter, although Harry isn't Lord Potter yet since both fics are still in third year iirc.

*** Depends on what you count as canon.

It is loosley supported at best through the books with the almost throw away line about "The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black".

It is likely hubris and fabrication on the Blacks part but if the claim of Nobility is true there most likely are at least some wizard lords.

Pottermore, love it or hate it has definitely expanded upon the concept with the outlining of the Sacred 28.

**** Thanks for the reasonable answer, I shouldn't have replied to the OP, but the combination of spelling and assumptions riled me.

But since you brought it up, on Pottermore 'the Sacred Twenty-Eight' isn't a listing of nobility, it's a relatively recent 'directory' of pure-blood families.
