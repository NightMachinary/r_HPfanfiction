In the ff the older brother of Harry wins against Voldemort (when he comes to kill Harry). The older brother does much good and becomes a teacher at Hogwarts to surprise Harry when he attends his first year. Later in the Story the magic academy in France asks for his help because they had a problem there (I think it was a dragon or something like this). He meets there Fleur and they start to be good friends. When Fleur comes to Hogwarts (Triwizard Tournament) they become Kater somehow together (Brother X Fleur). I don't now on which Platform I saw the Ff but I would very appreciate it when somebody could help.

** I wanted to change the request because some misunderstood what the story is about. I couldn't find my old requests and don't really now how to find them without searching through all in the community. I use reddit for the first time and i am some kind of newbie üòÖ‚úåÔ∏è
