** I mean.. he basically was a dad to Harry for a while, so like that (except I guess a bit more mature if he didn't have Azkaban).

- really protective.\\
- spoils the fuck out of the kid (he got Harry a freakin firebolt).\\
- prioritised the kid above all else.\\
- probably over-shares / says too much.\\
- encourages rebelliousness.\\
- thinks it's funny when the kid breaks the rules.

** Here's a few ideas that I had about what Sirius might look like in this world.

I think we would need to take a look at the rest of the family. Is he married? Is the mother still in the picture?

If so, while Sirius would have matured a lot with plenty of real life experience to change him, he would still be the Maverick that we all know from the books. If he had a partner, then he would most likely defer the "responsible parent" role to them. He would be the parent who indulges his kids, giving them treats, like candy and toys, and do it behind their mother's back. He'd go on "adventures" with the kids, showing them new places and new experiences, whether it be taking them to the cinema, taking them to the park, taking them to various sporting events, magical and non-magical, etc. One phrase that I could see Sirius telling his kids is "Don't Tell Mum." For those extra special adventures where she might disapprove or when Sirius accidently did something bad and caused a little chaos. I think Sirius would want to impart to his kids the desire to be curious, to want to see things and explore and have adventures.

Sirius had a rough childhood. His family was dark and full on blood purists, regardless of whether or not Voldemort was around to influence them.

He would want to give his child(ren) as many happy memories of family as possible.

He would also try to emulate James' father. When Sirius ran away at age 16, he went to the Potters, and experienced a completely new family dynamic. While James certainly was spoiled, we can also assume that his parents encouraged him to be the best student that he could be. We can also assume that James' parents taught him a good amount about what was right or wrong.

So, while Sirius would indulge the kids, he would also see the importance of studies, and, especially with how much he hated his family, impart lessons about what is right and wrong, and why dark magic is a dangerous and harmful type of magic.

He's also look out for warning signs in any kids that would hang around his daughter. He would happily be the type of father that James' father was to him, if he had the chance to be.

I would also think he would know that he'd been a prat in his school days. There might be some chance for the Maruaders and Snape to reconcile and see past their differences to at least be civil. Lily would be alive, and I don't think that Snape would have been so pressured by members of his own house with no Voldemort pushing for recruits, therefore, he might not isolate himself from Lily, and they might all be part of a web of friends and collegues.

With all that said, Sirius would try to stress the importance of making friends, not enemies.

Sirius would not know what kind of person he would be if he had not befriended James and Remus and Pettigrew. They helped mold him to be the brilliant, handsome, wise, and most important, humble man that he is today. (He never lost his sense of humor, and he's still be egotistical to a degree.)

I also like to think that if his daughter brought a boy home, he'd compare the kid to himself. "He reminds me of me when I was his age. No way does he get to date my little girl."

That would be the line drawn. While Sirius has a pretty high opinion of himself as it is, he also knows that his girlfriends' fathers would not be happy about the things he did with their daughters.

Anyone who dates his daughter had better be better than Sirius, because Merlin knows Sirius doesn't deserve such a wonderful daughter in his life.

So yeah, that's how I see Sirius in a world like that, if he had another parent in the picture for the kid.

If there wasn't a mother in the picture anymore, whether she left the country, went insane, or died, then Sirius would try to be the responsible parent as well. He would be frustrated sometimes, and often go to his friends for help, leaning on them to get advice on how to be a good parent, since they actually had good parents.

In short, a single dad Sirius, would be more serious. At least while parenting. He's still Sirius, so he'd be less serious when out and about and looking for single ladies. Then, if he hit it off and things got serious, Sirius would be more serious.

** I think if you go by cannon he'd be a good father. He was genuinely caring and sweet towards Harry.

I feel like a lot of fannon turns him into a sex-crazed wise-cracking "cool uncle" character who's also kind of a buffoon. I don't think this version would be a good father.

** I think he would've of compensated for how shitty his parents were and been incredibly if not overly supportive and giving. Also to prove he wasn't anything like them, he would be the type of his kid came out he would throw a rainbow party for them.

I mean his first gift after 12 years to Harry was a Firebolt which is pretty excessive though also understanding since Harry fell because the dementors were after Sirius though not his own fault.

** I think he would be more of a fun friend than a parent (especially if he is single). In fact, the daughter might have to be the responsible one sometimes. But she would be the centre of his life and he would always be the first person she goes to when happy/sad/angry. I do see him being extremely overprotective in some cases like going on a field trip, dating or leaving for Hogwarts.

Essentially, IMO Sirius would be a magical, slightly (very slightly) more mature Richard Castle.

*** Or we can break stereotypes and Sirius could be a friend to the daughter, and overprotective of the son! Which he was in canon, where he got a single letter about Harry's scar over summer of 4th year and then decided to cross the globe just to live in a cave near Hogwarts to protect him over it. :)

**** I meant if Sirius were to live in peaceful world with no war like the OP is describing. Sirius was overly protective of Harry because there were literally people wanting to kill the kid. In a peaceful world I think he'd be a bro to his little boy. He'd still be protective ofcourse if his son were in danger.

And when I said overprotective of his little girl I meant from hormonal teenage boys :) But I also think he'd be a doting father to her.

** I think a lot of it would depend on the circumstances of his life, even absent the war.

If Sirius is happy, I see him as a protective, loving, loyal father who would focus his life and attention around his kid. (Oh look, he's a dog.) He's a person who knows the importance of showing up for the people who are important to you, even if there's nothing you can do. Just look at how he acts in GoF: physical proximity the moment he thinks he's needed, coaching on the Triwizard tasks, listening to Harry's day-to-day stories, asking Harry to "swear by return owl" that he won't step out of line again. He's not as reckless a father figure in that book as everyone loves to cast him.

Twelve years in Azkaban messed with his sense of time (meaning, because he was forced to relive the trauma of the Potter's deaths daily, there was no opportunity to put any distance in that relationship), but even so, his immediate thoughts from the moment he has any freedom are to care for his childhood best friend's kid. Whether that's because he feels guilty for 'causing' the death of James, thinks Harry is a mini-James, actual love for Harry, or whatever your personal cannon, it seems inarguable to me that he's driven by loyalty and duty.

But I also think when he's unhappy, he's moody and can wallow in his emotions. My personal take on his OotP comment that Harry is less like his father than he thought isn't that Sirius is trying to encourage Harry to be reckless, but that he's on some level resentful Harry gets to make those kinds of choices. His freedom's been stripped from him in one form of another for fifteen years at that point, and he shows his frustration easily. So, if in your story Sirius is a single dad through rough circumstances or somehow feels trapped by the situation, I think he'd occasionally have a sharp tongue or let slip some unkind comments, but that's not his default setting. I think his upbringing would also contribute to this. We know his parents were verbally abusive to a greater or lesser degree, and though he had the Potter's influence, he was already quite old at the point he moved in with them. His parenting role models would have shaped how he behaves, even if he tries to distance himself (and he surely would).

** Hmm I truly don't know. More important questions are Would he even be friends with Potter, Lupin, and Pettigrew. He really only did too piss off his mother. What would his relationship with his family be like since Voldemort never happened. There's so much that could change from this. Would Andromeda still be disowned. How different would Narcissa, Bellatrix and Regulus be. How will Snape factor in to this timeline? So many variables

*** The blacks were blood purists even in the absence of Voldemort, and Andromeda marrying Ted never struck me as rebellion. I interpreted it as she just fell in love. So I think she would still be disowned. And Sirius would probably still be a rebellious child because he didn't initially care about his parents beliefs specifically, he cared that they controlled him, which they still would have. So I think they would still be friends.

I imagine Bellatrix was less crazy before Azkaban, but still cruel and brilliant. So I don't know if she would ever be a criminal. Her loyalty to the Dark Lord was crazy intense, but I imagine without him it would be intense loyalty to her family. (I wouldn't be surprised if her and Regulas married, but other people might disagree with how incestuous the blood purists got). Narcissa would probably still marry Lucius (I can never spell his name, so pardon if it's wrong). She was loyal to her family and just liked to do what was proper. I don't think Regulus would have ever had his moment of realization that he was on the wrong side without the cruelty of war (but depending on his internal views of Sirius which can be open for interpretation as we know very little of him, I can see him coming around).

As for Snape, he is difficult. I think he still would have been smitten with Lily, but I don't know if they would ever stop being friends because Lily was overly forgiving, and without the Voldemort Youth he might not have ever really gotten involved with blood purism.

*** I've always had the impression that the pull of James in particular was very strong for Sirius, and that that friendship would have blossomed in most realities. War or no war, Sirius and James shared a sense of humor and great magical acumen. Those are good solid building blocks for a friendship, and the choices for friends are somewhat limited by the Hogwarts population.

As for the original question--- a loving, doting, protective parent, but sometimes moody and prone to oversharing. And sometimes treating the child like a partner in crime instead of a child (that may have been exacerbated with Harry because he looked so much like James, but I think it would happen with a Sirius bio-kid as well). Above all, he'd want to be the anti-Walburga but sometimes she would slip through in the moodiness and short temper, which Sirius has before he ever went to Azkaban.

** I feel that he would be overprotective, like all others have said, but he would also be a very prominent figure in his daughter's life. Unlike how his parents didn't really care for him, or listen to him, I think he would try to be the complete opposite. But he would be able to draw the line at becoming interfering. A "make your own decisions but I'll be happy to help" kind of father. He may however, be quite a bit biased against Slytherins and be quick to anger, but overall a very passionate, and strong-willed father who would want the best for his daughter in the end, although he sometimes may not go about it in the best way. Don't forget impulsive, although that would be tempered as he does have a daughter and that would have probably taught him responsibility.
