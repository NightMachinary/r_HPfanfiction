Asphodel and wormwood don't result in Draught of the Living Death. They are the two main ingredients, but actually brewing the NEWT level potion correctly requires dozens of additional ingredients and preparation steps.

The difference between monkshood and wolfsbane isn't 'there is none'. Both refer to aconite, but 'wolfsbane' is also the name of a highly complex potion.

And every fanfic where Harry learns of magic long before Hogwarts has him answering the bezoar question with 'in my front pocket'.

Well, that doesn't make the answer that monkshood and wolfsbane are the same thing wrong. Snape is clearly referring to the plant (he even states “they are the same plant”).

The name /Wolfsbane Potion/ is obviously a pun.

Also: Snape never claims that you /only/ need asphodel and wormwood for the Draught of Living Death.

** The potion is actually officially called the Wolfsbane Potion, not just wolfsbane
