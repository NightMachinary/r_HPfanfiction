The Wanderer's Library. An enormous labyrinth of books. It holds every book ever written, every book that will be written and even books that were never written. Protected by immortal Eldritch Abominations, the Librarians, it is connected to all realities through mysterious portals, the Ways. A secret society, the Serpent's Hand, guides all that enter the Library. A young Harry stumbles across a Way. What happens?

The Hand and the Library come from the SCP Wiki.


** If the Wanderer's Library existed, the truth is that Tom Riddle almost definitely got there first.

*** Not necessarily: Ways are rare, amd change with time. The Foundation only finds them due to their immense resources and contacts. Plus, Riddle's megalomania is going to vanish once he learns of beings like Yaldabaoth, Mekhane, Ion, Bumaro, The Administrator, Wondertainment.
