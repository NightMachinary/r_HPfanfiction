I saw it a while ago. I think dudly goes and paints in the train station looking for Harry's attention.

*** You linked the wrong one. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059]])

There's some writing issues with it, but overall I find the series enjoyable (though I think the author is feeling a bit stuck on what to do with the last year of Hogwarts).

***** No worries. I wish that it had sequential chapter links like FFN, though I find AO3 easier for me to use for my own fics.

*** I really love the portrayal of Harry in this series. I don't think I ever got past the third or fourth book, but I remember him being both a reasonable continuation of his canon characterization and a reasonable extrapolation of how people would interact with the guy who felled Voldemort. I also liked Dudley and Holly, ofc, but it was Harry that I was most impressed by.
