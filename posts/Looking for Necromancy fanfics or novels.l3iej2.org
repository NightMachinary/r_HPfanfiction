Looking for necromancy fanfic or novels or books doesn't matter as long as is a good one not a crap one like Where they have the power to summon skeletons instead of actually making them like a game I don't like those fanfics As long as its main purpose is necromancy doesn't doesn't even have to be Harry Potter.


** Linkffn(Blood Crest) I'm only halfway through but it's very original and enjoyable

  Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

** I love necromancer Harry fic a so have a few!! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2528972/chapters/5621090]] Hell to Raise is an abandoned fic where Harry has necromancy powers that he can't control. Gen

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25429834/chapters/61673497]] Anatomy of Fear has Neville as the BWL. Harry lives with his mother and dead father (who he raised) in a house surrounded by a terrifying forest and is trained by Voldemort supporters. It's only 4 chapters in but it's really good! DM/HP but it hasn't gotten anywhere near that yet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28062768/chapters/68750928]] Our Art is Clandestine has Harry figuring out he has necromantic powers pre-Hogwarts. I love how the fic makes necromancers different than other people. They scare away animals and make people feel uneasy about them. I really recommend reading this one, it's one of my favorites. Gen

I'd also second dead things (one of my favorites) and inevitabilities.

** Lord Mortis - The Accident - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17943788/chapters/42375212]]

Summary - Harry Potter has never been good at lying under pressure, and his latest misstep lands him in deep trouble. He's now the Lord of an extremely ancient, extremely Dark, previously extinct house of Necromancers. Lucky for him, he has friends who can keep up, and enemies who are determined to draw the wrong conclusions.

A WIP I'm particularly fond of.

  Circumstance makes Harry an offer he can't refuse.“I can get you the Elixir of Life,” Harry says. “But I need your help with something else.”“You,” says Voldemort, cautious now, wary now that this confrontation hasn't gone at all like he expects, a little incredulous, “need Lord Voldemort to help you?”Harry looks right past him for a second, jaw tense. “Yeah. You're the only one who can, apparently.”

  Well... Harry is pissed, his relatives tipped his inner balance, so he snapped and turned dark. Yes, this is a very dark!Harry story. This is also going to be HarryBellatrix. So if you don't like it, don't read it. Contains also some graphic violence.
