I've come across a fanfiction and realised something that actually makes me think about. A werewolf according the moon cycle transforms once a month on full moon, everyone knows that. But what if we sent a werewolf up onto the moon?

(edited) Okay I didn't explain clearly up there, I am assuming the werewolf have had full magical education like Remus and full astronaut gear and stuff.

** Given Astronomy is so important to magic that it gets a full five years of compulsory education at Hogwarts I think we can assume there is something more magical about the process than simply the moon itself. It might even prove to be the cure.

*** I guess, but the problem is what cure? I believe that there is actually a potion that can furthur help werewolf's but the problem is we don't have the entire list of potion ingredients and it's uses, basically the whole book, ok JKR released 4 hogwarts textbooks but I don't think includes that content.

**** Yeah. I think its Xerosis by Batsuosai, but I haven't reread it for a long time, so I might be wrong. It's on both Ao3 and Ffn, though, so.

** Perhaps more practical, what happens when a werewolf crosses time zones? Would the transformation happen according to the internal clock when the moon rises back home, or does it react to the moon being above the horizon in the location of the were?

We know that being inside to block direct moonlight probably doesn't stop it since otherwise everyone would do that and werewolves wouldn't be a problem.

But if the trigger is based on the geometry of when the moon is both above the horizon at the location of the werewolf and, with some tolerance, opposite of the sun as seen from the earth, then it could be cheated by portkeying to New Zealand over the full moon night.

If portkeys are too expensive, flying around the world westwards in half a day (would require supersonic travel, enchanted invisible Concorde probably) would work too.

*** I was just thinking the same thing because of this prompt but I feel like it's probably an internal clock thing because otherwise remus could just take a portkey once a month and avoid the transformation. He definitely would have had the resources while working as a professor in book 3.

Edit: maybe it happens in relation to the location that one is turned into a werewolf.

*** So this is kind of gross but I was just reading another post about pregnant women during the holocaust whose legs were tied together and they died because the baby was just kind of stuck in there.

What if it's the same idea for wrewolves? They're on some kind of internal clock that they need to transform and the full moon allows them to do so. If theres no full moon allowing them to do so, their body starts attacking itself and trying to push out the wolf inside but failing because maybe a werewolf took a port key to the other side of the world where it's not the full moon.

And so the body just breaks down and dies.

** Permanent wolf-form.

And I'd wager that werewolf skin/fur is tough enough to survive 0 atmosphere space/moon, so as long as they had a bubble-head going, they'd do just fine.

Until they ran out of water.

Yeah no, as far as I remember that wouldn't be canon-accurate to what we've seen of Lupin getting injured in wolf-form.

Well, they can conjure right? It's the food that's the problem unless they brought food with them, I guess the duplicating spell will do.

** Well werewolves would tear up their suit and suffocate pretty quickly. (Even with wolfsbane they are still prone to violent tendencies, the human can just influence them to not do things, but they aren't suddenly humans with a fur coat on, they still have the impulses to be aggressive and damage their confines)

And in order to stay fully transformed they would need to circle around the moon every day to stay in full moonlight. (which is just the side facing the sun). Being in a dark part of the moon would be just like being under a regular moon here on earth.
