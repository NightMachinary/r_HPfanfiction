:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a Ron/Hermione one shot told from Harry's point of view. In takes place during the war and they are hunting for the horcruxes. They are staying in a cave and Ron and Hermione are already together in this fic. The fic starts off with Harry catching them sleeping together. Harry then remembers a time when Ron came to him asking advise on what to do when Hermione wanted to take the relationship to the next level but Ron was afraid. He was afraid of taking that step but then losing her to the war. Harry tells Ron that he can't let fear run his life. He has someone he loves, who loves him back. He tells him that this is what Voldemort wants. Hate and fear to run people's life's. He also tells Ron that their love is what gives Harry hope for the future and that their love is an act of rebellion against the hate. The fic then goes back to the present where he sees them sleeping together and they say I love you to each other. Harry turns away and smiles.
