I read so many fanfictions where Harry just follows every pureblood tradition without questioning. I want some fics where he doesn't give rats ass to their traditions. Please recommend me some.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This is a major AU in which his parents nailed Voldemort with a trap on Halloween 1981 and got to raise him. He never went to Hogwarts and made friends with that usual crowd. Chapter one already shows what he really thinks about traditional magical societies. For a long time, his main opponent is one GInny Weasley.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): This is probably the poster fic against traditional magical establishment featuring a (almost) canon Harry. It's also the ultimate takedown of that stupid marriage law trope. Their actions don't stop at Britain's border either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Written by the same author of the "Marriage Law Revolution". Here, Grindelwald breaks out to avenge Dumbledore. He allies with Harry, and things got out of hand very quickly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and kill off their enemies once more. They also bring down the Ministry and bankrupt Gringotts. The only two who escaped their wrath are Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends have it enough with the incorrigible postwar Ministry and Wizengamot. They begin with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who have escaped justice again. IMHO the best of these 'revolutionary' fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]], linkffn(4356667): In this unique fic, Harry made a deal with Voldemort and let him build his 'Pureblood Utopia'. Narrated by Lucius Malfoy, the outcome can't be more ironic.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth. COMPLETE.

This is one thing I dislike most. I like to think of the wizarding world as the kid(s) in your 3rd grade class that could read at an 8th grade level, slacked off for a decade, and now, in college, is still only able to read at an 8th grade level. The wizarding world is (was?) more advanced than the Muggle one for centuries. I can admit that if I was growing up in the 40's or 50's, I definitely would have liked to live in the WW. Great healthcare, women have the same jobs as men and can vote, low cost of living...I'd be on board. In modern day though? I'd probably split between both worlds tbh.

****** I agree that there's nothing redeeming in canon, but there's a few flaws with that argument.

1) we see virtually nothing of pure blood culture in canon. We do not see their religion, their relationship or courtship practices, their alliances, their etiquette, their politics, their holidays. The most we see of their culture is the bigotry which was /only/ present in a psychotic rebellion faction, and some small elements of their entertainment and diet. That's /it./ And it would be patently absurd to claim that any culture at all is wholly lacking in any of these things, much less all of them.

2) You want a /fanfiction/ in which Harry disrespects Pureblood culture, but your argument that Pureblood culture is irredeemable is based in /canon./ This is a double standard. Fanfics, of necessity, expand on and explore material not touched upon in canon. In order for a story to explore the consequences of Harry snubbing Pureblood cultire, it would be /necessary/ for the author to make up more information about said culture. Otherwise, what is there to snub? The bigotry? I /highly/ doubt that's what you were referring to with the line

"I read so many fanfictions where Harry just follows every pureblood tradition without questioning. "

So, either you're claiming that in most fanfics you read, Harry supports the Death Eaters- as pureblood bigotry is the only canon example of their culture we see beyond their entertainment- or you're claiming that he follows /noncanon/ traditions. And if it's the latter, we get back to my prior points- that it is an author's right to make up information to fill the gaps which JKR left us, and that not every detail of a realistic culture will be offensive.

********** That's certainly all we see of it, but the idea that that's all there /is/ is nonsensical. The wizarding world is effectively an entire alien civilization, with only the barest contact with outsiders. Look at how far the US diverged from Britain, and the Wizards have had a full extra century and are far more secluded. Any distinct community develops some manner of culture- even simple online communities develop traditions, a hierarchy, and standards of etiquette within astonishingly short time frames, and the Wizards have been highly isolated for centuries. Certainly their culture- whatever it may be- must of necessity be watered down to some degree by the influx of half bloods and muggle borns, but at the same time there /must/ be some manner of distinct Wizarding culture.

As for the Weasleys, the simplest explanation is that they couldn't give two shits about tradition, outside of Percy, who has virtually no meaningful presence in the series. Mr. Weasely is half mad and obsessed with muggles- that alone tells us what value he's liable to place on ancient tradition. Add to that Bill and Charlie's rebelliousness, the Twins' rambunctious energy, Ron's... everything, and Ginny's fierce independence and the fact that she's the youngest in this highly irreverent family, and there's no reason to expect that they'd be particularly respective of any old traditions.

But if the Watsonian explanation doesn't satisfy, there's the Doylist- JKR is a trash tier worldbuilder. Her setting falls apart like a house of cards made with exploding snap cards under the slightest examination, and it should be no surprise that it is unrealistic, superficial, and one dimensional. But that doesn't change what I keep trying to say- if a fanfiction /has/ a wizarding culture for Harry to ignore, then it is reasonable for that wizarding culture to be meaningfully distinct, and in that case, openly snubbing it would be disrespectful.

***************** You're using fanon here. Hermione wasn't the most socially aware girl at the start of the series, but she outgrew that. She was the one who organised the DA, after all, and later went on to become the youngest Minister for Magic in some time. That requires quite the social acumen. And the Weasleys aren't uncultured louts. I don't know where you'd get that impression - they aren't the ones sprouting bigoted beliefs in public, as Draco, supposedly a cultured pureblood, is doing any chance he gets.

But yes, JKR's setting falls apart as soon as you leave her railroaded plot.

However, if you add fanon pureblood culture, the Weasleys would be aware of it, being purebloods themselves. And whether or not harry and Co. would snub it would depends entirely on how exactly said culture was detailed.

I've made up a different pureblood culture myself for one of my stories - one where the wizards split off in 1692, and developed differently. I was shooting for a truly "different but equal" approach. They are more progressive in some areas, and more archaic in others (though usually tempered by custom), but, above all, far more magical - magic is used all the time in daily life, from summoning snacks and floating serving trays at dinner to robes covered with as many spells as you can manage or afford as a way to prove your status.

****************** I'm using canon, but I personally disregard JKR's nonsense outside of the books themselves. Even if I didnt, events which happened /after/ Hogwarts have little bearing on the matter of her attitude /during,/ and throughout the books, Hermione is persistently arrogant and insensitive, well into the fourth book at least.

And when I call the Weasleys uncultured, I'm not saying they're rednecks or crude. I'm saying they /don't care./ None of them, except Percy, gives a rat's ass what's proper or expected of them, and that extends to their interactions with friends and family- the Twins are blatantly disrespectful, Bill and Charlie both have some degree of a rebellious streak, Ginny is hot headed and independent, Ron is impulsive and crude, and Arthur is, as I said, utterly obsessed with muggles. Their independence and freemindedness is a persistent Weasely trait, and one which is very much a part of their family dynamic. I would be surprised if they taught Harry and Hermione much about something to which they pay so little attention themselves.

A "separate but equal" culture is exactly what I've been arguing for, though. They are, as I've said, somewhere between a foreign country and a literal alien civilization. I'm specifically trying to say that they /should/ have a rich, diverse culture with complex etiquette, traditions, rituals, ideologies, and likely even religious beliefs. They've been highly isolated for the better part of 500 years, and anybody who thinks that won't lead to a significant cultural divergence needs to examine the divide between American and British culture, which have had a century less and far more interaction.

Wizarding Britain also is, however, small. About the size of a small town. And powerful individuals have a lot of influence in such communities. That would be reflected in their traditions - and how easily they can be altered if a powerful wizards demands it.

To me, creating a "fanon" culture for the wizarding world would involve filling in the gaps, explaining why what we see in canon is the way it is, while actually /changing/ as little as possible. To me the ideal is to fill in the plotholes, shore up the foundations, and examine consequences. The canon characters, in particular, should ideally be left as untouched as possible, except insofar as fleshing them out beyond the one dimensional caricatures which JKR wrote about and turning them into complicated and believable people.

I don't think so. "Bashing" implies that the character in person is portrayed as a bad person. But is my father a bad person because he has little regard for the culture and traditions of the deep south? I certainly don't think so. As I've /repeatedly/ said, the Weasleys are fiercely independent and freethinking. Their lack of regard for what's "proper" is /established canon,/ and you're ignoring that wholly. Similarly, I addressed the point regarding Hermione- she likely would not be unaware of it, but I find it hard to imagine she would be respectful of it, /especially/ in the first few years of the story. At a bare minimum, for the first three or four years, Hermione is brash and insensitive, and often convinced that she knows better than other people. Such a person would not put the effort into changing their way of life to suit quaint and peculiar local traditions, when their own lifestyle is clearly "better."

However, at this point we're going in circles. Neither of us is saying anything that hasn't been said at least twice already, and it seems unlikely that this will go anywhere productive. It is likely best for both of our time if we simply agree to disagree.
