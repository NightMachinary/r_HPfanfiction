What do you think would have happened if the Horcruxes had been found and destroyed after the attack on the Potters in 1981 but before the 'bone of the father' ritual at the end of the Triwizard Tournament?

I could see it happening two ways, and I think I've settled on which I'm going to do in my fic, but I'm curious about other people's thoughts. In my fic, Regulus finds out about the Horcrux, but tells two other traitorous DEs before going after it. On one hand, the Horcruxes tie Riddle's spirit so in theory he could go poof and be gone if he doesn't have a body of his own when the last is destroyed. On the other hand, the Horcruxes did their job making him a wraith capable of possessing beings and can therefore still use the ritual to come back, despite the destruction of them all. Due to the Scarcrux, the question is moot for this fic, but I would still like to hear what other people think.


** Voldemort himself calls Horcruxes his “anchors”, Slughorn said that “one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged”. If they are anchors tethering a soul to the Earth then it seems to follow, when all those anchors are destroyed (including Harry's scar, although it can be disputed, that it wasn't created correctly, because the ritual was interrupted by Voldemort's death), nothing tethers the soul to Earth and it is gone. Which makes me angry about all those time-travelling stories, where they repeat all Stations of the Canon for no reason whatsoever (in my opinion).

*** The 'he goes poof!' option. I lean towards that one too and had some serious think time to come up with an excuse where that didn't happen before realising it didn't matter. The DEs wouldn't know about the Scarcrux until after the GoF, which will lead to a frustrated conversation about what to do now because they aren't killing a kid and what about AKing the Dark Lord? It would give them time to figure out how to safely remove the Horcrux from the kid. And so on.

** I think there is a lot left unanswered or that doesn't make sense about Horcruxes:

- would being 'reborn' through the ritual in GoF use up a Horcrux?
- What would have happened to the wraith if the diary Horcrux had succeeded?

  - Does the wraith merge with Diary Riddle?
  - Are they separate and then we have two Voldemorts after the ritual in the cemetery?

- is the wraith his soul? I don't see how it can be given that he became a wraith via an AK and Voldemort's AK to Harry in the forest destroys the scar Horcrux
- what is the relative strength of each Horcrux? Are they all equal or did they diminish in strength with each subsequent Horcrux?
- Does destroying a Horcrux reduce the power of its maker or is it an all/nothing situation?

Idk, but he made Nagini a Horcrux before the ritual so there's /something/ there, right?

Edited because I accidentally posted.

I've had a thought before about the ritual using a Horcrux. I later decided /that/ one didn't because each of the other Horcruxes had a reaction to being destroyed in some way, but perhaps if he'd used a different ritual that did use a Horcrux, he might have returned looking more... whole.

I think destroying the Horcruxes did diminish reborn Riddle, it's been a long time since I read the full book, but didn't Harry mention Riddle's thoughts feeling more erratic when he used the scarcrux in DH?

I want to read a fic from a DEs POV of two Riddles.
