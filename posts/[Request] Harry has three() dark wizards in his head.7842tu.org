I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago where when Harry dies in the forest he is sent before some judges and is given a choice to go back in time with some help, which turn out to be three dark wizards shacking up in his head. He goes back to the end of the third task and dominates Voldemort, he then gives Dumbledore the memory of his first time in the graveyard. There's also a part where Voldemort contacts Dumbledore and they meet at a muggle train station where he gives Dumbledore the actual memories of the graveyard scene. That was the last chapter in the fic when I read it, I went to read it again the other day only to realize I hadn't saved the story.

*** I don't think this one ever really went anywhere. Complete shame, the premise came from one of my favorite webcomics and I was looking forward to the author translating it into HP.
