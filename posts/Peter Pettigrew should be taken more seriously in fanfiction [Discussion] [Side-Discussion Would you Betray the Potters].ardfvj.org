Yes, Peter is cowardly, treacherous, and just an all-around terrible person for betraying the Potters to Voldemort (however understandable that actually is when you take into account the horrors magic can do to someone).

But he has a lot accomplished.

1.) He, like James and Sirius, successfully became an animagus during his Hogwarts years, a supposedly difficult piece of Transfiguration magic that, outside of the Marauders, only Rita was capable of doing.

2.) Peter was capable of fooling the Potters after he betrayed them, which could attest to his acting abilities.

3.) Peter was the Death Eater that managed to brew Voldemort's resurrection potion and bring him back to life.

Really, out of all of our Death Eaters, it feels like to me that Peter has the most accomplishments to his name. He was the one that gave Voldemort access to the Potters, and he played a huge role in Voldemort's 4th Year Plan.

I mean, there's Bellatrix and the Lestranges, who tortured the Longbottoms into insanity, and then there's Severus, who brought Voldemort the prophecy and was a "spy" for the Dark side.

I don't know, what are your thoughts on Peter?

Side-Discussion:

My friend and I also got into it on who would really give out the location of the Potters. I, realistically, would give the location. If not before being caught and tortured, then definitely during the torture. My friend attests that he would not betray his friends at all and would sooner die or being tortured into insanity. I'm pretty skeptical of this, but it's impossible to argue theoreticals like this.

How about you? Clearly I'm scum cut of the same cloth as Peter while my friend is Sirius. Where do you fall?

** I said this before in another thread, but I'll copy and paste it here:

He's the weakest out of the Marauders, but hell he was able to become a Animagus; which is no easy feat. He had help; but was still able to do it.

He's able to trick James, Lily, Sirius and Remus, with no one being the wiser.

He's able to frame Sirius for James and Lily, and the 12 Muggles murder.

And he's able to escape, faking his own death and living life as a rat for years.

He's also able to bring Voldemort back.

Pretty damn awesome for the "weakest or dumbest Marauder" as so many people like to write him as.

*** Some of those points don't say or mean much in terms of ability though.

#+begin_quote
  He's able to trick James, Lily, Sirius and Remus, with no one being the wiser.
#+end_quote

- It was Sirius' idea to make Peter the Secret Keeper
- Remus was never told about the Secret Keeper switching so he can't have been tricked.
- James and Lily were betrayed, not tricked. They willingly chose to make Peter their Secret Keeper and it had nothing to do with him.
- Sirius knew straight away that Peter had turned coat, so he wasn't tricked there either.
- No one was the wiser because James, Lily and Sirus chose not to tell everyone who their Secret Keeper was. Again, something that had nothing to do with Peter.

#+begin_quote
  He's able to frame Sirius for James and Lily, and the 12 Muggles murder.
#+end_quote

- There's nothing impressive here. Again, because of circumstances that fell in his lap Peter knew that only he and Sirius knew who the Secret Keeper was. So all he had to do was frame his death in a public place. A feat which wasn't hard since he's an animagus.

#+begin_quote
  And he's able to escape, faking his own death and living life as a rat for years.
#+end_quote

- Living as a rat for years isn't an example of any great ability.

- Faking his death wasn't difficult, and it only really worked because Sirius chose to act like an idiot and the DMLE wasn't interested in holding trials apparently.

Look, I'm just saying that a lot of the things people credit Peter for really aren't impressive.

** I have some sympathy for Peter Pettigrew... not that I condone his actions or anything. He sold out one of his best friends, and framed another of his best friends for it.

But I do think he had more going for him than anyone thought. The attitude from the readers that he was just a pathetic, talentless nobody, seems to have been the attitude his friends had too... certainly James and Sirius viewed him as a talentless idiot. Looking at that infamous flashback from their fifth year, they insult and patronize him like nobody's business, and just seem to take his hero-worship of them for granted.

(I'm sort of wondering how much of that hero-worship was genuine and how much was just Peter playing the role he'd been handed. I'm sort of suspecting he was exaggerating a LITTLE, given how he looks about ready to orgasm the moment either James or Sirius say anything even the slightest bit witty,)

Sirius making Peter the Secret-Keeper also seems rooted in this, because Siruis could never believe that anyone would suspect that pathetic weakling Wormtail.

I think Peter's lot in life was always to be the overlooked, unterestimated, patronized and belittled one. He wasn't the brightest, the most powerful, the handsomest or the most self-assured, so while he did have some impressive accomplishment in his own right, everybody just treated it like it was no big deal because he either needed help with them, or didn't get there as quick as his talented prodigy friends. And so he just ended up viewed as the worthless tagalong... No matter what side he was on, that was how he was treated.

I can sort of see him joining Voldemort not JUST out of fear, but also out of a hope that he'd finally be taken seriously and that his new friends would treat him better than his old ones had. Turned out they didn't...in fact, they treated him even worse. At least James and Sirius didn't outright abuse him.

In many ways, I think Peter is, or could be seen as, a cautionary tale about how you treat your friends. He turned traitor, yes, but his betrayal didn't come out of thin air.

*** Hi there! You make a lot of good points here. I was going to say that you might be wrong wondering about how much of how Peter acted in the 5th year flashback is him and how much is him playing a role he'd been handed - I was going to say he was genuinely their friend back then - but it occurred to me that we don't really know for SURE when he turned traitor. It could have been then, could have been 7th year, could have been after Hogwarts. I think if he wasn't already intending to turn traitor in school, the way we see Sirius and James treat him in the flashback suggests he'd certainly have a reason too. Not saying it's a GOOD reason, but I can understand how he wouldn't feel super-loyal to them if they treated him like shit all the time.."I can sort of see him joining Voldemort not JUST out of fear, but also out of a hope that he'd finally be taken seriously" - yes! The more I think about it, the more I feel bad for Peter (while still hating him for what he did).

** M'self, in Pettigrew's place, I would probably have let myself be killed, but only because I have the benefit of hindsight of knowing the afterlife is definitely real and pretty neat in the /Harry Potter/ universe. Before this became common knowledge I can make no promises. Probably I'd have done what I find the most plausible Pettigrew "redemption", namely turning into a rat as soon as the Death Eaters begin threatening me, and not looking back until Voldemort is definitely dead and buried.

** As I've said recently on another thread: I love Peter Pettigrew in the Promises series.

That being said, I would not betray the Potters, but I also would not let them live like they did in canon. Whatever Dumbledore said, I would've at least try everything to get them to move to France or anywhere else on the mainland or something. Or, if they refuse, at least seek refuge at Hogwarts, where a secret keeper is less of an issue, because Dumbledore's there.

** Depends. This is assuming that I'm already captured after knowing their locations, not like receiving the information about their locations and immediately selling them out.

For family, I'd die.

For friends, it gets more complicated, because there are friends, and then there are /friends/. Would sell out the former without question, but the latter...not sure about them. I'd like to think that I'll hold out, but I can't say for sure.
