I've been enjoying the fics where Harry gets help from someone other than Hermione, so I'm hoping to find more. Bashing and slash is fine, just no romance driven plot, pottercest, Mpreg or genderbending.

Thank you!

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

** The best one (as far as I'm concerned): linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane). Fun fact of the fic: great Dumbledore-Harry relationship

An extremely entertaining one, though not great: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar). Fun fact of the fic: I've been to that town in Wisconsin!

One that had potential, but went to utter shit through poor planning and quite frankly /too quick/ of an update rate: linkffn(A Cadmean Victory). Fun fact of the fic: First long fic I paid attention to from the publish date through completion.

Edit: WTF did I do to my spelling? Christ...

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

Part 1 of a trilogy, Ron bashing in there. There is romance, I wouldn't call it romance driven though. I'll just throw it out there and let you decide.
