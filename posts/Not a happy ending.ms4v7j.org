I always felt that in book seven everything became rainbows and butterflies very easily. Unlike the first war, this time the Ministry is under the Death Eaters' control, and there is no Dumbledore to be able to turn everything to what it was single handedly. So I thought of this prompt.

After Voldemort dies by his own killing curse in the battle of Hogwarts, despite Harry's expectations nothing becomes better:

- The Death Eaters in Hogwarts run away and return to the Ministry and maintain control of it.

- Goblins' are threatening another rebelliant if they don't get to execute Harry, Ron and Hermione.

- Shortly after, Minister Thicknesse resigns and Lucius Malfoy, now free of the Dark Lord's anger, becomes the new minister.

- Death Eater's are still reluctant to publicly admit that they want Harry dead for killing the Dark Lord, so they use the attack on Gringotts and Harry bringing the battle in a school full of children and causing some of them to die as an excuse to declare the trio outlaws. They want to give them to the Goblins to execute. That way they get their revenge and they prevent a Goblin rebellion.

- If the ministry being after him isn't enough, Harry's stupid monologue at the battle has let everyone know that he has the Elder Wand and every wannabe dark witch/wizard is after him as well.

- Dementors, free of the Dark Lord's control, attack several soccer/football games and kiss every single person there. Muggles are in an uproar, thinking that they are dealing with a deadly epidemic.

- ICW is furious at Britain for not controlling its dementor population and putting the statute of secrecy in serious jeopardy. So they put a powerful ward around Britain that lets muggles and mundane animals come and go, but stops witches and wizards and magical creatures to cross the border.

- Muggleborns in Azkaban are executed by Minister Malfoy's order and the order to capture muggleborns turns into an order to kill them.

- And finally, the muggleborns suddenly disappearing from the wizarding world, the war, and the ICW's heavy sanctions fucks up the economy badly.


** The Death Eaters were routed pretty decisively by the combined forces of the Hogwarts elves, centaurs, and reinforcements that appeared after Neville killed Nagini. Are you planning on them experiencing fewer casualties during this sequence?

** That could happen if the good guys lost too many, but I highly doubt Harry would put up with that shit if he was not incapacitated.

The war now will simply go on and even more vicious than before. I honestly don't think someone as weak as Lucius Malfoy could control the situation for even a few months.

Dimensional travel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] has such as a world in which Lucius seized power after Voldemort's defeat and imposed a Pureblood rule. But that world's Harry is dead. In its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]], this world is depicted in greater details.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]'s original dimension seems to remain in the control of Blood Purists, but since our protagonists lost everyone they care about, they move on to their newly found dimension.

Lucius Malfoy also seized power in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], but in 1981 and through a daring maneuver. This guy played the long con game here, and would have kept ruling Magical Britain if Dumbledore and Voldemort hadn't both come after him in 1999.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] follows canon until the end of DH. Then your scenario becomes partly true, until Harry rises up and kills the fuck out of them.

*** Thanks for the recommendations. But about your comment, Harry wasn't much of a good fighter, was he? He just runs around casting the disarming charm at people. But this time there is no brother wands, no Dumbledore to protect him, and no prophecy. And I personally think Malfoy could be a force to reckon with without Dumbledore and Voldemort around. He is more dedicated to the "cause" than the other Death Eaters and he is relatively intelligent.

**** He's pretty good at the end of DH, and he will definitely keep the Elder Wand and USE IT if Blood Purists stay in power.

My take is always that if Wizarding Britain's establishment refuses to change, Harry and his friends will become much more radical and ruthless. They will drop whatever remains of their mercy and REAL WAR will come to the country!

As for Lucius Malfoy, he was a weak coward all along and pretty much broken by the end of DH. Like the other commenter said, him seizing power is the least likely scenario. I would trust Corban Yaxley a lot more.

**** AFAIK Lucius Malfoy is the weakest part of your scenario. He is a defeated coward at the end of the Deathly Hallows.

**** We don't see much of it but it is repeatedly stated that he is the best fighter from his generation. The only thing is that he is very young, but he did hold his own against grown wizards many times. On the other hand he did became the youngest head auror of all time (at the young age of 26/27, not even 10 years after the final battle). So at the end of DH he is already a good fighter (in comparison to adults) who has the potential of being great. I think he would be a force to recon with if the Death Eaters wouldn't surrender.

**** Yeah, Harry is such a bad fighter that he goes toe to toe with many Death Eaters several times his age and with already one war they should have won (if there hasn't been an Harry Ex Machina) under their belt. Oh, right, sorry, he had friends. His 5 teenagers friends to be exact. Holding their own against the best of the best in term of Death Eaters, a team led by your darling Lucius Malfoy and the crazy super-powerful right hand of Lord Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange.

Yeah, he's weak alright.

** So while Voldemort is dead, Lucius Malfoy and his cronies are still going to keep on with the dystopia. Harry with the Elder Wand steps up to protect the muggleborn, suppress the Goblins & Dementors and quell the chaos. He finally becomes a Dumbledore-level figure as a teenager and everyone still gets their happily ever after.

Or it becomes a Voldemort victorious AU without Voldemort and everyone gets a horrible ending.

** I kind of see your idea making more sense. No one topples a government and then it's all milk and honey. I would add to your idea the fact that the resistance that joined the forces at Hogwarts organize themselves into a sort of military force now knowing who was behind the whole year of dystopia and an all out civil war breaks out. The resistance might even take over Azkaban and release the Muggleborns who themselves organize after into vigilante groups that hunt down purebloods associated with Death Eaters and kill them in violent ways. Also it would be even more realistic that even innocent people such as Andromeda get caught in the cross-fire.

** I mean, we already know for a fact that Rowling is bad with tragedy. She had originally planned to kill off Hagrid and several other people she never did pretty early, but she chickened out because, in her own words, she liked Hagrid and the others too much.

One of the reasons she went so kill-crazy in the last book, according to her, was that she felt she had waited too long to start, and that she had to kill some extra people to justify leaving Hagrid alive to herself. Because she just couldn't bare to kill him. I guess she feels like stuffing a firecracker up Hedwig's ass generates enough negative karma to balance out the Dragon Balls and let her keep Hagrid alive, or so it goes.

Everything sort of wrapping up neatly was always a foregone conclusion with her, no matter how little sense it makes. I personally will never understand how anything was solved without massacring all the Death Eaters and the Jr. Death Eaters like Draco. They used the unforgivables on people, they kidnapped, tortured, and murdered people REGARDLESS of their blood status. Even neutrals or less radical blood purists would have a reason to give everybody with a mark the death penalty, because but for want of a nail /it could have been them and their families/. But somehow they just... walked. What the hell?
