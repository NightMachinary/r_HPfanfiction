Everywhere you see Gellert Grindelwald being described as a charming, handsome young man who gave into the Dark Arts and appealed to the masses into joining him. But I have rarely encountered fics on that.

Now that there is more material from the Newt Scamander movies. Anyone knows of good and preferably long fanfiction where you can see Gridelwald delving into the dark arts and slowly developing his own power bases but through subtlety, cunning, speeches and appeal and manipulation of the masses before coming to the stage where he occasionally showed off his powers and became the kind of Dark Lord that gained following around the world? And not where he is Voldemort-esque.

If so, please recommend it. I have always wanted to delve deeper into that history.
