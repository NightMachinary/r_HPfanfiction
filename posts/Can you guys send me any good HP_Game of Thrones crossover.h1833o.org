** Linkffn(Death has no Master, but Life has Servants By Jinchuu21) - still updating slowly, harry can't use /all/ his powers here so it's not a stomp.

Linkffn(The Black Prince By cxjenious) - warning, abandoned on cliffhanger, made worse by how good it is.

Linkffn(Hadrian Lannister Lion of the Rock by Sage) - This has a strange final act, Harry is pretty OOC too if that's an issue.

  Another task had been given to him. Not one of prophecy, but of choice. He had long ago accepted his need to help people, to protect those who could not protect themselves. War was all he had known, all he was good at. It was time to help heal. But, sometimes, to save a life, you had to take one.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

  Reborn as the eldest son of Tywin Lannister, Hadrian must shoulder the responsibilities of being heir to Casterly Rock and play the game of thrones. As war takes hold will he rise to win the game or will he be crushed by the factions all around him. Rated M to be safe.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. The deciding line between staying and helping Robb Stark, or returning to her universe, is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros. But it's a decision that she has to make, or it's one that will be made for her. Part 1 & Part 2 complete! Part 3 now ongoing.

  It only takes a single disharmonious element to throw off the entire composition. Fifty years before Robert Baratheon was to ascend the Iron Throne, Westeros receives one hell of a bad musician. Harry never did care about any player other than himself.

** There's linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make by joen1801) although I need to warn you that its been dormant for three years. There's also linkffn(For Myself by Chaos65) ymmv on that one. Finally there's also linkffn(The Alpha Wolf by Wyvern03) that I constantly reread as a sort of wish fulfilment type. Been dormant for a year that last one.

  Harry always knew that his luck might not be the best. But to be sent to another world so Death could have more entertainment from his life? He might as well use this chance and live by his rules. Info about new chapters available on my profile.

  His will is the blade in which the coming tide shall fall upon. His duty, the armor that gives him purpose and strength to fight on. His blood the unbreakable shield against the coming darkness. His soul, the last bastion, forged in the furnaces of war. So beware enemies of the North, for the Alpha Wolf has arrived, the North never forgets, and Winter is inevitable.(AU)(TempHiatus)
