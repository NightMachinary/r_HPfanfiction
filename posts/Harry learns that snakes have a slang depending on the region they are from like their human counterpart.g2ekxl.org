Despite losing the scarcrux and beating Voldemort, Harry surprinsingly keeps his parseltongue abilities.

After the war and all the fighting Harry isn't so keen to become an Auror and instead goes on a trip around the world; maybe to work with magical snakes as he can speak with them (and make a book like Scamander had).

What he didn't expect (aside from Spanish Inquisition) was that snakes had slang quite similar to the humans by given region.

This complicated things quite a bit when you were trying to talk to a snake who had an accent added to their fetish for 's'.
