I'm looking for fics about the series end before the seventh book came out or next gen stories before cursed child. Or even fics that came out right after the series ended that has faded from people's memories. I don't really care what pairings aside from no Snape/students really.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End]], linkffn(282139): Written well before OOTP, guessed the final pairings correctly, but unfortunately not complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2818538/1/The-Seventh-Horcrux][The Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(2818538): Finished before DH, guessed several key plot points correctly, some even thought it was a leaked version of DH.

*** What do you mean, After the End isn't complete? It's absolutely complete. You can't trust the presence of the complete badge, btw - it's so old it was before [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] even had a "complete" field for fics, and the same holds true for LOTS of old stuff.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

***** HPMoR is okay, but turns into a very different story than it starts out as. I ended up never finishing it because I felt too bait-and-switched.

The Backwards With a Purpose Saga is definitely excellent, though.

******* My gripe was that it changed from "Harry applies science and rationality to magic, and hijinks ensue" which I loved (especially his visit to Diagon) to "super-smart Gray!Harry navigates intrigue and politics in an increasingly dark tale".

** Fic started in 2006:

Hiatus/Abandoned: Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.

[insert joke about recommending this to someone for the near literal hundredth time]

** linkffn(2027554) In Blood Only. A great, in-character fic where Snape finds out Harry is his biological son. It's AU as of Halfblood Prince, since Snape is a pureblood in this, but it's easily the best characterization of Snape I've seen in a fic. He's such an angry asshole in this, and the fic makes zero attempts to white wash his character. Also I found it to be pretty funny at times, and very compelling.

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]
