Here's mine:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione, Ron, I know we've had great five years, but I think we should start being friends of other people. It's not you, it's me. I've changed and I don't think you meet my needs anymore and I didn't want to tell you like this... but, I've been seeing other firends.

  He's a bit pudgier than Ron, but doesn't eat as much and doesn't suffer from bouts of jealousy.

  She's a bit more insane than Hermione, but doesn't correct my language or require me to obey the rules nearly so much. Plus, I noticed she was a girl right away. See, in older females, the breasts tend to stick out more and give it away.

*** #1: It's not Harry saying this.

#2: The quote is used to highlight how ridiculous the whole "and suddenly not friends anymore" is.

But I guess that's what I get for posting a quote out of context.

  But in the end, the past was dead and he was dealing with its corpse. The thing that mattered a lot more was what he was going to do in the future.

** Lucius draws himself up a little, or as much as he can appear to while presumably kneeling to look through a fireplace.
