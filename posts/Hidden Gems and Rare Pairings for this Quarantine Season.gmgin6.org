Any fics that aren't mainstream (like descent into darkness or Again and Again are what i consider mainstream). Or any rare pairings (Not tomarry or drarry)?

No Het (Cuz I can't anymore unless it's Luna or Amazing) No Harems No Prostitution or Dark sex stuff (You do you, just not for me)

Thank you üòä


** Well, linkffn(13491812) is pretty good, although it's not strictly a /pairing/ . . .

Whoops, sorry; I didn't see the "no het" stipulation; please ignore me!

  In an act of desperation, Harry invites Flora Carrow to the Yule Ball. He never expects having to entertain her twin sister Hestia too.

** I suggest Lust over Pendle.

[[https://lop.shoesforindustry.net/download.html]]

I know the unconventional website might turn you off, but it's definitely worth it.

It also most certainly qualifies as 'non mainstream' since the only times I've seen it in this sub are the handful of times I posted it.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúIt's a really long story,‚Äù he says finally, almost apologetically, ‚Äúand it's really hard to believe.‚Äù‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

**** Or Amazing.

Heartsease is amazing and IMO the best Lucius/Pansy out there. At 12k it is AFAIK the longest.

I really did not want to resort to "Fate is a four letter word" by philo again (even if it would tick OP's box bc how many Harry/Kingsley/Snape fics are out there?).
