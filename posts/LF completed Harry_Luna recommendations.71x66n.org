** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection From Nargles]] is complete, though the sequel is abandoned. Cute fifth-year fluff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8257400/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Paranoia][Harry Potter and the Power of Paranoia]] is complete. A little bit of crack, a little bit of Dumbledore bashing, but well written and a good fic overall.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.
