** How about Voldemort taking over Ginny's body:

"The Chronicles of the Dark Lord Ginnymort", linkffn(8892557), is the humorous version;

"Wither", linkffn(12118000), is the tragic version.

  Dedicated to my friends in the Teachers' Lounge. Lord Voldemort's attempt to possess the soul of Ginny Weasley was successful, but his triumph was not without consequence. Find out how our favorite arch-villain deals with the pitfalls and pratfalls, the laughter, loss and love of a teenage girl's life at Hogwarts.

  "A pair of familiar eyes stared widely back at him. And it was at that moment, Harry finally realised, that he had never been free." A dark spin on the last chapter of the Deathly Hallows, 'Nineteen Years Later'. One Shot! Complete!

*** Nice find with the second one. Though the story could've been much better if the author didn't try artificially cramming in as much grimderp and drama as possible.

** Now that you mention it, it's really rather odd that Harry's the one genderbent most of the time. Anyways, the only one I can think of is linkffn(7274298), D minor, which is a horror oneshot with Harry & fem!Riddle.

Not really. He /is/ the main character after all. It stands to reason that the main character would feature the most permutations in fanfiction.

**** Yeah, I know, but I thought there would've been at least a few more genderbends of other characters. It's a bit underwhelming.

  Oneshot. A DLP-inspired exploration of a fem!TomRiddle. This is not for the squeamish. Admitted into the DLP library.

  Harry's in the past. There is no 'Lord' Voldemort. However, if he expects things to be easier just because he's older and Riddle's younger, he's going to be sorely disappointed. Harry's never been one for giving up, but neither has Riddle, and as they both are forced to work together- in more ways than one- the stakes slowly change.
