There's a fanfic I read years ago that I've been looking for ever since but I can't find it cause I can't remember the title. The only thing I remember is that someone broke into Harry's house and killed his family while he was dropping Scorpius Malfoy home on his broom. It involves time travel and Harry desperately trying to save his family....any help at all would be much appreciated....TIA
