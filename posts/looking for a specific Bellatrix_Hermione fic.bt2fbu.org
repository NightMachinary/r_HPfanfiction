:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In the fic Bellatrix and Hermione are the subject of a prophecy that says whichever side they support will win. Both sides try to win their favor until some order members led by Augusta Longbottom try to poison them and cause I think Hermione to miscarry. If anyone can point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.


** It was called something like Primal. Primal was one of the three main forms of magic. It was only really used in a minor way by animaguses. The primal mages could transform ANY part of their body to ANY animal. Making Bella's primary animal the Spotted Hyena, which has elongated parts, just to have FUTA parts seemed heavy handed. Transformation bits of their skin into dragonhide to bounce killing curses was an interesting idea.

The author has pulled most of her work from [[https://FF.NET][FF.NET]] which is where I read it.
