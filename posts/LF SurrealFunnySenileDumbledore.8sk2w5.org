** Dumbledore is fully aware of his reputation among wizards of being the best thing since sliced bread. He's trying to see just how much ridiculous shit he can pull before someone has the guts to call him out on it.

"I hope you all enjoyed the end-of-the-year feast! I also wish to inform you that the Hogwarts Express has already left, and as of five minutes ago, you are all trespassing. Well? What are you waiting for? Get out!"

So far, he's extremely disappointed in everyone.

*** I remember getting tears in my eyes from laughing too hard for this fic. I think Hari was aware of it and trolling along with him though?

**** Either that, or Hari was completely clueless as well (he doesn't exactly have a good idea of what normal human behaviour is like). It's been a while since I read it, both sound in character for him tbh.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Dumbledore has a similar characterization in linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of a Soul Bond). The author wrote the fic with idea of subverting the common Soul Bond trope, and actually exploring the effects of being permanently bound to another individual - through humor.

Dumbledore is absolutely hilarious in this, and I wouldn't go as far as to say he's senile, but he's damn close

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
