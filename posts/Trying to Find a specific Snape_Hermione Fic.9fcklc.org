Looking for a Snape/Hermione fic that is set several years after the books. It starts with Ron and Hermione together possibly married. They go to a Quidditch game together and end up sharing a box with Snape. Snape offers a bet to them where they would get quite a bit of money if they win and if they lost Hermione would have to spend time with Snape. They need the money so they take it and end up losing. Ron eventually gets upset about Hermione spending time with Snape and they break up. Thats all I really remember it was still being updated when I read it. Snape was a wealthy business man and the title was a reference to the bet I believe.


** Found it in case anyone was curious

  Hermione and Ron desperately want to move out of the Burrow. In an attempt to increase their savings, they decide to try their luck at gambling at the finale of the Quidditch World Cup. When they end up losing everything, the billionaire owner of the English Quidditch team offers them a chance to get it all back. The only thing he wants in return ... is one night with Hermione. AU.
