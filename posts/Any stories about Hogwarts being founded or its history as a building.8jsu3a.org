I'm writing a fan-fiction currently about Hermione discovering the sentience of Hogwarts is in danger and she sees it physically falling apart because of this. I'd love to read other writers' thoughts of the structure of Hogwarts and the building itself.


** One important thing to remember is that Hogwarts - the building, not the school - is a /castle/, which imposes some things on the architecture.

The main one is that all those 'abandoned classrooms'? They're there for a reason. A fully-working castle has at least a modest contingent of dedicated fighters, keeping in training and patrolling the surrounding country to maintain control. (Within practical limits, which are defined by the foot speed of men and horses and the size of the garrison. There's a possibly-apocryphal tale of an archaeologist who was an infantry NCO in former life predicting the site of a fort on Hadrian's wall as being a spot neither of the known forts either side covered.) Those fighters - whether they're mages or hired muscle - need places to sleep, maintain their gear, train and so forth.

They need room over and above that, however. A major function of a mediaeval castle was as an intake: when enemies came, the local people under the castle's protection could carry their foodstores, their livestock, the lord's herd and the contents of the tithebarns inside the walls. The peasants got handed whatever blade-on-a-stick arms the local blacksmith could throw together and were available to man the walls.

Still on top of that, there are whatever other things are being done at the castle: housing a Royal Mint, housing a royal armoury, housing the local Big Man (anywhere from the small-l lord of the man or up to the King his own self) and so on and so forth. If it was an important job that needed a secure place to operate, it could and would be moved inside a castle's fortifications.

Normally, a lot of those functions - garrison, refugee camp, palace, safe deposit, prison, mint, armoury, arms factory - would be fulfilled by wooden huts and sheds built inside the outworks of the fortification, which is why so very few castles still have them. Castles that stayed in use after gunpowder made them obsolete often have those internal buildings replaced with permanent structures - the Tower of London is the easiest example to find pictures of. The Yeoman Warders have an entire street of houses in there to live in.

I would expect that a /lot/ of the buildings at Hogwarts started out as wooden structures inside the palisades of a mediaeval hillfort, getting replaced as the mages living there found time to levitate stone to the site and magically shape it - possibly with a master mason looking over his shoulder and advising on design. Of course, all that magic used to shape and lay the stone? The resulting building gets a bit ... animated. That plus a thousand years of student cock-ups, we should be thankful it's only the staircases that move.

*** The /other/ thing to remember is that Hogwarts wasn't in Scotland when it was built. Scotland wouldn't exist for a couple of centuries (not bothering to look it up, left as an exercise etc.) and Hogwarts was built in either Strathclyde, Alba, or some tiny Pictish kingdom unremembered by history. England had only been a thing for a few decades, Wales was still independent, what is now northern England and the Borders were culturally very much aligned with Wales and Cornwall and the northern border of England wasn't so much a hard-and-fast line as a hundred miles or so of banditry that wasn't entirely settled until the late 1600s...

**** Incidentally, this leads to my personal headcanon about Why Slytherin Left. *The* big change in Britain in the decades after Hogwarts was founded was the Norman Invasion. Salazar, a basque, would likely have had no good opinion of the Frankish peoples - they'd invaded his home country several times and outright annexed vasconia - and now he's /expected to educate Frankish whelps/? Cue massive argument, the wands come out, things get said, and he flounces.

The name of one of those damnable Frankish invaders, per JKR? One Armand Malfoy...

** So would I. Not least because Hogwarts must have changed /dramatically/ in that time - the way the castle is described in canon is so not a tenth century building - and I want to know how!
