Stories that either start or spiral so far out of control that it barely reads like fanfiction. Take linkffn(The Skitterleap) or linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) for example. These are stories that rely very little on an already existing canon, instead populating it with their own, unique ideas. That's what I really love to see in fanfiction.

**** yea, it is one of the best. And I don't even mind that it seems abandoned. The story has progressed far enough and there is plenty of foreshadowing, so I'm able to imagine how it wraps up.

** linkffn(The Slap Bet by Cardboard Tube Knight)

It's an alternate universe where Harry's parents never died, Harry has a younger sister (because of this first change). Voldemort is in prison and Ginny and Hermione are in love. I wrote it sometime ago and I'm thinking I might go back and do an overhaul.

  An ambitious magically binding bet made with Draco backfires forcing Ginny and Hermione to kiss and the only thing more confusing than how they were outsmarted by Draco and why he would do this is how come they enjoy it so much?
