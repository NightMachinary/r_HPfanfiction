Reading a fanfic focused on Nymphadora, I wondered if there was any fic where Nymphadora becomes Nymphadora Black, is not in favor of light, and as she has Black blood, she somehow manages to get back to the Black family!

â€‹

If there is anything like this, please tell me!


** I would love to read one

** Voldemort would have to specifically order Bellatrix not to kill her or may even reject Nymphadora in order to placate one is his most important Death Eaters.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12471459/1/Tempted][Tempted]] Tonks in the main character and becomes a Death Eater. Only one I've ever seen tbh.

I suppose towards the end of the Downward Spiral Saga by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10461539/BolshevikMuppet99][BolshevikMuppet99]] Bellatrix captures and then tortures until she breaks/rebuilds Tonks how she wants. It's not very important to the plot of the story, but there is an accompanying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13058581/1/In-Her-Image][one-shot]] specifically about that.

  ONE SHOT- When Tonks was six she discovered that there hadn't been a Dark Lady since Le Fey, she decides to become the Dark Lady Tonks. But there's a problem; every time she tries to do something evil, she ends up being a hero. Shout out to Chaos Shadow Kitsune for this idea- HONKS

  Tonks and Harry are married. But that doesn't mean she has to stop being the Dark Lady she's always dreamed of being. It just means now Harry is even more along for the ride. Sequel to The Dark Lady Tonks. Don't take this story seriously, Lord knows I'm not
