We've had a few posts about the small things that make you quit a story, so how about the opposite.

What are the small things that you really like to see in a story? Nothing groundbreaking, but the little touches to a story that boost your enjoyment.

Avoid things like grammar and spelling. It should be even without these things it should still be an okay story, these are just the cherry on top.


** When characters use really useful magic without thinking twice. I figure if you're in a magical world waving a sticky door open with your hand while maintaining a conversation would be the norm. I like it when fics don't highlight every instance of magic but also keep it central in the story.

** Use your imagination for little details. Like, come up with a completely ridiculous sidestory you casually mention in a couple of sentences.

Like that one time in Philosopher's Stone Flitwick explained about Baruffo, who pronounced "wingardium leviosa" wrong and ended up with a buffalo on his chest.

Completely ridiculous, but it really adds to the story, I think.

*** Renaissance, no. The wizarding world is dated, however. It's not even Victorian, barely post-Elizabethan.

Meaning little swearing, time-appropriate slang and actually being somewhat snobs at eleven, seeing as Hogwarts is what appears to be a upper class private school.

If you want to point out their age and the 90's British youth culture, use muggleborns, and show appropriate reactions among the wizards.

***** But the Weasleys aren't actually poor, are they? Sure, in comparison to other families shown they are lacking, but I'd never really pen them as poor in the sense of the word. They are an old family, too, even if they seem to have fallen on hard times.

Hogwarts seemed rather exclusive and expensive too, in the books. J.K changed that on Twitter, but the books still paints another picture. Ancient castle, very prestigious, mostly accomplished teachers, all the big family names in Britain goes there, almost all notable people in society is alumni from there.. It could be that it's the /only/ wizarding school in Britain, but it seems unlikely.

** What I like are two things: -small touches that show that the author know the canon well. Like ref to the fact that we are in the early 90's not the 2010's (so no Ipods, no internet, no current music), or refference to lesser known characters, facts given only in interviews, that sort of things. As long as it stays in small parts. -Good original characters. No self inserts. No "fourth member of the team that was always there I swear". Good characters. If your story need a new character, make one, to shoehorn characters that have nothing to do here because you need a new one. I hate people who will prefer to change the back story of Nott (yes he has one, way more that Zabini btw) rather than to create a new character. And yes I talked to an author who said she made Nott this way because she needed a new character and prefer not to use an OC because "they are bad".

**** You can justify it by saying that Dark Curses frighten the opponents much more than the "basics", because the damage they cause is permanent. Maybe they are also harder to block.

From an author's perspective, curses with more "complicated" and imaginative effects add a certain colour to the story, especially if it's grimdark, and a little Gorn never hurt nobody. Or maybe the author is just sadistic. I know I am.

****** Or, in addition to that, using less common curses can potentially have an intimidation factor that might help you to get a shot in. If someone sees a curse heading right at them that they've never seen before, they might have a brief moment of "what the hell is that?" that causes them to be late performing a shield charm, or getting out of the way. Even if that particular curse isn't necessarily more dangerous than something more common, getting one hit in can put your opponent on the defensive that they might not be able to recover from.

What makes it so annoying is that there are two perfect (but criminally underused) mechanics straight from canon: "blocking" and counter-Curses. Used in tandem, you might be able to create a Curse-specific shield on the fly. Personally, I think that's cooler, but whatever.

**** I don't think so. Wizard Dialect? No. Wizard Accent? Wherever the Wizards live.

long demonstration ahead.

Why and when did class accent appear in the UK? The British "Upper class accent" is actually pretty recent (late 18th-early 19th century). Before the rise of "Public Schools" (Private Schools) in the 1800's the upper class spoke with their regional accent. But in those Schools different accents mixed, and as they considered themselves the elite, different from the "common people" they cultivated these new accents... hence the very real School accents (Oxford accent for example).

Now one may think that it means that Wizards would have their own accents? In this case ALL of Hogwarts (and the British Wizarding World) would have a very distinctive "Hogwarts" accent... But there are clue that this is not the case. A wizard accent is never mentioned, not even with the Pureblood... Not once are Muggleborn identified by their accent (which would be easy). But the biggest argument against that is that some Wizards clearly use accents in the books: Hagrid's West Country accent, Seamus's Irish, I also heard that Mundungus is speaking with an East End accent...

So the idea make originally sense, it would be a good idea... But as the books clearly show they are no "Wizard Accent", Wizards speak their regional accent. Actually since the Pureblood do not frequent muggles since the 1500's realistically they should not have a class accent but rather a regional one.

There are pretty much always languages and dialects that have more prestige than others. If you go back another several hundred years the upper class would all be speaking French while the lower classes spoke English. I can't really speak to the situation in the centuries between those periods as I don't know much about the sociolinguistic situation in that time.

This actually makes no sense. If wizards have little to no contact with muggles in their region there's no reason for them to share the same dialect. Given that there is a pretty small population and most of their interaction is with other witches and wizards, I would expect a distinct magical dialect to have emerged.

Muggleborns arrive at Hogwarts at 11 which is past the prime language learning years so they probably retain at least traces of their original dialects throughout their lives. That would be yet another thing that sets them apart. They're just lucky that the Statute of Secrecy happened after the Great Vowel Shift or it's possible magical people might have been speaking what could be a different language altogether.

***** I think that while yes the Wizarding World is separate from the standard world, they keep the interaction for such things as accents to keep up to date. Imagine if you would that by some miracle, a group of muggles, corner a wizard. The only way out without revealing magic is to talk. the odd accent would definitely lead to the question of "where you from?" the wizard not thinking would reply with a location in the UK. Which would jeopardize wizarding homes, and the wizarding world. Also, JKR probably wrote the characters speaking as if they were around her. Soo they probably have her accent.
