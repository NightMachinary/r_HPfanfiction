Looking for a lot of world building fics that make sense within the Wizarding World.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash

Any Era, anyone can be the main character not just Harry

I personally don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but if it's written believably enough I'll allow it.

Don't have Harry suddenly be super powerful or super smart. A little more powerful or a little smarter then he is then canon is fine but don't make it unbelievable

Don't have Harry be the lord of seven different bank accounts, don't have him have marriage contracts with a bunch of people and other similar stuff like that, don't let that be in the story. Don't let the Goblins suddenly be nice to Harry or X character either.

No character bashing, or very little character bashing.


** I'm fresh off reading it, definitely check out linkffn(The Forests of Valbonë). I see someone already mentioned the /Animagus/ series. And there's also linkffn(Outcast's Alley), linkffn(Harry amidst the Vaults of Stone) and linkffn(One World). The winner of Potter-related worldbuilding is probably the HPMOR fanfanfic /Significant Digits/, but you can only get into /that/ if you read and reasonably enjoyed HPMOR, so tell me.

  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** If you don't mind AUs, I've written "Patron", which has heavy world building. I wanted a wizarding world that wasn't "old England, with some spells and Quidditch", but a society that has developed for 300 years independently of muggles. In some ways it's far more progressive than muggle Britain (they think muggles are prudes), in some ways far more archaic (some very old laws are still on the books, even though custom massively tempers their enforcement), but most importantly, magic is far more common. People, even students, use magic all the time, for mundane tasks. Serving plates in the Great Hall float around, "robes" covers anything from student robes featuring several spells to illusionary fire covering your body. Further, Britain has a mainstream culture, and a few outliers, and Magical France has a different society, as has magical Bulgaria, Magical Jamaica, the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire and Scandinavia. (As an aside, the story is written from the POVs of the characters, which are not omniscient.)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
