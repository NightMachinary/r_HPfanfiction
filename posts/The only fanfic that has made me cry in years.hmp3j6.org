*** Main protagonist is Lyra Black, the fourth black sister and love interest of James Potter.Story involves her branching away from her families views) may I say in one of the most realistic ways I've seen done) and growing as a person all while showing all the traits and quirks she would have inherited from being raised by The Black Family. What's most tragic is the irony of the ending and how it came about. Don't want to spoil to much, so I'll leave it at that.

*** There's also a sequel which I refuse to read set in the same time of the books. The characters like Harry, Hermione and Ron, are no where near as developed and interesting as the ones in the fanfic and I see no reason to read when it seems the sequel is following canon, Lyra is so out of character in it as well. After an ending that sad in the 1st book of the series i see no way this can go uphill for Lyra and that just seems like a dull read. I think the author realized and tried to make it more lighthearted but it's just a shadow of misery and despair for Lyra, with no upside and more irony and tragedy predicted in the future
