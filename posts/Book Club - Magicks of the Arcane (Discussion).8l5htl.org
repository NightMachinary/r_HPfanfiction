** I'm on the fence about this fic.

On the one hand, this fic does a good (maybe great even) job at creating an adventure feel. Even if some of the beats are the same during the first dozen chapters, tidbits of uniqueness stand out: the fight with the bicorn, the artifacts in Dumbledore's office, and all the duels feel exciting (more than I can say for some others). After the 4th year ends, the real highlight of the story appears: Dumbledore and Harry's adventures around the world. Scenes from this just stand out in my mind, but I would recommend reading the fic just for the chapters 12-19. If this fic were made just about the two of them doing this sort of wandering around, it would end up being one of my favorite stories, fanmade or otherwise. And the magic. While not the best depictions of magic I have seen, the author clearly went above the norm to put it on display. Interesting concepts are delved into, and I actually like the idea of Ancient Magick, even if it does come with some of the baggage of the idea of "power" being energy like (though thankfully never devolves into magical cores). And Harry, despite his forced growth and obvious talent in the story, is clearly shown to inferior to people like Dumbledore and Voldemort (and a few other OC characters).

On the other hand...this fic is all over the place story-wise. For one, Harry's character is really inconsistent, especially at the beginning. He seems to have done a 180 in terms of character overnight, and not in an altogether believable manner. And the sexualization in the story gets pretty out of hand, especially in the first half of the story. Also a lot of characters and plot lines are introduced in fair detail, yet never go anywhere or seem to be forgotten.

The verdict? The author appears to have not really known where this story was going to go, something that the A/N reflect, while they were writing. It seems that what the author wanted to write was Harry becoming magically talented and learning/adventuring with Dumbledore. When the story focuses on that, and the magic or action or world-building aspects, its great. When it tries to focus back on the "main story" (i.e. defeat Voldemort), it is only slightly above average or worse.

Read it if you want to see interesting magic, action, Mentor!Dumbledore, and exploration/adventure stories.

*** I couldn't stick with it. Abandoned it after 3 chapters. At times it was decent, at others it was just plain weird. And wtf was up with the scene and the chasers and their sexually heaving breasts? It felt like my immortal

*** I agree with basically everything you said. I think it brought a lot of nuance and fun to the idea of a mentor Dumbledore, but it was heavily overshadowed by the authors clear lack of direction in the story. I really wanted to like this Harry, and I really wanted to learn more about these Ancient Magicks but instead of tying it all into one grand story, it felt like 3 stories just mashed together with no real cohesive purpose.

**** I stand by what I said too. If a fic were written just about Dumbledore and Harry taking a year off from Hogwarts to go around the world, it could be one of the best fics in the fandom. Works like By the Divining Light and The Mind Arts touch on this sort of mentor-student relationship, but there are very few I can name that show Dumbledore as a teacher rather than a guardian.

The worst part is one of the A/N mentions plans for visiting several other locations and their adventures, but cut them because "summer was ending" and we had to go back to the done-to-death plot of kill Voldemort.

Just wondering, do you mean that Harry in his current state is inferior to them, or that his overall potential seems to be inferior?

**** Harry is 14, 15, and 16 during the entire fic. Magic is about skill, experience, and years of study and research. So Harry could never hope to actually match Voldemort without a stupid BS powerup like wandless magic or being the descedant of Merlin (you know the usual drivel).

Even with two years of training, partly at Dumbledore's hands and the Order members, Harry cannot realistically defeat Voldemort himself. The reason he succeeds in here is complicated and a spoiler, but it at least makes more sense than a lot of fics.

***** If we go by realistic development (which I personally love), it would take Harry about 15 years of studying almost exclusively combat magic and war, to be able to match Voldemort. Most fic stories just don't have the patients to create an intriging plot for this kind of development.

** For Magicks of the Arcane, the writing was decent, I guess, but I never felt interested in the story. It fell into the trap of making Harry "The Mighty One", which I'm getting rather tired of seeing.

*** I thought the author made a point to outline Harry's inexperience and the thoughtlessness of youth while slowly developing his character. He fails and is challenged many times, and I felt that his power was well balanced in consideration to his training and what he was facing.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** At the moment, I'm about 10% of the way through and I keep putting it down and stopping. So far most of the writing seems a bit under par, but the dialogue just feels so clunkly that it really takes me out of the story.

I've never been a fan of the whole uber-formal or Victorian language bullshit with the pureblood culture. But it's okay in general, provided there is a lead up to it, or characters are introduced talking that way. But it brothers me when the story starts out with Harry being basically completely cannon and then he switches to effecting this new dialect/mannerisms immediately in all aspects almost overnight story-wise. Too much too fast. Maybe if I keep reading I'll get used to it, but just the same I'll get used to bad dialogue in a story if I'm interested in the plot.

God I hate this story. I could actually like the premise and the general story but I hate it because of the constant sexual shit. It starts pretty good but its just painful by where i am at chapter 6 and Ive just decided to drop it at this point. Its fucking frustrating cause I want to enjoy it so bad.
