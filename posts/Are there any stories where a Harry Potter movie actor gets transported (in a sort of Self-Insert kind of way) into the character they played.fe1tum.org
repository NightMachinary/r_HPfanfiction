Bonus points if the story begins early on, or at the start of the canon series.

Sort of like the Game of Thrones story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557480/1/Sean-Bean-Saves-Westeros-Book-1-Sean-Lends-a-Hand][Sean Bean Saves Westeros]], except Harry Potter.


** I can just imagine poor Alan rickman looking at his counterpart and thinking why is he so nasty?

** I'd say this one comes close. The actors are the actual people they play (Emma - Hermione, Daniel - Harry, etc). The twist is that some of them have their memories wiped clean of wizarding stuff and only remember it as acting.

It is written and posted as posts in the aforementioned subreddit and you'll have to look for the next chapter in the post history of the sub (not to worry, chapters are only a few posts appart).

  Daniel Radcliffe loved remembering his time on the set of Harry Potter. One day, while walking through the park, he picked up a fallen branch nearby and swung it with an "Expelliarmus!" A streak of light streamed from the branch and knocked a walker's phone out of their hand.
