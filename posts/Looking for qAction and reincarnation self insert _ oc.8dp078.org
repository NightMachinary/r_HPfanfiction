I been reading hp fan fiction but all of them are Chinese novel (uukanshu). Because all of them are good story adding and action type of fanfic. Like "Harry Potter and the secret treasure", Mc has to fight old God's and must collect all the inheritance of the 4 founders. In "Harry Potter meets league of legends" Mc has can get skills from league of legends and kills people and do some morally Grey things( like killing, black market buying and selling, being hired to extradite criminals. I think he killed some Russian Aurora or somethin. And his doing all this thing as a student of hogwarts. his has the same age as the twins). Both story add and changes the story. Like one of them rather than dealing with the basilisk. He took the book and gave it to Dumbledore, which force Dumbledore to make all the students of hogwarts to become a exchange(?) students to go to the Japanese wizard school. And other one got slightly angry at Dumbledore that when Harry first went to the the mirror, the Mc told him the thing about not dwelling on the past when they went out making Dumbledore wait there all night and he did it again for the philosopher stone event.


** Uh. Is English your first language?

And most of the fics you list sound contrived as hell.

** Ummm..... ok? Ao3 has its own self insert category so you can just find some there easily. SB and SV also have SI fics but in less quantity since there aren't many HP fics there. Reincarnation shows up in fic description so use keywords in your search engine and you'll find some quickly. As for OCs, just specify your search on FFN and add OC as a character. Hope this helps.
