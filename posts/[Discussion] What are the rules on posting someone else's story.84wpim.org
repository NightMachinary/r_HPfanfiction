I know that defenstratable already posted Fettucini's story that was deleted

Well today I was searching. I was looking for a slightly grey, competent, powerful Harry with a dash of romance and came across this:

** That's absolutely not allowed. You cannot repost someone else's material without their express permission.

You should report the person reposting to the website, and they will get it removed.

*** Well I wondered because clearly defenstratable has already done this because Fettucini deleted his account. I assume it was agreed upon that defensable could repost since it has been up for so long? But the new one seemed deliberate.

****** Theft.

Included in his collection are the first few chapters of The Lie I Lived, Renegade Cause, Control, HP and the Unlocked Knowledge, HP and the Acts of Betrayal, and Room of Requirement. Some of the titles and summaries have changed, but the content is fraudulent duplication.

*** Totally with you on the plagiarist being a repeat offender. But I don't think [[/u/liverbuzzz]] is responsible for it, nor is this the same human on the other side of the keyboard as the other footballer who spammed us a week ago or so. For one thing, LiverpoolFC. So, y'know... civilised.

*** !!!! this isn't me and I swear, I don't want to be banned or thought of as a cheat. I have posted an update on my FFNet profile to show that it isn't me (to the best of my abilities).

I can't figure out how to link my profile to this reddit so you can see it.

Further, if you look through my reddit posts, I have never trolled and only requested or commented on fiction posts. You can also see on my FFNet profile (if I can figure out how to link it) that I don't even have any stories posted.

*** Is it wrong that I am honored to have you posting on my thread?? I think i have read through most of your stories, really liked Vitam Paramus and the Pureblood Princess (although the ending was a bit trippy to me). I really, however, liked the Quidditch World Cup.

***** Well that is me in a nutshell. Weird. I just think Luna and Harry work really well together, all things considered, but it is such a rare pairing and hard to write.

I am going to start reading limpieza de sangre soon, FWIW. I tend to not read many in progress stories because I don't handle abandonment well.

** There is also someone on ff.net who writes 'sequels' to other people's stories. I guess it's not really plagiarising but he does use the aignores and original story title in the summary, so it sounds like he's gotten their approval. And he's not a great writer. Is it okay to name and shame his pen name?
