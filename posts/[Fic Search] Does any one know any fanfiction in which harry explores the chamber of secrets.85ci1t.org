I am looking for fanfiction in which harry explores the chamber of secrets? Preferably a novel length work and Harry/Hermione :)


** ~opens up his 'to-do list'~

"Harry explores the Chamber of Secrets only to find that in its far-larger-than-expected depths, it hosts a near complete copy of Hogwarts. It turns out that Hogwarts is destroyed quite frequently, by dark lords and mad wizards and occasional potions accidents, with the Chamber of Secrets serving to 'grow' replacement parts for wings of the castle that are destroyed."

*** Oh, you could expand that by using the Room of Requirement as an alternate access. It fits, more or less
