How does this change his interactions with the Dursley's, and what wider ramifications could it hold for the rest of the Wizarding World?


** Maybe it has all this "combat" knowledge that it can slowly teach him as long as he is holding it in some way? Use the idea I saw somewhere, where it can become the appropriate size sharp edged item as the owner needs?

So, it takes an interest in Harry and decides to help teach him. It keeps showing up on his hip as a dagger (or as a pruning knife in the garden or kitchen knife when the Dursleys force him to make dinner... which could have interesting consequences) and trying to get him to use it so it can teach him some more. Maybe a conspiracy between it, the hat, and Fawlkes where they decide he needs a better chance than Dumbledore and everyone else is giving him.

I don't mind that nod to strange Japanese anime/manga where objects turn into girls either. Could be fun.

*** Considering the Basilisk venom then even if it is heavily weakened by being in the sword instead of the liquid the Dursley's are probably going to have a bad time with Harry using the sword to cut veggies... Harry of course won't really suffer any effects since he has plot-armor and Fawkes on his corner.

**** Fun fact: As long as you don't have any tears or other wounds in your esophagus/digestive system, you can safely drink snake venom as the enzymes are broken down by stomach acid. It's really not recommended, as there's no way to know for sure you don't have a little esophageal tear in there.

Now, basilisks are magical so that could maybe not apply, but venom in general is theoretically safe to drink and there are folks who have done it, because people.

A basilisk stare can kill a person instantly without harming the body, aka some kind of damage to the soul itself, maybe tearing away the soul from the body.\\
edit: on a related note, maybe the Avada kedavra curse was made by studying the basilisk stare.

And, getting fanficcy here which is fitting for the subreddit, but since the victims were not literally turned to stone, it could be seen as 'their souls are frozen and the body is in lockdown'

I wonder what would happen to a dementor exposed to basilisk venom. Would all the souls trapped inside be freed? Or do dementors digest them and stuff?

****** In theory it shouldn't hurt the person doing the sucking, but it's unnecessary. The issue is they have to slice the bite open and that leaves the person vulnerable to blood loss and can make infections way worse. Plus the amount of venom sucked out is so small it doesn't make a difference anyway. If the venom is hemotoxic, like what most rattlesnake species have, it causes tissue necrosis and sepsis and slicing the wound open can make it much much worse than it would be if the person was just rushed to a hospital for treatment.

There's also the chance that a venomous snake has given a "dry bite". Meaning they inject no or very little venom. They need their venom to get food, and it actually plays an important role in starting digestion so snakes will try to conserve it as much as possible. In a dry bite scenario slicing someone open to suck out venom just cause more unnecessary injury.

** Okay, so first of all the sword has the ability to turn into a cute teenage girl and she really wants to date Harry because the Sword of Gryffindor only takes on what makes it stronger and he's the strongest boy nearby. He's not the heir of Gryffindor or anything, but it turns out that marrying the sword means he can just take her last name and it works out about the same anyway. Swords can't have kids though, he'll probably have to fuck Daphne Greengrass too. And Tonks and Fleur, obviously.

She tries to solve all of Harry's problems by cutting them in half.

"Can't swim two hostages to the surface of the lake because they are too heavy huh? You could just cut off their legs to make them lighter."

"That'd kill them."
