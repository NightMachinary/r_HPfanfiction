I'm a sucker for the cliche. Consider it my guilty pleasure!

Don't know what that is? It's simply where the main romantic pairing begin the story and hopefully go through a significant portion of it disliking each other and then.... romance! Somehow. As long as it's (mostly) believable.

I dislike: femslash (but slash is lovely), threesomes, poly, HP/HG, HP/GW, RW/HG, and Filch. Literally every pairing and any character that isn't part of that list is fine.

Thanks!


** Haha I also love these - especially "bond" fics of some sort that FORCE two characters to get along who hate eachother. Sadly this trope is almost always done so poorly that I rarely read a fic like this without a rec. But you are in luck because I have tons of recs that fit this :). All of these are ones where the characters pretty much HATE eachother to start - if you want just mild dislike or annoyance at the beginning I have some like that too.

The classic for the Drarry-ship is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/754708/chapters/1410134][*Bond* by Anna Fugazzi]]. An oldy but a goody AU where Draco and Harry are accidentally bonded during 6th or 7th year using old marriage magic. It has everything you want in a Dr/Hr fic - true characterizations, sexual tension, a slow build to love and PLOT.

For Dramione, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][*Isolation* by Bex-Chan]] is what youre looking for. It is basically an AU that is really close to canon, where instead of going with Ron and Harry horcrux hunting in DH, Hermione stays at Hogwarts for the first term as Head Girl. And then Draco has to live in her head girl apartment with her because he is hiding from Voldermort and the Order (this premise was a little too unbelievable for me, but if you can suspend your disbelief you will like this one a lot more). The best part of this fic was that when it started syncing up with DH plot in the second half, it got really interesting and was a cool AU.

For Snarry, I loved [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361][*Cambiare Podentes* by Jordan Grant]]. It's a two part series, Harry/Snape 7th year fic where there is a prophecy that in order to kill voldermort, harry must bind to snape in an ancient spell as his permanent slave. I realize that this fic is seriously the most eye-roll educing premise ever written, but believe me when I say this fic is totally different and will completely subvert your expectations. Also, I usually hate Snarry because I think cross-gen is kinda creepy in most stories, totally OOC and also not at all well explained. But because this fic is a 600K-ish word series the characters and their motivations are fully explained and Snape and Harry are both so in character, the whole thing really works. Not to give too much away, but this is a SLOW slog to a love story -- so pretty much exactly what you are looking for.

Some other Drarry honorable mentions that are great:

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/864147][Hungry by Birdsofshore]] - Hogwarts 8th year. Harry and Draco accidentally fuse their arms together in potions and it take 48 hours to come apart. This fic was really great because the plot device was really clever and felt really in character.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879835][Salt on the Western Wind by Saras_Girl]] - Starts right after the final battle. Draco is sent with Harry, Ron and Hermione into hiding because his mom called in his life-debt with Harry. Due to an accident while in hiding, Harry and Draco are bound at the wrist by a spell that won't separate them until they trust eachother.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812][Helix by Saras_Girl]] - Not exactly a hate-to-love but certainly a dislike to love. In this, each chapter is one day in December of 8th year hogwarts. Draco and Harry are assigned to care for the breeding of frost snails and slowly become friends and then fall in love. This was slow and deliberate, the writing is so good. This is a favorite.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss the Joy by ICMezzo]] (you have to log in to Ao3 to see this fic)- This is the days right after the last battle like I've never seen done before. It is a beautiful fic where Harry and Draco both seek refuge in the RoR after the war and slowly heal together. Weirdly, it felt very in character even though it was slash - of course they hated eachother at first and the progression was slow and believable. At the end, it wasn't even clear that Harry is attracted to boys, he just needed someone and Draco was there. And the plot device of what/who was "real" was heartbreaking, original and beautifully done.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/42058][The Potter-Malfoy Problem by Who_la_hoop]] - An 8th year fic where the ROR keeps forcing Harry and Draco together. It is so angsty and hilarious and makes me blush while reading it. A favorite.

*** I love fellow Drarry fans. I've had people tell me that the pairing doesn't make sense, but I think it's one of the best pairings to show character development with. Even if they dislike each other, Harry and Draco have a pretty strong chemistry with one another, and a good writer can always find a way to make that evolve into a friendship, and maybe later romance.

**** Agreex1000! Also, not to hijack your tread too much OP, but what are some of your favorite Drarry fics (especially not commonly rec'd or less famous ones). It's hard for me to find things I haven't read - even in the big Drarry communities!

*** I've read both Bond and Isolation and enjoyed both, though loved neither. Cambiare is a new one though! I look forward to reading it!

As for the Drarrys... I'm actually super excited to dive into that list haha! Thanks a bunch! I see Saras_Girl recommended a lot in this sub but I don't actually think I've read anything yet by her.

**** I actually was pretty "meh" about isolation - the premise made no sense and I'm not huge on Draco/hermione in general. But I figured it fit your request too much to not list. Bond is just good to me because it's such a classic, but it hasn't aged that well. There are other Drarrys by the same author that are way better. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3634826/1/Volunteers][Volunteers]] is a favorite of mine that you should check out, although it doesn't fit your request really.

And dude, saras_girl is without a doubt my favorite author in fandom for "real life" stories. She doesn't write adventures or drama, just beautifully described slice of life fics. TURN is a favorite (and great even for non-Drarry shippers), but really everything she does is great. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4173777][The Girl in the Kneazle Nightie]] for example, has the best Luna POV I've read anywhere.

** The absolute best fanfiction I have ever read in my entire 15 years in the fandom is "The Fallout" which is a Dramione fic set during the war. Perfect pairing for the trope you are interested in, and it's one of the most if not THE most moving pieces of fiction I have ever encountered. You have to make an account on Hawthorne and Vine (Dramione site) to read it but it's quick to register and well worth it. Honestly life changing.

*** I'm surprised your favorite fic is The Fallout. This fic is really really good, you're right, but it doesn't feel like HP to me so I never even list it as a favorite. If anything it's just original fiction with some magic and the war as the base for the story. I agree that it's great writing, but not at all what I'm looking for when I read fanfic usually - it just didn't scratch that itch. But great rec for what OP requested for sure.

**** The reason that I love that fic so much is because it isn't like other HP fic -- it pulls from a place of such intense darkness which, in my opinion, is what was missing from JKR's final novel. War is messy and violent and terrifying and chaotic. The Fallout captures that perfectly. Not entirely sure what you mean when you say it 'doesn't feel like Harry Potter.' Why? Every character is well written and fleshed out and developed and everything feels incredibly raw and real. It's happening in a magical setting so it's not really AU, it's just the author's take on what a war in the wizarding world would really be like. Disturbing, strategic, devastating. In my opinion this author does it way better than JKR. Perhaps it doesn't follow Harry's horcrux hunt as closely and focuses more on the Dramione relationship and smaller missions on their side of the war effort, but that's what makes it special. This to me is like the adult version of DH and is thus far more developed in ways DH couldn't be as it was intended for a much younger audience.
