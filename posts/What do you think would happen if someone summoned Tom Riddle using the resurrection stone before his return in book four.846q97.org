** I'm not sure, but if he did manage to get hold of the Diary fragment, I think it would have changed its tune. On account of like, the eternal suffering and all that.

On the other hand, the Stone is spiced to draw from Death and Riddle didn't quite make it that far (only Limbo), so possibly nothing?

** I think you would get Senior, although if Intent is also taken into account then at see a smokey outline of a man unable to he heard. Only apart of Riddle would of been destroyed and pasted on, and I know the 'half of a half' argument but as he isn't entirely dead I don't think The Powers that be would Consider him dead
