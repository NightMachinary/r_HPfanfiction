When Harry Potter does his Gringotts inheritance test, he receives a strange result...


** "Shame." Ragnok said with a shake of his head.

"What's a shame?" Harry asked confusedly. "How can inheriting Gringotts be a bad thing?"

"Oh, ignore me, Lord Gringotts, I just can't believe you're finally here! Yes, that's it. Please, if you'll just follow me." Ragnok said before turning to whisper to his secretary, "Bring my axe."

"Wot was that?"

"Just getting the welcoming feast ready. Come along now."

And Harry Potter was never heard from again..

*** Could I ask why they killed him. I kind of feel like them having a human represantitive coukd be useful, and him being young means tgey could attempt to mold him to what they want.

**** Because Goblins rebelled constantly against Wizards. Being ruled by a Wizard (Lord Gringotts) seems like it would be anathema to them.
