A while back there was a Dramione story that was talked about on the Common Room(?) group on FB. As far as I can gather the story was about how they had been together all the time (in secret), but to protect Draco Hermione obliviated Draco of the knowledge about their relationship. But I think a bracelet had some sort of significance in this story. Mind you, haven't read this, only read the comments about the story but I would love it if anyone knew which one I was talking about.

Also other stories where they been dating throughout school, either in secret or a select few knew. Read one where they were married right npbefore the war but can't remember which one that is.


** You'll probably do better finding these if you check with dramioneasks on Tumblr. They're pretty good at tracking down fic requests like this and they all like the pairing and read widely in it. They've also got a decent tagging system for finding secretly dating fics and the like.

** You're thinking of two different stories by the same author (I believe).

The first part of your request is most likely *Silencio*. The one with a bracelet is called *The Bracelet*.

  In a whirlwind of pleasure and angst, can Draco and Hermoine end up happy and together? Or are they destined forever to keep their relationship physical and above all secret?

  Hermione has everything she could possibly want... Except a life. People are getting sick of her superior attitude, especially Draco Malfoy, who schemes to get her down, once and for all. And then there's the thing with The Bracelet... 7th year AR. COMPLETE SINCE 2009 XD
