A quick Gen fic for some brotherly bonding, with a brief cameo of Molly in the background. Feedback welcome!

Also, stunning lack of /Charlie Weasley & Ron Weasley/ fics on AO3!


** I mean Charlie is stunningly lacking in canon as well. Probably the reason why the fandom follows that. A Shame really.

Will definitely check it out later.

*** Definitely. I have a Charlie one-shot with Molly which has been well-received thankfully. Thank you for the response!

*** Thanks! Unfortunately, I've long since given up with FF, so I don't think I'll post it on there
