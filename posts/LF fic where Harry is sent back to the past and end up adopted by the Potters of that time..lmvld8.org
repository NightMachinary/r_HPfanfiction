Like the title said. Harry doesn't have to be a small child, he can easily be in the middle of his Hogwarts years. I'm just looking for a fic where Harry live with his family in the past. (And where the Potters know Harry's true identity, of course.)

**** Don't really know of any others. I know that once the author of Stepping Back is done with his current story, he plans on writing another time travel fanfic; this one being Harry/Narcissa. Whether he gets adopted by the Potters or not, I have no idea.

***** It'll probably be more Black Family related. But still very excited for it!

** A Second Chance at Happiness? Maybe?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14245221/chapters/32850018]]

A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe?

*** Not sure if this fits. It's a time-travel fic with an adult Harry.

  During the battle in the Department of Mysteries things go very wrong. An errant spell changes things far more than anyone could've imagined. Despite the title, this is NOT a Dr. Who crossover fic.

  Harry, Hermione, and Neville are still stuck in the past, and have started to build a life for themselves. Things are settling down, but then darkness rears its ugly head again. Harry's once more drawn into battle against the dark. With his friends and family he just might be able to fight them off.
