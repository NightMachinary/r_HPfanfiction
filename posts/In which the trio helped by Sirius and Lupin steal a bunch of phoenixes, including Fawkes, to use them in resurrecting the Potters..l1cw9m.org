:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remembered reading once a fic, a long time ago, which had the above as the main plot point. Might have been released before even HBP. I can't remember much of it except that Voldemort interrupts the ritual and we learn that Lily was spying on the Order for Voldemort but eventually fell in love with James and turned. Also Voldemort is ridiculously powerful and competent and he uses necromancy to enslave phoenixes when they are ashes. I remember there were some really awesome ideas and some really great magic, but unfortunately I can't remember the name. I'd be grateful if you could help me out.


** Bump for visibility. I'd like to know as well.
