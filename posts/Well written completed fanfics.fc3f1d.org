  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

** Linkao3(Paranoia and puns) It's Harry/Cedric. The best short work I've read. I've read a lot of times and it always makes me laugh

Linkffn(Timely Errors) Harry ends up in Marauder's era, pretty good and doesn't change the future.

Linkao3(Dimension Hopers) It's based in the universe of linkao3(C'est La Vie) which is not finished, but you don't necessarily have to read it to understand Dimension Hoppers, but it will give you some background. The story is about Harry and Bill after the war, they travelled to another dimension, Harry is twelve and makes friends with Orion Black (Remus and Sirius's son) and Draco, really good this one is kinda crack, but when combine with C'est la vie is pretty nice

Hope you like them, I haven't read a lot of completed fics. Sorry if my English is not good, it's not my first language

  Harry makes three rules to survive fourth year: 1) watch the new DADA professor like a hawk, 2) suspect all animals of being animagi, and 3) avoid Cedric Diggory at all costs. Shame Diggory didn't get the memo. For a tumblr prompt by johnlocked-starkid: maybe a Harry/Cedric thing where the Triwizard Cup isn't a portkey and Voldemort doesn't happen, and instead they just win together and are happy and celebrate together. (bonus points for shy confessions of a crush from one or the other)

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** All I have are slashfics hope you don't mind. I linked a few lesser known and shorter fanfics too as well as Crossovers because I guess that most people will rec you the "classics" and here is some diversity(?) Idk Some of the fics I linked are better, others don't reach the same level but these are all fics that are pretty good as far as I remember.

These below are all Marvel x HP crossovers

This first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot if you like Marvel (and Loki) since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17983598]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678135]])

Here a few fluffier fics to enlighten your mood.

Check out this series. Three small soulmate fics. Very fluffy. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])

Also this time travel fic. Bit sad at one point but Happy ending! (Ships Sirius/Harry Hermione/Remus) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

A funny drarry fic. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14010333]])

Very sweet. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15857595]])

One of my favorite Wolfstar fics. I highly recommend you to check out the whole series Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

All of these following fics are Novel length fics with either Draco ir Snape as a Mc/focus point most of them at least 20k

Time travel Snarry fics Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

A Draco/Charlie Weasley fic Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1907331]])

Snarry once again. Post-war. Harry and Snape swap bodies. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16848688]])

Post-war Drarry fic. Harry and Draco are Aurors. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20309395]])

Drarry. Amortentia fic. Harry is oblivious. (17k) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13818327]])

Drarry. Don't remember much about it tbh but I've got it bookmarked so I guess it's good. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15783759]])

A fun Drarry fic (Draco pov) post-war. Where Auror Harry gets deaged. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/391640]])

Linkffn(On a pale horse) Pretty funny. A well known HP MoD fic

Sherlock x HP crossover. Very well written.

Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

I mean, it's not like him to be nice.” Neville snorted, mouth twitching rapidly. “No, it's not,” He agreed readily. “Malfoy sending this makes perfect sense though. The flower means, Beauty is your only attraction."- Or... the one where Harry and Draco have a flower war. Their tamest fight yet to date as they trade silent insults, cutting barbs and even a few compliments sprinkled in.

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

** Linkffn(Storm of Yesterday by Shayalonnie) it's a time travel fic with eventual Hermione/James. Just finished reading it for the third time. This author has several well written completed fics also if you're new to their work. They are usually Hermione centric.

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow. When the Boy-Who-Lived lives no more, Hermione is thrown back in time into another battle where she has a chance to save not only Harry, but another Potter. *Art by colour me luna*
