I'm looking for fics that emphasis sibling relationships in a familia way. Any cannon relationships at all.

- Weasley Siblings (Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, Ginny)
- Creevey Brothers (Colin and Dennis)
- Sirius and Regulus Black
- Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissia Black
- Potter Siblings (James S., Albus S., Lily L.)
- Dumbledores (Albus, Aberforth, Ariana)
- Etcetera...

It doesn't have to be all at once, just any siblings interacting. Childhood, teens, adulthood. Fluff, humor, broken relationships, fixed relationships, closure, typical sibling interactions, something that makes me break into tears. With one, two, three or all of their siblings. Preferably no romances please. Other than that, I'm pretty much open to almost anything.

Edit: I'm desperate for something new to read.


** Fox ears- linkffn(4009690) is my favourite Weasley fic in general.

Cast a Long Shadow, We All Meet in the End- linkffn(5262967) focuses on Lily and Petunia.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

  In the wake of the Dark Lord's resurrection, fractured shards of the Black family - once scattered - are pieced together as the embers of resistance flicker to life once again. Unlikely partnerships are forged, and trust must be earned in a race against time to protect the next generation from the mistakes of the past and guarantee a future for the wizarding world.
