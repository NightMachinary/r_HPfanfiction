:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I saw a post on here about a week ago?? I thought I saved it but I can't seem to find it.

Essentially every pureblood wizarding family has a hair color affected by their magic. And if you marry into that family, your hair changes to that color. Such as how Narcissa's started turning Malfoy blonde.

I remember the post also mentioned a Drarry discussion of Draco hoping and waiting Harry's hair would start to turn blonde, and then being horrified when his own hair starts turning brown.

Does anyone know what I'm talking about??? Was this on this subreddit or [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]]?

** That sounds very familiar up until the Drarry part for me so I tried searching multiple key words in both pages but I couldn't find the post sorry. :/ I'm like 80% sure I know what you're referring to though
