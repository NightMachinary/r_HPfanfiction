Between the Death Eater attacks during the war, the Celebrations at the death of Voldemort, Death Eaters who chose not to surrender and fought till the end, and general wizarding incompetence, the Statue of Secrecy falls before the end of November 1981.

The final incident is the Sirius Black Incident.

By September 1991 Harry has grown up in a world that is fully aware of Magic and has mostly settled down. Dumbledore's Merlin like appearance helped greatly, with the various Ministry's and magical Congress' being brought under the control of their Non-Magical counterparts. Some places blend in well, others not so well, some places like the middle east and area's of Africa and South America have their own Witch Hunts going on.

How would Harry have been raised? How would the Dursly's react? Would the world at large know of The-Boy-Who-Lived?


** Harry would probably become famous in the Muggle world too, if to a lesser extent. So the Dursleys might either try to capitalize on his fame, if they think it'll benefit them, or actually get rid of him, if they're afraid of Muggle reactions.

Dumbledore might even decide that Harry needs protection from the Muggle world and take him away from the Dursleys, because as an easily recognizable wizarding figure, he'd be a target of anti-wizard sentiments.

*** I don't think the Dursleys would capitalize on the fame so much as try to get rid of him; because I'm pretty sure Petunia wouldn't want to be associated with anything remotely 'freaky' and since Vernon also appears to have a similar disdain for magical world, so, getting rid of Harry would seem the most reasonable assumption.

**** Yeah, I agree that's much more likely, but in the /very/ unlikely scenario that the public has an extremely positive reaction to wizards existing, the Dursleys might see him as potentially beneficial enough socially/financially for them to keep him anyways. Even their personal hatred of freakishness might have a threshold.

I mention it only because it could be an interesting direction to take a fic. Themes of childhood fame and exploitation, etc.

*****  /me remembers one fic where Britain officially launched their 1st piloted spacecraft (private one but company is new wing of 'old money' family) which went to Mars after short tests. Travel(all 4 hours if it) and Mars base setup was broadcasted over TV (without light-speed delay).

It's just technology from young genius they said. It's even fake one (no lightspeed delays)

They also put stone arch and used as portal to Earth (this wasn't intented to be shown over TV but it was) - official explantion:experimental quantum portal

next year - 1st interstallar ship launched. Not to any of nearest stars. Earth-like planet was found by first expedition. They were lucky. What magic?

well, it was officially declared that magic DOES exist right after most of magical world was removed from Earth (to 2nd 'found' planet).

Queen of course knew a lot about it.

Ships and other 'science' wonders were magictech. All it took one young genius from 'old money' family to get his Hogwarts letter, find way to transfer rather small (to his family) amount of money to magical world and hire a lot of researchers.

Statute? Nobody said it was actually magic until it was too later.

Voldie (or Dumblemore) didn't because serious issues.

******* There's a Haphne fic called Contractural Invalidation that has a very interesting take on the pureblood view of Muggles. Harry takes Daphne to a fancy Muggle restaurant and she explains through gritted teeth that she doesn't dislike Muggles because they lack art, culture or finery, she dislikes Muggles because they lack Wonder. In the age of Science and skepticism it is even harder for Muggles to accept something like magic as being real. The Muggle tendency to explain things away makes it easier for the Obliviators, because Muggles simply lack the ability to believe in the extraordinary. Daphne concedes that Muggles are clever and resourceful but they will always be inferior to wizards and witches due to their lack of magic, and indeed their inability to even believe in Magic.

In the modern scientific era of muggle development and discovery, the primary advocate of the statute of secrecy are Muggles themselves, and their adherence to the scientific method. It would literally take presidents and prime ministers weeks on end of television appearances with Wizards and witches to convince the populace that magic was real.

I think the statute of secrecy is actually way more durable on the Muggle side then people give it credit for.

****** I don't think muggles would demand a trial because they have a justice boner or anything, but muggles almost always have trials, and its part of the process of grieving/dealing with the aftermath of an atrocity. I feel like they would expect a public trial of some form. It would be definitely be noted by muggle government and probably media that Sirius hadn't been tried.

the only reason muggle britian would care about sirius not getting a trial is because sirius killed british citizens and therefore needs to be punished for those crimes too

if the incident went down differently and no muggles where killed the british goverment would not care about sirius at all

it would be considered a wizarding britian afair

** In 1981 that's going to be very different than the usual Fall of Statue fics set in the 90s. The Soviet Union is still around for once. With most of the world unaware of what's going on in the other half, it'd be easy to cover up anything as enemy misinformation. What do you think would be more likely, that magic is real or that the Soviets did a weird lightshow with a nuclear satellite that accidentally blew up over Britain? The Russian citizens would never even hear of it. As long as governments cooperate, a coverup is possible until around late 1991.

**** Here's my guesswork:

The top tier of the soviet government was probably aware of magic and had the state Propaganda apparatus cooperate with their magical government to keep secrecy intact. In return the magical government mostly left the muggle one alone and made sure that the American wizards also kept up a non interference policy regarding muggle politics. I'm not sure if either muggle government was made aware of the fact that the wizards had enchanted all nukes on both sides except for those used in tests to not go off.
