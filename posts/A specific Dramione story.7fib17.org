Read a story a few years ago where Draco and Hermione were married during their Hogwarts year but kept it quiet thanks to Dumbledore. The other only found out after the Great Battle. I remember Hermione and Draco arguing after the battle, they both thought the other was taking to many risks. And then they spent the next days telling the story of how they got married. And that the only thing I remember of the story

Thank you!
