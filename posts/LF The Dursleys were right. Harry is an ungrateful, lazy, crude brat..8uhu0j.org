Looking for a fanfic where Harry is more or less as bad as Petunia thought he was. And the Dursley's treatment of him was just them trying to raise him to be a good man (which they failed at). I'm not looking for a full blown "Harry is evil" or "Dark Lord Harry" type of thing. Misbehaving and being a brat rather than being super powerful and evil. I will appreciate all suggestions! âš¡

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.

*** It doesn't. I am in no way implying that the Dursleys were good gardians or that their methods were adequate. All I'd like to read about is a Harry who is a pain in the ass, lazy, sarcastic and a generally problematic teen.

*** Whether or not their abuse was justified isn't important, what OP asks about is fics in which their ridiculous excuse is correct, not their behaviour.
