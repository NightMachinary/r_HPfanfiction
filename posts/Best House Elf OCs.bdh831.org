** I remember reading a fic where house elves are just a tiny physical body that lets them exert the smallest amount of their power on Earth but at the other end of their connection to Earth each of them is as powerful as a genie from Aladdin.

Two house elves fighting is a multiple galaxy destroying slug fest but from a wizards point of view they just stare at one another until one falls over.

** I liked all the House Elves in "A Black Comedy". The brief scene with Sully in Chapter 23 is one of my favorites.

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]] has some great House Elf characters, including Kreacher, who gets some quality character development. I liked the world building that the author did, and it's an interesting take on how the campaign for House Elf rights might have played out.

** Haven't written it yet but the other day I was talking to my wife about the instagram granny Batty Winky and she told me that sounded like a house elf name and now I have a character in my head who's like the wizard equivalent of an instagram pet and her owner is a little pureblood girl who thinks it's all a big joke to act like she's an active fashion influencer.
