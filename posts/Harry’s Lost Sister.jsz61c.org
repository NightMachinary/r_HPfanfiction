:END:
I'm looking for a Post-canon fic where Harry finds out he has a half sister he never knew about. He also finds out his son, Albus, is gay and has a less than stellar reaction to it. I think drugs might have been involved in the story.


** Sorry, I can offer just Harry's sister during the war in “Reign O'er Me by cts” linksiye(3555).

#+begin_quote
  A sixth year fic that explores what might happen if Harry moves past the angst and starts to put his life together and has a few things break his way for a change.
