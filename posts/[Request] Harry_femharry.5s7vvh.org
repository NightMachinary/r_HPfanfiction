** You might enjoy the inverted version, where fem!Harry (of a sort) visits canon Harry to assist and improve the Chosen one's chances for winning. If so, try linkffn(Holly Polter by wordhammer). It's incomplete, but I know for a fact that the author is working hard on the next few chapters.

#+begin_quote
  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

  Harry Potter has Issues. That goes without saying, of course, but when he finds himself in another world facing someone he has a lot in common with... maybe he will find a way to make peace with himself. HarryGirl!Harry with a few twists.
