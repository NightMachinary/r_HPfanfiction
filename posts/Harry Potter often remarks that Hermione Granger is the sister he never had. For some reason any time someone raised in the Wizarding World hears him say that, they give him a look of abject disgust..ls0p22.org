** Everyone looked at Harry in disgust when he mentioned that Hermione was the Sister he never had. Except, oddly, the Carrows. Actual Death Eaters would hold normal conversations rather than attack them. "No no we're not like that, she's my sister!" Harry defended.

"You don't need to play like that with us Potter, we used that line in Public all the time when we were at Hogwarts too. We'll tell the Dark Lord that Goyle was the one who sent the alarm and was making things up, go have fun with your sister" laughed Amycus.

**** Story time: when I was in college, my school's Harry Potter club had unofficial sub-clubs for the Death Eaters and Order. Neither sub-club really did anything beyond an initiation ritual and an extra meeting tlwhere we just hung out every week. I, being an edgy 18-year-old, joined the Death Eaters. At the first meeting I went to, a masked and hooded girl calling herself Alecto asked if I wanted to be her brother. I agreed because why not?

3 years later we were married.

Behind him, Harry heard Ginny laughing and he turned red. "So you never--"

"God no!" Ginny cried. "We're poor, not degenerates."

Harry looked back at her, trying to return her grin with a shaky smile of his own. He'd begun to wonder what it might be like to date Ginny, to have her in his arms and kiss her, to do things he'd only admit to in his dreams; now, however, he decided that family was probably more trouble than it'd be worth.

Also, it's pretty much confirmed with the cloak that the Potters are an old line that the Peverall family branched into. These are just notes taken from actual canon and Pottermore, more so than fanon too, and not to mention the gold in Harry's vault (though that could be from Sleakeazy royalties).
