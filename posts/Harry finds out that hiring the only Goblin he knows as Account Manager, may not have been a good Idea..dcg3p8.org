Thats a thing that happens very often in bad fanfics, where Harry just hires the first Goblin who shows him his Vault as account manager and puts him in charge of investing the money, and it always results in Harry quickly becoming even richer, occasionally they try to justify it by saying that Harry is paying him dependent on his profits so hes motivated to succeed, as if that removes the problems.

This Prompt is basically about the many ways this could and should backfire, like maybe the Goblin is horribly unqualified and is actually just the janitor who was simply assigned to show this kid his vault, or maybe the Goblin just decides to fuck him over by investing all the Gold into a family business.

** "Run it by me one more time, Griphook, if you would."

"Account Manager Griphook, Lord Potter," said the goblin, testily.

Harry nodded politely, not wanting to anger his newly minted Account Manager. "Of course, my apologies."

"Yes, well," Griphook muttered as he walked across the office to what appeared to be a large chalkboard. The goblin drew a large 'P' at the center, and turned to his client.

"The plan is simple, Lord Potter," said Griphook. "You purchase a share in a successful business, and then recruit three other wizards to sell shares in that business."

"I got that part, Grip--" replied Harry, only to see the glare coming from the goblin. "...er, I got that part, Account Manager Griphook."

"Good," said the goblin, with a satisfied nod. "Do you understand the next step, then?"

"I think so," said Harry. "There would be three wizards under me, right?"

Griphook nodded, and drew the letter 'W' three times underneath the 'P'.

"Alright," continue Harry. "Then, each of those wizards recruits three wizards of their own?"

"Yes!" Griphook gave a toothy grin as he drew in additional wizards at the base of the chalkboard. "And each wizard contributes their profits to the company, which is you."

"Uh huh," said Harry. "How is this not a pyramid scheme?"

"What nonsense is that?"

Harry shrugged. "All I'm doing is talking people into talking other people into selling something. It's a scam."

"This is nothing like a pyramid scheme, Lord Potter, I assure you!" Griphook's voice was beginning to raise as his anger came to the fore.

Rising, Harry took the piece of chalk from the hand of his soon to be former Account Manager. Then he drew a pyramid around the diagram. Griphook stared at the board for a full minute, before he vanished the writing entirely.

"If you will excuse me, Lord Potter," he said quietly. "I need to speak with Ragnok." Without looking at his client, Griphook stormed off. Perhaps it was not too late.

/With apologies to Michael Scott./

  "I can tell you're a cautious investor," Griphook said to his new client, none other than Harry Potter. "That's why I recommend putting your money into a safe bet blue chip stock. In fact, I've already taken the liberty of putting a large portion of your gold into a company called Enron."

  "I'm not sure about buying shares in companies, Griphook," Harry said. "They seem too risky. Isn't there a safer option?"

  "Of course," Griphook said. "I'll tell you what, I'll put your money into real estate. There's no safer investment than the American property market."

  "Griphook," Harry said respectfully, "my trustworthy account manager, promoted from a lowly position driving carts to an investment analyst handling my billions of galleons. Tell me, how fares my fortune?"

  Griphook rubbed his hands together. "You're going to like this one. I looked into the Muggle technology market, just like you told me to, and I've found the perfect product to invest in. It's streets ahead of the rival technology... I'm so sure, I've invested your entire portfolio into this one technology."

  "Well?" Harry asked, "what is it?"

  "Betamax."

  "An excellent choice, sir."

  Harry nodded. "Now, I'll need something big to make a statement... announce myself in the market, you know? Do you have any ideas?"

  "How about this?" Griphook said. He pulled out a brochure. "It's called the World Trade Centre."

  "I am sorry, could you repeat that?" Harry must have misheard him.

  "I used the majority of your gold to place a bet on Bulgaria winning during the final of the Quidditch World Cup " Griphook said with a grin on his face, which Harry couldn't help but find nasty.

  "Don't worry, the Bulgarian Seeker is significantly better than the Irish one, the odds of him not catching the Snitch may as well be non existent, just one week and both of use will be swimming in Gold" Griphook joyfully assured him.

  Despite his confident tone, Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He brushed it of as excitement, nobody knows better than him, that a better Seeker guarantees a win.
