I read a fanfic once of harry getting switched with another harry from an alternate universe

the harry there was a total git and he has a sister so when the canon harry gets teleported there he starts building a good relationship with his sister. hermione was a ravenclaw and hates harry because (that harry was a total git) so he starts mending his relationship with her and all that i found the whole idea of this story good.the story shows the perspective of both the git harry and the canon harry in both universes

too bad that story got discontinued sad really i really liked the idea

do you guys know any stories with the same idea...


** I recently read Devil's White Knight on Ao3 it's about Harry kind of being sent to a parallel universe where his family is alive, he has a sister but his other self is basically a git, so he has to prove that he is a better person and rebuild his relationship with his friends and family (including a ravenclaw Hermione who sees him as a rival). It was pretty good but I must warn you the story it's Drarry and contains a lot of slash pairings.

(Sorry I've been here for years and still don't know how to link)
