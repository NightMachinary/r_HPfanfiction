A school full of teenagers needs someone to teach sex ed. Who loses the bet and has to teach? McGonagall? Snape? Dumbledore? Lockhart?Moody? Hagrid could bring animals in heat for live demonstrations. There's a whole lot of potential here.

Edited to add: OK, it seems like Snape regularly draws the short straw, looking at the fanfics out there. Moody, Lockhart, and Hagrid still need to take their turns.


** Dark Anatomy lesson took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without numerous graphic diagrams floating around the walls.

Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name. “Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new --- celebrity.”

Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.

“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of reproduction,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word --- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “Despite what many of you may expect, foolish wand-waving is not tolerated here. I don't expect many of you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering smells, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to stir cauldrons, insert ingredients, even create life --- if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”

More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.

“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I placed a male gamete into an ovum?” A male gamete into a what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air. “I don't know, sir,” said Harry.

Snape's lips curled into a sneer. "Tut, tut --- fame clearly isn't everything.” He ignored Hermione's hand.

“Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me the Gräfenberg spot?”

Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a Gräfenberg spot was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.

“I don't know, sir.”

“Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?”

Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Tricks To Cauldron Stirring?

Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand. “What is the difference, Potter, between urethra and the introitus?”

At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.

“I don't know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?” A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. “Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “And a point from Gryffindor for your cheek.”

Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Dark Anatomy lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to practice in turns, after writing instructions on the blackboard. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them attempt to, among other things, add snake skin to a banana, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like.

He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had garbed his elongated fruit when clouds of sweet smelling white glomp filled the dungeon. Seamus had somehow managed to explode Neville's banana into a twisted blob, and it gooey remains were thrown all around the class room. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on the other side of the room in disgust while Neville, who had been drenched in the juices when the banana exploded, moaned in horror as he saw what Seamus had done to his banana.

“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the fruit goo away with one wave of his wand. “I suppose you were a bit too excited, eh?”

“Take him up to the psychology wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.

“You --- Potter --- why didn't you tell him to slow down? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor.” This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.

“Don't push it,” he muttered, “I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.”

As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week --- why did Snape hate him so much?

“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”

*** That was beautiful, thanks. Nice touch with the banana. And if Hogwarts sex ed is like this, I think you've solved the mystery of why the wizarding population is so low.

** Why do you think Binns is on staff? No one else wants to do it, and Binns can make sex as boring as bran flakes.

** There are a few "Snape teaches sex-ed" fics out there. (For example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/439510/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-SexEd-Snafu][this one]] was uncomfortable to read because of Snape's typical Snapeness shaping his handling of the situation, but it also gave me a few chuckles.)

There was also a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2o6ox3/wp_snape_is_forced_to_teach_sexed_at_hogwarts/?depth=15][prompt]] with some great fills on [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] four years ago.

** linkffn(4106403) is an outtake from linkffn(3912184) and both stories are certainly worthy of reading (although the latter is substantially longer).
