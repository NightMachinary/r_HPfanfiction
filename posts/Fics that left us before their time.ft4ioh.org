What fics do you have that finish right before/when they start to escalate/get good? Be it on an actual cliffhanger or just mid-way through the building tension, whatever works. Just a fic than finished before you'd've wanted it to.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** Boy Who Lived

Subversion (please please please update)

The Phoenix and the Serpent

***** I'll have to take your word for that for now, but they do look good enough that I'm sure I'll agree with you by the end of them. Phoenix and the Serpent's first chapter particularly appeals. Thanks for the recs!

** Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, which left us just before things would heat up, as it was in the middle of the Tri-wizard Tournament and Harry was really getting into the very dark, fucked up stuff, like sacrificial magic and inferi creation.

+ Even though it's seemingly not the case, there's still the possibility that Calypso actually changed something in his mind (when he dropped all of his mental shields so that she could briefly make him believe he's actually 17, not 14, and can therefore walk past the age line because he took a ageing potion and he BELIEVES that he's the right age) and it will come up later.

I'm so mad, really.

** Super old school with this one. The Power of Time. It's the origin of like half the tropes in Harry Potter fanfiction, everything from pre-school shopping spree, family vaults, spare wands, a huge multi-compartment trunk he can live in, moving out of the Dursley's and getting his own place after getting emancipated, etc. It was just getting good and into the big action that had been teased through the entire plot and the author just stopped writing it. It's a little cringe to read now, because it's like reading of a fic where the author just took every overused trope and crammed them all into one and only did a semi ok job of it. But it was the first to do most of those so back when it was being written is was kind of mind blowing. Author is Rosswrock or something like that.

Impressive that the fic was apparently published not only before the website, but also before the first Harry Potter book. And the internet. (I don't know if it's an error on my PC, but I see that fic as being published in 1970).

**** Yeah haha I think there's a few very very early ones that had some sort of glitch like that happen to them on FanFiction.Net. If I recall this one was started either just before or just after the 5th book was released. I wanna say after because I think a major catalyst for a lot of the stuff that happens early on in it was Sirus's death and Harry feeling manipulated by Dumbledore. Manipulative Dumbledore is another trope from this one. Not sure if it was the first to do it, but if it wasn't it was one of the first few since that all mostly started around the release of Order of the Phoenix... writing this has made me realize that I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for a very long time.

***** That's mildly hilarious.

Definitely part of a vastly popular trope, whether it was the progenitor of it or not. I can't even remember how many 'Sirius dies and Harry gets his act together' fics I've read.

And hey, just means you know what you like and you're consistent about it. :)
