Something I've been wondering over for a fic I may or may not ever get around to writing, is whether the golden trio would ever form if it wasn't Harry and Ron who saved Hermione from the troll. There are two scenario's I'm thinking of;

- the first is that [character] seeks out Hermione and is comforting her in the bathroom when the troll shows up, which they manage to defeat before harry, Ron and the teachers show up.

  - in this scenario, do you think that the fact that Harry and Ron showed up with the intent to help Hermione would be enough for their friendship to form and for Hermione to not blame Harry and Ron for upsetting her in the first place, or do you think she would snitch on them for being the reason she was there to almost get killed and have no interest in gaining their friendship?

- the second is that [character] seeks out Hermione and is able to comfort and cheer her up enough that they head back to dinner in time for Quirrell to yell about the troll.

  - this of course means she's never in danger and Harry and Ron are never given the opportunity to do something as significant as saving (or intending to save) her life.
  - Do you think Harry and Ron would apologize for upsetting Hermione and that it would be enough for them to become friends, or do you think that the chance of them becoming friends is effectively zero and that, from Harry and Ron's POV, Hermione becomes just another background character (i.e. like every other girl in their year)?


** They're not becoming friends without defeating the troll together either way. /They/ didn't like Hermione at all and Ron isn't apologizing. The person who comforts Hermione would have to be a ghost or a professor if we're keeping characterization the same.

Further divergence would be Harry falling off his broom causing him not to learn Nicolas Flamel's name. Keeping in line with Harry's canon characterization, he learns ways to keep himself from falling off his broom.

Canon can be derailed entirely by having TMR devour Ginny's soul as Harry only meets Myrtle because Hermione brews polyjuice. You can just as easily have Harry ask around about the girl who died the last time, but I prefer the former.

*** that's a good point, I guess they only really became friends because harry and ron started including hermione out of guilt for nearly getting her killed, and she was thankful for them saving her life, even if she was only in that situation because of them in the first place.

And you're absolutely right, the butterflies of hermione not being in the golden trio are pretty big, not just with events, but with character development too.

do you mean former? but yeah, ginny dying would certainly be a big change, one that I can't recall occurring much in fanfiction.

*** As I read the canon /Ron/ didn't like and verbal (?) bully her. Harry just didn't disagree. Doesn't make it better but also doesn't mean that /he/ doesn't like her.

In such a scenario I can see two outcomes:

Harry becomes a bully too because he doesn't want to lose his friend (probably most if not whole subconsciously) (besides the two general paths of bully victims)

Or Harry becomes friendly with her because he feels guilty (independent of a fallout or not with Ron over the issue)

**** Hold up, Ron absolutely did not bully Hermione. And Harry absolutely does dislike her. He makes it clear in his thoughts multiple times.

As for the bullying thing, yeah, no. If you are clearly annoyed by someone, and they are just not taking the hint and keep being a condescending little shit to you, it doesn't make you a bully if you hit them where it hurts so that they finally fuck off. Ron, after being annoyed with Hermione for a while, finally exploded. Hermione was being a little shit since before the Sorting, managing to wait until Halloween shows way more patience than I'd be capable of when I was eleven. Hell, I wouldn't have that patience now and I'm twenty.

**** Ron and Harry both find Hermione equally unlikeable before the troll incident. Neither of them bully her; they mostly try to avoid her, and consider it a blessing when she refuses to talk to them.

** It'd be interesting to see Neville be the one who saves her. He's a good candidate for it - he's terrified of it all but still willing to do what's right when he needs to. Even in first year he proved himself willing to stand up to Malfoy and his own housemates when he needed to.\\
He'd be lacking in ability to magically help, so maybe he rushes to her aid, a fumble later the trolls looming over him, which breaks Hermione out of her terror to save /him/. It'd leave them on decent grounds of equality, having essentially saved each other, and it'd form a bond between the two essentially pariahs of Gryffindor house. Maybe he'd develop his confidence a bit earlier and become his best self sooner.

It could develop into the dual duos of Gryffindor. Potter and Weasley, not the brightest but willing to charge into trouble and constantly finding themselves in it. And Longbottom and Granger, cautious and intelligent but driven to do the right thing anyway.

They both keep getting tangled up in the plots of Hogwarts, sometimes working together, sometimes competing to solve it first.

**** It's never explicitly mentioned, but Neville is written as a bit of a wallflower and it generally implies that he's a bit left out.

I don't remember the specific quote, but in book six Neville and Luna are one of the few DA members to join the fight against the Death Eaters in Hogwarts and I vaguely remember a passage describing them as the loneliest members who had felt their membership of the DA the strongest, thus still carrying their fake galleons even a year later. It's been a while since I've actually read the books though

** I would like to see a fic with that divergence point. Either scenario works to avoid Harry and Ron being friends with Hermione. They really don't like each other at all before that; without the troll incident I don't think they'd ever be more than acquaintances.

linkffn(12431454) is a collection of oneshots on this theme. I think it's a fun concept

*** I guess it would be pretty unique for hermione to not be friends with harry and ron, it feels like a lot of fics (or at least the ones where all 3 are in gyriffindor) stick to the canon series of events regardless of any and all changes the fic includes.

thanks for the rec, its pretty good, shame its only 3 chapters though.

** I reccomend checking out What's Her Name In Hufflepuff linkffn(13041698) (there is extra/omake content in the relevant spacebattles thread). In it, Kasey (the PoV character) actually ends up comforting Hermione in a girls' bathroom earlier in the year. In doing so Kasey makes it explicitly clear that they are friends. So, when it happens, Ron's "It's no wonder she hasn't got any friends!" line doesn't hit near as hard or near the mark. So Hermione goes to dinner as normal.

 

I don't wish to spoil any more of the fic but I will simply say this. In the canon book series, what little free time Hermione has, not spent jockeying to be the top student of the year is instead spent solving various mysteries and trying to keep their trio alive. Here, she does not have that distraction. Harry and Ron very much learn that, for all that she isn't the easiest to get along with, you very much do /not/ want a vindictive Hermione with actual free time on her hands on the opposite side of you.

*** That fic is great, it's actually what gave me the idea for the second scenario I suggested (the first scenario more or less occurs in 'The Doll Gamer' linkffn(13203887) but has harry and ron apologising to hermione and they all become friends still, although hermione seems to have stronger feelings for the SI who saved her.)

one thing that gets me though is that harry and ron are still somehow able to beat the traps and defeat quirrellmort, although maybe that's just me thinking too little of harry and rons abilities (the fact that hufflepuff gets screwed over like slytherin in canon may also have given me an irrational dislike of them though).

**** One thing to remember is that Harry and Ron go to stay with Sirius (and presumably some sort of minder [Remus] as it's unlikely he's in any state to host kids by himself immediately after leaving Azkaban. Plenty of time to ask questions and get knowledge. The Flamel revelation came from a chocolate frog card, Harry can outfly the keys, Quirrelmort takes care of the troll and the chess set seems to be made for Ron. Since it seems that they are (or at least Harry is) something like actually friends with Neville here (for now as he tries his best to balance on that tightrope) having more Herbology knowledge offhand isn't unreasonable. And indeed, as "ways to attack a plant" go burning that motherfucker seems pretty instinctual no matter the exact species. The only /real/ problem is Snape's trap. And while Ron may not be familiar with logic puzzles and Riddles of that nature (heh), Harry himself isn't dumb. Especially given he's been forced to apply himself more than in canon. It might take longer than in canon, but the tragedy of this isn't that there is a time limit but the exact opposite. The Mirror of Erised was working as intended and Harry showing up nearly ruined everything.

 

I will say though that reading the final House points scene, I couldn't help but feel genuine anger at what had taken place. There ought to be a Hufflepuff boycott when the same thing happens next year (because you /know/ it will, even if Kasey manages to safely store the diary with no one being possesed.)

****** I did find it funny that with spells that got taught in SPELL Club, they could also fairly easily best the gauntlet. Including /three/ different ways to beat Snape's trap other than beating the riddle [one of which may have inadvertently been pointed out to Snape forcing him to hurriedly fix the loophole] and Daphne's contribution which would let you know if the bauble in the mirror was /actually/ the Philosopher's Stone or just a hunk of rock
