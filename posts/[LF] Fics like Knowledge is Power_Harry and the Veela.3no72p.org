#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

** Shameless self-advert [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557311/1/The-Magnate][The Magnate]], if you want a fic about Harry going to Durmstrang. Haven't read Harry and the Veela yet, but the story does end up being H/F.

Eventually.

  Voldemort's mastery of dark power was unrivaled in history. Grindelwald's legendary charisma came a hairsbreadth from bringing Europe to its knees. "Very good. Next! And what will you be singing for us today, Mr. Potter?" AU, Durmstrang!Harry
