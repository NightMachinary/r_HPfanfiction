I love this community, I have been reading fanfiction for as long as I can remember. Many great stories and posts on this very sub have inspired me. I have an idea, i think it's pretty cool, but I am having a hard time opening the damn thing.Ii have parts already written, I have ideas and long text dumps about time lines in cannon, it's literally just this opener. So please Hpfanfiction your my only hope. Without giving to much away, the story is suppose to start in New York in the 80s, specifically Harlem at night. I guess I'm just hoping for some magic? Any way, thank you for putting up with a late night rant. Cheers.

Edit: thank you all so much, a lot of this is really good. FloreatCastellum you have no idea how dead on you were with a few of those details

Edit 2: I suppose a little detail isn't the worst thing, it would be a good chance to see if it holds any water after all. Okay so to set the mood, it's the late 1979, and the war with Voldemort is getting worse. In an act of desperation Albus Dumbledore sends an envoy to the U.S to request help from American wizards, he sends Sirius Black. While there Sirius does his thing, and in the process impregnates a witch. He has no idea once he departs to continue the fight in England having gathered a few fighters. The witch has his baby and names him in line with the Blacks, hoping he will come back after the war. She dies during childbirth and Baby Aries, finds himself alone. Fast forward a few years and Aries is a no good street rat. The story actually starts on him waiting to be picked up for a crime. Mostly because of his odd and "unique" power. After that he gets a letter from gringotts telling him of an inheritance, and it portkeys him. Now in the UK he must use his street smarts and guile to bring House Black to glory once more while battling his inner demons, and a dark wizard from the past.

Well there you have it, a not so quick run down. Any feed back would be cool, and I'll be happy to answer any questions. Thanks again Hpfanfiction.


** It can be tempting to open with dialogue, but the most effective openers involve description & setting the scene - but something must be happening. Think about the tone of your story and establish interest early on. I think a good example is the opening of HBP.

So, you might want to open with a character walking through Harlem at night, or maybe waiting to meet someone? It's a good way to establish the description of the main character without them having to do something trite like looking in a mirror. So (bearing in mind I have no idea what Harlem looks like now, let alone the 80s) you might say something like 'The towering buildings loomed over the darkened streets. Under a flickering street light, a brooding young man smoked a cigarette, lounging against a wall but still glancing suspiciously with cold grey eyes.'

** It might help to think about this sideways---what /purpose/ do you want Harlem to serve here, especially since it sounds like the UK is where most of the story will take place?

From what I can tell it sounds like you want it as contrast---here's how my protagonist grew up, as opposed to your average rich British wizard. So build your Harlem as a foil to him. How has it shaped him? What has it prepared him for that his friends in England couldn't possibly understand? And what will /he/ not understand about Wizarding Britain?

You can probably show us how it shaped him in one scene---we don't even need to see Sirius, or know he's a Black. We just need to see a pickpocket with a knack for finding different trouble than the other pickpockets. Every time he behaves differently from a wizard with a different pedigree we'll notice, and it'll build his character up as an individual.

** First- I think this is an intriguing question, so I have no idea why you were downvoted.

What you've given us is a bit vague, so the advice is equally generalized.

The opening is meant to capture the reader's attention. It establishes the starting situation for at least one of the main focus characters. It also can be used to identify major themes in the story. For that reason alone, it's best to start with a scene that fits with where you're taking a story. If the opener is a high-tension moody action sequence, people will expect more of the same and be a bit put out if the next few chapters is ho-hum exposition and sitting in classrooms being passingly funny.

Hope that helps. If you need more specific help, you'll need to be more specific about your concerns.

** Here are my two tips for the start of stories.

- Read the first chapter of the books you love the most, and see what they do to introduce characters. Then, do the same thing.
- Write chapter 2 or 3 first. Start writing after the beginning of your story, imagining the main character's been introduced in a prior chapter. Then, see what context you need for what you've written, and craft a first chapter to deliver that.

I'd also recommend reading (if you haven't already) /The Thief/ by Meghan Whalen Turner, /The Demon King/ by Cinda Williams Chima, and /Sandry's Book/ by Tamora Pierce, which deliver my three favorite street-rat characters in fiction.

Verrrry excited about your idea. Good luck writing! PM me when it's out if you can :)

** In the background, you should have Bruce Willis wearing the 'i hate niggers' sign from Die Hard. Just as an irrelevant world-building aside, that then doesn't even impact the story.
