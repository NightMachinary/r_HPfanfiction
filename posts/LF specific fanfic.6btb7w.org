Trying to remember and find this one. Harry loses to Voldemort in a battle in northern Scotland in the first chapter or two. Then he disappears and lives as a muggle in big house in Scotland and becomes a drunk. Old men at town pub give him a soldier nickname like sergeant and keep him secret to protect him. His friends find him and sober him up to face Voldemort again. Final battle takes place in same place as first. Pretty sure the horcruxes were different. Any help?


** With a lot of skimming I actually found it. It was Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux by Full Penseive [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/Making_The_Last_Move/]]

** I vaguely remember a fic that involved harry tanning up with (I think muggle) war veterans. Idk if we're thinking of the same fic though.
