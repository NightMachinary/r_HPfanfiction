We do not see any male veelas in the books and, while female veelas can and do marry into other species, there's still the existence of pure-blooded veela to be accounted for. So my headcanon is that veelas (being all women) would normally mate with each other and would produce female children using some kind of veela magic. It would be very ironic that the most attractive females possibly in the whole magical world for the most have no interest in males whatsoever. Their alluring appearance, the object of fascination and obsession for almost all men in their presence, would be only a physical manifestation of their complete understanding and control of female sexuality as a species. For the few ones that marry outside their species, their partners may be female or male, with female being the "majority" choice; however, male children are only produced by mating with a male. Fleur's grandmother was actually frowned upon by older and more traditional veelas as "sexually deviant" for marrying a human, and a male no less. However, the younger generation, on the whole, has a more accepting attitude to inter-species and heterosexual relationships. It will certainly be interesting to explore a magical culture based on entirely one sex, which could also serve as an unusual background for an OC or an alternate version of a canon character. I wonder if Fleur ever visits her full-veela relatives? Then her relationship with Bill could become the subject of heated or amiable discussions, depending on the genre, as may her grandmother's marriage with a human male. I would really like to see an interpretation of the veelas as not the perfect sex dolls and veela blood as not just a way to make a character physically attractive.

Edit: another fast sinking post. There is obviously something wrong with me and my thoughts, I know. I'll just quit posting for good.

Edit 2: Thank you for all your kind and encouraging words! I guess one shouldn't give up so soon after all.

Edit 3: Is there a way to change the flair? I think one of the comments is right about this should be a discussion post.


** Veelas lay eggs while in bird form. Bird forms can be both male and female, (though usually female), kinda like some depictions of dragons and dinosaurs. The human form is always the same gender.

There, more thoughts.

Cheers,

*** That actually makes sense and sounds magical! I'll admit that male mating bird form veela would cause a little problem but there could always be a kind of ancient ritual specifically designed to transform a veela's reproductive power into her human form, and after this, she may not be able to employ her bird form so freely although she would still become bird-like when she's angry or upset. A sort of little-mermaid transformation if you'd like. It will mean a great sacrifice on the part of the veela and I am sure there could be a lot of drama and tension surrounding this. For example: what if a veela transformed herself for a man's sake and he abandoned her afterward? Or what if a veela who does not want to transform herself ends up doing the ritual to save her marriage? The ritual itself may be illegal for some time and improper performance by back-alley warlocks may cause more than one veela deaths and permanent injuries.

** Nothing wrong with your thoughts! This is a fascinating idea. I've always thought there was more to Fleur when she was introduced and her reaction to Bill's injury sealed it for me. Veela are not vapid, they embody a lot of strength. It's a shame she wasn't used more. Maybe people are just too hung up on shipping fics.

*** Thank you! Yes, the more I think about them the more I am fascinated. There is a power in their beauty that makes them not the helpless object of the male gaze but the mistress of it. It's a shame that Fleur is predominantly remembered as a pretty French. I wonder if part of the reason she was Beauxbatons' champion is that the inherited veela power enhanced her magic in a way that made her an unusually powerful witch for her age. I remember she managed to lull the dragon to sleep in the first task and that may have to do with the "power of the heart" that veelas seem to have.

Aww, you got some upvotes on this one. You just gotta keep posting. Some will get 20-30 votes, sometimes you'll post something that gets downvoted, but every once in a while you'll post something that goes to the moon! That's my experience.

In fact, don't even worry about upvotes, just share your thoughts with us and have fun.
