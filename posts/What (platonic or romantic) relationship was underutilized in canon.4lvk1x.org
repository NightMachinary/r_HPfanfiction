Example: The Harry and Remus mentorship could have been expanded upon in the later books, especially after Sirius died, but it never really got much airtime.


** Probably because Lupin never really stepped up to help Harry.

*** Do the books indicate that he was close even with Sirius post-/PoA/?

I mean, I guess that I (and others?) idealize his relationship with, basically everyone. But with Harry, he was absent during childhood, chose to maintain a teacher/student relationship with him in /PoA/ and was almost completely absent until /DH/. Even then, he tried to join up with Harry & Co. to get away from his familial responsibilities (suicide by Death Eater?) and then inexplicably made Harry Teddy's godfather.

The only person he seems close to at all is Tonks and 1) she wouldn't take no for an answer and 2) he tried to abandon her anyway.

**** Remus is a difficult character for a children's book. Either he's a coward/ broken man, or he's just busy pretty much.

***** I still like Lupin...but like him much less than I did when I read the books as a kid/teen. Probably because I see more of his faults now than I did as a youngster.

For me, Lupin's main problem is that he's both weak /and/ self-loathing. He's shown over and over in flashbacks for instance as being kind - but unwilling to stand up for the right thing (therefore becoming totally useless and just letting the bullies have their way). I POA, he again is cowardly/ashamed at not only being outed as a werewolf, but the whole dealing with Sirius and past slipups - he never fully comes clean and leaves embarrassed and ashamed.

He comes off as being an aloof friend to Harry and co as well and it is his self-loathing and weakness of character that make him behave the way he does early on in book 7. I wish we could have seen more of him and how he gets over his problems on screen - but that sort of thing seems a bit much for a kids series.

Lupin's an interesting character to me - he's at once courageous in physicality, but cowardly in mentality. He's kind, but aloof. He's strong but he's broken.

In that way, he reminds me of Snape - two characters with conflicting personality traits/ and emotions...though Lupin is still the lighter version.

** Basically all of them. Harry Potter as a text is a plot driven work, rather then character driven. You need look no further than the Prophecy. The arc of the books is the discovery of the prophecy though to it's resolution. What I think that means is that everything in the book is slave this plot line. There is rarely a time in the books when characters interact with one another and it doesn't also serve in pushing us closer to the resolution of the prophecy. What would Remus and Harry getting to know each other better do for the plot, how would it get the Trio out camping for book 7? Organic character interplay just isn't a focus of JK's style and nor should it be.

Add to all JK choosing to write from Limited Third Person!

I Do think Harry and Ginny are the obvious choice. Some clues as to their compatibility are present but it did come out of left field a bit.

Harry and Neville probably should have got a WHOLE lot more time too.

** I would have loved to have seen more of the relationship between Xenophilius and Luna, as well as Xenophilius' relationship with Arthur and Molly - I love the idea of Ginny going off to play with Luna, but I'd have been really interested to know what Arthur and Molly were like with Xeno.

Presumably they knew Pandora before she died, and I'd like to see how they'd talk with Xenophilius after her death versus before.

** Luna and Ron.

I don't ship it or anything, but I reread the 5th book recently keeping my eyes out for their interactions, and was surprised by how interesting of a pair JKR wrote them as. Unfortunately it never developed into a friendship or even relationship, as the 5th book seemed to be foreshadowing. There could have been so many more moments with them but I guess it wasn't right for Ron's story.

** Hermione's parents. Outside of them being loving parents there is absolutely nothing there. Having them stay at Grimmauld during OOTP due to safety concerns and the resulting interactions could have been pretty interesting.

But alas. They're just muggles so they don't really rate more than 2 sentences per book.

** Twins-Lee Jordan Lee Jordan-McGonagall

I see Lee Jordan as sort of an apparently less talented hanger-on of the Twins whose real value is his ability to get things and get them out of trouble. --And working backwards, I see him as performing the same function that Pettigrew probably did. That the Twins didn't have to protect a single individual meant that the whole of Griffindor (and eventually the whole school) filled the Lupin spot.
