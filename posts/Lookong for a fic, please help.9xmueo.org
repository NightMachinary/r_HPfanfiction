Hey,

Looking for a fix where Harry gets sent back into time accidentally and is found by Merlin. He is adopted by him and he begins trying to find a way back to his time. He spends hundreds of years travelling with Merlin and details alot of history of them traveling England throughout the centuries as well as Harry building Hogwarts.

If anyone knows please let me know!!

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
