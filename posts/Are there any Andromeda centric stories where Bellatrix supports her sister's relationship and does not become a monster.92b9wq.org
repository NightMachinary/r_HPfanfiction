Instead of the usual "how dare you to sully the noble House of Black with a mudblood, you're no sister of mine, blood traitor" and so on, are there any stories where Bellatrix supports Andromeda's relationship with Edward? Be it as a wingman, as someone to cover with their parents ("we were out together mother, torturing mudbloods and hunting muggles" ), or through some other, preferably humours way?


** Linkffn(Wind Shear) has a bit where Andromeda, Bellatrix, and Ted go shopping for lingerie, I guess. Not exactly what you're looking for though.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
