**** In my stories I often assume that wizards went into hiding because all the Seers around the world realised that if 18th century princes could wage war with magic that destroyed Atlantis, the world would not survive, so the wizards went into hiding before someone reconstructed that kind of magic. Sort of like not wanting to hand out nukes to aeristocrats who have no idea about their consequences. That's why everyone agreed to go into hiding - no one outside Europe gave a damn about witch hunting in Europe.

*** It requires a bit of non-cannon thought, but I like the idea of ley lines and the idea that you could set up magical protections that draw power from them (or other ambient magic). That would mean that something set up 10,000 years ago would be fuckoff strong compared to something set up 100 years ago, since it's had 100 times longer to suck up magic to reinforce itself.

It migth still be modern artillery vs bow and arrow, but the bow can fire the arrow at 5 times the speed of sound. Sure the artillery has the advantage of not requiring line of sight, but it sure sucks to be you if you get hit by an arrow.

Although since some curses (like Sectumsempra) seem to require specific counter-curses to neutralise them, old curses could be effective just because of that, not because they are more powerful.

***** Very true,but also,when you say Hogwarts,I would argue that limits education due to the Ministry of Magic. Think of what people like Godric,Salzahar,Rowena or Helga were doing compared to what Albus was doing compared to what Snape/Voldemort was doing to what Harry was doing. As information institutions are made,knowledge is more easily accessible but due to societal confines and more importantly,legal limitations on learning and teaching,I think it could be argued that simply modern geniuses were not offered the same opportunities to flourish and innovate,and if they did,then yes,modern>ancient.

**** That's...you know how Isaac Newton said a thing about how 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants'?

People like Archimedes and Leonardo da Vinci were amazing inventors, but they were limited by the time period and level of civilisation they lived in. Most of our amazing scientific developments today rely on having computers, widespread communication, all kinds of machinery, which we need to study and refine, say, nanotechnology.

But, magical culture is not necessarily like that; that is to say, magical inventions, spells, potions, wards, and so forth, aren't necessarily limited by infrastructure. All a wizard/witch needs is a wand (and in some magical traditions, not even that) and the necessary know-how and they could potentially do anything. Hunt for food, enchant crops, build a house, charm a horse, create a flying carpet, split their soul and put part of it in a trinket to secure their immortality...

Basically, what I'm saying is, magical researchers and inventors aren't necessarily going to be limited by the world around them.

If they /need/ to be able to see something, or /need/ to manipulate something on a microscopic level, or even create something impossible by our physics, they can do it. With magic. They simply need the willpower and the right incantation to do so, and sometimes a flying carpet to go seek out magical ingredients with.

That means, in turn, that an ancient magician from the far distant Ancient Egyptian or Ancient Greek or Ancient Whatever times, can potentially craft just as efficient and powerful spells, wards, and artifacts as any modern day witch or wizard; they're on a level playing field as far as their means of viewing and manipulating the world around them goes, so superiority goes to whomever is the cleverest.

****** This^

To be more explicit, and because I think it needs emphasising more, the "Standing on the shoulders of giants" quote /never/ meant having better technology, but having the corpus of your predecessor's /knowledge/ to build on. As Starfox says, it means not having to waste your time reinventing techniques to deal with the same problems, but being able to tackle new ones with the skills that you've been taught by the people who last pushed the frontier of knowledge further. Better technology to tackle problems is a side effect of this, not the actual meaning.

And there are plenty of areas of modern research, mainly in pure mathematics and theoretical physics where experiments and simulations aren't used, that demonstrate this. For example Fermat's Last Theorem.

You know, the one that was famously proven single-handedly by Andrew Wiles?

Except it wasn't.

What Wiles proved was a conjecture first stated in the 1950s about Elliptic curves and modular forms (both things developed after Fermat), generally known as the Taniyama--Shimura--Weil conjecture. It had been shown in 1984 by Frey that a counter example to the Taniyama--Shimura--Weil conjecture could be constructed if Fermat's Last Theorem was false. Thus, by proving Taniyama--Shimura--Weil, Wiles showed there could be no counter example, and thus proved Fermat.

So Wiles proved Fermat 'alone', but could only do so because all of the previous work that had been done in the previous 300-odd years to develop the new languages of Elliptic Curves and Modular forms (without them, the proof would never have existed) and to link them up to Fermat. And that's just one example- mathematics relies on using things developed by others. Things like the Riemann hypothesis are being studied with tools developed only 50 years ago. Ramanujan was a genius, people were angry and upset that he had to 'waste' his time reinventing maths instead of tackling new problems, problems he never got a chance to solve because of how young he died.

***** Well the Brooms are actually the reason I thought of my argument. I understand Carpets used to be the dominant form of transportation but how are innovations still happening? By all sources,the magicians of old were more powerful than the modern ones,but potions are still discovered,transfiguration is still explored, etc. etc. I believe that what really happened is a lot of this stuff was made before, (ie Wolfsbane and fast brooms) but the knowledge got lost,so they are essentially re-inventing the wheel again.

Their entire race just disappeared in a single moment leaving everything behind. Nobody really knows what caused it. It could have been a racial-wide ascension, they may have been eradicated by a ritual, anything really.

Imagine if that happened in past of the wizarding world. Every wizard just disappeared off the face of the earth one day. Only squibs and non-magicals were left. Squibs of course eventually had magic children and passed on what they knew but obviously there would be much lost.

** For my AU, I'm working out a... series of unfortunate events (lol), a series of disasters over the last couple thousand years, that coupled with some other stuff, resulted in population crashes (so knowledge was lost because the only people who knew it died, their records were lost or destroyed or the method to read them was lost (magical key, language, etc.)), and outright destruction of centers of magic.

Conveniently, the same are also the cause of the ancestral forms of the pureblood and anti-mundane/anti-mundane-born ideologies.

Basically, I'm cribbing from real-world collapses of civilization, as well as how various virulent comparable ideologies came to be and evolved over the millenia.

At the same time, there are modern developments - basically, ancient Arithmancy was number-based divination (which included what we would now call basic probability theory - the ancient magicals hoarded even their mundane knowledge (not that mathematics is not magical :) )). Divination here being not just future-prediction, but including all magics used to gain information, whether about the past, present, or future (and presumably timeless stuff - a spell that takes two numbers and returns their sum would presumably also fall into this category).

In the somewhat less prejudiced period around the end of the Renaissance - right before the panic that led to the SoS, various Enlightenment ideas did creep over. Critically, the magicals had Newton/Leibniz and their Calculus, as well as evidence that ancient mysteries of nature could be explicated through mathematics. This led to a magical revolution, of sorts.

Modern Arithmancy is lumped with the ancient, not really related beyond being also math, forms. The Hogwarts Arithmancy course starts out with a survey of the ancient stuff, mainly to ensure that all students are on level with the maths. Years Four through Seven begin with calculus and go on from there. The course is mishmash of maths, physics (at least Newtonian), and what magical theory there is. Really should be at least three different courses, but due to modern anti-mundane sentiment, the course is... frowned upon, but is permitted to remain because modern Arithmancy is too damn useful.

Due to the nature of magicals, especially post-SoS, the advancements of magical physics are limited. There are very few as a proportion of the mundane population who go into math or the mathematical sciences, and the magicals are so few that they have too few in each generation who go into these fields to maintain the university, the peer-review, or anything like that. As such, much theory is at best conjecture that someone might have tried once, and there is very little decent combobulation, especially since magicals like to hoard knowledge they discover. A great Arithmancer is more likely to pass on his secrets to his children, which means a pile of notes moldering in the family vault, aside from whatever spells and stuff he added to the family library.

**** Quite possibly.

The plot-important one is that some person, group, or cult came up with some kind of biology-copy ritual, for example creating the Centaurs by casting it on humans using horses, and Goblins by casting it on humans using... I don't know.

At some point they screw up and cast the ritual on an empty circle with [I haven't decided] as the source, and create either an extinct/sealed away/dormant plague that only kills magicals (or literally is the black death (in which case I'm going with sealed evil in a can, because otherwise the timeline does not work out)), or Dementors.

Epidemic because some random virus or bacteria ended up being the target, or Dementor because they are void/death. Maybe have a Thestral be the source, and their connection to this is why they are reviled. Or maybe they were from ordinary horses using Dementors as the source...

The ensuing everybody dies causes massive prejudice against the varieties of Homo sapiens created by this ritual (We know at least Goblins are fertile with baseline humans, (so it is plausible that the entire set of changes are applied only by magic acting on the biology, which implies that perhaps a child of one of these who is a Squib (or a true muggle born of Squibs) or raised in an anti-magical field might be a 'normal' human)).

So the ritual was forgotten, probably on purpose. It also requires human sacrifice, so yeah.

** In Quiddich Through the Ages, it talks a bit about how the first brooms had no cushioning charms and couldn't turn very well (if at all); I remember them explicitly stating that better cushioning charms had been developed. There's also a mention of an "Experimental Charms Division" in GoF (I think in the Quiddich World Cup section). So, magic definitely has been developing. On the other hand, Hogwarts is nearly a thousand years old and it's still holding strong, and there's all sorts of crazy ancient artifacts (like the Hallows for example) that nobody seems to have been able to recreate. So it's kinda hard to tell which is better.

** I've always wondered if magic wasn't more powerful back then, just less controlled. If you threw a curse at somebody, you just knew you were cursing them to pain and suffering. You might have had some influence into what the curse ends up as, but cursing one farmer to be sterile might have spread to the farmer's crops as well. Or breaking a man's bone might give him brittle bones for life. Summoning water ends up as a flood.

That gives me an idea, though: Magic, by nature, might resist having order imposed on it by way of a spell. It would require focus and mental discipline to cast a spell. Modern magic is much more controlled and much more efficient /to/ control. Ancient magic, like egyptian, is easier to cast and maintain but much less controlled. Useful for a teenage Harry to use in the Triwizard Tournament, but with high chance of collateral damage to the bystanders.

In this case ancient magic is more powerful but takes longer in the form of rituals or chants compared to the versatility and speed at which a staff and more recently a wand offers when calling upon the power internally.

*** My favorite non-apocalyptic ritual thus far was in (don't remember the fic), One must kill their true love and sacrifice their ability to rationally reason about a certain topic (generally causing the performer to obsess on the topic), and gains immense power in return.

Voldemort murdered Myrtle & sacrificed his ability to reason about Purebloodism (he becomes singlemindedly focused on murdering all muggles and those of 'impure blood').

Dumbledore killed Grindlewald (I might be remembering incorrectly, and it merely requires killing one you love, and he killed Arianna to gain the power to defeat Grindlewald) and sacrificed his ability to reason about stopping all Dark Lords by any means necessary (which ironically leads to him taking the actions that create Lord Voldemort and make Harry go very dark Grey).
