** "I came to a very important realization today," I said. "It doesn't matter what color the Great Hall is during the Leaving Feast or who gets bragging rights for the next year. What matters is that I am the one who decides."

^--- I'm not far in the story yet, but that part and

"Look, Ginevra, we have to talk about this" -- I waved my hand vaguely -- "following us thing. I didn't say anything before because we were at your house, and you should be able to stalk whomever you like at your house. But this is my house."

"It's a school, Harry. It's nobody's house," Hermione said as she dug out her Transfiguration book, intent upon reading it for the third time before term.
