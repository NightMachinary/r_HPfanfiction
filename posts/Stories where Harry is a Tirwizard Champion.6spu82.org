I'm not quite sure what a Tirwizard Champion story would be (probably decent crack or "so bad it's good" fanfiction) but I know I want to read one.


** linkffn(11826429) has just that.

From Old Irish tír, from Proto-Celtic *tīros, from Proto-Indo-European *ters- (“dry”), i.e. "dry land" as opposed to lake or sea.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

*** *Tir (god)*

Tir or Tiur (Armenian: Տիր) was the god of written language, schooling, rhetoric, wisdom, and the arts worshiped in ancient Armenia.

He was the son of Hayk and considered to be the chief god Aramazd's messenger, fortune teller and the one who explained dreams, and who recorded the good and bad deeds of the men and the one who guided souls to the under world. He spent one month of the year documenting the birthdays and deaths of people in his journal, the other 11 months were spent on gifting power to writers, poets, musicians, sculptors, and architects.

Tir's temple was located near Artashat.

** Hmm...perhaps submit this request again, and add (That's not a typo) in the title?

I'm pretty sure everyone's assuming that you made a typo, see. Maybe emphasis it, 'Stories where Harry is a TIRwizard Champion (that ain't a typo!)'. And add the Request flair.
