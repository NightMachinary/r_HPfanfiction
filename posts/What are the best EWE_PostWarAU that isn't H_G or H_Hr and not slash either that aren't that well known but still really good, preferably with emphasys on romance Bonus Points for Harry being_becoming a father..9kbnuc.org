I've read dozens and dozens, a few of my favorites would be Days to Come, GYWM, all of Dorothea Greengrasse's work, all of Jacob Apple's work aswell, A Fateful Walk, and whole bunch of others.

I'm looking for those that slip the radar.

Thanks.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
