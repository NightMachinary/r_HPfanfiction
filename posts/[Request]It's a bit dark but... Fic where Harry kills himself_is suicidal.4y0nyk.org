** Glimpses of Battle on A03 has Harry with severe PTSD, an addiction, and suicidal. It has some SPaG issues at times and is slow at updating but is a pretty addictive fic. I'd link you but I'm on mobile.

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath.

** Umm... so these are an assortment of some of my favorite stories that are tragic and heartwrenching, and deal with themes such as suicide, mental illness, trauma, and recovery. I hope they give you feelings of comfort and connection with the characters like they have for me.

An Aunts Love: linkffn(2196609) - a total classic (and unfinished! ahh... but there's so much there to love) Harry goes into a deep depression after year four and Petunia throws him in a mental clinic where he can get the treatment he needs. A great, sensitive, depictiction of recovery, and integrates lots of fun magical elements, and LV, RL, and HG become fleshed out regulars.

Had I Known: linkffn(2544950) - adult Harry struggles with suicidal ideation after the war is over. Snape goes down the rabbit hole of memories to help find the core of the issue before it leads Harry's magical destruction. A great slow development of a HP and SS complex friendship in an isolated setting. Tearjerker. Complete.

Stages of Hope: linkffn(6892925) - You've heard of this one, yes? Harry might not be suicidal, but I felt for him anyways. Complete.

Signal to Noise: linkffn(3690537) - Abused and depressed HP begins to decline in health and inflict self harm. RL, HG, and SS get involved and enroll him in a psych clinic for recovery, particularly for an eating disorder. The storytelling here is heartwrenching, and very realistic for disordered thinking and recovery. All conveyed via first person perspective for the main characters which normally i don't like but here it works well. Complete.

When A Lionness Fights linkfnn(2162474): you've got to have heard of this one too-- it's a classic! Hermione takes it on herself to become a spy in LV's ranks, and when it becomes too much Snape helps her through addiction, depression and recovery. SS/HG. Complete. So tragic, so good. Love how HG must confront herself, SS, her friends, and ultimate LV in order to overcome and survive.

Never Alone Never Again: linkffn(750576)- Abused teenage Harry is rescued from the Dursleys and taken to recover with the Weasleys, but he continues to be played with insomnia and nightmares from LV. Things escalate, and it's tragic. READ IT. It's so good and it's done. SB and RL become regulars.

Ones that I can't remember well enough to summarize individually due to time but are on my favorites list. Give em a go: Reading the Signs: linkffn(3341876),Walk the Shadows: linkffn(3659281),Stronger than Hope: linkffn(3389525), Happy Days in Hell: linkffn(1252201),

  Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well.
