** Vernon was actually the director of Grunnings and quite wealthy.

And he and Petunia dont use insults, the mostly choose to ignore Harry's presence unless he gets a chore.

James and Sirius were actually smarter than Lupin and most likely smarter then Severus and Lily to.

Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott are both blood purists.

Dumbledore did not plan to sacrifice Harry indeed his plans included to increase Harry's chance of survival and his plan worked.

Dumbeldore didnt know about Voldemorts use of Horcuxes until second year.

Voldemorts doesn't frequently torture his followers, Harry who could look into his head for three year whenever Voldemort was angry only saw him do it three times for serious fuck ups.

Lily and Ginny dont have the same hair color, Lily has dark red hair and Ginny bright fiery red hair.

We have no reason to assume that muggle studies is out of date.

Canon only ever speaks of runes in terms of translating them.

The Order of Phoenix doesn't have a anti killing agenda, they even called Harry out for giving himself away by not killing a civilian under the imperius, right after he killed around three death eaters.

The unforgivable´s dont require intense emotions but rather the intent for them to do their jobs.

Harry survived the killing curse because his mothers protection lived on in Voldemorts blood and tethered him to life, not because he was a horcrux.

Umbride was not an incompetent witch, we see her use advanced magic like the cruciatus curse or the patronus charm.

Discrimination of muggle-borns is not publicly accepted. They even had a muggle-born minister.

The death eaters didnt discriminate against half-bloods.

We see no real sexism in the books, except boys being barred from girls rooms, but not the reverse.

Harry was embarrassed to be seen with Neville, until the start of Dumbledores Army. Its even mentioned at the beginning at next year that joining him in the ministry made him accept Neville and Luna.

Hermione dismisses muggle technology as substitute for magic instead of something magic should aim to emulate.

Aurors are not police, they are dark wizard catchers and body guards for high ranking officials. The closes thing to police would probably be the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol.

"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills." - from literally the first chapter of Philosopher's Stone. Admittedly, 'director' is an office that's remarkably easily handed out under the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989, but he's got a 9th floor office and apparently a free pass from HR for shouting at staff. (Assuming his age is within a few years of James and Lily, who didn't see their 22nd birthdays, he's made director of a manufacturing concern before he's properly in his thirties, or even out of his twenties. I smell nepotism.)

And there's actually plenty of evidence that the Durselys are, if not Old Money, at least living on reasonably-sized inheritances. Marge Dursley is of the kind of set that mixes with retired colonels and can afford to buy expensive presents for her nephew on what she makes breeding bulldogs. Vernon, meanwhile, was put through the kind of private school (since apparently 'public school' means something different to americans and other aliens) that can get away with an anachronistic uniform and issuing the kids with blunt instruments.

If Rita was just throwing around general insults like retard or whatever, then I could buy the "Hermione just happened to be female". Like she didn't even call her something more neutral like a whore or a prostitute, she called her a scarlet *woman*. Like using an extreme example, it's like calling a gay person a faggot. It's obviously specific to the person. At least that's how I read it.

The Ginny thing reeks of the whole over-protective male relative shtick tbh. I might be reading it in a different way because I'm biased from my own experiences though.

That is definitely beyond intent for the spell to do its job.

- Ron didn't turn Harry against Slytherin (in the books, it was Hagrid who says /"There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin."/ They gave that line of dialog to Ron in the movies. In the books, Ron only mentions Slytherin once, in passing, and he doesn't say anything overtly bad about it. (/"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."/) Also, throughout the books, Harry is typically far more hostile towards Slytherin House than Ron.)

**** As a reader, that makes sense because the story is told from Harry's point of view. We know what he's thinking and what he's doing, so we get a more complete picture of Harry's dislike for Slytherins compared to Ron. Also, assuming my memory of canon is accurate, he has no other basis to form an opinion about Slytherin house as a whole except for Hagrid's statement, Ron's worry on the train, and Malfoy's arrogance. And two of those happen a couple of weeks before he even meets another Slytherin, so those preconceptions have had time to sit in his mind and stain his interactions with all future Slytherins.

Ron, on the other hand, we only see him being hostile /when Harry sees him being hostile,/ which would also fuel that instance of Harry's hostility. Also, Ron grew up seeing the kind of people that Slytherins tend to grow up to be (by seeing the people who antagonize his father, and growing up hearing stories of the Death Eaters) but I would also think (pure speculation at this point) that he kind of had that tempered by meeting those kids as kids. Sure social circles are a thing so maybe it didn't happen more than once or twice, but with how many of those pureblood families seem to work in the Ministry, I can't imagine that there weren't a couple of times where the adults just shunted the kids off to hang out together while a Wizengamot meeting was in progress or something.

*** It probably is canon that you can cast magic by writing. It certainly fits within the tone of HP magic. That isn't the same thing as 'runic magic' as seen in video games and nonsense fanon. You'd writing something done as a means to cast a spell, the same way to speak to cast a spell. The magic wouldn't come from the writing, or the engraving or whatever nonsense. It wouldn't be powerful magic, it would be significantly weaker than wand magic.

Would it? I can't follow your argument there.

If you let writing and speaking match off, you have two ways of conveying information and providing communication that have very different extras to them. Speaking has gesture, tonality and /much more/ personality to it. Writing has longevity, stability and stricter rules of communication than speaking.

Just by those differences I would just assume that spoken magic has a more personal and direct effect, while written magic would have a more universal and longer lived effect. Stronger in the long term is definitely the written word, while speech will always trump words in strength in the short-term and immediate vicinity.

Also, why would the writing and encraving itself have some effect? Wand-movements have effects too - so much so that the success of a spell hinges on their exact repetition. And historically speaking, words and runes written and encraved were severely judged by their form, as just another argument.

***** Magic is determined by effect, not process. If a wizard is to enchant an object by writing on it and completing the magic that way, its functionally the same as another wizard who just waves their wand and casts a spell. However one is much faster and fluid. It's more easily adaptable. It's functionally better in every way.

The idea that runes need to be drawn and then remain for the magic to have effect means the magic is in the writing itself, which is against HP magic. That would be like saying the magic is in the wand movement. However the is clearly not the case. We see as wizards grow in skill and experience with a spell the wand movement, and the incantation, become less important. Applying this to our comparison from before only broadens the gap between the disciplines.

Runic magic in all of fantasy, not just Harry Potter fanfiction is quite bad. It's unimaginative and poorly designed. It's video game magic, which I mean as an insult when applied to literature. It stands right along with any form of magic reliant upon mana as utter shit.

****** The sheer richness of runic and writing magic in history - and life still writes the best stories - stands against your classification of it as "utter shit". The "spells" our ancestors have written and carved still stand in our time and /still/ hold our attention. /That/ is what I meant when I attested them longevity. Its not days or months - its centuries and millenia. The circumstance that authors don't spend months delving into research of runic and writing magic in history does not make the idea itself "shit", just the executions so far (and I'm sure I've read some good uses somewhere. I'll get back to you if I find them).

That is one way of interpreting it, but not the one I would propose. Writing in itself is a ritual. While you can say the same of spells - wand movement, incantation, intent, concentration = ritual - the time required for it would probably push it further towards potion making than spellcasting. Potions have their area in the magical world. Maybe runic magic does too? If the effects don't differ from wand-magic, yes, then written magic would definitely be inferior. If they differ in effect, then there is probably a niche somewhere in which wand magic is inferior to written magic.

In any case, we are discussing an area of the HP world where we have close to no insight in. We know that Ancient Runes mostly deals with the translation of old scripture and that we almost never see writing used in magic, and /never/ as anything other than a trigger or anchor of sorts (the signatures on the contract for the DA, Harry's name for the Goblet). But what I'll argue is that we haven't seen all of the HP world. For the sake of something that has glued me to textbooks for weeks in leisurely research, I don't think we should dismiss the most magical technique, the most powerful "magic" humanity has ever found because its uses thus far have been mediocre at best in fanfiction.

******* I'm not arguing that writing isn't magical. I'm saying it is, but that it has nothing to do with runic magic as exists in anything I've ever seen it appear in. As you said, writing carrying magic in Harry Potter is in line with canon, in tone and in the limited amount we see. With signatures, and with Tom Riddle's diary. My point is that the writing is a part of the process, not the thing itself.

**** I would say that it's almost certainly canon, just not relevant to the books. We learn that Occlumency and Legilimency are obscure branches of magic, but we only ever hear of them in the first place because Dumbledore thinks Harry should know about them. If Divination involves reading tea leaves, there is absolutely a branch of magic dedicated to writing as a magical act.
