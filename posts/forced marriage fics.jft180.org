Hi i am looking for Hp fics with forced marriage contracts not marrige laws. it would be nice if harry either wasnt accepting them gladly accepting the consequences or accepts them and then make the life of everyone including his wife a living hell.... i kinda like the trope of contracts... but they are so overdone and its always happily ever after even if hates the person at the start of the fic...

â€‹

and pls.. NO SLASH

  Goblin courts are inhumane, the Ministry thinks it can arrange marriages, and Voldemort wants to oppress everybody. The muggle government is not amused.

** I think you're not going to get too many. I'm aware of quite a few contract fics, but even the ones that aren't breakable tend to be "love conquers all" stories with happy endings, just because that's what people like.

Of the stories I'm aware of, linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao) fits your criteria best, and linkffn(Contracts and Legalities by fringeperson) probably comes next. It subverts the trope in an interesting way.

I'll skip the "unbreakable contracts with happy endings," because I've got a lot of them.

These don't go through to marriage, but you may enjoy them:

linkffn(Marriage in Mind by Lady Azar de Tamaran). An attempt to force an existing contract.

linkffn(The Mandatory Marriage Contract Fic by Itsme66). Dumbledore tries to force a contract on Harry.

linkffn(The Standard Potter Betrothal Contract by Marc the Unruly). Harry uses a betrothal contract to get revenge.

And this one is just strange. The Greengrass family uses a betrothal contract to extract penalties against Harry, but it doesn't work out the way they expect. linkffn(Tortious Interference by OlegGunnarsson).

  Oneshot. Complete. Do Not Own. All those harem stories where Harry gets a lot of other people's girl? If he can have lots of wives, why can't they have lots of husbands too? This story is inspired by that thought.

  One Shot. AU. A marriage contract. They want him to sign away his freedom and his future and his life on a girl who didn't even attend her best friend's funeral. Harry has other ideas.

  AU post 5th year. A bunny that wouldn't let go. Harry is set up in a marriage contract, but things don't go as planned. Rated for language and blatant - if non-desciptive - sexuality.

  It's the end of 1st term during Harry's 8th year, Harry is tormented by feelings he doesn't understand as he watches Hermione with Ron. Lyric Llama Challenge from the Harmony & Co. 18 Facebook group. H/Hr fic. Molly, Ron & Ginny Weasley bashing. Rated M for language. Thanks to Slytherinsal and Madie080802 for their help on the story.

  After a disastrous first year class, Potions Professor Daphne Greengrass is visited by the godparent of one of her students - none other than Harry Potter. She knows that he somehow defeated the Dark Lord, and that he sits on the Board of Governors - and that he was once her betrothed. Unfortunately for her, their history goes much deeper than she could possibly imagine. One-shot.
