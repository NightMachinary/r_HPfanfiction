I'm looking for well written fics where always - a - girl Harry either goes back in time or to another dimension and gets together with a young Sirius Black. NO Canon era Sirius and much younger Harry please. Harry Reborn into marauder era fics are cool too. Just, that he somehow ends up in the past, kicks ass and gets together with Sirius. I honestly don't really mind if it's not femHarry either. If it fulfills the other criteria, please rec! Bonus if she/he has a good relationship with James and Lilly.


** Non-fem Harry. This one is pretty slow burn but along the lines of what you're looking for. Not completed but updates frequently.

  The Veil of Death can only reap one soul at a time, so when Harry follows Sirius through in a desperate bid to save his godfather, it only reaps the horcrux out of his scar before tossing Harry's soul back in time to the Marauder's Era. Waking up as a new person with sixteen years worth of new memories was not part of Harry's (admittedly rash) plan. Waking up as a girl, even less so. But if it will give him the chance to save not just Sirius but his parents as well, Harry isn't going to complain. Fem!Harry/Sirius Black Or in which Harry tries to help his dad win over his mom. Sirius tries to win over Harry. Voldemort is a total psychotic creeper. And Lily is just done with all of them.

I've always quite liked And So, All the Pieces Fall into Place on ao3. It reads well and has some interesting moments with Harry being in the past. Be warned from what I recall they only just get together before it stops and that it hasn't updated in about 2 years.

  Harriet Potter had just defeated Tom Riddle. She means to keep her promise to place the Elder Wand back into Dumbledore's tomb. But she and her friends could not have suspected that Riddle had made one last desperate bid for his life shortly before his demise. The trio suddenly find themselves in the Hogwarts of 1977 in much more sinister circumstances than before. Familiar faces of the past are only a part of the mess they're in. If Harriet thought that her mission had finally been completed and her life become free, she would find herself most grievously mistaken.

*** I just finished this fic actually. It's quite nice I agree! The way it's left is a real bummer. They never actually get together. They go on a not date. As friends.
