Because if I see essentially the same prompt three times in a week I have to make fun of it.

 

Based on the lineup It was looking to be an interesting race at Hogwarts circuit. Draco's Lamborghini LM002 was backed up by Crabbe and Goyle's twin Range Rovers.Hermione was proving dentistry was a high paying job in her fathers Porsche 911, Ron had coaxed the Ford Anglia out of the forbidden forest, and Harry was in a Mclaren f1 that Sirius had bought him. "I bought you the best racing /broom/ so why wouldn't I buy you the best racing /car/" was Sirius's defence when Harry tried to protest.

And off they went, Harry taking the lead, followed by Hermione, then draco in his modded 700 horse suv, followed closely by Ron in the Anglia (you think flight was the only modification Arthur did? think again.) at the rear was the stock range rovers. Harry was braking for the first corner when draco rammed him, he went spinning wildly out of control. The second corner was worse, Hermione could only watch in disbelief as Draco used a lubrication spell on his car and rode the safety barrier on the outside of the road.

 

Their wands had met; the duel was on, tetriminos fell through the air as fast as Harry could guide them. it had taken a year of coaching from Hermione on her well loved gameboy but he was now playing at a professional level. his glance at Voldemort's board was a shock, "THAT'S NOT TETRIS"


** That's...actually, I /could/ imagine a Gamer Harry fic where instead of grinding skills to level them up, he plays minigames tangentially related to the skill at hand that spontaneously bolster his mind/muscles/reflexes/etc when he wins them.\\
Memory Match cards conjure themselves in front of him when he's trying to study magical theory, rhythm minigames start up when he's trying to brew potions ("I don't understand it, Albus. The boy was twitching to some kind of unseen rhythm from the time he sat down, and 5 minutes into class his potion was completed! That potion normally needs a month to finish brewing!"), and of course, when he's learning to weave words and wand-motions together, he sees Puyo Puyo, Dr. Mario, and Tetris.
