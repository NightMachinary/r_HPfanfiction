Such as

linkffn(Harry Potter and Merlin's Reaper; West of Here; I'm Still Here)

And

linkffn(12620461; 12384509; 12516323; 12228434)

I'm going with dark world to basically be somewhere where things went horribly wrong, ala Harry died.

Whereas 'Ancient Magic' is more like Oh hey, Meteors from the sky, Deathly Hallows that let you teleport, that sorta stuff. I.e. Powerful!Harry


** Magiks of the arcane is pretty much exactly what you are asking, although I feel that the author teases you with Harry using rather proposterous magics at the begining that he doesn't use lather for a reason or another

Make a Wish may not fit entirely in your criteria but he still gets powerful

in For love of magic rather than using ancient spells, is the understanding of magic that gives Harry his power, different from other powerful HP ff there is a feeling that he actually earns his power, it's not just "he spent 6h/day in the library and 8h/day training in the room of requeriments, 1 year later he defeats dumbledor" and I HAVE READ that kind of garbage

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
