** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/#post-49397518][There is nothing (to fear)]] - Tom Riddle was sorted into Gryffindor. There is nothing to fear.

Pretty interesting assortment of snippets form an AU where Voldemort ended up sorted to Gryffindor. He's still the same sociopath, though has different connections and outlook on life and society as a result.

** Boy is this the post for me! These are my absolute favorite Harry Potter Fics, that I reread over and over, and I have only seen each of them recced once. linkao3(11457669), linkffn(3673824)

This one gets an honourable mention, even tho it's not my favorite favorite, for being complete, decent quality, and long. I've also only seen it recced once. linkffn(9268889)

  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  Friendless, bullied, seen as worthless by the Dursleys, Harry's natural rebellious and adventurous nature was repressed. Life was only bearable if he kept out of the way so he grew up unwilling to step out of line. He lives by his wits but has high ideals and courage below the surface. Harry is simply reluctant to draw attention to himself --- it's less painful that way! H/G. Ron/Hm.

** “Underrated” is a wrong word. It is just that some people have different taste than yours, and some people like me really dislike OP!Indy!Dark!Slytherin!Harry, Evil!Dumbledore, any bashing, and I avoid slash, which makes me outside of 80 % or so of all fanfiction stories.

So, yes I like the usual suspects (things by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Norhumbrian]], [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/White_Squirrel/pseuds/White_Squirrel/works?fandom_id=136512][/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]], for example), but I also very much like stories, which nobody cares about:

- series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]: next generation series with the main character is Dudley's daughter Holly, which is not only witch but even very special one. However, that's just in the first chapter, and the eight books of the series are *very* original and different from almost anything I read elsewhere. Except she is a Hufflepuf, so nothing-OP, polite, hard working, very social, whole series is very low on romance and sex (I am not sure whether Holly gets one kiss from anybody who is not a family member, but certainly there is not much of any romance for her), and the result is that nobody cares. I do. I like it very much.

- stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]]. The problem with this series and why I like it so much is that it is written for adults. No, that isn't an euphemism for porn, but that it is not (like 99.9% of all fanfiction) written by teenagers/very-young-adults for the same but by an adult for adults. Main character is not a bad person, but she does morally quite problematic things (some unquestionably bad), occasionally (without celebrating it like all those nonsensical stories about grey!character), but life is just a bit more complicated than the simple black and white. And yes, the story is about infidelity, so some sex happens, but it is not the centre of the story. And this is (as far as I know) completely unique pairing.

  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter. Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

My absolute favourite pre-hogwarts fic.

My thoughts when I first read it-

' A peek at Harry's pre-hogwarts life with the Dursleys in the form of his third form journal entries. Canon compliant. Also has a bit of an outsider POV of Harry in the form of his teacher who reads these entries. (Gen, Ongoing but ends at a note that feels complete.)(23k words)'

Not sure if this fits your tastes, though.

** Honestly I adore [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/inwardtransience/pseuds/inwardtransience][inwardtransience]]'s fics. They have some of the best worldbuilding I've ever seen. I particularly enjoy how the politics are written as the human centric vs magic centric conflict is so much more satisfying to me than the usual good guys vs racists. I do have to warn you that while he has a 3 or 4 200k+ words fics, I don't think any have actually gotten finished and most are on indefinite hiatus.

Linkao3(To Reach Without)

A fic about trans girl harry potter with almost no transphobia. Using accidental magic harry becomes female and goes to school under a pseudonym. Dealing with the issues from abuse and being transitioned so quickly are major points for the entire fic. Shows Harry finally learning to fight well. Takes place after the events in OOTF. I love the combat in this with it being more focused on mobility, and it excellently shows the the intriguing politics. This fic set my head cannon to lily being an absolute badass.

Linkao3(All According to Plan)

Fun protagonist even if she is a bit insane and a psychopath. This is the first part of a 3 fic series with 1 mil words in total. Belatrix really doesn't care about the laws regarding black magic and does it anyways. Most of that is just rituals which basically call upon the gods of magic. The religion sounds crazy at first but is still fascinating.
