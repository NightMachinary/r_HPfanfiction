[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][It]] is the best fic I've ever read. It just gets that whole edgy dark magic preserving the balance stuff so perfectly right! I've probably re-read it about a million times by now anyways, so I'm giving it the golden seal of approval as far as fics go.


** It is insanely black and white, even more so than canon.

The Slytherins are perfect misunderstood angels who immediately accept Harry without fail. Of course, they still treat others outside the house like shit, the Inquistorial Squad is still a thing they gleefully take part, they still call others slurs, but Harry (and us) is supposed to look past that because "ZOMG dark magic!1!1! Like FFS, Zabini is mocking Neville in the literal last scene. ETA: 2nd to last

And of course Ron and Hermione are bashed and made look unreasonable for not falling in line like good doggies. Ron in particular is treated like shit throughout

One of the more egregious moments is Harry bashing his own dead father for not liking dark magic /like an hour/ after he starts learning about it's capabilities. And apparently the healers in this world would rather let people die or be scarred for life than use dark magic, even though it's apparently not actually bad in the slightest?

*** I'll probably regret this, but whatever.

Sorry I didn't write the story you wanted to read. Bit of a bummer to hear that you thought it was black and white - I tried really hard to make every character nuanced and I am /very/ anti-bashing. I just tried to write every single character with real flaws because that makes them more interesting to me.

The way prejudice is portrayed based off of my own experience in high school, and that aspect is getting explored more in the sequel. I went for 90s realism. Guess it didn't work.

But then some of your other complaints legit make me wonder if you're mixing my fic up with someone else's.

**** I have to agree with the poster here.

I read your first book, and while the writing is good and the magic is unique, I sincerely felt the characters were whitewashed and made far less interesting.

All the Slytherin characters end up being misunderstood children who /aren't that bad/ and /only supported voldemort because they had no choice./

You are taking about Draco Malfoy who in COS was fine with muggleborns dying. Who actively supported voldemort until he actually realized what this meant (in half blood prince). Here all this is forgiven and forgotten. It would have been far more interesting for half the house being for Voldemort and against Harry. That Draco, over time, realized he was wrong. It happens far too quickly here.

Its the same with Sirius. Sirius is heavy against black magic and anything to do with his family in Canon. It's completely out of character for him to have stayed dark. It immediately took me out of the story. What I had wanted to see was Sirius being the counterpoint to why Harry /shouldn't/ be dark. The one who understands what Harry is going through and how it's not worth it. Yet, when Harry did decide, Sirius would have sighed and hated it, yet supported him. He would have found Andromeda to mentor Harry and guide him.

Instead, we have a magic system built that makes me wonder why everyone isn't using it. There arent really any downsides or costs to use it. You have Dumbledore, one of the most well read and knowledgeable wizards, not know anything about it (even though he once dived deep in the dark arts theory as a teenager).

Then you have Harry who doesn't have a single reason not to use dark magic. Every argument against it seems to be flawed in a major way to the point you wonder why everyone isn't using this magic. There hasn't been a good consequence for any of Harry's decisions. Everything has worked out far better than it has in Canon.

All this being said, I do enjoy the creative approach you took to your magic, and that your bashing is far more limited and a little more nuanced. Your writing has improved loads from the beginning and overall I think it's still better than 95% of fanfic out there. I do want to thank you for writing this and hope you continue it. I hope I wasn't too harsh as I don't mean to be. Just because this fic isn't for me doesn't mean that countless others have enjoyed it.

***** This is going to be a roller coaster of a reply, and I apologize.

I have gotten feedback along your lines before. I have also gotten feedback that says the exact opposite. And I'm not just talking about the completely positive, “Vichan can do no wrong the fic is perfect chef's kiss muah” comments; I'm saying I have gotten very negative feedback that literally has the exact opposite stance that you have.

I've had multiple people say that the bigotry and prejudice portrayed in the fic was more than what they were prepared for. One very memorable comment said that it was triggering for them, which led me to slightly alter the tags on the fic to hopefully better prepare future readers.

And then I have people that are more in your camp, who are telling me that it's /completely/ whitewashed.

I've had quite a few people say that they were angry and disappointed that Harry couldn't cast his Patronus anymore without feeling terrible. I've had people be angry and disappointed that friends couldn't stomach what he was messing with.

And then I have you telling me that there is no real consequence.

And bashing. My god, I am at the point where I'm just completely sick of hearing the word “bashing.” I've had more people than I can even count beg me to bash characters. People think that I'm not portraying Ron as a big enough asshole and /him showing any concern at all for Harry is totally out of character/, that Dumbledore is even more wicked than Voldemort and /why haven't I had Harry kick Dumbledore out the window yet/, and that Hermione is the worst and /why is Harry still friends with her/ or /how dare I give her any attention in the sequel/.

And then I have others say that the fic is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill bashing fic. (Adding to this particular conflict are positive reviews saying that the portrayal of three-dimensional characters is a breath of fresh air.)

Even in this very thread, one person says that the Slytherins are still bullying people, while you say that they're perfect angels.

If a whole lot of negative feedback is all saying the same thing, that's probably a good sign that I've done something wrong. I can think of quite a few places in the fic where I could've done better. The issue I'm having is that the negative feedback I've gotten has no consensus. Like, at all. (There's no consensus even with my own negative feedback about it!)

If I'm getting all of these negative viewpoints that completely conflict with one another, is the truth actually somewhere down the middle? I don't know. Seriously, what am I even supposed to do with all that? Who do I listen to?

I think the popularity of this fic has really driven home the fact that every single reader is looking for something totally different in the stories that they read. It's what made me realize that a ton of criticism about fic is very often “this person didn't write the story that I wanted to read.”

So all I can do at that point is just continue to write the story that I wanted to write.

I suppose it's worked out okay so far... though I have a pretty good feeling that people who loved certain aspects of the first story are going to rage-quit in the sequel.

For whatever it's worth - I do lean more towards your feedback. Some of it is quite valid.

(Though I have been in love with the idea of a darker Sirius for literally 20+ years, so... sorry that's not for you. I adore it. The fic is also intended to be canon divergent, not canon compliant. But this also is just another thing that reinforces the fact that every person is looking for something totally different. Liking something or not liking something will always be subjective.)

I think quite a bit of what you took issue with was an unfortunate side-effect of me being determined-as-fuck to stay in 3rd person limited (I personally cannot /stand/ omniscient - it makes me immediately hit the back button), which in turn limited my ability to tell the full story that was going on in my head. I was purposely limiting the writing to Harry's perspective, which isn't 100% reliable. It's barely even 50% reliable, and that's partially from his own doing and partially from other people trying to influence him or straight-up lie to him. (Kinda-sorta unreliable narrator, but also not really?)

Could I have tackled it all a different way? Absolutely. I haven't written something of this scope before - the longest completed piece I wrote prior to this was barely 50k words. But I also want to leave Evitative mostly as it stands now because quite a few of those issues play a bigger role in the sequel. (I don't want to say which ones specifically, but I'm really, really excited about exploring two of those issues in particular. :D)

One thing I want to explain more in-depth: my exploration of the Slytherins - Draco and Blaise in particular - is based on my own experience with one person I went to school with. I saw someone go on a journey from being incredibly prejudiced - which was inherited from parents and their parents before them - to unlearning that prejudice. In my mind, Draco is still stuck in the “don't say these things in polite company” part of a journey that I witnessed as it unfolded. He's filtering himself for Harry's benefit and it's definitely not going to stay hidden. (It's a huge reason why I decided to introduce multiple POVs for the sequel.)

I mean, to be completely blunt about it - the portrayal of the Slytherins in the books always bugged the shit out of me as being very boring, mustache-twirling cliches, and I wanted to portray their prejudice in a way that I had actually experienced. (“Write what you know.”)

I know my fic isn't perfect. Not by a long shot. I will be the first person to say that my fic is totally overrated and I have no fucking clue why it's gotten as popular as it has. I started writing it with no intention of ever showing it to anyone, and then it became my outlet for dealing with the horrendous ending of a relationship that included cutting a metric fuckton of toxic people out of my life. I wrote it when I was very lonely. I have no intention of ever writing professionally, so... it is what it is. I'm still mostly happy with the story I've told, and I'm very excited about where the story is going. That is more important to me than trying to please people who all want completely different things. It can't be done, so I'm not going to bother to try.

All this said.... as someone who is very much not in favor of public negative fic reviews (it used to be taboo and I miss the days of ‘don't like, don't read'), I'm just glad it's my fic getting thrown under the bus and not someone else who might have had a completely different emotional reaction. I really wish this sub wasn't so into it.

​

Edit: I just read this back and realized that I probably sound a bit arrogant. While I'm happy with it, there are so many fics out there that are so so so much better than mine. I just want to reiterate that I truly don't believe it deserves the attention it's gotten. That attention has in turn led to the most negative feedback I've ever gotten in my life. It's offset by the good and I can handle it. But the amount of completely contradictory feedback has kinda led to me throwing my hands up in the air and saying "fuck it."

****** No, no, you are fine. You don't sound arrogant at all, rather just frustrated at the different comments you are getting. I do get where you are coming from. The fanfic world is insane and you can't please everyone. The only one that matters is you and how you feel about it.

I think what makes this fic rather divisive is /when/ it takes place. It comes across as canon until 5th year, then something happens, and you start seeing the ripples. Many readers go in expecting canon personalities with the expectation that people will change as the fic goes on. That, however, isn't the case. It's more of an AU than a canon divergent.

Sirius is the perfect example. I went in expecting canon Sirius and that wasn't what I got. Thus, it felt like a sudden personality shift in order to fit the stories narrative. I don't mind a dark Sirius at all myself. My issue was that I wasn't expecting an AU Sirius. This is the same with the Slytherins. I expected far more fighting, misunderstanding and solid rivalry between Harry and at least one other. When that didn't happen, it felt more like whitewashing because of what I was expecting. Now that I'm talking to you, these changes do make more sense.

I'm sorry about how harsh I might have been before. Sometimes words fail me and I have trouble explaining /why/ something isn't working. Your post made it finally click.

As for what feedback you should listen to... It's hard to say. Anyone who takes time to write paragraphs are always solid choices. Outside of that, hp writing groups. I have my own private discord for some of the top HP writers (taure, annerb, bolshe, manatee, etc). Having other writers you can get feedback on does wonders. It's the main reason I'm on DLP (even when they can be butts). If you are ever interested in joining a writing discord, shoot me a pm and I can send you invites to the few I know, including my own.

I do want to wish you good luck and good writing. At the end of the day, it's what you want to do and screw everyone else. I do hope I haven't ruined your day, I certainly didn't mean to.

I can see that, but my brain flip-flops when I think of the fic as an 'AU.' (AU has always made me think of coffee shop AUs and high schools/college AUs, etc.) I wonder if it's because a lot of fics that were the most influential for me came out while the books were still being published without any benefit of hindsight. At the time no one was calling those fics AU and I still don't think of them as AUs.

I think I accidentally cherry-picked from canon AND the idea of canon-in-training or speculative-canon or whatever it was called... and I think I did that because I'd been wanting to write a "Harry gets resorted to Slytherin" story since sometime around OotP came out. Some of my earliest ideas were probably conceived way back then, so maybe my brain just did a time warp when I was plotting things out?

I wish, haha. I've been sent a coherent mini-essay of all the reasons why Dumbledore is the worst and why he needs to be completely eliminated from Harry's life. Well-written, but still a 'nah' from me. :D

You did not ruin my day. I think this was actually pretty helpful - this is stuff that has been actively distracting me from writing lately, and it felt great to finally put some words to why it's bugging me.

And I will likely be getting in touch with you. This has been the most pleasant negative feedback exchange ever. :D

Hmm. I started it a while ago, but didn't get that far. I do remember the romanticisation of dark magic (especially ritual magic, maybe?) being a strong theme, but I can't recall much detail.

***** Well, linkffn(The Changeling) isn't my personal favourite (because Ginny is so often unhappy), but I do think it did a good job of explaining and redeeming Slytherin.

linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) looks inside Slytherin house a bit, but also it's about a very Slytherin protagonist, and contrasting his approach with others like Lily. Despite his burdens of guilt and shame, he is brave, and loyal, and clever, but above all resourceful and cunning and patient. Very long, but I enjoy how it studies his character and how he very gradually softens up.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a much more positive depiction of Slytherin house than canon, although there's still more caution and more focus on appearances than in other houses. Part of the change may be because there was no war, and non-Purebloods aren't allowed at Hogwarts any more, so the blood purists aren't on edge and don't cause as much conflict. Harry herself definitely belongs there, though, not for her views on blood status, but because she is driven and ambitious and keeps secrets. She wants to learn from Professor Snape and become an outstanding Potions brewer. The differences in Draco are interesting; he's overall pretty friendly, though still self-important and often scathing to people who don't impress him.

** If you liked Evitative you'll definitely like Out of The Night by Raining Ink. The author deleted the story from their profile unfortunately, but here is a link. Don't be put off by the cliche summary. Its really good! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723942/1/Out-of-the-Night]]

**** I second this rec whole-heartedly. <3 I believe I read it when it was first coming out so it's been AGES since I read it, but knowing my brain it was almost certainly part of what inspired 'Evitative.'
