I was just reading this fanfiction about Harry Potter in a [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11208933/2/][Creepypasta]] fic, and it occurred to me what if Harry Potter was crossed over with the SCP universe and it turns out that the power he knows not is in fact that he seems to negate most negative aspects of other scps in the form that they don't actively seek to harm him and passive negative effects that would harm him don't seem to work. Obviously some spc's are just so powerful that his ability doesn't actually work on them but for most of the lower class ones it would. On top of that he still has his magic.

So the story starts where the dursleys have enough of him and they put Harry in an orphanage where he gets noticed by an undercover foundation agent monitoring the area and he is abducted and brought to an SCP facility at a really young age, like no older than seven.

So Harry Potter basically ends up growing up until he's 11 years old in an SCP facility where once his abilities are figured out the staff use him like a shield to study other SCP's. Harry ends up being on friendly terms with most scps that would normally just kill normal humans like the plague doctor, they see him as somewhat like a family member or something and they teach him things that because of his magic he can now do that would be impossible for normal humans as well.

So now imagine this dynamic of a Harry Potter who has become a high level staff member of the foundation before he even hits puberty since he is so invaluable and is sane and crazy at the same time, like he acts like a normal child his age should, but you know he has no problem witnessing or partaking or even helping with some sick or madness inducing stuff. When he gets his Hogwarts letter by an owl that has somehow found its way into the facility he ends up deciding to go to Hogwarts to study this new SCP called magic.

Because of magic Harry can copy certain scp abilities that are physically impossible and defy laws of magic as well but they would also kill normal humans, they basically make him the most dangerous wizard on Earth not to mention the fact he could basically call upon help from a number of scps that would normally be too dangerous to do anything with like shy Guy or siren head.

So the basic plot line would follow the Canon 7 books in terms of core points, but obviously an SCP harry potter in the middle. Like the philosopher's Stone almost being stolen by Voldemort but by the end it's confiscated by the organization. In the second book when the chamber of secrets is opened everybody blames Harry Potter because at this point they know he is in contact with creatures that are super dangerous, meanwhile Harry is just trying to get rid of Lockhart who he hates a lot but it turns out in this case Lockhart somehow accidentally cast an obliviation spell in such a way that he is now the personification of such that even when people know he's a fraud they will forget the next day so Harry eventually ends up getting him sent to the SCP facility.

Harry Potter is probably a ravenclaw and he's really into studying cataloging and finding new scps in The wizarding world, but he could be sorted into another house as long as the house traits reflect on how he handles SCP related stuff.

Haven't really thought much about how to involve the plot in the other books except maybe the fifth one with a ministry taking over Hogwarts not to get rid of Dumbledore but to try to capture Harry Potter because he's so damn dangerous.

Some time spent with Harry growing up in a foundation facility would be good, and any number of safe, Euclid or other SCPs can be added. If you focus a lot in any particular ones those should be the ones that Harry has the most interaction with. Apart from that you could have freewaying with the plot and how things are resolved or even at your own spin or completely go off tangent as long as somehow the end result is very beating Voldemort.

*** [[http://www.scpwiki.com/][S.C.P]]

It's an internet created wiki, if you have ever heard of or read creepypasta like Slenderman, imagine that, but instead of just being one entity it includes beings, objects, animals, locations, events, and even concepts that are "anomalous" in that they don't make sense to conventional logic, physics, reality, lore, history, or biology.

The entries are formated like secret government files with descriptions on what the entry explains and how to best contain them. From harmless but odd to world and universe ending entries range the entire spectrum. SCP stands for secure, contain, protect; it's the motto of the secret organization known as the Foundation, who spreads the entire world and has higher security clearance than CIA, FBI, or any other top-tier government agency. Their responsibility is to research, discover, catalog, contain, and sometimes destroy anomalies which are simply referred to as scps.

All the while they keep the truth of these anomalies secret from the general population so that a panic is not insighted that could result in an SCP escaping or possibly causing the end of the world itself.

As such the wiki self-references itself to be factually real and for all we know it might actually be.

At this point I think they're like well over 10,000 different entries that you can read through some of them are pretty simple and short but some are very detailed.

I've only read this story but if you don't have a problem with fem-harry, then it's pretty much what you're looking for.
