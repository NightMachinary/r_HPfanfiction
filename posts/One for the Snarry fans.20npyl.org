This was (is, so far) my first attempt at fanfic at all and I had a super stupid blast doing it. Check it out - it's 4000 words and smutty.

** Not sure what all the downvoting is about. It's well-written, believable (assuming both characters are gay/bi), sexy, funny and doesn't shirk on showing the messy parts of sex.

If this was my particular twist, I'd encourage you to let me know when you write another (It's not; I was just in the mood to read something for style analysis).

For the sake of the Harry/Snape fans, I'll just say 'keep writing'.

*** I've noticed that posts about certain topics (like slash, and especially Harry/Snape) just tend to attract a lot of downvotes. It probably doesn't have anything to do with the writing itself.

*** I hope that whoever the new mod(s) turn out to be, they'll help run a slash-friendly subreddit. We're not bad people. We just like different things.

** (Also, not wanting to appear too throwaway, I've made an account just to talk fanfic since my usual account is a little too traceable.) Would love any feedback.
