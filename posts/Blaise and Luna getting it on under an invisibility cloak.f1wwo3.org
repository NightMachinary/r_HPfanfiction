I remember it was some kind of funny aside/extra chapter... and I'm fairly certain it was Blaise + Luna, but cannot for the life of me figure out why they would have the cloak lol. Also, they might have been in public, in the gryffindor tower???

I have literally no idea what other context there may be for the story, but I suspect it was one of those where Ginny/Hermione/etc gets sorted into Slytherin or something...

*** Thanks! But I don't think this is actually the one.. I'm pretty sure the male character was Blaise.
