No one found the body of Lily Potter nee Evans, but a certain white owl comes with Harry to school.

*** Harry had always found it weird his owl seemed to stare at snape with a death glare

he found it weirder when professor lupin started teaching and his owl brought in a box of chocolates for the professor

He also found it weird, that his owl seemed to attend every quditch game and seemed to squawk loudly when he did well

Harry was quite fond of his owl, though he wished his owl would stop killing Ron's pet rats harry was quite tired of having to buy ron a new pet rat every few months

** My own two cents, but this would work better if Hedwig was a reincarnation of some sort of Lily rather than Lily herself. If it was Lily herself, there would have to be some reason for her not returning to human form, like the killing curse ripped her soul apart and she could only be in Hedwig form.

A major story arc would revolve around healing or piecing together Lily's soul. This wouldn't start until 3rd year at the earliest due to only Lupin, Sirius, and/or Pettigrew (the only surviving Marauders) would be the only one to know about it. You could pull off Harry not finding out until the Summer after 3rd year or 4th year by saying they didn't tell Remus due to them believing he was a spy. I personally am not a fan of that, but that's my opinion.

The story arc could end with them finding out the only way for this to work us with a sacrifice. This leads to either Remus or Sirius sacrificing themselves to bring back Lily. Sirius could do it believing it's the only way for him to redeem himself for not being there for Harry. Remus could do it by either doing it to stop Sirius, believing Harry is closer to Sirius and needs him more, or could do it by saying he was close to Lily during their time at Hogwarts, and believes it's his duty as her friend to help her. I feel this wouldn't happen until fifth year at the earliest. This would also cause it's own grief for Harry and Co. no matter who made the sacrifice.

I now feel a need to write this fic

*** To go with Edcetera77's post instead of Remus or Sirius sacrificing themselves, what if Lily's sacrifice put the human part of her soul in Harry's scar instead of Tom's?

**** That would be really interesting, depending on when Harry finds out, he would probably sacrifice himself to bring her back (if a sacrifice was needed). Or it could be similar to the Nine Tails in Naruto, where Harry could go into the scar and talk to her.

** But then what does everyone call Hedwig? Owl, not witch.

Are you saying owls can't be Marauders? Seems a bit close-minded.

*Edit*- if you can't tell I'm joking all the way down this thread, please send me a private message, I've got a bridge in Long Island I'd like to sell you.

I definitely think you can at least double your investment within a year!

Don't pass up on this opportunity, I have buyers lined up already - you need to ACT NOW!

*** I don't think you understand. In the OP's promt there is no Hedwig the Owl. Rather, for some reason, Lily stays in her animagus form, an Owl that is nicknamed Hedwig.

***** No. In this AU, Hedwig doesn't exist as an entity. Only Lily that takes the form of an Owl that's nicknamed Hedwig (just like Sirius can take the form of a dog nicknamed Padfoot).

What the OP is suggesting, is a world where Lily became an animagus with the Marauders and after the night of '81, is stuck in her Owl form.

******* I'm 70% sure you are joking (I hope you are).

In case you aren't: I don't think you get the point of /Alternate Universes/. I do not hate Hedwig, but I find the premise of Harry's mom being his owl really interesting. Even if an owl that could've been gifted to Harry and named Hedwig exists in such a universe, it doesn't matter because it is not relevant to the plot. Lily takes the place of Hedwig.

The fact that Lily's ainmagus form is nicknamed Hedwig (and has the same appearance as Hedwig from cannon) is used emphasize the similarities to cannon and make the differences that much apparent.

I've been joking in this whole thread.

My very first comment was a joke, which most of you people took seriously for some reason.

But thanks for the explanation of why you like this premise lmfao

********** I'm sorry dude, I kind of assumed the people here would have the intelligence to see that a comment about how they're killing Hedwig and are owl-haters is obviously not serious.

Or how a comment about how the owl can't join the Marauders because there would be two members named "Hedwig" is a joke.

Like, really? I mean, no, /really/? Do any of these sound like serious statements to you?

I'd give a couple choice adjectives to describe exactly what I think this says about the intelligence of the people that downvoted me, but I'm a good boy that doesn't want to be banned :)
