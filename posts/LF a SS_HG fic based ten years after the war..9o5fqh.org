I remember Hermione had a daughter with Ron, who died during or just after the final battle. She and her daughter see Snape being attacked in the street and take him in. After the war his money had been frozen and his magic suppressed so he ended up on the streets.

Also remember that Hermione and her daughter do a 'Granger Girls' show on Christmas Eve.

Anyone recongise this?


** I can't remember the name but I'm 99.9% sure that the fic you're looking for was written by Teddyradiator (who is a spectacular author btw, if you're looking for a work of pure genius with the emotional impact of a Bludger to the head, read Lay Me Low, it's long as balls and there are a couple of scenes that make me cry like a hungry angry baby)

Edit: It's Choose Something Like A Star
