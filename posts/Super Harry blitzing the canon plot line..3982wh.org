What I'm looking for is the fluffiest over powered super intelligent Harry fics you know. I want to see him breeze through canon with no added challenges or obstacles, save perhaps those he chooses to attempt (such as problems with the wizard world).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]] easily qualifies. Beyond the third chapter of most of his stories, you can substitute +Harry+ with Jesus or Goku or whatever deity you prefer. Many people enjoy his stories, though, so I'm happy for them.

***** While it would be hilarious if it was solely because he rec'd Robst, it's more likely to be related to the FPH drama. Many people have deleted their accounts in the last two days.

****** ... having just looked up what you're referring to... I can't really bring myself to have an opinion on the topic. All sides of the debate get a confused look and a resounding 'meh'

I'm going to elect to believe that he deleted it because he recommended Robst.

** I've had people complain of overpowering in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][one]] of my stories, the one where Harry goes back in time to the end of book 6, solos all the horcruxes, and then whacks Voldemort in a single evening. It's pretty much just a prologue to all the fluffy, Harry/Molly W., Soul-Bonded goodness to come.

*** I'd love to read a Harry potter story written in the terms of an rpg. Soloing the boss, party gear, aoe vs skill shot inspecting loot, grinding xp (not HPVG style though) etc.

**** It may not be 100% what you wanted, but you may enjoy [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]. A D&D wizard who lives for optimising himself and breaking the rules is transported to the Harry Potter world.

Ideal if you're familiar with D&D, but I only know the very basics of D&D and still enjoyed it, though about 95% of what the main character does is something I didn't know could be done in D&D.

Your willpower must be herculean to pull you out of the TVTropes morass with such rapidity.
