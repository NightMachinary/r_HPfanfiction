For me it has to be authors who write a million pointless tags, especially those ones that are just full sentences of their views that are completely worthless, as it just comes across that the author is probably thirteen at most and it's therefore just going to be a thirteen year old's cringefest of angst nonsense.

**** Well it also removes a lot of possible descriptions of how the characters said a sentence or paragraph

Harry questioned Hermione with an overbearing tone ‚ÄúDid you hear what happened to Ron last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you hear what happened to Ron last night‚Äù Harry inquired while frantically waving his hands in circles.

‚ÄúNo, but I imagine it involved copious amounts of alcohol and a Nimbus-2000‚Äù Hermione drawled out, throughly unimpressed with Ron as a person and already thinking of several ways he got himself into trouble.

Anyways that's the main problem, a lot of new authors write their dialogue like a plays but then do not fully commit to that style.

*** It comes across as the PoV character relating a conversation whose content is so significant that only the words matter, and the circumstances and manner in which they're said don't. Yet it's also seems a light-hearted way of doing it.

It's the sort of thing that can work well. But only in very rare circumstances. It lends itself to occasional use in a PG Wodehouse style of writing. But not much else.

Done well, it's like the PoV character is telling the reader about what was said - the author's breaking the show-don't-tell rule for effect, but doing so for a whole conversation.

**** I will have to break a lance for well done outfit descriptions. But I have to say when it comes to show vs tell, and to detailed outfit description is an example for too much show and too little tell. Because authors then try to show the reader that someone looks really cute in their outfit, by trying to create a specific image in their head, instead or just telling the reader that the character looked and felt cute today.

But cloth descriptions can show you a lot about a character, without telling you.

He stood in the door. The rain was dripping from his wide hat down on his shoulders. The heavy wool cloak he was wearing showed signs of tear at the hem and was once probably of rich black colour, but now look gray and patchy, as drops fall from it to form little puddles around his boots. The leader hiking boots looked like they once had cost a lot of money, but now they came undone at the seams and the heels were worn down and uneven. When he took a step or shifted his weight they gave a wet squishing sound as evidence that they weren't as much protection against the rain, as needed by this weather.

This character didn't do anything but standing in the door, but you know that he is someone that wears old worn-out clothes, that probably were expensive once. Someone that fell down the social ladder? His heels are unevenly worn down. A hint that he is maybe limping?

*** Brit here, and while it might be a personal or regional thing, I grew up with 'mom' rather than 'mum', mostly because a mommy is a mother, a mummy is a desicated corpse. I've heard some people use 'mam' as well, though I think that's more Ireland/Scotland way. There's also the thing that 'mam' sounds like 'ma'am', which can be taken as 'madam' and depending on the user that can be the title of a head of a brothel.

I agree with some of the others on Americanisms like breakfast pancakes though. The main British pancake is a once a year thing, not a breakfast food, and while we do have a type that matches the sort Americans use (Scotch pancakes), they're more dessert than breakfast.

Likewise pants for trousers/jeans/shorts or using 'greyhound' for the intercity coach or sometimes intracity bus.

*** Second this but have to add that, while the main characters are all established to use "mum", this is actually a regional thing, and some parts of the UK use "mom", or "mam", so for an OC they could be okay.

Other Americanisms are much less forgivable!

Lily was a young mum (barely in her 20s when she had him) and presumably not from the wealthiest of backgrounds. Harry is a very likely name for her to have chosen.
