Looking for good Ginny-centric fics that take place during her Hogwarts years. Any genre is fine, as long as it's canon-compliant and everyone's in-character. The longer, the better.

I've seen some great Ginny/Harry fics, and though I'm always looking for new Ginny/Harry fics, I would also love to find some with less of a focus on Harry.


** You might try SSHENRY's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=5097][Summer of the Serpent]] and its many sequels. North of a million words, it's canon compliant (mostly) through 6th year and a classic that's still fairly readable after eight or so years, if a bit of a Mary Sue treatment of the character.

**** Though it's been some years since I read this series, I believe the order is:

Summer of the Serpent

The Forgotten Girl

Life is But a Dream

Towards Tomorrow

Today the Tempest

Facing Future

Facing Future 2

Timepiece
