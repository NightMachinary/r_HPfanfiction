Basically, I am in the mood to read fics about Dumbledore when he wasn't so wise and all knowing. He would obviously be a Transfiguration prodigy, but the rest he might not be as naturally gifted in. Slash is fine, but ideally no Grindelwald pairing, as they canonically didn't meet until after Dumbledore graduated.

This has been written before the Deathly Hallows, so the descriptions on his family aren't really canon, but I enjoyed the things the writer came up with. There's also one more complete story, but then the series ends.
