** Or a success in taming his own and James was a rebellious teenager that didn't want to have hair like his dad.

** Somehow I imagine James being the lab rat of his dad thus Harry's power he knows not is something like Samson or even that girl from tangled. Better yet, imagine hair functioning as tentacles doing their own thing.
