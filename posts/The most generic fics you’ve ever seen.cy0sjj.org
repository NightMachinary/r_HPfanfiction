What are the most generic fics you guys have ever read

Also what do you think is the most usual pairing right now. I'm curious

EDIT: okay please spare my inbox it's done nothing wrong


** The most generic fic has to be Hermione realising that Draco isn't really a blood supremacist creep but in fact a handsome man and ultimate lover who she will instead give up her career and beliefs to instead submit to.

*** Okay i think you've just read way too much dramione cuz i've only ever seen like 5 out of like 60 fics

Although even that is a pretty big percentage

Ehhh but i myself have read so much Harmony and Haphne i probably would say one or the other is the most popular. Maybe Harmony

But as i said, I haven't read much else so i think it would be a bit biased.

** I have one, but I forgot the title.

It goes like this: Harry goes to Sirius's will reading, and ends up being declared an adult. He's also betrothed to several witches, but that's alright because he's the Lord of the exactly same number of lines, which must be continued. He learns that Dumbledore has been manipulating him and the Weasleys are stealing from his vaults, so he breaks free and becomes independent.

Anyone remember this one? It's on the tip of my tongue.
