Looking for crossovers where the addition of a Harry Potter character actually changes the story. To many crossovers just follow the original story line and the Harry Potter character is just along for the ride never making a difference in main events.


** *The Shadow of Angmar* linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

Harry ends up in Arda, takes a while to get going, and then promptly chucks Sauron's chessboard down a chasm. Among other things the balrog of Moria is known for what it is much, /much/ earlier. Despite the long hiatus Steelbadger is still active and working on it to the best of my knowledge, he just writes like 40k word chapters so they take a while. He does pop up every now and then here on the sub actually.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** *Post-Apocalyptic Potter from a Parallel Universe* linkffn(13326497)

Harry ends up in the MCU mysteriously after his world ended fighting Voldemort. The big ticket events happen, but Harry's presence tableflips it. God-like Harry (over time).

This fic swaps between action, drama, inventing/theory, and some Black Widow romance all the time.

â€‹

Also, Wolverine becomes Hagrid.

Edit: Since a lot of the stuff happening in the MCU were happening or planned well in advance of Harry's arrival (or such a distance away that Harry's presence doesn't matter), they still happen. There are a few movies that were evaded completely and/or nipped in the butt before they really took off.

  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete -

#+begin_quote
  During a fight with a dragon, Head Auror Harry Potter and a few others are transported to another world. Years later, Westeros and Essos are a little smarter and a little more honorable. The players of the Game of Thrones become pawns when the Builders raise their fist and strike. This is the Song of Builders, a song millennia in the making. Story starts at the end of "Baelor."

** Linkffn(warcaster by the crimson lord)

A Warmachine (table top game) crossover where the MC solves problems logically by throwing steampunk weapons platforms at them. An action fic in its purest form IMO

  The spell that should have killed sent its victim to a world where man bound machines to their will. Warcasters commanded and warjacks obeyed, and the Fates that had meant for the boy to carry a burden found instead a girl who stared at them beside the empty crib of her twin. Fifteen years have passed and the Dark Lord has returned. The Light must have a champion, but who?

** Broken Angel was really good. Not going to link it for content reasons. It's a crossover between Harry Potter (obviously) and Naruto. It has the most cohesively joined worlds I've seen in a long while for a crossover. It is completed and nearly a million words in book one alone. There is a sequel currently being worked on. I highly recommend it, very well written. It's a bit different from most crossovers, but I highly recommend giving it a chance.
