Or where all elves are as they are in cannon but for some reason harrys' elf is a full on Legolas motherfucker.

I can see the dialog now, bitter and sarcastic at first. "Yes /master/. I am sworn to carry your burdens..." perhaps they evolve from house elf to house carl

Just a thought.


** This seems to be a request but is flagged as dicussion... Nevertheless this Fic could fit.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
