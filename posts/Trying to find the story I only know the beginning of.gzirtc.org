:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I know for sure it was a Snarry fic. Harry manages to get Snape back to the Hospital Wing after he gets bitten by Nagini. Harry checks in on him often while Snape is unconscious, talks to him and eventually Harry feels as if Snape is a friend. But when Snape wakes up he's cold as usual to Harry.

And that was all I read! I'd really like to read the rest if it's still up. Ty in advance for any help!
