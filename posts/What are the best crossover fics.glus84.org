  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

** Brace yourself. I love crossovers.

I think one of my favorite crossovers is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12729635/1/Through-the-Wormhole][/Through the Wormhole/ by Dunuelos]], which sends Harry Potter into the Veil(Which turns out to lead to the same place the Prophets reside), and he winds up on Deep Space 9, in the /Star Trek/ universe. There are three parts amounting to over 370k words, but unfortunately it has been explicitly abandoned by the original author.

Another one I enjoyed was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][/Brown Coat, Green Eyes/]] which takes place in the universe of /Firefly/Serenity/, and has an absolutely fascinating take on the effect of interplanetary travel on wizards.

Yet another one I enjoyed was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8054239/1/White-Knights-and-Dark-Lords][/White Knights and Dark Lords/]], which crosses the Buffy the Vampire Universe with Harry Potter. I think I'll have to go back and re-read it at some point, as I don't remember much about it, other than I enjoyed it.

One I remember better is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1375393/1/The_End_of_the_Beginning][/The End of the Beginning/]], another Buffyverse crossover, which takes place as a prequel to both /Harry Potter/ and /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/, mostly taking place during the tail end of the First Wizarding War, and before Rupert Gilles and Ethan Rayne had their falling out. It also does a fair job of setting down the pieces where they start at the beginning of the /Harry Potter/ series.

A third crossover with the Buffyverse I've enjoyed, but is /much/ lower key than the others, is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5847][/The Flat Next Door/]]. For whatever reason, Number 4 Privet Drive is no longer safe, so the Dursleys(plus Harry) are relocated to an apartment safehouse. Next door is one Rupert Giles. Bear in mind there isn't really any action to speak of. This is very much a character piece.

On the lighter side, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784770/1/Harry-Potter-Geth][/Harry Potter: Geth/]], in which Harry is flung far into the future, and crash lands on Rannoch. Without any sort of spacecraft... So... SPLAT. The Geth rebuild him and choose him as their emissary. Hilarity ensues as he irreverently annoys everyone around him. Fair warning, it's Super!Harry, but I enjoyed it all the same...

Oh and one last one for good measure, one of the first I ever read, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/401208/chapters/661126][/Damned Demented Demons/]], which is a crossover with /Supernatural/, and has the demons enlist the aid of Dementors, which leads to Harry Potter being called in, as he's considered an expert at combating Dementors, considering how young he was when he first cast his Patronus charm and fought off over a hundred of them. It has a sequel in [[https://hells-half-acre.livejournal.com/115495.html][/Vile Violent Vacations/]], which isn't on ao3, for some reason I can't figure out..

I think I'll leave it at that for now....

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2268507][Distance]] by SomethingIncorporeal) is a really good FMA crossover that takes place when Dumbledore is working with Flamel, but I don't think it'll ever be finished.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4953046][Wizard Among Bats]] by somefantasytosurvivereality) is a Batman one that's fun and complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6870892][The Colours of the World]] by MaiKusakabe) is a FMAB crossover and probably my favorite HP crossover.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11052627][Magic and Mind]] by Preelikeswriting) is another FMAB one but it is very long. Enjoyable, but takes a while to read.

** There are a few HP/Buffy crossovers I really like that I rarely see referenced here.

Learning to Deceive is a WIP. This is one of my favorite stories ever; I cheer when I see updates. Willow is a Hogwarts professor during OoTP. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15935933/chapters/37159226]]

Howl was recently completed- Buffy and Bill Weasley fight Greyback post-DH. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3242063/chapters/7063658]]

First Impressions is a pretty smutty Xander/Charlie Weasley fic but also has a really interesting and well thought out plot with lots of great twists. Not my favorite but I think this fic needs more love. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/745942/chapters/1390673]]

A couple of great Avengers crossovers:

The Blood on My Hands, It Scares Me To Death is the opposite of the overpowered Harry in the Avengers world fics. A weakened and emotionally scarred Harry is found and recruited by the Avengers. Beautiful story, WIP but almost completed (I hope). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11799474/chapters/26614947]]

  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][Child of the Storm]]. Starts off Harry Potter/Marvel but then adds in more.

** Legit any Mod Harry and the Avengers crossovers... My personal fav can be found on Ao3- Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis by Enigmaris.

There are also a couple of Lord of the Rings crossovers that are absolutely beautiful like *A Whole New World* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1186762/fuzzy-christmas-socks][fuzzy-christmas-socks]] and *Steady is the Hand* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6444490/rhosinthorn][rhosinthorn]].

And it isn't exactly a crossover, but rather an idea based on Alanna the Lioness, but the Pureblood Pertinence series is my love and I would never give up a chance to recommend it...

*** I'd add a third LoTR crossover, linkffn(Shadow of Angmar), although it's incomplete and only occasionally updating. Quite good world building for the earlier ages of the world.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
