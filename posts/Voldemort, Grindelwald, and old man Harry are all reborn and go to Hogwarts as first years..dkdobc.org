:END:
We know very little about what Harry did with the rest of his life, but he died old and it's pretty much confirmed that he went and became some kind of Dark Lord. Grindelwald and him get along rather well, in a "I don't doubt that I'm going to have to deal with you eventually" kind of way.

For Harry it has been a long time since Voldemort, so he's able to be pretty detached and mess with him.

Voldemort started out trying to manipulate Harry, until he realized that Harry had been reborn as well. Some knowledge and skill that Harry displays along with the fact that Harry knows a good deal about both of them but neither of them have any idea what Harry developed into means that Voldemort feels forced to be very cautious.

They all go to slytherin. Grindelwald is disgusted when he realizes that it's a green lit underwater dungeon.

It's pretty entertaining and funny.

  Dumbledore would regret the decision to hand over the school letters to the house elves, even if it did save him hours in admin. Eleven year old Harry Potter was expected... Tom Riddle and Gellert Grindelwald... yeah, not so much. However that might turn out to be the least of the school's problems.
