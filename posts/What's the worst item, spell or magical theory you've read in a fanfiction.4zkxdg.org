** Some of the magical core theories. The worst I've ever read was when Poppy Pomfrey measured Harry's magic level and guess how high it was.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik][You guessed right...]]

Basically anything that reads like its straight out of a Shonen anime.

I also dislike stupid stuff like "Glamours" or magical vows. Glamours is the easy way out for authors who end up having to let their characters go somewhere public but can't be bothered to think about some sort of solution other than "lol, glamour that ass". Seriously, as if the Ministry wouldn't scan for those if they'd exist, let alone a "manipulative" Dumbledore. Magical vows are also just lazy writing, short-circuiting the interaction between characters who mistrust each other. Furthermore, their existence in a fic often destroys it completely. Magical vows would fix any major problem. Any crime severe enough would require a magical vow in court. Any suspicion can easily be cleared up with it. There would be no reason why Lucius runs free and Sirius is imprisoned in a world with magical vows.

Another is the /genetic/ family magic. I do like the idea that old families hold onto spells and knowledge. Books, or rather knowledge in the magical world is the greatest resource you can have. Knowledge is power, and here that's meant literally. I also like the aspect that some obscure stuff is inherited or something you're born with. Parseltongue, metamorphing, the Inner Eye,... Where it gets too stupid is when family magic is this uber-weapon. The Blacks can summon the Old Ones, or some stuff like that (in that particular fic, them summoning the power of Cthulhu was responsible for their madness, which I found funny, but you get the point). I also dislike when fic try to link magic to genetics. Granted, it seems to make sense, but it takes much of the "magic" from the world.

**** I should have elaborated.

I'm well aware of the Unbreakable Vow and the costs of it. Death. Its is used in the story to give Dumbledore reason to let himself be killed at the end of the year. Snape was forced into the Vow by Bellatrix and Narcissa. Dumbledore, cursed to death, has no intention of having his spy killed due to it and trades a few more months of his own, for the lifes of Draco and Snape.

The nature of both Unbreakable Vows we hear of was, however, one of a promise for the future. The twins tried to trick Ron into serving them, and Snape was forced into the vow to fulfill Draco's task should he fail. We can hence assume that an Unbreakable Vow needs to be a promise regarding something in the future.

Furthermore it cannot be simply made. It needs a giver of the vow, a recipient and a witness. We do not know what the implications for the later two are, but we know that death is the penalty for a break of promise.

The magical vows I mean are those "I swear on my magic..., so mote it be." things that could potentially cost the vower his magic. They're retroactive and used that way in almost all fics I encounter them in. On the meta-level they are a cheap tool for authors to make a audience of characters believe someone. Because actually writing all those dialogues to eventually make them believe is just tedious and requires planning. Which is why I included them in this "worst magic of fanfiction" post.

Also, just to make that clear, I do think that next to Timeturners, the Unbreakable Vow is one of the dumber examples of magic in canon.

True. And if some author does it I still find it stupid and lazy, but accept it as something that may well be canon. I'm just incredibly annoyed by the obvious cop-out that is the fanon magical vow. It deprives a lot of situations off their tension and potential.

You could write the tempus spell such that is has limitations that make it useful sometimes but makes a watch still a good long term investment. You could enchant a watch to do all sorts of things, they are a fashion statement, you can use them in front of muggles. The tempus spell just tells you the time. Maybe the tempus spell would only give you absolute time based on the position of the sun and not account for standardized time zones, or it is only accurate within five minutes, or maybe it's tricky to cast well enough to be reliable.

Pronounce "Samukse".\\
No one uses it except during the day in Irak, and to this day the best attempt to translate it into a more usefull spell (i.e. give the exact time following the sun at the position of the caster, in a script understood by more than a thousands of the population), was by Wendelin the Weird, which created the modern "Tempus". Unfortunately, it has the precision of an amateur-crafted candle clock (i.e. you mostly know on what side of lunch you are), uses Elder Futhark runes and writes the time in blue flames in a fireplace. Neat quirk: it has a precision to the thousand of a second if cast on the fire of a stake....

****** As far as their ability to use magic goes, yes. Genetically, though, if we want to go there at all, they are likely enough to be different; the fact that usually strength breeds strength and trait meets trait and yet squibs happen sometime (but not too often) suggests that they are an aberration rather than simply a result of child too weak to be a wizard being born. Admittedly it is possible for such a thing to happen without any genetic mishaps, as there are many ways in which the whole thing could work on a genetic level (and as Madame Rowling is not an expert in genetics she refrained from trying to get into specifics) and with some of those ways it is possible for recessive traits to go for generations without doing anything only to surprise people after so much time that nobody even remembers them being there. So really, may be identical, may be close enough, may be something else, spoon if we know.

So really, we know that what MoR tried to show wasn't the correct version (though, and I'll say it again, for all its faults it's just a character's theory and not something presented as absolute truth in that story), but there's quite a lot of leeway for people who want to present it as whatever.

Because it did fulfil its purpose in the story (which I did enjoy, its flaws aside), it's just that that purpose wasn't deliberation about genetics and it was just a random-ish example chosen to have something to work with.

**** Why so, exactly?

IIRC Harry Potter later hypothesized (but never tested) that magic worked for Wizards because it detected some genetic marker placed my the Atlanteans. If that were correct, there's no reason it couldn't allow squibs (who have just one copy of the allele) to perform limited magic - after all, it's not functioning by expressing proteins through the genetic code, it's functioning by "magic" someho detecting the presence of a genetic "password".

On the other hand, as Harry said, just sating "it's magic" isn't really an explanation.

***** IIRC (and correct me if I'm wrong here) Harry proposed and then proved a single-inheritance model, where muggles have no magic alleles, Squibs have one and Wizards/Witches have both. We also know that Squibs can be born from two magical parents.

But, by the single-inheritance model, the only outcome from two magical parents would be a magical child. So something there is not right. Unless you deny that Squibs can be born from two magical parents, the model doesn't fit.

I missed any examples of two magical parents begetting a squib in HPMOR, and I'm only part way through the Canonical HP books.

What examples are there?

IIRC, Harry proposed the single-inheritance model, and "proved" it only to the level of rigour one would expect of a primary-school science fair project; nowhere near a publishable level of rigour. Personally, I'd hesitate to say it was proven, though it did remain HPJEV's working hypothesis throughout.

On the examples, that's actually given me pause. The only example I can find is Marius Black, but his name only appears on a film setpiece so that's hardly binding canon.

Still, I'll approach it from a different angle: the existence of Half-bloods. In a single-inheritance model, we'd expect wizard/muggle children to get one allele from each parent -- but that would prevent the existence of Half-blood wizards with a muggle parent, like Tom Riddle or Severus Snape.

******** True, or muggle-borns, for that matter. The "muggle" parents must have been carriers of the allele, hence actually Squibs. Perhaps the canon rules this out, stating or implying that any squib raised as a muggle would be recognised as such. However, I certainly don't recall anything like that in HPMOR, and I'm halfway through the canon and all I've learned about squibs is that Filch is one.

I get what you mean about the blurred lines between HPMOR and the author.

The Harry Potter wiki gives a huge amount of information on someone who allegedly only appeared as a name on a tapestry! I suppose Sirius gave most of that info in the dialogue? I didn't watch that scene carefully enough to know.

I think you may have hit the nail on the head there. The book's approach to classifying magic is too vague and inconsistent to really support this one way or another. There are also various concealed passages, and for whatever reason I seem to recall something about walls you could walk through, though don't quote me on that.

Regarding 'glamours' in fanfic, I'm basically apathetic. It's not really a particularly original idea for a spell, but at the same time it fills a well-defined and believable niche as a magical equivalent of putting on makeup for the night. It's believably less difficult and permanent than transfiguring your body to be different, which might be more akin to extreme body modification and/or plastic surgery, I think. Either way, it doesn't really impact my enjoyment of a fic, generally.

That said, after the second task Dumbledore dried the contestants with a blast of hot air rather than with a warming or drying charm; considering it was Dumbledore, that counts for something, although given that a warming or drying charm would be a charm and a blast of hot air is something that could possibly be achieved with transfiguration, I can accept that it might simply be Dumbledore's choice rather than a lack of alternative (still, the contestants themselves did not seem to know such charms either, so that's that).

Many of the spells in canon seem centred more around achieving some kind of general effect rather than something like it but precise. There are exceptions to this one, but that's what separates a blast of hot air from a drying charm. As I said, you could have one in your story and most people wouldn't care; but lack of such spells in canon would not automatically be nonsense, which was my point in the post you replied to.

For example, maybe they apply heat directly to a surface so you can only make them so strong before you risk burning yourself. Perhaps they wear off easily and reapplying is a nuisance. Perhaps they only make you feel warm but in reality you're still loosing heat. Depending on your magic system, maybe they are grossly energy inefficient compared to just wearing a cloak.

******* There could be several ways to achieve the same result. Hermione could choose to use the bluebell flames over the walking charm because it better doors her situation for whatever reason. It doesn't mean that there's no warming charm. And even if there isn't a warming charm in canon, I don't see why there couldn't be one in a fanfic.

******** On a random note, it would be hilarious if Hermione's choice of the spell was so that they'd all have to get close to her to keep warm.

**** In a sense, yes. I mean, I don't hate the spell, it just annoys me to see it used every time they step outside. I like when it's sued differently, but most of the time it's only use is expanding narrative when the student goes outside.

** For me, the biggest trigger is when Harry or an OC has multiple animagus forms, or when they drink a potion and enter a trance in order to find the animal/s. Also, I don't like the idea of custom wands made from five cores and three types of precious stone. Apart from that, I dislike fics where Luna is shown as some kind of uber seer that can sense the flow of magic/predict the future/etc.

** Maybe slightly off-topic, but the spinning portkeys always piss me off. Spinning portkeys were used in /one single fanfic/ as a valid plot device, and then every damn author who had read that fic had to use them as well.

It's not the /worst/, but it's one of the most rage-inducing. It really breaks the immersion by reminding me of a completely different story.

*** Uh... do you mean that thing they do in the movies where using a portkey sends you flying up into a vortex, along with everyone else who's using the thing?

Because that was basically how they were described in the book, I think. It prompted hundreds of fics at the time to note that while wizarding travel was extremely fast, muggles had them beat for comfort every time.
