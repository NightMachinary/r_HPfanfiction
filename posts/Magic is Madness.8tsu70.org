So I was playing Fate: Grand Order like every nasu nerd worth their salt and then I remembered a recurring theme in the nasuverse: Madness is powerful. over and over again things like logic, common sense, and rationality are brought up. Then I thought "hey hp wizards are fuckin nuts!" and then I had a moment. A slow solemn moment of failing to reach an epiphany until i realized it. Harry Potter fanfiction where madness and irrationality are powerful.

So, do ya know any?


** You know, this request reminds me of something from Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches:

  Silence. Then her grandfather's voice filtered through to her as a whisper from where she still stared at the wood floorboards.

  "...And you're ten years old. Dear Merlin, you put even your grandparents to shame. I wonder if that means you're even more insane then them too..."

  She looked up.

  Luna beamed. "Why don't you ask Alex? She can tell you."

  "She's insane," she said without hesitation.

  Luna turned and hugged her. "Thank you."
#+end_quote

Luna is actually one of the most powerful characters in the story (no really). At one point she shoots a stunning spell from her tongue.

*** It's because the nasuverse is seriously underrated, more so amongst the members of the hp fandom. Like, I don't know why I find more and better crossovers with naruto underrated.

**** I've tried, but there are... Issues with crossing over the two. Unless you want to invoke second magic fuckery (which is done most of the time), you end up with two magical societies occupying similar spaces, which leads to problems of the 'just how many shadow wars would the two engage in' variety. There's also the issue of explaining away the existence of two competing magical systems without negating the origins or capabilities of either, which always puts the 'fun' back into 'functional insanity'.

My solution was simple-the magic are squibs in that they cannot use a wand the way wizards do. Instead of apparently just being wi-fi'ed to magic like HP wizards are, the magi have to generate od before connecting what spells they wish to perform to a source of mana, be it the environment or some other source, to sustain the spell. This makes casting spells exponentially more difficult, especially with the limitations imposed in the source material, but also allows them to cast stronger and stranger magic than what HP wizards are shown to be capable of.

The problem comes with all the other factors present in both worlds-the True Ancestors, Dead Apostles, fucking Alien super-beings, the Evil Moon, Enforcers and Counter Guardians and murder-priests and Holy Grails and Heroic Spirits and Bloodline eye-based Uchiha-like powers and Gaia and Alaia and the Age of Gods and and and.... Which are all like, whoa, how the Hell do you even think that the Statute of Secrecy can even be enforced when enforcing it basically strips the human race of the assholes that save the world and sometimes endanger it slightly less than the horrors they face off against on a regular enough basis that the organisations that know they exist tolerate them to a greater or lesser extent?

Explaining the magical systems co-existing is easy in comparison to questions like that and getting it wrong isn't something you want to do when crossing over two of the most rabid magic-centric fanbases in existence. Every time I try, I inevitably stall.

**** And the irony its one of the easiest fandons to crossover with HP(and better suited). You can do some cool stuff with a Servant Harry Potter(witch he actually could be summoned as Rider, Assassin or Caster). I also found Harry with servant EMYA interesting since Harry became a Hero but just wanted to be normal and EMYA wished to become one but failed.

***** Even ignoring that, the things you can do with the magic system and setting and amazing. In fact I would argue that reducing the nasuverse comprised mostly of grail wars to just grail wars is a huge disservice. Think about what you can do with the fact of the existence of the associations and gods, how you could explain magic and hold interactions between different peoples, how you can change things.

Like having wizards have the element of daemons, have their magic works by them being so bugnuts crazy gaia gives up (like types, apostles, marbles, velber, gods, and daemons), channelling od through foci with spells basically being A.T fields,l etc. there are so many ways to do the crossover without introducing a single character or item, merely by defining the magical system a bit. Imagine all the potential. just remember to think bast holy grails and heroic spirits

sorry for ranting but I am passionate about my love of the nasuverse. I am a hardcore nasu fan all the way.

****** The most interesting to me in a new setting is how the characters react and develop but I read and enjoyed a few(because they arenÂ´t to common) crossovers with that type of premise.

** The book Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell explores this avenue to magic deeply.

I'm not myself a fan of crossovers but damn a HP/Strange might work for me. Even better a HP fanfic with magic like Jonathan Strange's.

** Seems like a really cool idea, if nobody can come up with an existing fic where that applies I might create my own.

*** I remember a Naruto fic where the MC stops using chakra for a couple of weeks in order to test if it effects his sanity. In short, it does, but it's worth it, because chakra. I think the solution was to kind of channel his madness into specific outlets and hobbies.
