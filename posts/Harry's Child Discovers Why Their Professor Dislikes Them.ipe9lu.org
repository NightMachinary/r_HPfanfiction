Harry's Child, relatively popular among their fellow students and a favorite among the teachers, never understood why one of said professors never liked them; never would look them in the eyes.

At first, they thought it might be because of their father -- he did kill Voldemort, after all. Time, however, discounted that possibility: the Professor held no ill will words muggleborns or muggle-raised half-bloods, and was outspoken about the idiotic beliefs the Death Eaters and their sympathizers had.

Harry's Child eventually discovers the truth by accident, much like how their father did with Snape being picked on by James and his friends: in the Professor's eyes, they should have been their child, much like how Snape felt when seeing Harry walking around with James' face and Lily's eyes.

Their very existence is walking, talking, breathing proverbial salt in an open, emotional wound.

Turns out that Harry's Child's mother 'stole' Harry from the Professor in question, and ever since she's been Snape levels of bitter and angry and regretful.

(Harry's Child's mother did actually "steal" him by lying and manipulating the situation to her advantage, and the Child finds out. Now they're burdened with the knowledge of what their mother did, and of knowing the implications of what this will mean for their parents' marriage if the beans are spilled).

*** I purposefully left the identity of both the Professor and the Mother vague, so anything's fine. I expect that, if someone does pick up my humble prompt, it'll involve Hermione in some way, since she's one of the most popular characters to write about regarding Harry romances/tragedies.

I'd hope that lesser-used characters are attempted, though.

As for "bashing"... eh . Bashing has the literary substance of sugar: it's good for a craving, but it has the substance of empty calories.

** Version 1(Disclaimer, I don't think Hermione would /ever/ act like that towards a child(or a breakup), she might be vindictive towards the parent, but not the child, it's just not in her):

Lilian Potter was confused, her Defense Professor was supposed to be a great witch, she was called a hero for the Wizarding World, helped her father defeat Voldemort, and was widely regarded as a genius. She had been really excited to be taught by her.

But Professor Granger seemed to dislike her, rather badly.

She did not do anything untoward, she did not berate her, or scream at her for no reason, and she graded her work and tests fairly.

But every opportunity she had, she would punish Lilian for the littlest offense, discounting more points than normal, and even when Lilian excelled in class, she would either give her less points, or just congratulate her without looking.

Now, if Lilian had been a bad student, or a rowdy one(like the Weasleys) she would kind of understand, but Lilian was a quiet student like her mother had been, much different than her adventurous father.

And this only happened with Professor Granger, the other teachers and staff would fawn over her, they would say she had her father's eyes, but otherwise looked just like her mother.

Headmistress McGonagall would be one of those to say that and look at her fondly.

She asked her cousin Scorpius, who always had an ear in the grapevine, but he told no student knew, since when not with Lilian, Professor Granger was a fair and kind teacher. He had asked his mother, but she had evaded the question, only guaranteeing it wasn't Lilian's fault, while his father just told him it was family business, but had remarked it was 'ironic' or something.

Lilian was a smart girl, she had been placed in Gryffindor because she was brave, and because her mother's House just wasn't as fit for her.

She learned that her father, Professor Granger and Mr. Wesley had been great friends at school, so she asked Rose, one of her best friends.

Rose pulled her into an empty classroom and started casting privacy charms like they were going out of style.

"Look, Lils, I am only telling you this because it's involving you and you are getting hurt, and I think it's wrong, but please /don't/ tell anyone you heard it from me okay, I heard it from Victorie, who overheard her parents, so it's probably the real deal.

"Ok, Rose, I won't tell."

The redhead took a deep breath.

"Okay, so Granger and your dad, back when they were in school, they were dating."

Lilian's eyes widened, she had suspected something like this, but had discarded because she couldn't imagine her extremely kind and thoughtful dad having a bad breakup.

"Wow. So she hates me because she's my father's ex."

"It's not your dad, it's your mum."

"What!? They knew each other?"

"I don't know, I know they, as in Professor Granger and your dad, were dating, and then something happened, and he broke up with her and started dating your mum."

Lilian really wasn't liking where this was going.

"So, she hates me because I look like mum?"

"I think so, yes, look, Victorie implied it was bad, apparently her parents talked about a duel, a really bad one, they trashed the living room and it got to a point your dad intervened and had to disarm them, Aunt Fleur had to run damage control, the Minister himself had to pull some serious moves to keep the media out of it, and Dad was torn between the two, it's why they are not so close anymore, and why grandmother doesn't like your mum that much."

"But Mrs. Weasley likes me."

Rose smiled, "Of course she does, you are the perfect granddaughter who's all proper and she can't wait until you get there so you can talk about girly stuff."

Lillian huffed, she had already 'resigned' herself at being considered an honorary Weasley along with her dad, she then noticed her mother may not be included.

"So, what do I do? It's not my fault."

"I know, but you look like a younger version of your mother, only with your father's eyes, you are like a walking reminder."

"Do you think my dad...that he...cheated on Professor Granger and left her for my mum?"

Lilian didn't like to think like that, her parents had always been her role models, her father was kind, passionate, and heroic, he always made time for his family, always showered them with love, her mother was a bit more reserved, some thought aloof, but she was always there for her family, and always showed love for her and her father, who made a game of getting a reaction from her.

They always looked like the perfect couple, the brave knight and the fair lady, it was hard to reconcile that with her father cheating on his girlfriend and leaving her for her mother, who would know what was happening.

"Hey! Lils, get that look out of your face! I really doubt that, your father simply isn't the type, and Victorie said they broke up and then your father got with your mother, the duel was after all that happened."

Rose placed a hand on her friend's shoulder, "Look, maybe this is still too recent, or you being here has made her remember it all again, and with the time she's going to get used to it, and it's not /so/ bad, right?

She was right, maybe it would improve with time.

It didn't.

*** When Lilian was in her third year, and started growing into her looks, it started getting a bit worse, with Professor Granger actually scowling at her, and something her eyes would show aggression that was really weird on the otherwise nice woman.

Lilian didn't want to bring her parents into this, her father was very protective, and would probably march into the school, and her mother, well, if they dueled before...

But now she had to worry about her little brother, who was coming to Hogwarts next year, James was her opposite, he looked like father, but acted like their mother, it was such a certainty he was going to Slytherin her Uncle Draco had bought him a green uniform for Quidditch, much to her father's consternation.

She didn't want to know how Professor Granger would treat him, and she knew that he had a temper, and wouldn't stand for it.

She had to solve this.

She thought about going to Professor McGonagall, but what could she do? Professor Granger didn't do anything /wrong,/ she still graded her work fairly, and never raised her voice, but her looks and some of the things she started saying.

"Miss Potter, your handwriting still has ways to go."

"You need to hold your wand properly Miss Potter, these are offensive spells, not make up."

"Miss Potter, by your age your father could cast a corporeal Patronus, your performance is, not as impressive."

The proverbial straw in the camel's back came in a visit to Hogsmeade, when she, Scorpius, and Rose went to buy some books and met Professors Granger and Longbottom as they were leaving.

Lilian was dressed in casual clothing for that, enjoying the weather before Winter, and she had her hair in a bun, very similar to how her mother used to dress.

She was laughing at something Rose said(and her laugh was also very similar to her mother's) when they met, but she caught the tail end of their conversation.

"And she was just there with him, with that gloating bitch face of hers, holding him like a trophy, how can he be so stupid, Nev?"

Professor Longbottom had a long-suffering look on his face as if he had heard that story a lot. With closed eyes, he gently guided her out of the store, and spoke, as if repeating a mantra.

"They are /married,/ Hermione, have been for more than a decade now, it's kind of what marri-"

He stopped speaking when Hermione stopped abruptly, he opened his eyes and looked at the three students in front of them, specifically at the student in the middle, and couldn't stop himself from muttering 'shite' under his breath.

For the first time, Lilian was actually scared, Professor Granger looked at her with hatred, and at the moment it was like she was seeing someone else instead of Lilian, she had a pretty good idea who. There was actually a breeze as Professor Granger's magic flared.

The Professor sneered, and then almost /snarled/, "Green-"

"Miss /Potter/! Miss Weasley and Mr. Malfoy." Professor Longbottom almost screamed the first name while placing a hand on Professor Granger's shoulder and guiding her to the side, and /away/ from Lilian.

"A fine day to you three, don't forget about the essay, it's due Monday, and no extensions!"

As Lilian saw then leaving with wide eyes, seeing Professor Longbottom start whispering with a grave expression, while Professor Granger placed her hands in her face.

"Shite, Lils! I thought she was gonna curse you!"

"Me too, she looked really mad, some people give me ugly looks here too, but not like /that/!"

Lilian turned to look at Scorpius, who actually had a hand on this wand, and was too following the Professors with his eyes.

Rose was looking shocked.

"Did you hear that? She almost called you Greengrass, your mother's maiden name!"

Scorpius turned to look at her, and his eyes widened, "Lils, are you okay? You-you are crying."

Rose hugged her as she sniffed, and Scorpius guided them to a more secluded spot until she calmed down.

"She thought I was my mother. Did you feel her magic? She was going to-to attack me!"

"You need to tell McGonagall or your parents, I mean, she can't do that, your father is the Minister of Magic!" Scorpius said.

Rose was nodding, "I will talk to my dad if you want, they are friends too, and I could talk to Aunt Fleur, she is good at talking to people."

"No!" they both were taken aback by her vehemence.

"If we involve them, this is going to become an adult problem, and mother won't let this go, hell, dad might be angry too, even if they were friends, and if I say I felt threatened..."

"Your father will have to go through official channels."

"You won't even need to say it, they will probably ask for a memory."

Lilian nodded, except for her, Professor Granger treated everyone fairly, even Scorpius and some of the children whose parents she fought in the war, and she was a very good teacher.

She knew what to do.

"Guys, I will talk to her."

"What! Are you mad? After that? You still want to be alone with her?"

"She won't attack me! At least, I don't think she will, she was already angry and seeing me..."

Scorpius looked offended, "Hmpf, Mother is right, you Potters are too forgiving, it's not your fault, so you look like your mother, but you are /not/ her."

"I know, and that is what I will say."

"We /will/ be outside, and Rose could call her cousins, just to be safe."

"Louis will be there, Fred too."

Lilian took a deep breath and nodded, she would go there tomorrow, after things had calmed down a bit.

**** It was a very diverse group that was walking down the hallways, Potters and Weasleys were already expected, but the Malfoy in there still turned some heads.

Lillian looked at her cousin Scorpius, and her friends, the Weasleys(who were like cousins for her too), they nodded and waited by the corridor's entrance.

Lillian took a deep breath and went through the door of the classroom, walking towards the office, she did her best to not stop.

She reached the door, took a deep breath, and knocked.

There was a moment of silence, what sounded like a muffled crash, and then an "Enter" was heard.

Lilian opened the door cautiously, and couldn't hide her surprise at seeing the office things packed, nor Professor Granger's utterly regretful look when she saw her, she noticed her hair was a bit disheveled, and her eyes had bags under them.

"Ah, Miss Potter, you, good, I wanted to talk to you."

She sounded defeated, very different from the normally assured woman.

"Professor? What, is all this?"

Professor Granger scowled for a moment and then deflated, and gestured at her office, "Well, I am just getting ready for when H-Minister Potter comes here to sack me."

"Sack you? Why would he do that?"

Professor Granger looked at her like she sometimes looked at the kids who asked stupid questions when she thought they weren't looking.

"You really want to rub it in my face, don't you?"

Lilian quickly gathered what she was implying, and went to stop it, "What? No, I didn't tell anything, I don't even think there's anything to tell, I mean, nothing happened, nothing bad."

Hermione looked at her with an open mouth, as if she was seeing her for the first time, she looked into her eyes and when he found truth in them, she deflated, "That's not true, something /did/ happen, I-I..." she sniffed, but pulled the tears back in, a practiced movement, "I almost attacked a student...all because she..." she then collapsed on her chair and began crying.

"I became Snape, oh Merlin, after all that crap I turned out just like Snape...I am a horrible person."

Snape? As in Severus Snape, Professor, Headmaster, and Spy? She vaguely remembered her father telling her about Snape and the grudge they both had with each other, but she thought it was about how her father talked back to everyone when he was a teenager.

She then remembered him talking about how he was friends with her grandmother when they were in school, and then...

Her eyes widened as she saw the parallels. Ironic, indeed.

"Wait, Professor." Lilian didn't know what possessed her to approach the woman and place a hand on her shoulder.

"It's, it's not like that, Dad, he told me a bit about Snape, and you are not like that at all, you don't go after me, you grade my things fairly."

Hermione raised her head to look the girl in the eyes, and her expression softened a lot upon seeing the caring expression on those oh-so-familiar green eyes.

"I am still a bitch to you in class."

Lilian smiled, a soft familiar smile that for Hermione shouldn't look right in that face."Honestly professor I prefer that to people trying to suck up for me because of Dad."

Hermione chuckled and cleaned some tears, "I see, but what I did yesterday..."

"Professor, about that, I /need/ to know, I have been confused since my first year, I figured out it had something to do when you...dated...my dad, but I..."

Hermione looked at her, and the regret came all over again, "Merlin, I really acted like Snape, or at least thought like him..."

She took a deep breath, and indicated the chair, after Lilian sat down she rose from the chair and turned to the window,

"How do you know I won't be biased and tell my version?"

Lilian thought for a moment, "Professor, you were always fair, even after the War when all those people went on trial, and my-...I always heard you had a good sense of justice."

There was a bitter chuckle at that. "A good answer, well, I spent three years being unfair with you because of something that's not your fault, and yesterday...you deserve to know, but....know that people change with time."

Lilian nodded, extremely anxious to hear it.

"When I was in my Sixth Year, with Harry, your father, we...began dating, or rather, seeing each other, it just felt...natural, we had been best friends for years and..." Lilian could hear the pain and nostalgia in her voice.

"We did that for a few months, with the War and everything, things were pretty hectic, and then Seventh Year started and we couldn't go back to Hogwarts, it was dangerous, and we had something...important to do, Harry, Ron-That is Mr. Weasley, Ronald, and Me, so we left, just us three, to do that."

Lilian remembered her father talking about that, not going to school and an important mission, given by Albus Dumbledore himself, but he never gave details, and she felt it wasn't her place to ask.

"That year, a lot of bad things happened, and it ended in the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry won, we won, but we had grown apart somewhat, the war and the things were...we did things we aren't proud of, things we regret to this day."

"After the war, lots of things, happened, the trials, and the reconstruction, but we still met, Harry and me, and then I had to leave the country for a time to...look for some people, Harry had to stay, there were things only could do."

The silence was such Lilian could hear the tears hitting the floor.

"That's when...That's when your m-mother, /approached/ him, I think, I /know/ they were just business partners and friends first, they had never been in contact during Hogwarts, what with that stupid Gryffindor versus Slytherin thing, but after the war, things were /easier."/

Lilian remembered her parents talking about that, they met on a business lunch, through Andromeda Tonks, Dad's lawyer, and family friend, even to this day, and her mother started helping to deal with the Potter and Black states, who even with the war were substantial, her father had no idea how to manage companies and properties and was /terrified/ of squandering his family's legacy.

Her mother had been trained from birth to manage companies, to be the heiress to the family, and so she was able to help him, after Andromeda vouched for her, apparently, others who her mother had helped avoid punishment in the seventh year vouched for her and Aunt Astoria too. They became friends, and then lovers, apparently they went into a cruise or something.

"When I came back, everything was so different, Harry was different, very different, we tried to approach, but, he had become a different person, he wanted different things, politics, and I knew, I /thought/, it was your m-mother's doing, that she had turned the boy I knew into a...politician, a Lord of the Wizengamot," the disdain in her voice was unmistakable, as was the undercurrent of anger at the next ones, "that she had turned him away from me."

Lilian thought about how little she knew of that time, her father had told about other girlfriends, but never expanded upon it, and he had said he changed a lot after the war, became more thoughtful, how he learned to see the opportunities he had to help people, to use his fame for good instead of just 'getting lambasted by reporters', heck there was even a book about his 'rise',' Harry Potter: From Warrior to Lawmaker.', had her mother done that?

"And I was right, your m-mother, D-Daphne Greengrass /changed/ Harry! He didn't want to play Quidditch professionally anymore, or be an Auror to be an Auror, he wanted to become an Auror, then Head of the Department for Magical Law Enforcement, and then /Minister./"

It was exactly what had happened in a little more than a decade.

***** But Lilian never saw her father as a politician, he had real friends, and kept the people he disliked at a business distance or at the most a cordial relationship. She could see he was truly passionate about the things he did, and he wasn't cold /at/ /all,/ her mother had even told her was just 'too honest' with people to be a politician, but she said that with a fond, almost silly smile.

"The Harry I knew and /loved/, wasn't like that, the way he talked, like a politician, and then he...ended things, officially I guess, it was already over months before, I didn't take it well, and confronted Greengrass, and she...well...looking back I am going to say we were both giant bitches that day, she showed me a ring, it had been a gift from what I know now, but I thought other things, and she /gloated/, and I...well I talked back, we began screaming and then spells started flying."

Lilian couldn't imagine her mother /gloating/, but she had said her teenage self wasn't very pleasant in some situations.

Hermione gave a bitter chuckle, "It was a mess, we destroyed the living room and some of the walls of Grimmauld Place, some of the wards even fell, we were really going to hurt each other when Harry appeared, he disarmed us, with that fancy Wand of his."

Lilian, for some reason, immediately remembered her father's notched Wand, that he always had on himself and that she never liked picking up, he also used a darker one, to teach her magic or do some fun spells, that one was much more friendly and shared the same wood as her own wand, Holly.

"We shouted and said things we shouldn't, I found out he thought I had done some things I...hadn't, not in the way he imagined them, and I think that was the day we..." she sniffed.

"And since then, me and..." she looked at Lilian, for a moment looking surprised she was there, "your /mother/, never saw eye to eye, some other things happened over the years, but they all stem from that, and I never could get past it, I couldn't look at you without seeing your mother and, Merlin how I am a stupid little girl. I am so sorry."

Hermione seated back and was now looking up with a miserable expression.

Lilian thought a sensible teenager would just thank her and leaver he quietly with some platitudes.

But she was Lilian Luna /Potter/, daughter of Harry James Potter, and so she wasn't that sensible. She was also the daughter of Daphne Ophelia Potter so she knew how to be diplomatic. She was also a girl, which already helped a lot to understand Professor Granger's situation.

"Professor, I, I understand, thank you for telling me."

Hermione just nodded, probably expecting the girl the leave.

"But I think it's mighty stupid you are leaving because of that."

Hermione looked at her, and for a moment she again looked like she was seeing another person.

"What?"

"Look, I know it's not my place, because I am thirteen and a child and I don't understand all that happened and that my dating experience limits itself to having kissed Frank Longbottom in the Chamber of Secrets." she immediately closed her mouth with her hands. "I shouldn't have said that, I should /not/ have said that."

"Anyway...I think you are a great teacher, easily one of the best, and everyone loves you, I mean some of the boys are, /eww,/ but, look, you were just distressed and I can see that and yes, it scared the crap out of me, but I won't tell if you don't and those that were there won't too, I also think you are justified in being mad at my mum to some capacity, but it has been fifteen years and, dad always looks sad when he talks about you, and mother, well I know you won't care but it's one of the few times she looks very remorseful." she took a deep breath.

"So I think you should stay, and...and maybe talk with my parents, I don't know how you adults act, but I can see everyone is having a bad time with this, even if it's just to clear the air, I think you should do it," she said, in a half smile, but with a defiant look on her face.

Hermione was now looking at her, and she had an extremely wistful look on her face, Lilian had the distinct impression she was seeing her with a different color of hair.

"Miss Potter."

"Lilian, I mean, call me Lilian, Professor, you just shared something so personal with me, it feels wrong to call me Miss Potter."

Hermione huffed good-naturedly.

"Fine, Lilian, I am really, really sorry, about how I treated you, it was very, very wrong of me, it /won't/ happen again and I...thank you for not, reporting me," she chuckled, "I think I am long overdue a talk with...your parents."

They smiled at each other, and Lilian felt she had done something good, now she would have to work on the other end, because she thought her mother had a grudge too, just well hidden.

"Well then, Professor Granger, I think you should unpack, and I will be going..."

"Miss Potter, or Lilian, in private, I guess, thank you for that, speaking about it was almost like...well it was good, and sorry again."

"It's okay Professor, it's not like you used rapid-fire questions to try to embarrass me on the first day of class."

Hermione snorted and Lilian turned to leave.

"And Lilian, I will forget I ever heard anything about you in the Chamber of Secrets, if you agree on working with me and Professor Hagrid on showing how speaking Parseltongue is just a regular magical ability with nothing evil involved...it was something I...always wanted to do."

Lilian gasped, and then turned back to look at her with a smile, "Okay, Professor, if you wait until next year we can have two parselmouths in school, and on some special days we may get three."

And then she left an openmouthed Hermione in there, her things unpacking around her, and walked down the corridor, where she could see her friends looking shocked as she smiled at them.

Leave for her to solve a fifteen-year-old family feud, she truly was a Potter.

NOTE: I started writing for something but then it turned completely different because I guess I just can't bash, sorry.

This would also ask for a conclusion. What truly happened? Was Hermione's version completely correct? Did she omit stuff to spare Lilian? Did Daphne do something more untoward, or was it all just a big misunderstanding that turned into anger and resentment with time and continued enmity?

Did they reconcile and rebuild their friendship? Did they reconcile, and Hermione married Harry and Daphne, to the utter embarrassment of Lilian and James, also making Minerva win a long time bet with Filius?

I don't know.
