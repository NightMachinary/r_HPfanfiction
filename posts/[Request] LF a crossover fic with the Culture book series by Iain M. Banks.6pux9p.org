Some time ago I read a crossover fic on Fanfiction.net where Harry is taken from the Dursleys' doorstep to be raised by the Culture (from the eponymous series by Iain M. Banks), and returns at the start of first year. At the time I hadn't read the Culture series but enjoyed the fic nonetheless; having now read several of the books, I wanted to read again, but was unable to find it - the only fanfic on FFN that's officially a HP/Culture Crossover is 2 short chapters that is definitely not the one I'm looking for, and searching HP fanfics for the word 'Culture' is rather like trying to find a needle in a 'wizarding culture' haystack.

Anyone happen to know the fanfic I'm talking about?

edit: yesssssss. Thank you [[/u/deirox][u/deirox]] !

*** I hate this fic. Actually, that's not true. I love it, but it's abandoned before it actually goes anywhere :/ Makes it hard to recommend to people.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

** I see that your request has already been answered, but if you're a Culture fan and a Warhammer fan you might also enjoy this:

Fair warning it's also abandoned but it's good while it lasts.
