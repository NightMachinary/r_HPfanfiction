  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

  In limbo, Harry makes another choice and finds himself in a baby's body: little Tom Riddle. Years pass and intimately bind the orphan and his imaginary friend, in a hopeless and incestuous relationship. Indeed, all the odd events of Tom Riddle's life happen in spite of Harry's presence: could he be the one who provokes them? Time travel, UA but as canon as possible. HPTR - COMPLETE

** Story: Almost a Squib [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/7/306]]

There's a very brief scene about â…˜ of the way through the final chapter. It's only a handful of short paragraphs and a bit of dialogue, but it made me cackle. :D

I'm not aware of any other fics that fit the bill.
