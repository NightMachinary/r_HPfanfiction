A somewhat less common pairing: Harry-Astoria If you can please drop suggestions.. 100k+ or with sequels. Lemon is acceptable as long as it's not the main plot and it's just a part of their relationship going forward. And NO harems. An individual Harry-Astoria... Edit: a few typos Edit: switched slash to pairing because a fellow redditor informed me of the differences between them.


** I dont have a recommendation, but I just wanted to inform you that slash usally refers to gay relationships in fanfics, for straight relationships its just called pairing.

*** It was quite interesting, ngl. New POVs and friendships. I quite liked it. Anymore like this? Doesnt have to be with Astoria I suppose.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

** Ellory has a few stories, if you can appreciate her "Pure-Blood culture" world-building.

Also, regarding the ship name, why not just Starry? Sure, it shortens her part a bit, but it has a nicer sound owing to being a real word

** I'll second the vote for Motivations. Also, try linkffn(Family - It's in the Blood by mjimeyg). Only about a 20k one-shot, though.
