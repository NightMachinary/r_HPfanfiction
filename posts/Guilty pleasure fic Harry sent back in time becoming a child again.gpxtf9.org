:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I am very desperately looking for a fic I read long ago. I believe it had Harry working at the ministry as an unspeakable or something and they decided to send him back as a child because the war had made too much damage. He arrived and didn't have all his memories. There may have been personifications of Fate and Death or something like that. I also believe Harry held the title of « Friend of the goblins ». It was super crack so Harry might have been an heir of gryffindor I'm not sure.

They found a way to get the Longbottom back to sanity and Alice came to the board of governors with I think Sirius and they found ways to completely obliterate Dumbledore there and in the wizenmagot.

It was very much dumbledore and molly bashing hence why it's a guilty pleasure but I really want to read it again so if anyone has an idea it would be much appreciated
