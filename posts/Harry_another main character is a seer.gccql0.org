i thought this could be a cool thing, maybe they get visions about events that might happen, so things end up going different than in canon.

I haven't been keeping up with it lately, but I've read most of it. Main character is the second Weasley daughter (i.e. an OC) who is a seer and ends up sorted into Slytherin. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I remember quite a few of the plot beats being very interesting. It uses the concept of a 'magical core' quite extensively - which I've heard is a big deal breaker for some people - but it really didn't bother me at all.

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?[ CURRENTLY ON HIATUS ]

  What if Parvati didn't want to go dancing with that boy from Beauxbatons, and dragged Harry onto the dance floor instead? A simple action leads them both into a much darker destiny filled with romance, danger and prophetic visions. AU, Complete.
