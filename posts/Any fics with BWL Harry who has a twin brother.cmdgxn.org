*** There are dozens of fics like this. I am pretty sure OP is asking for a fic where Harry is the BWL, everyone correctly knows he is the boy who lived, but he also has a (presumably not antagonistic) twin brother. I can't think of any like this. There are one or two where he has a twin sister though.
