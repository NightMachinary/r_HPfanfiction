I'm looking for a fic which name I have forgotten and I just can't seem to find it.

Overview: -Twin Potters, might be WBWL or Harry might not be the BWL. Can't remember exactly.

-Squib Harry

-Lily divorces James and takes Harry to Scandinavia, or Norway...

-Semi-crossover with Skyrim, but can't find it in crossover section: Companions are a guild of squibs. Harry is Dovahkiin

-tomb raiding: Harry and Lily and a team explore tombs and they find lots of enchanted goodies, I think dawnbreaker was amongst them.

I can't actually remember if the story was any good, I just find the concept intriguing.

Please let me know if you find it


** linkao3(Kalpa)?

It doesn't quite fit what you have listed, but there are enough similarities that it might be it?

  It may take a community to raise a child, but what does it take to raise a Dovahkiin, and how far from home will Harry's family have to go to find out?

**** I am unsure at to why there's an 01 in the title, but it's the right fic, I think.

***** I'm certain that this is not the correct fic. I've read the one OP was talking about and it was totally different. After googling for it and not getting anything, I'm persuaded to say that it was deleted. I could be wrong, though.

****** That's a shame. If it is/was a seperate fic I would have liked to read it.

*** Yeah, this isn't it. I fear it might have been deleted. A shame really.
