You need to be a fan first, in order to make a fan theory. This theory is not even undergrad literature student level. It is easy to cherrypick elements and use hyperbole in order to come up with stuff like this. Moody is not insane, just paranoid. There's a ton of other things wrong with this, especially in his interpretation of Harry. For all the talk about mental illness, he's just listed a bunch of random symptoms, some of which are exaggerated. What is the illness? How is this not applicable to over half the YA fantasy novels out there?

*** That's a good point that it's easy to cherrypick elements to look for your evidence to support your theory. I think what's useful from this article is just how the magical community seems to have disdain for "madness", and "otherness" but what constitutes as madness in this community is never clearly defined.
