I loved linkffn(In the Mind Of a Scientist) by Zenonikyuubi(I don't remember his names spelling)

The sequel had a cross with star gate and it didn't interest me much as the star gate parts made me very confused.

But, I still wanted to read another Scientist!Harry. Any suggestions?


** One shots - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/23/Odd-Ideas][Better Living Through Chemistry]] and chp 39, the revised/OP version, from linkffn(Odd Ideas by Rorschach's Blot)

  The months passed and eventually the three students went into the bowels of the school to prevent the theft of the Philosopher's stone.

  "We're going to have to get on a broom and pick out the right key," Hermione said in realization. "Uh . . . are either of you good enough to get it?"

  "I might be," Daphne said with a frown. "But it'll take me a while . . . what are you doing Harry?"

  "Mixing up some thermite," Harry replied absently.

  "What's thermite?" Hermione asked.

  "You might say it's a key to every lock," Harry replied

** linkffn(10937871)

Horrifically overpowered Harry, and he's basically amoral to the point of being a monster, but it's readable despite that.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** It's one of my favorites due to the writing style. The story itself is... I would say maybe 7/10. The premise, to me, is easily 9-10/10.

** linkffn(Madness Effect by ZenoNoKyuubi)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11304904/1/Madness-Effect][Madness Effect]] is a HP/Mass Effect crossover. I understood most of it despite never having played ME and only reading a few fanfics.

  It's the year 2185CE. Commander Jane Shepard is recruiting members to bring with her on a mission against the Collectors and the Reapers. Among the candidates is Dr. Harry Potter, the reclusive mad scientist who has been missing for twenty years. Who knows what he was doing during that time? Rated M to be sure.

  Harry Potter wasn't raised like in canon. He was top of his class, and very intelligent, always seeking to improve things, and so he learned all kinds of things, and, upon entering Hogwarts, started studying all he could get his hands on! Intelligent!Super!Harry Later Mad Scientist!Harry Rated M for Language, Nudity, and Gore Stein-ish Harry Genres: Humor/Romance/slight Horror
