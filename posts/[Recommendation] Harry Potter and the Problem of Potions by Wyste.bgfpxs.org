I do hope I got the flair right.

Anyway, I just finished reading the story and would like to leave it here so that others may read it, too. It's interesting and annoying at the same time. Annoying because of how the events in canon still played out in spite of the differences the author introduced, yet interesting because of trying to catch those divergences from canon the author managed to squeeze in, especially towards the end.

Oh, and Harry Potter is a unicorn. LOL.

  Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy

makes me think this is going to be the kind of cringy LOLRANDOM fic that makes me x out in the first paragraph.

*** That is not a good description. While it's not super serious, the fic is not crack or Draco/Harry despite what the summary sounds like. There is not even any implied romance between them and they remain friend-enemies throughout it. The fic is quite good and keeps Draco and Snape surprisingly in character. I don't understand what OP means by saying that Harry is a unicorn (maybe because he acts in a hilariously chill way towards everything?)

I originally didn't read it because I thought it would be a canon rehash and crack, but I find it to be one of my favorite fics now. There is tons of humour and the sacrastic sassy dialogue exchanges between Snape and Harry are great. The fic does follow canon, but manages to put a unique spin on everything and is an enjoyable read.

**** I mentioned the unicorn bit because it WAS written in the later chapters of the fic. Ron and Draco tease Harry about it (Ron whinies whenever Harry appears and Draco transfigures a unicorn statue to follow Harry around). I actually liked that part coz it showed the relationship among the three worked.

In retrospect, only those who've reached that part would probably get it. I can see how it can confuse others.

*** I know, right? Wait 'til you see the actual pairing in this. Thankfully it isn't Harry/Draco in spite of that summary.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
