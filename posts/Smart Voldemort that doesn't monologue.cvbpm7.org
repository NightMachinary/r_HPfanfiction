Just a random request for an AU where Voldemort is smart, didn't split his soul, just found other ancient magic, and swiftly killed Harry at the first encounter to satisfy the prophecy.

As Harry rounded the corner, he was still thinking about cupcakes. He didn't expect to die there, wake up, and die again.


** Splitting his soul /was/ smart. In /CANON, there are no adverse effects from doing this./ He didn't "have his magical core reduced," or "lose his abilities," or memories or skills, or anything like that. There's absolutely no downside to making a Horcrux. Only upsides.

Let's say you were offered two options.

1. Immortality.

2. Immortality, but if you ever mess up and die in the next eternity you will suffer alone in hell forever.

I would refrain. I am not arrogant enough to believe that I will never mess up. Sometime down the line, even if it's several trillion years later, I will eventually die. Once that happens, there's an eternity of suffering waiting. An infinite amount of time is so ridiculously huge that the trillions of years of life will eventually become less than a blink in comparison.

It is not worth it.

Even if I did decide to take it, the risk of damnation is something I would consider to be about as bad of a downside as something could possibly get.

We don't know that at all. We don't even know if there is an actual hell in HP-verse. We also don't know whether or not you can redeem yourself by becoming a better person.

IIRC, our knowledge about HP-verse after-life is basically limited to:

- It exists.
- There's a nice place that good people go to.
- Making horcruxes turns your soul into a disfigured baby that is stuck in limbo forever.

His first murder was Myrtle. His first Horcrux was his father.

Actually, our knowledge about HP-verse after-life is basically limited to there are ghosts and only magic people leave them. Everything else is in Harry's head, souls that were possibly trapped in a wand, and the 'resurrection' stone luring Harry to his death. None of them talk about the other side though.

If you want to take things said in interviews as canon I can't stop you. But Rowling often contradicts her self and admits to not keeping track of the lore (and she's bad at math). Does that list exclude the ring and diadem because Rowling forgot them, or did you just leave them off?

If you get so upset when other people do the same speculating you do, no I can't point to the actual text, just subtext. I'll just say "no, we don't know that, here's how it actually is" that's Dumbledor's explanation and his supposition is all we have. Heck, by my read Tom didn't even kill his father. He knocked his uncle out and stole the ring, and because Tom looked so much like his father Marvolo went and killed the poor muggle. Not that Tom wouldn't commit murder but a lot of Dumbledor's explanation defies Occam's Razor.

*** Well, there are a few downsides. He lost his nose and doesn't look human anymore when previously he was a very attractive man. It seems to have diminished his ability to be charming, since we see multiple examples of it in his past but all he can manage now is threatening. He also seems to have set up an eternity of himself being stuck in a liminal space between life and death in the form of a sad dying baby.

That said, I still wouldn't say he was stupid to create the Horcruxes. I don't think any of those downsides were either known to him or cared about when he was making them.
