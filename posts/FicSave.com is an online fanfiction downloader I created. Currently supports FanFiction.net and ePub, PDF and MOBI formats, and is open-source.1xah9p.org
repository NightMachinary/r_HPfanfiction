For those of you who love reading fanfics offline as often as I do, you'll know the empty hole that FlagFic left behind. To fill that hole I created [[http://ficsave.com][FicSave.com]], which currently only has support for FanFiction.net (with more to come) and can deliver ebooks in ePub, PDF and MOBI format.

[[http://ficsave.com][FicSave]] is also open-source, so you can check out the GitHub repo (linked from the site) to see the site code and how it works, and even create your own copy of the site.

Please give it a try! Any feedback is appreciated.

**** It's now not letting me use it :( It worked on my first pdf, but it goes to error 524 after a minute and 40 seconds. I waited over night to try it again, but it is still giving me the same results.

***** It's caused by all those chapters that need to be grabbed and then converted to PDF, which takes longer compared to ePub and MOBI.

After a bunch of testing, I deduced that it's timing out because of the browser itself. Each browser has a max request time because the connection is closed, and I can't change it server-side. I'm going to have to fix the script to speed up the grabbing process somehow.

****** You could also create a server session (referenced via cookie or generated id as get-parameter) and present the user with a waiting page. That way the processing can take as long as it needs to and the user gets a quick reply instead of waiting on a perpetually loading page. You could even use ajax-polls in the background or timed page reloads coupled with a server-side redirect to the download once the processing is finished.

Same error, but this time it went for 100 seconds before timing out.

Also could you add the functionality to mail the file to my email?

I have a kindle and Flagfic used to do this it would mail the file directly to my @amazon.com account and it would be automagically downloaeded to my kindle

Does your tool support adultfanfiction.net by any chance?
