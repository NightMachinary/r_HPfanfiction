I'd like to read a fic where Harry is sorted into Ravenclaw and doesn't really make any friends in his first year. He's never had friends before in canon, so I imagine he might have some difficulty in approaching people.

Perhaps his isolation regularly sends him to the Hogwarts library where he comes to the attention of one Hermione Granger?

Anyway, if you know of something like that, any recommendations would be appreciated.


** I don't have any suggestions, but just the other day I was commenting on how strange it seemed that Harry acts like a normal boy (relatively), with no signs of abuse and good social skills.

*** That's exactly what I was thinking.

I have absolutely no experience of such things, nor do I know anyone who has, but I can't imagine someone who grew up like that can just hop on a train and strike up a conversation with the first person who happens along. You'd expect there to be a lack of social skills at least.

**** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]]?

Not Ravenclaw, though.

#+begin_quote
  Systematically abused and degraded children do not suddenly turn into well-adjusted members of society when removed from the abusive situation. Nor do they tend to be very trusting of others, or forgiving.

  Over the course of the journey to Hogwarts, a shy boy in search of a toad, a bushy-haired girl interested in his reading material, and a blonde boy full of arrogance all stopped by the compartment. Harry pointedly ignored them all, refusing to respond to any of them.

  Once at the dock, Harry managed to procure for himself a boat without accompaniment, by the simple expedient of waiting until all the other students had boarded, then entering an empty one.

  By the end of his first Potions class he had already tooled his displayed personality around Snape's classroom as submissive, and eager to please, something that infuriated him to do. It kept the bully's attention focused on him rather than his classmates however, and Harry decided silently to count that as a personal victory.

**** Not really, media coverage and the promotion of the /traumatised/ victim has warped the puplic perception of abuse and the effects of abuse. Most victims of childhood abuse tend to have problems much later in life usually after they have their kids and realise that their own childhood was not /normal/. But as children unless abuse is severe you'd never tell. This is partly why so much abuse goes undiscovered and unreported.

****** I'm gonna preface this with; I'm writing this on my phone on a train.

For the most part not really, as is kinda the point of the problem. Abuse (in the family and/of children) is one those things that the more you look at it the murkier and seeder it gets.

For example, we can only protect the children that we can see. So if a child is being abused and is for all intents and purposes appearing normal it is unlikely that they can be identified. So what we know is from cases that we've uncovered, which means the child was acting in a way that allowed them to be identified by somebody.

Moreover, /normal/ children of abuse can know to /hide it/, ignore it out of ignorance as children of poverty do (i.e don't know know or realize their poor) or hide it because of embarrassment. Often children blame themselves for the abuse and feel that they are in someway the cause of it and that if other adults find out they'll be angry at them too. Again making them hard to find.

So in these sort of cases its often only through the building of a relationship and a long discussion with the child, that abuse may be inadvertently revealed. And then that might never be reported. For example, for a piece of my research I looked at male authority figures, babysitters, teachers, youth group leaders etc, as they tend to get 'hit on' by children who are being sexually abused because they (the children) think that sexual favors are a sign appreciation or love, and then these males will not make an accusation out of fear of being branded as an instigator or pedo themselves, allowing the abuse to continue.

There is a list for what to look out for, and a good one can be found [[http://www.helpguide.org/mental/child_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm][here]]. But again it falls into the same trap as being abuse that we can /see/.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi fits the bill.
