Hermione isn't the first or even the only muggleborn student in Hogwarts with Western values.

Why is she the only one who raised "House Elves are Slaves" topic?

Even Harry would gladly ignore it and he actually served as a House Elf to Dursleys for most of his life!

Is there more in this than Hermione knows? (and let's ignore the Interviews Of the God).


** I assume most muggleborn students are too busy struggling to figure out how the moving staircases and stuff work to have time for extracurricular activities like this.

In real life, much of our chocolate is grown by slave labor and kids don't care about that either.

*** That's a good point. I hardly know any people IRL who care that the products of fast fashion shops like H&M, sneaker companies like Nike, and cheap consumer electronics that make waffle irons and USB fans are assembled by underpaid third world workers.

On the same level as caring about house elf welfare, I doubt muggleborn students would care about where their potions ingredients come from. Things like unicorn hairs and boomslang skins can be harvested humanely, and the plant-based ones seem okay (if you don't question the mandrakes), and then you start to wonder where the ashwinder eggs and murtlap tentacles come from...

Well, the suppliers probably don't care about going Cruelty Free.

*** It comes down to a question of how well the house elves manage to stay out of sight. Modern business practices that rely on exploitation of people and animals and the environment are only successful when they're obscured enough to avoid having to think about the production process.

The Weasley twins are the only students mentioned in canon besides the Golden Trio that know about the kitchens, right? And the house elves probably use all the other magic of Hogwarts (staircases, gargoyles,etc) to disguise their actions so they don't get bothered by the kids

** To me, it seems like a case of ingrained habit that has taken such a pervasive grasp on the Wizarding World. The overwhelming consensus is that the House Elves have always been servants and that will always be the case.

For example, imagine that an alien landed on Earth and opens communication with the general populace. For a few years, they are busy learning all about us, almost obsessively so. One day, without consulting any human, they suddenly announce that all dogs are slaves of humanity and they will be starting a movement to free the canines from their shackles.

That sounds pretty stupid, right? Dogs are not our slaves, they're our friends. We provide them food and shelter and they, in return, love us, hunt with us, defend us, entertain us, etc. Who is this alien to judge us when they never even bothered to ask humanity why we keep dogs as pets? In a nutshell, this is how Hermione is viewed by the Wizarding World.

Now I have to admit that the metaphor is not perfect. House Elves are sentient beings with their own desires and choices. Dogs are not sentient, as best as science can deduce. However, I believe this comparison still has some merit.

**** Hmm, so I did, misread the question as why do the wizards as a whole not do much about the House Elf issue.

In that case then, perhaps a combination of ignorance and apathy. The House Elves are not something that come up in regular, everyday conversation with Muggleborn. As someone else pointed out, it is probably fairly common they go their entire careers at Hogwarts not even realizing the elves do all the cooking and cleaning.

For the ones that do know, they probably do not care all that much about the situation. After all, how many elves besides Dobby seem to be angry about their status? It just is not a worthwhile fight in that case to those.

#+end_quote

I'm inclined to say yes.

Hermione "does research" for all of 2-3 days at most after they get back to Hogwarts, and then proclaims that it's slavery and starts on her group. She also attends classes and meals like normal during these days.

Not sure about you, but when I need to research a practice that spans centuries or millennia, I certainly won't be finished in 2-3 months, forget 2-3 days.

And gobbos and centaurs have different views of the world - they don't see morality or ownership, to take a couple of examples, the same way a human does - so it isn't a large leap to assume that house elves too have a different view of their enslavement compared to a human would. Centuries and/or millennia of service and bondage will eventually make a race more servile, especially when you have something like magic in the equation.

Hagrid, who most people agree is quite knowledgeable on magical creatures, says that they don't want emancipation.

It could be just another instance of Hermione being arrogant enough to think that no one in the past (like Albus, for example) has ever thought of this matter and kept quiet about it. She certainly has enough arrogant moments throughout the series to lend weight to this.

*** That's bullshit. If Hermione were wrong, someone would have told her. McGonagall, Dumbledore, a prefect once the elves stopped cleaning Gryffindor tower, Molly, Arthur - someone would have told her "hey, it's not like that". SOmething would have been written in the books she found - in one of the best libraries of the magical world. But there isn't. There's nothing redeemable.

And everyone calls it enslavement. Dumbledore too, when he explains how Harry inherited Kreacher. It's a fucked-up evil system, and that of all the named elves, two want to leave their owners and suffer for it, and the other gets thrown away like a broken tool proves that as well.

That the slaves claim to want to be slaves is quite natural - for slaves who can be ordered to mutilate themselves as punishment, or on a whim.

And Hagrid /does/ tell her to lay off. There you go, an actual professor telling her that her vision isn't the right one.

McGonagall might have done it - but she seems to be extremely distant from her students. She doesn't bother too much when actual students in her school are in danger from mythical monsters, dementors or Umbridge, so why would she care about Hermione's doings? Same goes for Albus.

Molly and Arthur, well, they don't have any house elves to speak of, and I think I recall Ron mentioning that Molly would have liked an elf at some point in the series. Might have been book 2 or 4.

It's literally only Hermione who gives a damn about this, and if you're of the opinion that everyone else is all for slavery...well, there's no point in replying really, because I'll never agree to that.

I've seen people make the "Hermione does research" argument - but that's a pathetically weak argument. I repeat, reading for a few hours in a school library about a practice that goes back centuries or even millennia is nowhere near enough to form a comprehensive conclusion. Only someone who's arrogant and/or ignorant AF can ever make a conclusion from such little effort.

It's like the equivalent of saying that you can write a thesis on the socioeconomic conditions of the Dhimmi in Islamic sultanates after reading a few books for a week, that's how ridiculous it is.

I suggest you read the books before you sprout fanon. Here's the direct quote by Dumbledore: "He was forced to do Sirius's bidding because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved."

Ron calls it enslavement as well. As do others. No one claims it's not slavery.

Yeah, as much as some fanboys hate it, Hermione's the one who in the right. House-elves are slaves. With all the evil that implies. Even if they want to serve, that doesn't mean they need to be slaves.

And /I/ suggest you take your own advice. Here's the actual passage. There's no mention of the word enslavement or any related words anywhere.

#+begin_quote
  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited--"

  He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, "What the hell is that?"

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.

  "Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. "Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, won't --"

  "As you can see, Harry," said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."

  "I don't care," said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. "I don't want him."

  "Won't, won't, won't, won't--"

  "You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?"

  "Won't, won't, won't, won't--"

  Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.

  "Give him an order," said Dumbledore. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."

  "Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!"

  Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, "Kreacher, shut up!"

  It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.

  "Well, that simplifies matters," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "It means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher."

  "Do I--do I have to keep him with me?" Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.

  "Not if you don't want to," said Dumbledore. "If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him."

  "Yeah," said Harry in relief, "yeah, I'll do that. Er--Kreacher--I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves."

  Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.

  "Good," said Dumbledore. "There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements--"

** I always felt like canon really dropped the ball here, and the whole ‘but house elves LIKE being slaves' thing makes my skin crawl--- because that line of reasoning was used as a justification for enslaving real people back in the day. Hermione's crusade might've been somewhat poorly thought-out, but the fact that wizards regularly make use of sentient beings and don't think twice about it, who work for no compensation and are magically compelled to punish themselves if they displease their masters, is easily one of the more disturbing aspects of the series.

*** I think it's a combination of a) “that's how it's always been”, b) house elves being a legitimately other species who for all we know was made by wizards to be servants, and c) Hermione was pushing for freedom for everyone of a group who didn't want to be free even after seeing the effects on a freed elf, and d) What would happen to house elves after they are free? Would the owners pay them or kick them out? I think if it was something like “you can't abuse your house elf “or something like that it would be more effective outside of Hermione not being a good PR rep. After all making a huge blanket goal to free elves who don't want to be free couldn't be easy. Also I can't remember but do we see elves other than kreacher and Donny punishing themselves? If not then I could definitely see black and Malloy families and others like them forcing that in them.

** If other muggleborn students cared about elf rights, and it was included in the books, then they would be bloatier than they already are. The SPEW subplot is one of the most hated parts of the series, next to the Grawp subplot, and Lupin and Tonks' romance which came out of nowhere and was poorly developed enough that many readers questioned if Lupin even liked her.

On the other hand, Harry only learned about the existence of elves, and Hermione only knew about abused house elves, due to their exposure to Dobby and pureblood Death Eater families who kept them. Other muggleborns, for example Justin in Hufflepuff, might have been part of a majority muggleborn clique where this would never have been brought up, and they'd go on assuming that all the meals in the Great Hall were made by magic, without ever knowing any better.

Without that bonding them together, Ron and Harry would have just ignored her for the rest of their school years together. Even by Year 4, she was selling badges and buttons for SPEW, and no one cared enough to join her club.

Realistically, an extended SPEW subplot with Hermione in-character would be a futile exercise of Hermione trying and failing to convince people she's right. She is not charismatic or socially astute enough to persuade people over to her side. Even with the D.A., people only joined because of Harry and his reputation.

From a writing perspective, I would hate it and skip it over re-reads. Perhaps it would have made sense from a story told from Hermione's PoV, but since it's in Harry's, he would end up ignoring it or not paying attention to it.

Harry, after learning about house elves, still did not know there were elves at Hogwarts. It truthfully isn't until fourth year that Harry comes to realize that elves are critical to Hogwarts, and only then when Dobby reaches out to him first. And finally, it is only after Dobby reaches out to Harry that the ‘brightest witch of her age' realizes that their how deeply their lives are impacted by elf labor and begin to do something about it.

Remove Dobby from the equation and you get an interesting situation where one of the most observant, inquisitive, and prone to investigation muggleborns never learns about house elves until Winky, and never learns about them at Hogwarts period.

**** Ron is a part of the magic culture that led to the enslavement of house elves. Seeing the frankly alarming reaction most elves have to being freed I don't anticipate a large abolitionist movement.

If you see the enslavement of house elves as wrong (which isn't hard to see) it still requires perspective. If you took survivors of Auschwitz and imediatly upon their liberation fed them a seven course meal, you would likely kill them.

It is highly reasonable that those that know about hourse elves dont care, and those that care cant do anything.

I would deeply encourage those thinking about the morality of house elf enslavement to consider this: house elves are sentient; house elves can make their own choices; given the choice between freedom and servitude house elves overwhelmingly choose servitude. I for one found it fascinating how JKR made it so clear that Hermione cared more for the idea of elves than actually cared to learn about elves. This girl practically lived for research, yet her S.P.E.W. Iniative wasn't reseaech or fact driven, nor was it supported by any of her victims.

Someone who has always breathed air, never encountered a fish, and saw a mermaid in the lake, might react poorly. A compasionate person might even ‘rescue' the mermaid, taking her onto land and suffocating her. It takes more than good intentions to properly apply your morals to a foriegn world. It requires patience and understanding.

** I'm going to have to go with: There's more to the story that we never find out, and most people who find out about house elves get the whole story. We the reader don't though because our viewpoint characters into the issue are: Harry (underachieving everymen with blinders and motivation difficulties), and Hermione, who while brilliant, does tend to fall into the trap of "I'm smart and know better, everyone else is wrong."

Which means that Hermione probably WOULDN'T look further into the actual reasons/logic/history/whatever, because it's wrongness is so self-evident to her, and even is somebody told her, she'd be likely to dismiss it as wrong/biased/apologia. There's also the fact that we don't see many house elves being mistreated. Doby is the only one IIRC, and Doby is... well lets be honest, the guys kinda coocoo for cocopuffs. It very well might be that the nominal or average master/elf relationship is nothing like what we see between Malfoy/Doby. The only other one we see in any detail is Winky I think? But then, her punishment is to be given clothes and let go. To which she reacts rather badly, going into a depressive spiral. But... normal people that get used as a scape goat and fired/let go can and do do that too, so I don't think there's anything there.

I could easily see Mafoy cruelty and Doby crazyness feeding on each other, spiraling WAY out of bounds of what is normal.

​

Hell, all you need to do to turn Hermione from "Brilliant witch fighting for the downtrodden house elf" to "Dangerous Lunatic endangering lives" is have the master/elf bond providing something the elves need or strongly value. Maybe it's magic, maybe it's the act of cleaning, whatever. This kinda automatically takes them out of the slave category.

I dunno, there's just way too much stupidity in the house elf world building to really work with in any reasonable fashion. Lets not forget that: 1. Elves clean, wash, etc. 2. Elves are apparently immediately released if they touch an article of cloth. 3. It doesn't even need to be their masters cloths.

IIRC in cannon Hermione was hiding cloths in rooms to try and free the house elves? Or is that fanfiction? And they were actually scared of her for doing so? 1. I can't imagine Malfoy washes his own socks, he probably tosses them to the house elf to be washed and put away. 2. If Hermione really could free the house elves by hiding cloths for them to accidentally find and be released, you could start some fun shit by visiting wizard homes and handing out cloths to their elves... Or even just tossing your coat to one fully expecting it to be hung up.

At the very LEAST I would say that freeing a house elf requires 1. INTENT, and 2. BY their Master. Malfoy lacked one when he freed Doby, and Hermione wasn't the second for the Hogwarts elves. So it's all bullshit you can twist in any way you want.

*** Hermione did hide clothes around Gryffindor tower. While I don't think it would actually work, according to Dobby the elf had to be presented clothes by his master, which I would assume require a teacher at least and maybe even require the headmaster as 'The Master'. Still, it pissed the Hogwarts elves off and they eventually stopped cleaning Gryffindor tower.

I agree INTENT by the MASTER is needed to free the elf in question. Imagine a wizard coming home and handing his cloak to his elf. Really? That's instant freedom? Personally I think Harry tricking Malfoy was pretty dodgy and only worked because Dobby was a weirdo and actually wanted freedom and used loophole abuse.

**** I think I saw one theory that Dobby was never actually free but was more of a runaway slave. I read it here [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/basilisk.html]]

  But I am no longer convinced that Dobby was ever properly free.

  Four years later he is still trying to throw himself in the fire when he speaks poorly of the Malfoys. Nor does he ever settle down to dish the dirt about their past activities. And, for that matter, how was he able to pop directly into the cellar of the manor in DHs. Don't you think the Malfoys (in common with everybody else) would have had some kind of Apparation barrier for Elves that were not theirs? I think that when Albus hired Dobby, Albus was fully aware that what he was doing was harboring and giving protection to a runaway slave.

*** Hermione did research the matter extensively in canon - it's stated so. In the Hogwarts Library, even. So, unless there's some huge conspiracy where people colluded to keep the true secret of the house elves from her, and no one, ever, told her, it's clear she's not wrong about elves. And, in canon, Dumbledore calls it slavery. Not a bond. Not a smybiotic relationship - slavery. Magically enforced. Further, Kreacher is forced into servitude against his will - twice. First Sirius, then Harry. Inherited like a piece of property; no bond mentioned at all.

Cool. I'm going to look up all I can about architecture online. I fully intend to become an Master of architecture in about a week. Thank you for letting me know its that easy to know everything there is about a subject, just grab a book for a week, and poof! You are master of that subject.

All mockery aside, that does not work. Here is a stream of a man who researched law for a couple of days and tried arguing with a lawyer. Spoiler, he failed miserably. [[https://youtu.be/cXZIrnlKlCs]]

** I really do find it frustrating in a fic when someone (either Super!Harry or Draco or some other pureblood) casually informs Hermione that the House Elves /need/ a bond or they will die/lose their magic/go insane and Hermione immediately gives up her belief that House Elves should be free.

Largely because this often goes hand in hand with the assumption that she did no research whatsoever after discovering the whole thing and that all it takes is one book which explains it and she'll completely change her mind.

It feels patronising.

Let's say it's true, surely there would be multiple theories on why the bond was so necessary and yet so apparently one sided (wizards aren't hurt or damaged by having House Elves and yet they can order a House Elf to iron their ears or shut their fingers in an oven). So having one book which apparently explains it all seems a little unlikely.

Two-three days of reading is not nearly enough time. A month wouldn't be enough and that's if you used internet. She had to find books about it, books in a huge library.

**** A month wouldn't be enough to undertake a deep study of exactly why House Elves require a bond and how that bond works specifically.

But to discover that such a bond exists and is necessary, yeah two-three days is enough. Since it's unlikely to be a huge secret and is instead likely to be the first fact in any book mentioning House Elves.

If you knew nothing about Henry VIII and I told you he married six women, it might take you a month to deal with the nuances of each relationship and their impact on the politics of the time. But it would take you far less than that to learn that they were married one after the other not all at once, the order in which they were married and their causes of death.

***** First of all the libary is huge. Finding stuff would be hard. Secondly, that assumes that Hogwarts posses many books about House Elfs. Wizards don't pay much attention to them or care about their capabilities so the amount of writting on them would be minimal. Thirdly the books could very well be biased in the Wizards point of view. She could realize that and assume she is right because she perceives herself to have a moral high ground.

If I used internet (full of many diffrent sources I could use which provides me an opportunity to develop my own opinion) it would take me a manner of minutes. If I went to a libary it would take a hell lot more. They might not even have books about him.
