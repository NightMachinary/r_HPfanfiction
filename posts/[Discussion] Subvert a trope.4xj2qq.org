** Manipulative Dumbledore: Dumbledore has been burned by trusting others in the past and keeps his secrets because thats the only way to defeat Voldemort and the Death Eaters. He even keeps crucial information from Harry, which might have been able to save lives (Sirius) if it had been out there. Despite all this, Dumbledore loves Harry like the son he never had and is determined that Harry receive the training and information he needs in order able to defeat Voldemort once and for all.

This sounds suspiciously like canon...

*** What about this?

Harry reminds Dumbledore of his long lost one true love Gellert Grindelwald. The same passion, the same good heart and will to do good. Because of it, Dumbledore is unable to trust Harry, despite loving him as a child, but he knows he had to work with him because of the prophecy. With time he's able to grow over it but much too late, he's then cursed by the Gaunt ring and doesn't have time to properly train Harry before he has to go... He's also sure that he will have to face and kill Harry in the end for a huge part of the story.

*** My favorite manipulative!Dumbledore is linkffn(When Harry Met Wednesday).

Dumbledore manipulates Harry with magic, altering his personality and memories because Harry is a psychopath. It's very well done, no bashing at all. The fic also subverts the evil Dursleys well too.

Totally canon:

- When others were using their magic to levitate feathers, he was levitating mountain troll clubs. Using an inherited wand.
- He spent his second year using a broken wand. He still passed all his classes. Clearly, there's talent for controlled wandless magic there.
- Ronbledore Theory makes a lot more sense in this context.

Daphne realizes this and gives Harry a "let's be friends" talk. Harry isn't the type to be angry about it; instead, he gets mopey, and Daphne has to spend the better part of an hour comforting him.

**** My apologies. I thought this was a place for fan fiction, not for [[/u/howtopleaseme]]'s headcanon.

Harry grew up in the UK in the 1980s. He is in some ways a product of that culture. Men expecting sex in exchange for being nice to women is a feature of that culture. It is not /unusual/ to have that attitude. You don't have to be a glory seeker or motivated by reputation or anything like that to expect sex in exchange for being nice to women.

As an example of how pervasive and easily ignored this attitude is, look at the phrase "friend zone", how widely used it is, and its connotations. It's not unusual to accept the concept of a friend zone as being valid and existing. The attitude I'm talking about is a small intuitive step from the friend zone.

There may be the possibility of the female character falling in love with the guy eventually, like if the guy stays and tries to help her through it.

Or maybe she'd latch on to the guy because it was an traumatic event to experience and because of the trauma she mistakes her feelings as love if she has continued relations with the guy?

But all the she might fall in love with her saviour are due to keeping in contact and not immediate love just because you saved me.

**** Good point.

Alternate: Petunia married Vernon for a reason. She wanted access to his family's magic.

The Dursleys were mages who left the magical world to avoid the constant stream of Dark Lords, but they were drawn in every generation thanks to the Hogwarts register. Lacking the skills of the Gaunt family at protective enchantments to hide from the registry, they instead turned to more difficult options: removing magical abilities from their line.

It took a fair bit of research, but they came on three methods. One, which they used on their own children, involved systematic abuse and blood runes. The second was a ritual that drained a fetus's magical abilities. The last is fatal.

Having seen what happened to Lily, Petunia wanted to keep her own family well away from Magical Britain. The Dursley ritual would ensure that no child of hers fell victim to the wizarding world.

And then Harry came. The prenatal ritual wouldn't help a yearling infant. Killing the child would do it no good. That only left one way for Harry to stay free. So they abused Harry, and they took his blood to etch runes around the house, but the blood-based protections that Dumbledore set up prevented them from working.

In the end, this mistreatment provided the power Voldemort knew not: Harry used the Dursley's third method, destroyed Voldemort's magic, and vanquished him.

** Manipulative Dumbledore: He's genuinely trying his best to be good.

Checking arms to find death eaters: Voldemort realized this might happen and created a spell that could remotely put dark marks on his enemies, though they were just tattoos, not magic.

The cupboard under the stairs was actually surprisingly large and comfortable. Vernon and Petunia weren't actively abusive, though they were negligent.

Severus Snape is forgiven for taking away points by the staff unfairly because they honestly don't feel points matter much. They just view it as a system to get students to behave.

The prefects bathroom Harry goes to in book 4 is actually the /male/ prefects bathroom. There is a separate one for females.

The ancient and most noble house title is one that the Blacks came up with for themselves, not an honorific given to certain families. It does not reflect anything about wizarding society except the Blacks.

Ted Tonks is taken care of by Andromeda Tonks. I believe that JKR mentioned that in an interview once, but no one seems to remember it.

The reason that Slytherin house seems like a house for the troublemakers is that the sorting hat has been ordered by the professors to put the people who seem based on their brains like they might become future troublemakers in that house, so they can be more easily kept away from other students.

Guns are /not/ effective on wizards. There could be a number of reasons for this: Wizard robes can block kinetic piercing objects, wizards could be much tougher than Muggles, in the time it takes to properly aim a gun a wizard can easily put up a shield, the killing curse is genuinely more effective...

Professor Binns isn't just a bad teacher, it's that History of Magic is genuinely that boring of a subject.

Wandless magic is not trainable because it is only accessible in times of extreme emotion.

The Order of the Pheonix was an effective force that managed to kill a lot of Death Eaters (albeit unnamed ones), but they are trying to remain covert in book 5 and are very good at not letting the main characters know about their operations because they feel they are too young.

Goblins and Centaurs, with a few exceptions, are dicks. That is why they are treated badly.

  Guns are not effective on wizards. There could be a number of reasons for this: Wizard robes can block kinetic piercing objects, wizards could be much tougher than Muggles, in the time it takes to properly aim a gun a wizard can easily put up a shield, the killing curse is genuinely more effective...
#+end_quote

This will need more work. In order...

- If that were true, shield robes would be unnecessary. However, shield robes do exist separately from normal robes.

- Wizards may be tougher than muggles, but you're underestimating the ludicrous amount of energy behind a bullet. Even pitifully small handgun rounds have enough energy to cause damage in remote parts of the body simply from shockwave of the body absorbing the energy. Wizards would have to be nearly Superman to be bullet-resilient.

- Well, possibly, but that's only if they see it coming. It'd really be a "who acted first" scenario, which is really how that works, magic or not. At less than 100 yards, a wizard might be able to see what's coming and put up a shield before the gunman fires. Any farther, we're well beyond the effective range of a wand from every example we've seen, and most people can't see details that fine much farther.

- I'll give you that. In terms of killing power, well, the magic that instantly kills somebody is more effective than the brute force method of throwing a fast piece of metal at them hoping to cause lethal damage. Still, lethality is only part of the picture. Otherwise, soldiers would all be armed with M2's and anti-materiel rifles.

My personal theory as to why we never see guns is three-fold:

First, wizards never adopted guns because they don't replace wands. Wands are like knives. They're a universal tool used in everyday life (or at least, what knives used to be). They just also happen to be capable of every other task imaginable. You don't get much benefit from having guns. Though there's a lot of comparisons of wands to guns, they're actually pretty far apart in intended purpose.

Second, by the time guns were /decisively/ more effective killing devices, wizards had long since been removed from muggle cultures. When muggles and wizards interacted more, the most advanced guns were short-range matchlocks. Noisy, relatively inaccurate, single shot, slow to load, and just generally a pain to use. The only other similar weapon being /cannons/, which are massive artillery meant to be used against armies and ships, not individuals in a duel. For wizarding purposes, guns are probably less efficient overall.

Third, magical healing makes anything not lethal in the next 15 minutes basically irrelevant. As long as dark magic isn't involved, healing wounds is easy. Limbs can be reattached without major issue, bones can be completely regrown overnight, and minor wounds can be solved in a matter of seconds. Unless you'll definitely kill somebody in a few minutes, a wizard can either heal themselves or find somebody who can. Therefore, you either need to use a /really/ big round, be very accurate, or riddle them with holes.

** One day when Harry is 7, the Dursleys go too far. Harry discovers magic while locked hurt into his cupboard. He discovers that he is a lot more powerful than the people around him. Affraid, he decides that since he's so much more powerful and strong than the others he'll have to be a lot more cautious as well. He will not interfere in the affairs of others, always try to avoid confrontation and always fight his own anger, for fear of hurting somebody. As a result, he won't be sorted in Griffindor, for lack of courage, but in Ravenclaw (where he can best avoid others). Dumbledore will have to take him under his tutelage far sooner than in canon, to reverse the blocks Harry has put on himself. Harry will have a really hard time accepting that he has to eventually face Voldemort. At first he'll be friendly with Hemione, a bit of a outcast herself, but her personnality will soon be too much for him to bear, they will finally put up but only in the later years. Harry will be more or less alone in his first year and then will befriend Luna and Colin Crevey in his second year. It will become better for him after he meet his godfather at the end of third year. He will be a target for Draco and his goons as well as Ron and other Griffindors who don't anderstand why the boy who lived behave the way he does, but will eventually become good friends.

**** I put the Ron bit mostly because you always have this fic where Ron picks on Harry because Ron's a dick. I think Ron being unable to understand why his hero behaves like he does, and blaming him for the death of his uncles (for exemple) would be a good subvertion. But Ron being a good guy, they would finaly get along well after a time.

For Draco, I can honestly see him picking on Harry because his status of BWL and his apparent weakness. At the very least it will give him kudos with the Slytherins.

And let's be honest, a story needs some conflict, those two are good to provide it.

*** It's not that clear, I think. Practicing magic does involve performing the same hand movement perhaps hundreds of times, while enunciating a particular phrase, all accompanied by an unstated but, in all evidence, fairly intense cognitive component. Doing that for hours can certainly make one feel tired.

I never said Harry seeks attention. In fact, I pointed out that Harry not wanting attention was a difference between Harry and Sasuke. Where is the evidence that Harry isn't outgoing?
