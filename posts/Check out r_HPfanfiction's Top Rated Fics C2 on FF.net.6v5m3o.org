*** My suggestion would be to have some sort of threadl where people could submit new fics to be added, then people could upvote or down vote the submitted fics and the ones that end up with a certain number of upvotes would then be added to the C2.

Or if you want to get really fancy run some sort of parser to see what the most frequently rec'd fics are and add those.

*** Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian because it is one of the gems of the fandom. Dark, brutal and still updating after a decade. Possibly the best opening chapter of any fic.

The First Day by littlebird0 because this is likely the best immediately post-DH fics there is.

Strangers at Drakesaugh because this the prominent fic in one of the best canon compliant post-Hogwarts universes (Northumbrian's).

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19 because this is one of the few really good romance fics in the fandom.

The Skitterleap, The Forests of Valbone and/or By the Divining Light because enembee's work certainly deserves to be represented here. All of these fics are great in different ways.

Unatoned by SeriousScribble because along with Resurrexit, is one of the best written pieces of HP fanfiction.

The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger because how the hell is this not on there already.

I would have expected to see A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh, which I have heard is excellent.

I see most of these rec'd all the time on this sub.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot.

*** I should also say, "Top Rated" is definitely the wrong term to use if there isn't any actual rating going on. Top rated generally implies something about quality, where as a term like "favorite" implies the recommendation is based on taste.

** Ok, so this is going to be pretty rough if it's just a conglomeration. Like, if there's slash, and Hermione/Snape mixed in with all the floreatcastellum stories, as well as the old classics, then that's going to be a bit of a minefield since there's so many different tastes.

**** Haha, i think that may be underselling it. I have a very personal bias against that story, probably due to how highly it was spoken of to me, only for it to turn out to be a completely nonsensical piece of loosely stringed together malformed plot ideas, complete with no narrative sense, bad characterization and a "like if you cry everytim" ending

***** I thought it started well enough and ended terribly (like the author hadn't planned it properly and just picked an end - any end - out of thin air to get the thing finished). I can't really remember the middle. But every time I see it recommended I wonder if it's the same story I read. But then I think that about a lot of recs, and sadly I'm no one's target audience anyway. /rambles/

***** I actually have a soft spot for that fic and it's what I'd consider a good "starter" for newbies or anyone who wants to try something that isn't a shipfic. My standards for fic in general are lower than that of published fiction, so I'm not comparing them to, say, Woolf or Tolstoy or even King, but to other fics.

For HP fics, I'll consider something "decent" if it has a semi-fresh premise, a firm grasp on grammar, and passable writing. Tight plotting, unfortunately, is a bit rarer, so I'm more forgiving there unless it's especially bad.
