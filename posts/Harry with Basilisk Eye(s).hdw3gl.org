:END:
Hey guys

so i am looking for a Fanfic currently, where Harry loses one or both of his eyes while fighting the basilisk (or was it even earlier?) and thus takes the eyes of the snake to replace his lost one(s)

any idea which fanfic that might have been?

Kudos!


** Not exactly on point but there is a fic where the blood and venom of the Basilisk gets in Harry's eyes and changes them. It's called Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone

Used a link instead of the bot due to the story tags

Edit: I've never come acrossed/read a story with that plot line.

***** I took a break from reading it after the scene of Harry talking to the captain of the ship when he had trouble taking the gangplank down. Haven't gone back to it yet but probably will at some point since it's on my list.

****** Wow... you read a lot of chapters. Others have mentioned that they lose interest around those chapters. I'll take a look at them... see if I can make the story flow better. Thanks for letting me know!

*** Sorry, I'm a bit confused why can't you use the bot because of the story tags? (sorry, this isn't important I'm just curious)

**** The summary for this story has one line of text (17 words. "As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom......some gets in his eyes."

It then has 22 lines of Character tags and then 21 lines of additional tags. Basically 158 tags (369 words).

The bot is good for giving you the summary of the story and some information in terms of completion status, published date, word count etc. But the real benefit is the summary. Using the bot for a tag heavy fic is not worth it. You would get one line of summary and then more than a page of tags.

** Hey this sounds interesting. I've read a bit of "Deadly Eyes of a Phoenix Reborn" but that doesn't sound like what you were looking for. I'd link it but I'm pretty sure it's got questionable content
