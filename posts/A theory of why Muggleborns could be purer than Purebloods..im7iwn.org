This may sound weird but it's something I've been thinking about for a bit.

Let's start with what I'm basing my theory off of. Genetics. With inbreeding there is not enough diversity and causes long-term problems in the form off illness and disabilities. What if the same thing could be said about magic? You have to assume magic is either a genetic trait or isn't a universal one size fits all sorts of thing. If there is no change or diversity, the magic just gets uses and used become unstable and weak.

Now think about this. Say Muggleborns were gifted their magic somehow. If it was gifted from Mother Magic or whatever, wouldn't that be purer because it's coming straight from the source and not passed down? If we go with the theory of magic being inherit, if it was gifted and never used before. It's new, healthy and untouched.

Just a rambling thought I have.

*** One an indigenous fic sounds great, but I won't write one. I had put a Native American in one of my fics and some people found it to be out of place and didn't like it. I tried to do research to make it fit but I don't have personal experience and I feel I would muck something up and offend people.

Yes blood and magic is a moot point but I guess I thought of it more for a possible comeback in a fic.

** Some canon support for this: the Gaunts. They weren't shown to be particularly weak magically (bar Merope, but that was due to a use rather than actually being a squib), but they were definitely showing the signs of generations of inbreeding. The Merope rapes a Muggle and out comes Tom Riddle, arguably the most powerful wizard since Dumbledore. Yes, he was a deranged sociopath, but that could very well due to nurture rather than nature, and only worsened when he split his soul apart.

** But Purebloods like the Malfoys are the establishment, and they are not likely to give up their privileges and entitlements without a fight!

In fact, they would feel even more threatened by the theory that Muggleborns are some kind of 'gift of magic', and they would employ all kinds of dirty means (bribe the Ministry and Daily Prophet, murder those who propose this theory) to suppress it.

*** I can totally see pureblood families watching each generation born less powerful (some even squibs) and looking at some muggleborns come from nowhere and feeling threatened, then plotting to discredit them accusing them of "stealing magic", being unnatural and not belonging to their world. Pureblood families conspiring to get rid of muggleborns rather than being upstaged by them certainly sounds right.

** Maked a lot of sense, magic definitely has to come from somewhere, whether it be genetics (the magical gene would've had to have mutated at some point in the past giving way to the first generation of witches and wizards) or a gift bestowed upon a few who then passed it on to their children and so on. Besides the fact that some Half-bloods are regarded as extremely powerful (i.e. Voldemort, Dumbledore) it is possible that the influx of fresh magical blood strengthens pureblood lines and results in more powerful children, specially with the amount of inbreeding that has occurred within pureblood society which, in relatively small wizarding communities like the British, is even more alarming; we now basically most pureblood wizards are related to each other at this point, if not all of them.
