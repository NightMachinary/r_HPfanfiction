** linkffn(Renegade Cause) starts slightly disappointingly and doesn't immediately hook you in, but read a few chapters and you're in for a 500k word ride.

** linkffn(Unatoned): depending on your thought on noir style that is.

linkffn(What You Leave Behind): probably abandoned, but it is an enjoyable read with a lot of interesting ideas on the whole. I would probably recommend this one above anything else.

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): pace is a little bit sacrificed for the sake of the mystery, but its a great story with a true tragic Harry.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time): probably one of the most interesting time travel stories, though I cannot remember right now if there was bashing.

Taken together linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) are easily novel length, with some interesting ideas that you won't see anywhere else. Ditto for enembee's other work linkffn(The Skitterleap) one the most interesting AU's out there.

I would also throw in link(The Unforgiving Minute), predominantly because its one of the most unique storylines I've come across, with a lot of things most of the fandom wouldn't touch.

** Not really sure what the stories you put in the title are, but one of the greatest reads I've read in a while is Gryffindor's Girl. It's a fem!Harry story (which is probably why it isn't that popular) that has fem!Harry receiving all of Canon Harry's memories up until he dies before her third year. And, unlike other time travel stories, it has plenty of twists that don't make it an exact rehashing.

**** It's a rehash in the sense it follows a basic outline to the books. But it also does forge a new path; for instance, Mary proves Sirius' innocence before she's even halfway into her third year (if she even started it at all, that detail escapes me). This leads her to getting away from the Dursleys and never going back.

There's lots of other new things that happen, but I'm not going to spoil the story. =P Also, one thing I forgot to add: the author has not directly stated who they're going to put with Mary. A few of us have some theories about who it will be, but I'm not going to spoil your fun with those theories either. Because, well, they're only theories lol.
