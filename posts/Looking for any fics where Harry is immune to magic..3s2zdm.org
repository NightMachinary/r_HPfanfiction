As in no spell cast on Harry works. I think that would be cool to read about.

*** I have some sort of awkward attraction towards lack of conflict. Everyone around Harry is trying to disturb his life, I think it would be hilarious if everything they tried failed and Harry just went to Hogwarts like he was normal.

There are plenty of ways to make a story dramatic without magic. You just gotta think outside of the Wizarding Box. ;)

*** There is actually a fairly popular anime where the premise is that the main characters right hand negates all abnormalities in the world(Psychic powers, magic, etc) it manages to do conflict fairly well.

But secondary effects are a must, if those don't exist then it is very boring. AK, Stupefy, even undoing transmutations would make sense, but banishing a desk at Harry would still really really hurt.

Also, assuming he was still forced to join the world it would create an interesting problem with things, apparition would fail, the sorting hat would do nothing, healing magic wouldn't work. It could be a lot of fun. Though having him in Hogwarts would be pretty hard, as he is more a muggle then anything. Oh, I guess I assumed he can't cast either, because if he can cast and is immune to direct magic then he is far too op.

**** Id love for him to be as OP as possible. :P Harry Potter doesn't push-up, he pushes down the earth. (insert every chuck norris joke)

Like a parody making fun of how dependent the bad-guys are on magic for defense / offense.

It would just be Harry learning magic with a ridiculous running gag.

** I've gone with "Harry is immune to Voldemort's magic (up to his revival with Harry's blood)" in one story. Meaning, all the old defenses, curses and spells cast by Voldemort before that day in the graveyard won't affect Harry, including his horcruxes, making him the best choice to hunt the soul anchors down.

But complete immunity? Either he is too powerful, or, if he can be hurt indirectly, he's weaker rather than stronger, since magical healing won't work as well (or not at all, depending on if potions work), and yet anyone can banish some rocks at him. He might even be unable to cast spells on himself, like Protego.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

** Someone's been watchin' Dragon Ball Super, eh?

Jokes aside, I only know of one - linkffn(1325132). It's been on my to-read list for years, but I've never gotten that far with it because a fic with a more engaging opening is always around the corner. Make of that what you will.

*** I watched Battle of the Gods, FLOW did a fantastic job with the opening. And after years of exposure to the series you build a bit of a craving for the 'Biggest Fish.'

I'll check out the fic, looks like an interesting read. I knew someone had to of thought of the concept before me. Thanks!
