#+begin_quote
  With the threat of Sirius Black looming, Dumbledore feels it best that Harry Potter does not attend Hogwarts this year. Fortunately, there is an alternative. Hopefully Harry enjoys France!

** It flows quite a lot better than the first draft. The first six paragraphs could still be cut, though.

I would change the line:

#+begin_quote
  Of course, the woman's opinion was less that dirt to Harry
#+end_quote

to something like

*/Of course, Harry didn't care what she thought of him.../*

Because Harry very much cares when Marge starts shit-talking his mother.

And if they are traveling internationally, Portkey is the way to go. Otherwise, Gabriel can Apparate further than Voldemort can.

*** Thanks for your review! I never really focused on apparition's abilities, so it didn't seem like a big deal. I'll change that in the near future. And you're right about the other part. It sounds much more in-tone to Harry and makes more sense.
