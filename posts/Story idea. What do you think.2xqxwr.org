** I've seen quite a few of these, some done better than others, but if you want to try your hand at writing your own take on a mentally ill Harry, I would love to try reading it.

**** You probably won't find many that fit exactly what you're looking for, and I couldn't suggest any either, as I'm not a fan of them and wouldn't remember them. Some that have Harry become somewhat unhinged (either in a good way or bad) and are therefore somewhat related that I recall would be:

A Different Fate by LordHellebore, Gryffindors Never Die by ChipmonkOnSpeed, Survivor by atruwriter, Where in the world is Harry Potter? by nonjon, Stages of Hope by Kayly Silverstorm, Wastelands of Time by Joe Ducie.

I came across a couple really good PTSD fics a while ago but I can't for the life of me find them. There's a oneshot where Hermione sends him to a psychologist (or psychiatrist, can never remember which is which) and another where I specifically remember she finds him under a bunch of blankets and Ginny doesn't know what to do so Hermione just sits there with him for a while.

Most stories that have Harry be affected as a normal person would by his time with his 'family' wind up having him turn dark and/or evil and massacre everyone for the sake of it. For example, Dinner Time by Dark-S (something or other, can't remember atm) or Dirty Little Witch by (I think) Azrael which just gets kinda weird.

Anyway, I can't remember one that specifically turns him into a troubled hero post-DH, but there are definitely some where the last battle affected him. My mind sorta skipped over the "broken" part when I said I'd read some like it. Sorry that I got your hopes up.

**** This one might fit your description, and it's a decent read:

** I'm not a fan of the genre because, in canon, Harry endures. He gets filled with angst and anger, but he still cares and loves. To me, writing a successful story along these lines would have to be tempered. Harry couldn't be broken, because he will never be isolated and unloved; but he could be depressed and struggling to find purpose.
