Sorry if the title doesn't make much sense. I'm after a fic I read I while back at least I'm pretty sure I did I could just be dreaming shit, but the main thing I remember is harry goes back in time after finding out his parents are still alive and ends up removing them from the potter family. Thanks for any help.


** I saw the Travel Secrets series in another thread, where he learns that his parents faked their deaths and Dumbles was in on it. Might be worth a look.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.
