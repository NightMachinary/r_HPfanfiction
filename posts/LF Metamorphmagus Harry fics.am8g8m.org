  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Victoria Potter by Taure has Fem!Harry metamorthmagus. It's not a major plot point yet, not fully explored, but I think Taure won't put it there for nothing. Has been few months since update though.

*** If Victoria Potter follows the same beats as Alexandra Potter, then Victoria will challenge Hermione to a magic contest with an emphasis on transfiguration to see who's the better witch. Victoria will use her metamorphagus skills to imitate human transfiguration (a very difficult skill), and when Hermione attempts to beat that, Hermione ends up severely injuring herself.

**** Oh yeah, I remember that now! I feel like Victoria is kinder than Alexandra though, but I maybe misremembering. On the other hand it's a nice plot twist, too good to give up maybe.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

  Harry discovers Metamorph abilities early in life and hides them. When he meets another of his kind years later, he's in for a rude awakening. His abilities could mean his death. Thief!Harry.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph by hermyd). Doesn't meet your additional criteria, though.

linkffn(Metamorphose by salus gem). I won't lie, this is somewhat off the wall with the story and the pairing.

linkffn(Morphed Secrets by nightkitty555). I didn't make it far into this one before quitting.

Transforming Harry by DrT ([[https://ficwad.com/story/269233]]). I didn't care for the smut, but it's not a bad story.

linkffn(Under Suspicion by Ottilchen). This was another one I gave up on quickly. YMMV.

  What if Harry met the Tonks instead of the Weasleys in kings cross. What if he was also a metamorphmagus? Harry becomes a Puff and has to resist Dumbledore's machinations and learn what it means to be a member of the Hufflepuff house. this story is adopted from Ironicism. The first three chapters are all his/her work I don't have any credit for the first three chapters. REWRITE
