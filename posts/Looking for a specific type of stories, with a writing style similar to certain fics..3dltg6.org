Hello! What I am looking for is suggestions for those rare stories that have a crude sense of humor, adventure, and a plot that does not follow canon closely. ( that obviously means no time travel or redo-stuff) Emphasis on dialogue and action rather than heavy exposition-isque tangents is preferable.

Basically, they need to be similar to this kind of stories:

Draco664's Apprentice series

The Minister's Daughter by Don E. Delivery

Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84

Shezza's Denarian series

The majority of these are first-person, but obviously i don't mind either technique.

I know what I am asking for is really difficult, since stories of this caliber are rare, but any help is appreciated :)


** Have you looked at the work of nonjon? It certainly does the crude humour bit. His story with the most adventure is probably linkffn(Lovegood, Boobs Gooder)

*** I have checked a couple of Nonjon's stories; some of them I liked ( such as Apathy and Black Comedy), and some I didn't. ( Where in the world is HP - maybe crack isn't for me. )

To be honest, I generally don't read fics with Luna as a main character, cause most writers make her out to be an annoying... something - she was a bit wonky in canon, and they just make her worse. Nonetheless, thanks for your suggestion. I will check it out.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Luna Challenge Response. Harry refuses to stay with the Dursleys and is now going to spend the summer hunting for Snorkacks with the Lovegoods. This is crude, immature, adult themed humor.

** One of my favourite action/adventure stories is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/][Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer]].

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6763981/1/][The Dark Lords Equal]] is also pretty good. Kind of on the edge of being a crack fic, but packed full of fight scenes and humour.

*** Yep, I have read Cursed Summer and it was really really good. Cheers for reminding me that one.

About the second story: I am pretty sure I read another of this writer's stories in the past and I had to stop after a couple of chapters because I didn't really like his style. Add the fact that it is kinda crackish, and you have me on the fence. But hey, you never know, so I'll give it an once over.

Thanks for the suggestions.

You mentioned you don't like crack, so this might not be your thing. But it's got action and crude humor, alright.

*** xD See the comment above, where I mention I had to stop reading a story due to the specific writer's style? Ironically enough, this was the one I was talking about.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

*** Yep. Unfortunately, couldn't get over the second person narrative. A real shame, cause the starting chapter I had read seemed really interesting otherwise, and pretty close to the genre I am looking for.

Of course, jbern's other stories rock 100% !
