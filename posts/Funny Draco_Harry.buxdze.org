I don't really read this pairing, but it's really popular so I wanted to give it a chance... But every story I look at is just, a massive load of angst and drama. Anyone got one which is lighter/more fun, with the tension played for laughs? Honestly the rivals-with-a-secret-crush idea is really funny and could be pretty good if it was less angsty.


** linkao3(Hermione Grangers Crammer for Delinquent Students) is a drarry fic that made me laugh out loud multiple times

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** I couldn't stop laughing when I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/118431/chapters/165770][Little Red Courgette]]. If you like political comedy, this one is for you.

I also thought [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2304488][Draco Malfoy: Toilet Supremo]] was hilarious. Harry needs a new toilet and Draco is the salesman.

Abandoned, but it's still one of my favorite light HP fics.
