:END:
hi guys so i'm new to this community and i'm looking for an old drarry wattpad fic i read before, but there weren't too much romantic undertone. anyway, in this story, harry gets taken in by sirius and lupin. in the first few chapters, harry gets sorted out in their home and then when sirius takes him to diagon alley, they took his blood(?) and let it drip on a piece of parchment(?) and then the parchment which houses he's heir of(?) like the house of peverell, house of black(?), etc. then after that someone removed something from harry to make him not a horcrux anymore.

also, at hogwarts the friend group consists of draco, neville, luna, hermione, ginny, and ron. there was also this scene where their friend group comforts mr. filch, and snape isn't so harsh on them but he explains that he has to live up to his image as head of slytherin house.

anyway, the story kind of goes like that and those are all i remember but i was still hoping that someone here may remember the title because i really want to reread it and i can't get it off my chest.
