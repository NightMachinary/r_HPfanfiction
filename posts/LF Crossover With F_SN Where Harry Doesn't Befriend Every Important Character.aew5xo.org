All the good F/SN crossovers end up with Harry winning the Grail war and befriending Shirou and Rin and Ilya, then getting called over to Hogwarts for the GoF. I think that Harry ending up in Einzbern Manor, becoming a homunculus or something similar, then becoming Ilya's devoted servant before going to Hogwarts normally as a first year. Does anyone know anything like that?


** Im confused, do you want that specific fic or somthing similiar?
