Any pairings but Harry/Hermione and I would prefer if there is no Weasley bashing. Also stories set after the war where Harry never went to Hogwarts are fine. Edit: No slash


** Gothic, linkffn(11922116): Harry never attended Hogwarts, has hunted down and killed all the marked Death Eaters and now collects rare artifacts from dangerous locations.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Daphne Greengrass wouldn't realise that a chance encounter at the age of eleven could have led her to have a life of adventure. Fourteen years later she meets Harry Potter again, this time over a dead body, but will she walk away or stay? He's a consulting detective and she's a healer, worlds apart from some, but for others, it could be just the beginning. AU.

** Maybe someone remembers the name of it, because my Google-Fu is weak, but I vaguely recall a fic where Harry didn't want to deal with all the attention and went back to muggle-land post-Hogwarts.

Where he promptly discovered that he had gift for making clothes (lingerie?) and became a big-shot, if reclusive, fashion designer. Does this ring any bells with someone? Think it had a HP/DG pairing but not too sure on that.

Similiar to linkffn(11692854) but, well, Post-Hogwarts and without Dumbledore.

  Harry Potter knows that money can give you power and influence. He has learned that from a young age on, seeing how his relatives get away with many things. And others having way much more than you do can be a problem. Thus he starts his path to cause a small revolution in its own right. No matter if Dumbledore doesn't like it. Two-shot.
