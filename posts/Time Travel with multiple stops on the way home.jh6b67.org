:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I have a very vague memory of a fic I read a really long time ago. It involved time travel where they needed to jump a few times to get home. I think it was a group of four, maybe traveling via medallion? The main plot point I remember is Harry having a relationship with Galatea (I think Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter). Anyone remember it?
