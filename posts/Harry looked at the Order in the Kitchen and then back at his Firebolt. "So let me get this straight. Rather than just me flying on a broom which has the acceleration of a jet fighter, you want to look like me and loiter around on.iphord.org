The Firebolt has a 0-150 speed of 10 seconds and an unknown top speed. Harry could have escaped Number 4 by simply making a run for it. Unless Voldemort had a squadron of Spitfires around, the only way any of his death eaters could have caught up if they tried to apparate into mid-air in front of Harry and then managed to hit him with a spell. And given that it's dark and there are no reference points in the air, I call that impossible.


** Voldemort had pretty good financial backup (aka Lucius Malfoy), so it was possible that his Death Eaters were on Firebolts as well. We just don't know.

Even if the brooms are equally fast, so the only Death Eaters with a chance to intercept are those already in the same direction Harry chooses to escape into. And given that brooms do not work with gravity, they cannot use energy fighting tactics to transform a potential height advantage into speed.

**** We also need to establish speed of flight verses speed of spell. Even if spells travel at the speed of light, aerial combat would require rapid spell casting to 'walk' the spell fire with the light as a tracer.

This could be overcome by mass casting which could be more effective by having an entire group as per mass musket firing which would require the group to remain in reference to each other stationary (then Harry can rapidly move away). Or have the group move in concert with each other on brooms, which would make them slower to react, then Harry would be able to out maneuver.

But we are arguing semantics here. If the Order of the Phoenix had any planning capacity at all they would have;\\
a) moved Harry anytime prior to last possible moment, forcing the death eaters to spend resources watching the area for the escape and ensuring that any broom escape would happen with less then the full compliment of death eaters.\\
b) moved Harry elsewhere somewhere between his last exam and returning to 4 Privet Drive and not allowing Death Eater the opportunity for an assassination/capture.\\
c) Not told Snape that the above 2 items were going to occur. Thus getting Harry somewhere safe and causing Death Eaters to waste resources.

** I imagine this is one of many better-than-canon ways that Harry could have left Privet Drive. (Especially if he wore the cloak). My personal method would be, assuming advance preparation took place: a member of the order that Harry trusts takes polyjuice potion to turn them into Mrs. Figg. The real Figg just stays at home while her doppelganger gains admittance to number 4 and once inside, apparates Harry away to Grimmauld Place. Or alternately, gives Harry a dose of polyjuice allowing him to look like Dudley and they walk out of the house openly together. If he left several days before his birthday, that probably would have been safer too.

If I was the Death Eaters I wouldn't have been sitting around watching the HOUSE; I would've intercepted him in the fucking car from King's Cross at the end of sixth year and apparated away with him! Just get him on an isolated stretch of freeway or something when he's going from London to Surrey! What are the Dursleys going to do? Put up an anti-apparition charm to stop harry from escaping and then swarm him with spells.

The Order has absolute top-notch cursebreakers, surely they can sneakily renovate the place to have an additional hidden complex and war-worthy wards. The Dursleys get to play at being super wealthy, and the Order gets to use the unbreakable wards for an effective HQ. Everybody except the servants they have to draft in for Dursley duty wins.

If/when the wards fall (I personally suspect the age 17 deadline was a self-fulfilling prophecy of giving an exact date they don't have to call a place home caused the wards to fall the instant Harry celebrated not having to live there. If "a spell can't tell the position of the sun", then how is accidental sacrificial magic an expert on ages of majority? Checkmate, tempus haters.), just break off for a network of safehouses.

Everyone knew where the house was, which just makes you a sitting duck until the protection drops. If he'd have been taken to an unknown safe house immediately after sixth year, skipping Privet Drive entirely, he'd have been safe somewhere nobody knows where to even find, while the Death Eaters are stuck screwing around at Privet Drive.

********* I think it was either Dobby doing something to trigger the trace, or some kind of external monitoring spells that detect any magic set up near where muggleborn/muggleraised live. No way would someone like Lucius Malfoy be OK with ministry being able to detect what magic he does just because he's near his son.

And even then, we're talking pureblood bigots where the most civilized (Lucius) of them treats their elves like garbage, crazy murder hobos out of Azkaban, and Tommy Riddle (enough said). I highly doubt any of them would even consider using elves to find Potter.

So the easiest course of action would be to sneak out under the cloak (maybe have Order create a distraction or two) or under polyjuice (some muggle takes a taxi, nothing to see here); rent a muggle apartment somewhere far away, lock the wand in a box, and live in comfort until the trace fades.

Edit: Maybe even put the apartment under fidelius, if knowledge how is not lost with Dumbledore.

***** It has little to do with science per se and more with the air dragging you off your flying device (so not "that thing can't go that fast" but rather "it is impossible to operate at such speeds since the air would yank you off") . The kind of motorcycle with a side car is usually not the kind built for high speed and therefore has little to none aerodynamic covers like you see on race machines. They also have a more upright seat position. Which means that, especially as a larger person such as Hagrid, simply holding on gets difficult at much lower speeds than on a broom where you have a much flatter seating position and the footrests to brace yourself against.

Your perception of speed depends very much on your vehicle. 50 kph on a bicycle feels fast, 100 is basically suicide unless you are a professional. Meanwhile, 100 in a good car are barely noticeable and too slow for a plane to even take off.

So this might very well be a case of "fast for this piece of junk", not "fastest thing ever".

Which already eliminates roughly 3/4 of the death eaters since they were spread out around Number 4, not all waiting on one side, and therefore have no chance of catching up. He then has the speed advantage and, well let's just say that lining someone up in a fighter plane with fixed guns is difficult, trying to do so with a one-handed wooden stick while going at ~150-200 mph (so a lot of air pressure against your hand and therefore a shitty aim) is practically impossible before you factor in that a fighter has one or more machine guns (a Spitfire, for example, shoots 80 bullets a second) while the wizard would be lucky to get off two spells/second, which are significantly slower (you need to lead your target more which means even worse accuracy). Aerial combat without missiles is very much "throw enough shit at a wall and hope that some of it sticks", which makes HP magic unsuitable for it.

Or you could simply do the escape earlier, which also reduces the present opposition and makes it even easier.
