*** At least they give a believable reason to why a caster might tire out though. In canon people.could just cast endlessly, with no sign of getting tired from the output of energy.

At least magical cores give a way to explain how someone using magic would tire out. I like this because canon version of casting violates a universal law of getting something for nothing. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it can only change states.

So, no, people in Canon can't cast endlessly. Of course, you also think magic is energy, which is your first problem. Don't do that, and you need no magic batteries, either.

*** I like that idea, but there is the idea that there's "talent", whatever that means. Whether it's more innate power, genetics, upbringing, etc., at least the wizards believe in it. The purebloods believe it's "in the blood", e.g. a family legacy. Hagrid said that Harry was "a thumpin' good" wizard upon first meeting him, after he'd been brought up among Muggles, so it's probably not based on upbringing. Voldemort was a half-blood from a near-squib inbred line, so it's probably not genetic. So what makes Voldemort and Harry "talented" wizards? Harry barely even studied, so it's not a question of skill learned by practice. Honestly, it seems that power is based entirely on authorial fiat and plot armor. The wizards that JKR wanted to portray as powerful were powerful because she said so, not based on any internal or external factors. If you want to write about a powerful wizard, do so. You don't have to explain why. The canon author certainly never did.

** tl;dr: most wizards have the same magical /power/, but they need to discipline their mind to make use of it. Some wizards like Dumbledore and Voldemort have either been born with /more/ magic, or they were born with easier /access/ to it (compared to others). I also think that the Dark Arts can be used to increase one's power, which would make Voldemort -- already stupendously talented -- even more powerful.

It depends. For the massive majority of wizards I think it's a case of time spent practising (and practising /well/).

Much like how you can train your brain; you don't think of your brain as a muscle, but your brain is responsible for the organisation of your thoughts and your attention. You need either an obsessive interest in something or self-discipline to take control over these two things.

- If you have disorganised thoughts and make no concerted effort to organise said thoughts, it will be more difficult to use your intellect meaningfully and recall information you learn later.

- If you have undisciplined concentration then your attention will waver and you will be more easily distracted. This will impede your ability to learn /anything/.

Your ability to organise your thoughts and the extent to which you have discipline over your focus is /everything/. It is the underlying ability atop of which all other knowledge is filtered through.

I view magical intent / willpower through the same light. If there are people who have the exact same magical baseline, the one who has better control at exercising that magic with their willpower and concentration will improve faster and see better results from their spells.

Then you get people like Harry, who is not noted as having spectacular concentration, but has a great "force of will" (which he used to resist Mad-Eye's /Imperio/). But I also think Harry is an outlier when it comes to rote magical power, and if he spent more time practising (like he did when learning the Summoning Charm for the First Task) then he would easily become an uncommonly powerful wizard. I mean, the guy could cast a Patronus Charm at 13 that shielded himself from hundreds of Dementors (to continue my analogy - Dementors are a pretty big distraction to overcome). I /refuse/ to believe that Harry is ordinary. He has some kind of special sauce baked into him, but it's up to him to make the most of it.

Edit: Just realised I didn't actually answer the question. I think that the above information applies at all ages. There are probably people who were good students in Hogwarts, then stopped using magic as much after graduating and kind of "lose the hang of" spells that they could once cast. I think all wizards start with the basics and build up from there, and they regress if they stop practising and they develop skill if they continue practising and exploring magic. You develop your skill for as long as you engage in the material and /desire/ to improve yourself.

Some like Tom Riddle had proficient control over their magic even before they were even trained. Hermione had an tremendous intellect and ability to focus, but she wasn't capable of what Riddle was. And unfortunately, Riddle seems to have been on-par with Hermione when it comes to academic accomplishment. He's a scary dood. I imagine both Hermione and Riddle both improve massively after graduation, where they will hyper-specialise into areas of magic that most interest them. Riddle liked more malevolent Dark Arts and would have immersed himself in that material, using his innate skill with magic to push the limit on what was possible.

Another example is Dumbledore. Below is a quote from canon about his time at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  "By the end of his first year, he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school."
#+end_quote

And also:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore also became very well-connected during his Hogwarts years, making notable friends such as Nicolas Flamel, Bathilda Bagshot, and Griselda Marchbanks, who marked him in his N.E.W.T.s for Charms and Transfiguration and later recalled that he did things with a wand that she had never seen before.
#+end_quote

We can therefore guess that Dumbledore had more-or-less an intuitive grasp of magic, and had the intellect and mental discipline to make something of that ability.

Harry doesn't have that academic discipline, he also doesn't appear to have a specific obsessive interest in magic outside of Quidditch like Hermione, Riddle, or Dumbledore have. What he does have is buckets of willpower. And some special sauce.

** At what age are you best at playing the piano?

I think that is a very similar question. So there are three components: Talent, knowledge, and skill. When you are very young, you will lack the last two, although the first can make acquiring it very easy, if you have an intuitive grasp (think Mozart). In theory, you can improve skill and knowledge all your life, but beyond a certain point, improvements are only incremental.

So in theory, I'd say you are best at performing magic in old age. In practice, you'll have learned 99.99% of all the stuff that will max out your talent at some point early in life, probably before 50, if you give wizards a life span of 130 or so. And just because you keep practicing and learning, you're never becoming Mozart if you weren't already, so you'll stay on that plateau for the rest of your life.

The profiency curve therefore should look something like this: [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Generalized_logistic_function_A0_K1_B1.5_Q0.5_%CE%BD0.5_M0.5.png][curve]]

The scaling I imagine for average wizards is approximately:

- -1: Age 5
- -0.5: Age 11
- 0.5: Age 20
- 1.5: Age 50

And as long as you don't fall magically ill, magic waning isn't a thing.

** Personally I subscribe to the idea that they have unrestrained access to infinity amounts of magic or that magic is not actually an energy and the telltale signs of accidental magic that generate that idea are just a result of magic being attempted without a proper intent behind it.

Through all the books there was no instance of anyone suffering anything resembling the “magical exhaustion” common in the fandom, and the supposed scale of power was so over the place that trying to make sense of it is an exercise in futility like, the unforgivables were supposedly extremely power intensive but by the time the Battle of Hogwarts happened /everyone/ from both sides and /their goddam owls/ seemed to be casting them at the rate of a freaking machine gun, then there is the patronus which was supposedly hard even for adults but not only Harry managed at thirteen, but he also taught it to the entire DA in a few weeks which, if I am not mistaken, included /other/ 13 YO and potentially even /younger/ students.

And still on the topic of the patronus, that thing is almost as arbitrary as the fidelius, I mean common, even disregarding the fact that having animals represent specific character traits is a particularity of humans and varies a lot with the culture than what is the correlation between the intensity of the emotion and the amount of power needed? Like, can a memory generate so much happiness that the person don't have the power to cast the spell? Or the amount of power is the same but the happiest the memory the stronger the spell?

Personally I think either magic is more like a form of authority over the world and isn't spent because there is no energy-cost per spell at all; it is an energy but the amount available to everyone is infinity; or it is an energy but by the time cannon arrived they had perfected the energy-efficiency of spells to such a point that the amount anyone has became essentially a non-issue since even the weakest wizard around would need to cast high-power spells with no-rest for days before even approaching magical exhaustion.

** Canon doesn't really go into this - there's not a single point where anything even remotely resembling "magic power levels" are explored.

My theory is that magic "power" is essentially 100% about what you know and /maybe/ whether your body can still make the right wand-movements.

There's no real limit to when you can cast certain spells or when they're at their most powerful, as long as you know exactly how to do the spell - see also, a 13-year-old driving off hundreds of Dementors with a Patronus, an 11-year-old casting a Hovering Charm strong enough to rip a massive troll's club out of its hand.

The only moments your access to magic would wane, then, is if you either start forgetting spells due to waning memory, or if your body physically can't make the wand-movements anymore.

** I think that there is probably a fairly standard magical baseline (you either have magic, or you don't), but what differs is the users personality, intelligence, willpower, talents and interests.

I'm a teacher, and at any point, I will have a class of 25 students, and 25 different levels of abilities. Some pick things up easily, some are always going to struggle. Some may not be particularly intellectual, but will give 100% to any task, others are blessed with strong intellect, but are too unmotivated to achieve their full potential.

Someone like Krum is an exceptional flyer because that is the branch of magic that he is interested in the most, just like any elite sportsperson. He has the innate talent AND the willpower to channel that ability. We can presume he works hard to develop those skills, trains regularly and is focussed on his goal.

Snape is a strong wizard because he is exceptionally intelligent, and has the willpower to want to learn, but also a streak of ruthlessness that means he pushes the boundaries. We can presume Hermione is probably at least as intelligent, but she's a rule follower, and doesn't have that same level of ruthlessness.

** Magic is supposed to be a skill like any other - you practice and you get better, if you're smart/talented/have synergistic qualities then you have a leg-up, and understanding it usually helps.

So, I'd imagine that as long as you maintained yourself and kept practicing, you'd probably keep getting better at Magic. I wouldn't say that Magic 'wanes', technically, but if you get older and slower then it's harder to make wand motions as smoothly as you did in your youth and cognitive decline would make picking up new spells harder, etc. So, you get worse at the things that make you good at magic, rather than getting worse at magic itself.

** In my mind magic works essentially like how Zenkai boosts worked in DBZ. The vast majority of people are never pushed to the point where they /have/ to increase their magic, so it just slowly grows as they get older and practice more and more magic in school.

Some people like Aurors and Cursebreakers start getting small Zenkai boosts as they're pushed past their limits in training, but imo the earlier you start Zenkai boosting, the more magic you can eventually wield.

But ofc if you don't continue working on your magic it won't grow.

Meanwhile people like Dumbledore and Grindelwald worked themselves to the bone continuously training over and over, repeatedly working themselves to exhaustion, giving them insane Zenkai boosts, which panned out later in life as they continued to push themselves to the point where they casually do things most wizards and witches balk at the thought of.

Like having multiple transfigurations ongoing while fighting a running battle with someone throwing Unforgiveables around like candy, while protecting a child and keeping the insane guy's best lieutenant from joining the fight.
