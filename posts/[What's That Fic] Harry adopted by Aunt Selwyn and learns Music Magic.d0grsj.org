:END:
Hi! I've been looking for this fic for years and was hoping someone could help. Harry is in 5th year, and is adopted by a distant relative named Elizabeth Selwyn (?), who makes him learn more about wizarding traditions. Harry stays with her over Christmas and also starts to learn music magic which has been made illegal by the Ministry.

Other bits I remember include Harry having vivid dreams of another boy who dies tragically. Harry also buys a book which is illegal, and Hermione discovers- Hermione then reports the book which results in the bookshop owner being sent to Azkaban to Harry's horror. Slughorn also makes an appearence as does a lot of boarding school talk (i.e 'rugger).


** Have you found this fic? It sounds interesting
