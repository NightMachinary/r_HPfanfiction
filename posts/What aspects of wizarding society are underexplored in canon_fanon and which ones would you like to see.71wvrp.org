** Monuments. Stuff like Stone Henge. Old temples. How much of old religions were based around the acts of ancient wizards. We know immortality exists, we know it can be achieved in multiple ways so the idea there might have been immortal wizards worshipped as gods isn't too far-fetched.

We have a few stories where it creeps up but nothing that handles it well. So poorly in fact that I haven't bothered to remember them. Morality isn't objective or absolute, what was acceptable then might not be now. What happens if they're not gone but simply sealed away? Roman wizards during the reign of Constantine worked to unthrone the 'gods' but couldn't undo their immortality. Curse-breakers working in some temples or the like accidentally unleash them.

As they attempt top regain their position and adapt to the new world completely unaware of the statue of secrecy their past begins to come out. Conflict is rife as they attempt to subdue entire countries to make themselves into gods again. Historians are fascinated by knowledge they might hold and are desperate to have them alive. The ICW and law enforcement everywhere want them stopped while Departments that study magic want to know how they achieved what they did.

It has to be done carefully. Focus on the magic and the action. There is so much potential for conflict that the story should be able to have decent pacing. So easily ruined if the author focuses on the religious aspect and we are subjected to endless rants on their opinions on the failings or benefits of religion. Its irrelevant to the greater story but its something that some people could obsess in and in doing so ruin the action of the story.

*** Harry learned to animate teacups to dance in his first year. Enchanting certain 'helpers' shouldn't be beyond second or third years (13 year old kids). So I assume sex-toys are very accessible, even for very young wizards and witches.

I mean other fetishes, like bondage can get very hot very quickly, and levicorpus for example is easy to cast for a 6th year.

Mind-Magic has also possibilities that are endless. I mean if you ever wanted to enact a certain fantasy and not know that you consented to it, /Obliviate/ is your friend. Of course Obliviate can also rather scary, but it is that in general.\\
Love-Potions could be fun to use. And if potions can evoke certain feelings like love, can they also evoke lust? Like a super-viagra that makes you not only hard, but horny as hell too?

You could also have stuff like enchanted underwear, so your SO can make your bra vibrate or get 'touchy' easily.

Wizarding sex must be awesome.

*** I have an entire sketch about this, that shall never see the light of day because its smutty af. So for the sake of discussion I'll just babble about what I just assumed.

I thought that, given how muggles do things, anything that is available will be used. So Polyjuice to have some hooker look like the guy/girl you want to get it on with is probably one of the tamest things. There even is a relatively popular fan-theory that the woman selling fingernails in Knockturn, sold them for the sole purpose of using them in Polyjuice. In my own sketch I theorized that its an actual source of income for famous, or just extraordinarily beautiful people to sell their fingernails, hair,... to use with Polyjuice by having Harry and Hermione asked to do so.

When it comes to the sex issues, I assumed that there aren't any issues at all. The physical nature of reality is slave to the mind of the wizard. I assumed that this is a cultural factor in how wizards and witches see the world. Building on that, if the mind of a wizard feels like they're a woman, then he simply has to take a potion (and probably give a heads up to her friends) and get on with her life afterwards, without anyone batting an eye. So if the "sex", the biology of a person isn't in accordance to their mind, then any change is 100% accepted. I'm not so sure about "gender" issues, though. As in any culture, the magical one would too construct social norms of what a wizard and what a witch is supposed to be, and what special cases are acceptable or not. Personal fanon here, for me, is that more traditional households are more accepting of homosexuality than households that are more accepting of muggleborn, given that the acceptance of homosexuality in the muggle societies of the 80s and earlier wasn't exactly great. So I'd assume that with the magical worlds need to separate themselves culturally, homosexuality would be more based on the practices they derive their "spell-language" (something I would assume holds almost sacred importance in such a culture) from, meaning latin, ancient-greek, norse,... ,all cultures that were /in some form/ more accepting of it than christian (or abrahamic) cultures.

About insecurities. I built around the fact that the evil people in the HP lore seem to be ugly by default. Therefore my bit of fanon: evil magic makes ugly faces. I'm well aware of the problematic nature of that statement, but it was merely a continuation of what we have been presented by canon. So in my bit of sketch, ugly (adult) people weren't primarily shunned because they're ugly, but because the cause of their attractiveness lies within the fact that they're practitioners of corrupting magic, or have been targeted or influenced by such magic. That again comes from the fact that magicals have the power to form reality to their wishes. It would make sense that they would be able to form physical appearance towards the "beauty gold standard" of a society by the use of magic. Therefore my thought was that if you're not attractive by the time you can use your magic freely (17 to 20 - may need time to learn or buy that magic), there has to be some magical reason for it (including magical heritage, such as being quarter-goblin or half-giant).

I haven't actually thought about voyeurism, but I always thought the cloak would've been one hell of a tool to have for any teenage boy with raging hormones :P

Yes to both sorts of pornography.

Robes are mainly there to separate themselves from muggles. Which is understandable, I'd guess. But given that robes seem to be an outwards statement only, I'd guess that in terms of the more interesting garments, the magicals get as creative with their clothes as their enchantment abilities allow. I personally featured a "cloud-dress" in my sketch, which is only smoke gliding around the body of the wearer, and every time you think its gonna reveal something, another bit of thick smoke forms and disguises it.

I remind you that you don't even have to be an animagus. You could just have a wizard with a good handle of transfiguration magic you into an animal (Ferret Malfoy). So yes, thats a thing.

I mean evil magic could just alter the perception of 'good' people of your face. Because Harry is as good and selfless as it gets it is very obvious to him who is 'ugly'.

It might not even be that their face is ugly, it's just that he /knows/ they are ugly, and therefor interprets their faces as ugly.

**** And then there's access to birth control. We saw what easy access to effective birth control lead to in the muggle world with the sexual revolution back in the 60's-70's.

One can only imagine how completely casual magicals would be about sex if you assume they have had easy access to potion or spell based birth control for hundreds of years or more.

Add in the fact the the Statute of secrecy would have caused them to skip over that whole Victorianism prudishness fad that muggles are still trying to shake off and it gets even better.

Then there's the role of religion (or lack thereof) in the magical world. Not to mention whether or not you want to write magic as having any significatn impact on an individual's biology; we know they're probably more durable and age slower, but what else?

** I think for me retail and markets and how they work. How big, for example, is Diagon Alley? How many shops are there? What sort of licensing is required to open a shop?Is advertising expensive? How many businesses are there across the wizarding world? Are there many international businesses? Many corporations? Are there checks and balances on things like monopolies? How much tax does the wizarding world charge? Are there taxes, even?

And even the actual logistics side aside, I have to admit I'm super interested in like...

So Knockturn Alley is super skeevy, right? It's where Hagrid goes to buy poisons, Borgin and Burkes is an antique shop that also sells dark objects, etc, but everything on Knockturn Alley - the actual business ideas at least - /must/ be outwardly legal or they wouldn't be able to open up a premises in the middle of wizarding London.

How many other alleys are there off Diagon Alley? How many people live right there? Are there many wizarding restaurants? Is it difficult to sell secondhand stuff, in case the enchantments don't do what you think they do?

If a wizard is walking through a regular Muggle town, is there a chance they'll see an apothecary on the main street, settled in-between a Muggle butcher's and the council office with a Notice-Me-Not charm on it?

We saw Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes go from a selling shit in the castle to owl order forms to a big business on Diagon Alley, but I always wonder what sort of hoops they actually had to fly through in order to set up everything!

The house is also only accessible from the whomping willow, so it's not as if just anyone can investigate if they wanted to. Dumbledore and the Ministry were complicit in the cover up as well, and they have enough clout to either prevent the few skilled people who would want to investigate closely themselves (rather than just complain to the ministry, like I imagine most normal people would have) or to ensure their silence.

Everyone makes mistakes, so I could be entirely wrong, but I think you're mistaken here.

If I recall correctly, no one knew Remus was a werewolf. /Especially/ not the ministry. He was bitten as a child, before Hogwarts, and Dumbledore helped keep it a secret so that Remus could attend school.

This, in essence, is why Snape's blurting of his condition to a room full of children was especially condemning for him. It alerted the Ministry to his condition.

Sure, he'd always had trouble holding a job, but that was mostly because he was useless for several days out of the month for any type of work.

I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I've kept quiet. There aren't many who'd have let you hire werewolves, or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you're going to work against me -”

As for Lich, I'd think that there are several ways of immortality (or similar things) in the HP canon. We know of two, but there may be many more (just like there are roughly 4 spells making things explode). A horcrux keeps you alive, and holds you in a state "less than a ghost" when your body is destroyed. Lich are decidedly above ghosts. In myth they are powerful Kings or sorcerers ascending into a form free of death. If they exist in HP lore or not, is a thing for fanfiction authors to decide for their own, but the effect of becoming a Lich is definitely a different form of immortality than the form a horcrux (or the philosopher stone) provides.

** One that's particularly striking in how rarely I see it is that wizarding society is, in theory, a society where there's no reason for the divisions between men and women there are in muggle society, both modern and historical. Wands negate any bodily strength differentials, and if magic manifests equally in both males and females, there would be no logical reason for womens' intellect or capabilities to be suppressed for years or centuries.

Somehow there's not many fics that actively pick up on that though, unless they're deliberate full-gender inversions like Firebird with its cruel matriarchal society. Instead, there's multitudes of fics where wizarding society is old-school patriarchal, marriage contracts where witches are married off like chattel at 16 years old and wizards have harems of otherwise helpless and useless witches to serve them, etc. etc. I get that these are fantasies and AUs, but still. They've always struck me as almost /the opposite/ of what you might expect the gender dynamics of that world and society to be given the worldbuilding, that sets up the only difference between wizards and witches being that witches can biologically bear children.

EDIT - to more fully answer the question: Essentially it would be really interesting to see stories where muggleborn students, muggles, and witches and wizards have completely different understandings of gender divisions and even gender roles. Give me Draco and purebloods horrified that muggles are so backwards to think that women are inferior, give me Voldemort championing wizarding society and purity because of how badly his mother was treated, give me muggleborn witches tending to stay in the wizarding world because there's none of the being treated in any way a second-class citizen due to biology there, because wizards don't have that concept. Give me a Hermione who overnight no longer faces gender-based prejudice for being a brainy, scientific girl, but who instead has to newly negotiate being a minority due to other factors of her birth. Give me Professor McGonagall being completely dumbfounded by muggle parents' reactions to her authority or professionalism, or Tonks being scandalized by what she hears muggle men saying when she's working undercover, or her mother, Andromeda, having to learn to negotiate how she was raised with what her muggle mother-in-law expects a wife to do and be. Give me Lily Evans-Potter able to see the good and bad in both worlds in different ways as she goes through school and becomes an adult. There's just so much fuel to be mined there that I feel in so many stories is only very lightly entered into or touched upon.

*** My understanding of sex inequality is that among other things, it stems from women being relegated to a different sphere of production - household/domestic labour, which is unpaid. If accounted for, it would [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/brycecovert/2012/05/30/putting-a-price-tag-on-unpaid-housework/#35b9cf7235c6][increase GDP by 26%]]. Because House Elves perform most domestic labour, it doesn't make any sense that there would be sex inequality as sharp and pronounced as in Muggle society.

I don't think the "wands as equalizers" explanation really holds up. Economic and social power hasn't been correlated to actual physical strength for tens of thousand of years. Besides that, it also doesn't explain why women in Muggle society who are physically stronger than some men don't wield accordingly more social power - which makes the individual paradigm nonsensical, requiring a social-historical approach that takes into account the exploitation and oppression women have faced as a class.

Yes, house elves - or even in Molly Weasley's case, spells that she herself can do just by saying them - really, even in canon, compared to a muggle housewife or stay at home mother, Molly is more akin to a manager or supervisor of the household spells than the drudge she is sometimes portrayed as in the fandom. Already, instead of the physically labour-intensive tasks most muggle stay at home moms do, Molly only has to remember the order of her list of tasks for the day, and keep the peace between whichever of her children are at home that year.

**** There are just some things I would call irregularities. For example the most obvious: Christmas. We have the Yule Ball, which kind of makes this whole concept of what magicals actually celebrate on that day a bit funky. Fred and George dressed up a gnome as an angel. Angels are mainly an imagery used in abrahamic religions in modern times. So it offers the question of where that inspiration comes from for the magicals. How much christianity have they assimilated? Are middle-eastern magicals similarly influenced by islam?

It would make little sense if someone would claim that magicals are just straight up christians as we know them. If anything christianity would have to have made a similar theological split between magicals and muggles as it did between catholics and protestants.

And how the muggleborns deal with being 100% condemned to hell simply for what they are by their own religion... thats another question entirely. Or they delve themselves in ignorant bliss. That's probably the way most would choose.

Anyway, religion is a really underdeveloped part of the HP universe. I dearly hope, however, that Rowling stays far, /far/ away from it herself. Given what a poorly researched clusterfuck her lore expansion in the United States was, I'd rather just have capable worldbuilder write some fanfiction about it.

And thats what I find so interesting. The celebrations we read about seem to be completely derived from muggle festivities. What about the burning of the Yule log, for example? What about smoking out the house (no idea how that tradition is called in English)? Instead we get Christmas crackers and trees with angels. That can't be just coming from muggleborns.

Where is Samhain? Where is Beltane? Where is Mabon? Things that would maybe fit in, are absent.

Which is also why I like to see stuff like that in fics where Harry has contact with people who are arguably of a different subculture than the Weasleys, for example.

And I think you underestimate the hold religion still had on the identity of young people back in the 80s and 90s. In 1980, church attendance was still retty damn high in the UK, but slowly getting less. It would probably be rare, but not overly odd to see young muggleborn struggle with the fact that they aren't part of their own religious "good group" by default, in the canon time-frame. Its really a thing of the 00 years that atheism, or at least non-organised spiritualism found greater popularity among the western european countries.

******* My theory is that Dumbledore has been pushing these muggle traditions at Hogwarts recently in order to make the massively growing number of muggleborn more comfortable. One or two a year at most historically were easy to handle, but when it gets to be three or four times that, a quarter of each class, they're harder to keep track of, increasing the chance that one might go home and blab about all the heathens. This has then caused a massive push-back from wizarding traditionalists and is one of the causes of the recent war.

***** They're wizards but they're also British wizards. The cultural differences become more stated when the school is visited by Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. I thought it was interesting how the students still observed the differences in their national identities over the whole "we do magic this way and they do magic that way." You can also see this during the Quidditch World Cup when many of the Hogwarts students supported Ireland over Bulgaria. If they're national identities play an important albeit understated influence in their lives, than it makes sense that some religious traditions that shaped by regions would also feature in their societies. Christmas is one of those traditions. It probably lost it's religious significance a long time ago just as it has for many Muggle-borns.

Culture and identity among the wizarding world would be super interesting to explore.

**** Wizards seem far less religious than Muggles, indeed. They still must have some system of belief and morals. It might not be as organized or developed, but if there isn't, it would mean that they're the only human society in history without one. It would be strange.

Now, being an atheist myself, what interests me is how would the existence of magic influence these things, as we know that every great social or technological breakthrough influenced religion in history. For example, the things people believe aren't the same before and after the invention of writing, or the congregation in large cities...

*** Rowling presents a sort of pseudo-Christian worldview in the series, most noticeable in the last two books. There are lots of theological concepts that are assumed, but usually not explored from a sociological aspect. Wizards know about the soul, and they seem to know there is an actual afterlife - these are huge revelations that would surely impact the way Wizards think.

Further, Dark Magic impacts the soul of the person using it, and it's established that love and sacrifice have a profound effect beyond the physical. Remorse is established to heal a soul's taint of sinful acts. These are definitely Christian concepts explored in a magical universe, however Wizards probably wouldn't have an institutionalized form of Christianity. Nevertheless, its philosophy and ethics would impact Wizarding culture before the institution of the Statute of Secrecy, so it's likely that said culture would have "culturally Christian" aspects. Perhaps it is closer to neoplatonism.

My own headcanon is that Magic accounts for more esoteric aspects of western philosophy which are largely abandoned by modern muggle philosophy. The Logos, the active principle, could have a magical inspiration, as well as things like Plato's forms. This would require a thorough exploration, but we can imagine that classics of ancient philosophy would be written by squibs and people familiar with the existence of magic.

Beasts are creatures who don't fit into this category. Acromantula and Sphinxes are beasts, so it's probable they at least can't work with Magical law.

Now to be fair we don't know that Mosag was /hatched/ in Scotland --- in fact, there's no information at all of where she came from aside from the fact that "Hagrid brought her" to Aragog. Could be she was already fully grown at the time, and was able to pass on the Borneo acromantulas' traditions. In fact, it's a headcanon of mine that the Children of Aragog wouldn't have started eating human flesh if not for their mother's influence. Aragog didn't dare stand up to Mosag, in part because he probably loved her, and in part because, being that A) he was blind and B) female spiders tend to be bigger and stronger than males, he was scared fangless of her.

My take is that ghosts can Move On by willingly passing through the Veil --- that is, in fact, the thing's primary purpose. At some point tthe Ministry, being a bunch of scaredy lobsters someone accidentally transfigured into bureaucrats, forgot about it and sealed it away. Besides, most ghosts never outgrow the fundamental cowardice that prevented them from leaving in the first place, or at least not for a thousand years or so if that.

I don't think so. The Grey Lady was raised in 11th century English but speaks fluently in the modern tongue, without the characters noting an accent, so I think ghosts can still update their knowledge of language over time --- meaning a stone-age ghost would have progressively picked up the changes in language and could be speakign Brooklyn american by now for all we know.

You overestimate the amount of ghosts in the world. I think it's quite a rare phenomenon, especially considering only wizards and witches may become ghosts. (...Here's a side question --- can goblins or other beings capable of using magic become ghosts?) By the time the world would have become "overrun", a significant enough amount of the population has been disposed of with the Veil already. If it really becomes a problem anyway, you can always ask some them to move to the Moon or something, or, if you're feeling umbridgish, bring in some Dementors.
