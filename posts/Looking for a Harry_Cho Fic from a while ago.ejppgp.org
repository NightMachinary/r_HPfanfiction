:END:
Hey folks,

I was hoping you'd be able to help me out. I read a Harry/Cho fanfic 5 or more years ago, and was recently remembering it, but can't find it. Honestly I have no clue even if it was trash or decently written. Here's what I can remember:

​

1. Lots of cliches (Sue me, I like to turn my brain off sometimes ;) )
2. Harry can do wandless magic
3. The Weasley twins make harry these magic dampening rings so that his superpowerful magic doesn't hurt people
4. Harry becomes a teacher and lives at hogwarts with Cho, but I believe they start as students
5. Harry saves a group of (his) students later on by wandlessly blocking the killing curse
6. It may have been a series?

​

That's about it, but I can feel more under the surface of my brain, so I'll update this if I can think of more. Anyone have any clue what I'm talking about?

Thanks regardless!!
