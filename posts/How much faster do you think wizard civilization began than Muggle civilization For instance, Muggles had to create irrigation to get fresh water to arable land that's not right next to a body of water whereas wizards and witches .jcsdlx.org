And prehistoric Muggles had to figure out how to create fire whereas wizards and witches had to invent Incendio.


** I think there is a blurred line between muggle and magical civilization. It's only quite recently, when the statue of secrecy went into effect, that muggles and magicals divided.

*** Yes and no. The Statute of Secrecy made the divide official, but we know that the wizard/Muggle divide existed in Britain since at least the 1300s, when the Wizard's Council banned playing Quidditch within 50 miles of towns and villages to prevent Muggles from seeing magic. While we know that some wizards like the Malfoy family moved in Muggle circles, there's no evidence that they practised magic openly.

***** The key phrase there was "at least". I think the implication in canon is that magic was /never/ practised openly among Muggles, at least within the era of written history - this is why Muggles have legends of magic all the way back to the classical era, with stories about dragons and sirens, centaurs and mermaids, but do not have any stories which are /accurate/ accounts of the magical world - because they only ever caught glimpses of magic, with wizards generally keeping to themselves and avoiding Muggles.

**** Compare the 1300s to tens of thousands of years ago. Civilizations would have been built together, although magicals would have a lesser effect on it by virtue of having a lower population throughout history.

Did wizards & witches have a spell to hold food or did they use bowls? Muggles and magicals don't exist in separate spheres. They don't even in modern times, one side just doesn't know the other exists but they still interact and feed off of each other.

Was the advancement of magic faster than the advancement of technology? I think, yes, until about 100-200 years ago where muggle technology starts to outstrip magic. Magic peaked early and stayed there until very recently.

** Wizards had to first learn how to do magic in a systematic and organised way. I imagine that magic and Muggle civilisations were the same thing until relatively shortly before the Statute of Secrecy. We see hints of this from the books too, with Nearly Headless Nick being a former Court Wizard, the ancient Egyptian wizards with their tombs and the curses on them... I imagine that early magic was as rudimentary as early Muggle technology.

It wouldn't have used wands for a start, since those are said to be a Roman innovation and there was already thousands of years of Muggle innovation and learning needed to get to Rome. We see hints of older magic in the books as well, with things like the sacrificial protection Harry had, the curse on the defence position, Voldemort's resurrection ritual.

I think the very earliest wizards would have just had the basic advantages that wizards have over muggles - they don't get sick from simple Muggle diseases, they're durable, and live a long time. Just like writing and mathematics, I assume spells and real magic came much later.

** I think one thing to consider is how wizards piggy back off muggle technology. I mean at the time of the books, the wizards were still using radios while TVs had become norm in the muggle work. Also between the 1990s and the Statute if Secrecy, the wizard world never developed better clothing than robes, better writing implements than quills, or even a maybe more logical sport than sending 17 year olds into a death tournament. I mean this lack of innovation is most likely due to the small population of wizards so they use muggle advancements for the â€˜normal' things while they focus their advancements on the magical. This still leads to wizards relying on muggle advancements.

** I would wager wizarding civilization is an offshoot of muggle civilization

with early wizarding being town priests and miracle workers

but as the thousands of years past, the wizards started to explore magic more and learn how it worked and pulled away from the roll of religious advisor

** Pre-wand? I think the advantages would have slight. Without wands, wizards would mostly be doing accidental magic, some controlled wandless magic if they can, and perhaps some rudimentary potions and taking advantage of some magical creatures. Though I'd also note, it'd be more dangerous as they'd also attract magical creatures without wands to defend themselves. The best advantage would be an increased natural lifespan, the decreased aging of which would keep their lifespan longer by decreasing the odds of death each year.

I do think that even before wands, there would start to be a seperation between muggles and wizards quite naturally. The slow aging, the fact that wizards attract different types of threats, and good old prejudice probably forced wizards to start slowly separating. For the most part though, I think both groups of people would have largely relied on the same things, except the wizards might have a few things magical.

The wand changed everything. Wizards had far better control, had a whole host of spells unlocked, and suddenly magic went from a trade-off to clearly being a good thing. And the separation would have continued. It's not a perfect one, and there's is crossover which is why the statute happening was still a big deal. But I do think that once wands were invented, wizards had a huge advantage when it came to civilization.

** Forget the beginning of civilization starting around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. The idea of Magicals existing from the beginning of human existence starting around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago is incompatible with human evolution.

We're not even homo sapiens, we're homo sapiens sapiens. Were there magical homo sapiens? Were there magical homo neanderthalensis? Homo erectus? Australopithecus?

Let's pretend that speciation is instant rather than gradual, that homo sapiens popped up fully distinct 200,000 years ago, and that there were Magical and Muggle homo sapiens. Within a few thousand years, there would be no Muggles. Magicals would've out-competed and out-bred the Muggles.

We could pretend that Magicals almost immediately separated off into a separate civilization that we could call Atlantis.

The Toba supervolcano erupted about 70,000 years ago and caused something called a "genetic bottleneck," meaning only between 3,000 and 10,000 humans were left alive on the entire planet, and every living human is descended from that tiny population. There were probably between 100,000 and 300,000 humans living before that eruption. We could pretend that some gigantic Atlantean catastrophe caused the genetic bottleneck rather than the Toba supervolcano. Either way, there's something called the "minimum viable population." There would've had to have been at least a few thousand Magicals left alive after the eruption/catastrophe in order for them to not become extinct, so at that point the Muggle and Magical populations would be roughly equal.

If there were 10,000 Muggles in Africa/Eurasia and 10,000 Magicals in Atlantis, not only could those two populations not breed with each other for 70,000 years in order for what we know to be true about the current living population of the world's genetic history to be true, but the Magical population would have to grow at a rate that would mean the modern Magical population couldn't be as small as it is.

If there were 5,000 Muggles and 5,000 Magicals living together at that point and interbreeding, that would square with our genetic history, but it would mean every living person would have to be Magical and there could be no such thing as a Muggle.

The modern magical population being as low as it is just doesn't square with genetics or evolution. The existence of the Wizarding World only makes sense in a magical universe that's had the appearance of mundanity artificially imposed upon it. But for the existence of magic to square with recorded history and evolutionary history, magic had to have been invented or discovered extremely recently, as in less than 10,000 years ago, and that doesn't make sense if the universe is inherently magical, but it isn't possible if the universe is inherently mundane.

I can't see any way to make this work.

*** There's no evidence in canon that magicals can outcompete and out-breed muggles. Magic apparently confers an evolutionary disadvantage, considering how few magicals there are in proportion to muggles. It's easy to see what the mechanism could be, as canon magicals use their magic to get themselves into deeper trouble than muggles are capable of.

Another possible mechanism is that magicals invented birth control earlier. Magical families are generally small. That's a personal advantage and an evolutionary disadvantage.

**** The only "evolutionary disadvantage" is whatever prevents you from breeding before reaching the age of maturity. Magicals can summon clean water from nothing, and recover from flesh wounds and such, and ward off predators, and all sorts of other things.

Muggles have gotten themselves into all sorts of trouble over the last couple hundred thousand years. Malaria. Lions and tigers and bears. Starvation. Infections; from food, and from minor scrapes and cuts, and from impacted wisdom teeth, and from unclean water. Muggles are exceptionally squishy.

I won't look it up right now, I'll leave that for you if you're interested in diving deeper, but I'm pretty sure the child mortality rate has been over 50% from the beginning of time up until about 200 years ago. Even if Magicals were having fewer children, that probably evened itself out owing to the high rate of mortality for Muggle children.

The fact that canon doesn't contain as many Magicals as it should doesn't mean magic confers an evolutionary disadvantage, it means canon doesn't contain as many Magicals as it should. You're not arriving at "magic apparently confers an evolutionary disadvantage" by starting from first principles and working forwards, you're starting from canon and working backwards to try to justify it. For canon to have the Magical population size that it has, that means magic MUST confer an evolutionary disadvantage. But magic does NOT confer an evolutionary disadvantage. All that means is that canon is a fantasy story for children, written by an author who didn't care whether or not her world was compatible with reality. Which is fine. It's a fantasy. We're not supposed to be thinking about this stuff. It's ridiculous to even be having this conversation. But OP's question is about this stuff, so that's how I answered, by taking it seriously.

***** Considering the potential for accidental magic to inflict harm, I'm amazed there are as many magicals as there are in canon. It's hard to childproof a home to keep just a muggle toddler alive. I'm sure magical toddlers can get into much worse trouble. I'd be surprised if their childhood mortality rate is lower than ours, or was any lower historically, or prehistorically.

Traits that prevent you from breeding after reaching maturity are evolutionary disadvantages too. Being smart enough to understand how to use birth control is an evolutionary disadvantage. So's having access to magical birth control. Being too stupid/not magical enough to use birth control is an evolutionary advantage.

Canon is perfectly consistent here. Magic is a cool trait, like albinism, that hasn't become prevalent in the population because of the evolutionary disadvantage it confers.

** Spell development probably took a long time. My headcanon is that as better, easier to cast and more efficient spells get invented all the time, if you look a few thousand years back the spells they used were different and clunkier and people generally knew fewer spells.

Copying spells were probably less accurate with small details and only the best could produce readable book copies or enchant quills to auto-write without making errors, so books would have been something reserved for highly skilled individuals and wealthy families. At least until Gutenberg would make all wizards think "why didn't I think of that".

The first water spells would probably be complicated rituals to make it rain that would take weeks to prepare, and slow but steady improvement would lead to modern spells. In the medieval age they might use a single complicated water conjuring enchantment that'd take a skilled wizard months to cast on a central cistern to provide a constant water supply, in modern times a much simpler and cheaper water conjuring enchantment on each individual tap could make plumbing obsolete.

You could imagine how importing Leibniz's calculus to arithmancy in the 1670s might lead to a wave of innovation around that time, which could produce a large scale memory spell that would finally make it practical to make muggles completely forget that magic is real.

So I think wizard civilization developed and improved mostly in parallel with nonmagical civilization. With both being much more intertwined in ancient times.

** I mean, someone has to create the spells, develop wands or other magical foci first. But you're spot on, and i think your point makes a lot of sense.

This is why it really is a shame that JKR got so rich so quickly. She really gave up on the whole 'creative' part of her writing almost immediately. Like, how while in 'the real world', the 1960s were a transformational time where civil rights became a major issue, in the 1960s wizarding world... uhh .. the same thing happened, at the same time. Funny coincidence.

If you read Pottermore, you can see JKR just went and found an Intro to Western Civ textbook, and went through line-by-line and crossed out "people" and replaced it with "wizards" ðŸ™„

** My headcanon is that for most of the human civilization wizards and muggles worked together. I think that magic is something that evolved in some humans more and some humans less. If we were to take Dumbledore's statement that "words are an inexhaustible source of magic" and that love and sacrifice are some of the most powerful forms of magic, you could say even muggles are capable of some rudimentary magic (we say that someone has charm when they make you feel good around them and we use curses for words that make people feel repulsion and discomfort). This would indicate that both muggles and wizards have the same origin. I think that the first forms of 'magic' were being able to domesticate animals, women to seduce men for protection and men would use charisma and inspirational words to get other people to follow them. This form of rudimentary magic evolved in some people to the point that their willpower alone was able to protect or harm others and later on even to manipulate weather. These people became priests or shamans or leaders (in ancient Egypt) or were even so revered that they called themselves 'gods'.
