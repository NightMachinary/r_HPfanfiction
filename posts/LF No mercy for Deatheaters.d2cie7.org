Hey guys,

I'd like your best stories where Deatheaters (except those captured for interrogation (even with torture if need be!)) are killed by "the good guys" (I've always hated Harry arguing against killing! Remus, Moody, Tonks, Fred etc. could still be alive if their murderers had been put down (say Bellatrix and Dolohov dying at the DoM) like the monsters that they are! Traitors, too which makes killing them quite ok, even without arguing for self-defense!)

Bonus-Points if Harry or Hermione (or both!) argue for this when Dumbledore or others try to argue for forgiveness and the use of stunning-spells etc.

Like always:

- no slash (just not my cup of tea - ok, unless it's minor and in the background!)

- only very good Harry/Ginny

- no pairing Hermione with Draco, Voldemort, Lucius etc. either (Snape is ok if done very well and I mean that! I hate Snape, but he is a brilliant, intelligent man - despite being a bully and an asshole!)

So, the stage is yours guys :) - Thanks for your recommendations (in advance) ;)

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

*** Hm...I myself don't mind the spoiler (Yeah, I am strange like that - I do watch spoiler-vids before going to the cinema (so that I don't regret going to a movie, because if the spoiler shows something I despise then I usually don't go))

Grindelwald? That's a nice bonus (would like more fanfiction with him, especially if they discount 'Fantastic Beasts'...I kind of don't like this version of Grindelwald, he's more of a comic book villain than I like :( )

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
