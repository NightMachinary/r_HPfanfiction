I just read Bad Education by magicspacehole and I loved it and would love more like it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888]]

( this is the link in case anyone is interested)

I'm looking for something where Tom Riddle is the main /pov character and ideally one where he doesn't end up romantically involved with anyone or in a parental role for anyone.

But if he is involved with anyone no ocs no one in Harry's generation ( even with Time Travel) and not Bellatrix


** Diablerie by OceanBreeze7 seems to be right up your alley. It's an incredibly well written fic

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.Originally posted on ffnet, now also updating here.

**** I'm glad you enjoy it!!! If you like that fic then I also recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20196385/chapters/47855671][A Cuckoo in The Nest]]

It's from tom's POV where he possesses ginny and takes her place much like a changeling. It's a dark premise but that's expected from any story featuring him.

My guilty pleasure is seeing tom forcefully getting a family whether he likes it or not!
