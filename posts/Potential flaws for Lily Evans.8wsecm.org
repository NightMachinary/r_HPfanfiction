We don't get that much from her in canon and what we do get is when she's justifiably angry and when she's just a kid. So what are some potential flaws she could have?


** She seems to have a very black and white view of the world. I don't think she has a temper, she was rightfully angry when Sirius and James were bullying Snape so I don't know where that 'explosive temper' comes from. Maybe make her stubborn or independent to a fault. Or maybe she was too altruistic or too kind for her own good. There's some potential for her being a bit stuck-up, although unlikely. But you can play with that there. This would make her a hypocrite, however, and you'd have more flaws.

Avoid making her a wet blanket or a killjoy. We know she broke the rules (underage magic, she enjoyed Sirius and James's antics, she sassed Slughorn). Otherwise if she yells and screams at the slightest bit of dust James would've become bored with her very quickly, and wouldn't have been attracted to her. So she must have had a mischievous nature.

I'd also look at Gryffindor's general flaws if you're stuck. They can be rash, reckless or maybe too brave, resulting in her being rude to authority figures. Dumbledore also describes Harry more like his mother so maybe you can give her a hero complex. Maybe she was too sarcastic and took it too far? Or she couldn't get out of trouble.

Although unlikely too, maybe Lily had it reinforced by so many people that she was perfect (Her parents, Snape, Slughorn and later James. Also, to an extent, Petunia) so she had it in her mind that she was 'perfect' and 'ideal' and her popularity added to that, so it fueled her being (unconsciously) stuck-up.

Maybe Lily was too talkative and likely made secrets slip when she talked too much, which would give her a bit of trouble with her friends. Or maybe she was too energetic and adventurous, venturing into the very depths of the Forbidden Forest at night because 'why not?'.

She's basically a blank state in canon, with a few qualities we know she had (if you choose to ignore the movies, like I do, that would make it very few). But it's up to you, however, she should be likable overall.

** Here are some possibilities I see:

- She wasn't really capable of understanding her sister's resentment. Not that Petunia was really justified (though she was a teenager, and teenagers are not playing with a full deck), but Lily is never shown really seeing the other side of the coin. You could make something of that.
- She could have been very controlling. She wanted certain things to happen and was more insistent on things being done in a particular way (/somewhat/ like Hermione, though there are plenty of potential differences). An extreme example of this is the Firebird Trilogy, where Lily had been a seer and even planned her child around changing the world as she thought best.
- Having a disdain for Quidditch similar to Hermione or others. Not neccessarily a flaw, but the truth is people who are generally not good at something often dislike it or try to portray it as stupid or useless (I see this one all the time in the real world).
- Jealousy or pride about her abilities. Maybe part of her motivation for splitting from Snape was also that Snape was actually doing /better/ than her in different subjects. Yes, the blood purity thing is a big deal. Often though people have more than a single motivation for committing to a major change like that, but /ususally/ we humans try to make the case that the reasoning for doing so is for the more "upright" and "righteous" reason. Need an in book example: when purebloods justify their racial ideas with muggles "stealing magic" which would frighten any wizard/witch if they did not know for sure it wasn't true (honestly its never really clear on how magic occurs in children and why anyway).

** She's got so little characterization, you can do almost anything. Some random options:

- Black/white morality
- Rigid moral system (extreme consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics)
- Obsessive personality
- Inability to focus on one task
- Odious personal habits
- Callous toward others
- Poor social understanding (can't tell when she's being insulted or complimented, not sure how to be respectful toward other people -- see the titular character of /Bones/ (TV series))
- Grudge-bearer

If I'm looking for character flaws, I often go through the GURPS disadvantage list. (GURPS is a tabletop RPG, like Dungeons and Dragons.) It's got a pretty large list of things that limit a character or provide them with problems.

But she's incorporated in both as relatively important to the plot due to her flaws creating problems.

***** Thanks! I have it in mind that she was excited going to Hogwarts because she was discovering new 'science' so she could be the greatest scientist in the next century when she introduces it to the Wizarding World (later putting a downer to her mood when she found out about the International Statue of Secrecy) but was later put down very quickly when she was a bit behind in her classes, trying very hard at midnights to write her essays and failing, writing to her parents to tell them that she hates it and the only subject she is good at is potions, eventually getting help from McGonagall when she opens her mind up a little but with Lily being too stubborn for it and independent to a fault, she didn't accept it.

So she eventually found sanctuary in Potions because it was very close to Chemistry and she could handle it. So as you described it, Lily was a person who liked structure and logic, being narrow-minded to other things and everything suddenly slapping her in her face with full force. Because of the war, she wanted to show everyone that the muggle and magical worlds weren't so different after all and so wanted to become the new Potions Professor at Hogwarts because she found a way to incorporate chemistry with potions, aiming to prove to everyone that she wasn't very different and developing her own unique style.

Her and Snape had very different styles with Snape experimenting and her adding everything to her potions without thought, later trying to explain it with chemistry. That made Snape resent their friendship a bit and put a strain to it. So she started a club at Hogwarts aiming to open the Wizarding World's eyes to muggle culture, which gained popularity and a better sense of empathy with muggles. This made Dumbledore appoint her as Head Girl and she got an Special Award For Services to the School as a result, because she made the school have a stronger passion to fight in the war, earning a sense of friendliness between them and muggles, causing them to unite at a time of war.

Oops, I got a bit carried away.

****** Hmm, I like the idea of her and Snape having opposing approaches to Potions and their relationship suffering for it.

In terms of her failing everything, I would suggest taking a different approach. We know she's very talented in Potions and Charms and considered a very bright student, so that might not work if you want to partly follow canon. However, I think her failing at Transfiguration actually makes a lot of sense. We know that transfiguration has certain laws (i.e., Gamps Laws) but it may not have complete structure and laws to replace all the laws of physics and matter that it destroys, so it takes her more time to work through.

As for her adding anything to potions without thought, I imagine it wouldn't work out. I do think Potions and Chemistry can be linked, all the magical ingredients and stages of potion making have reactions with each other, and the properties of the ingredients have to be taken into account. I think Lily could easily grasp all the properties and their reactions in combination with each other, thus being able to prepare the potion with ease. However, she isn't open to or excelling in any form of experimentation, whereas Snape does quite well. So she and Snape clash when he tries to experiment with the potion, and she is unable to fit that into the way she looks at the 'rules' of potion making.

******* No, I don't think she failed everything! Just that she was a bit behind. We know Slughorn considered her bright but what about the other subjects? History of Magic wouldn't require magic so of course she had it easy if she liked History, that is, the same goes for Arithmancy since it was based on logic, Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. Astronomy is supposed to be linked to Potions as well so she was good! I just think she struggled with Transfiguration and Charms. Charms at first because she again she couldn't grasp the idea around it but I think later on, she would've been good, one of the best in her hear at it.

Transfiguration was quite ironic for her to fail because it's supposed to be the most scientific branch of magic, so she was quite frustrated with it! I think she found a gift for Charms later on in fourth year and mashed muggle machinery with magic, making her give Sirius the idea of a flying motorcycle and later having a heart attack when he actually comes back with one. So I think she used Charms for good later on, giving the Order an advantage because she and Sirius wrecked havoc with their magical machines.

As for Potions, Slughorn describes her as 'intuitive' and 'instinctive' and that means doing things based on a 'gut-feeling' so I think she did do things without thinking. Or maybe she did indeed follow the rules of chemistry for them, but with a lot of work and preparing behind the scenes so Slughorn only /thought/ she was instinctive without any hard work. I think that fits more! So good at the theory of potions, but barely anything else because of her adherence to science but later on, when she opens her mind a little, great with application.

** First of, at what age do you want to write her?

When she was in Hogwarts? Then she is a person that still has to find her moral code. She is kind of ignoring Snape's racist and bullying tendencies, because he is her friend and it only becomes unforgivable once he turn them against her. But those are things teenager have to learn. Harry is often described to have a lot of her character. Look at his flaws: Quick to judge (she didn't seem willing to give Sirius und James a second chance or even explain their views about Slytherin), maybe she unfairly fought and shout with her friends as well like Harry does when he is under a lot of stress

After Hogwarts? She becomes a character that is willing to fight in a war instead of fleeing. She didn't like Dark Magic in school, but didn't view it as unforgivable as James, for example. Maybe she was the one that was willing to go deeper and more brutal into the fights.

** I often portray her as a straight up genius when it comes to magic, with a sturdy moral code and great capabilities for love.

To balance that out I often make her less detrimental, aka. the "Mary Sue flaws", be that of a chaotic sense for organisation, a tunnel-vision mind when it comes to research and experimentation and a kind of full-or-nothing stance on friendship and relationships.

For her actual, heavy flaws I often give her a gullible, naive stance on the finer points of social interaction - as in, she is great at reading books, but absolutely awful at reading people, which makes her susceptible to exploitation by others. She is also often involuntarily arrogant when it comes to less gifted people, and has no patience to explain complex subjects in detail, hence why the circle of her friends is a small one made of intelligent and capable wizards and witches (Marauders, McGonagall, Dumbledore, Flitwick, Snape, Pandora Lovegood, some of the Order). People of average skill and intelligence often find her to be obnoxious and exhausting, even if shes not insulting most of the times.

She was up against the top two students in her year and they'd have hexed her if she tried to against them. Maybe she was even buying time until a teacher came to the scene. She didn't flirt, I thought we'd established that already. And Jo made it quite clear through the text that Lily disliked James with all her being.

********** James would have hexed Lily? What??! No. No, absolutely no chance, his friends would have not dared to either. If people fancy you, you have a HUGE amount of power over them and both sides (Severus and James) fancied her.

No we did not establish that. Again. If she did not want to flirt, she was obviously too dumb to choose words that were not completely wrong.\\
Did JKR truly show that? If that is true, Lily was harassed for years and could not do anything about it. How disgusting would it be to make a love story out of this, let alone in a children's book?

*********** Well then, at least Sirius would've hexed her. How is saying 'I'd rather go out with the giant squid' completey wrong? I don't get how that's flirting at all. Then what was she /supposed/ to say? Just because you wouldn't personally say it doesn't mean that others wouldn't. You either want to portray Lily as dumb when we at least know she's great at potions and possibly charms or just an insensitive person, which she wasn't.

************ No way, James was called the head of the marauders for a reason and Sirius worshipped him. There is no way he wouls have dared to raise a finger.

I mean "dumb" as in socially idiotic, not academic. Though about the "brilliance" of Lily, we have big narrator's bias here, the only people we ever hear talking about Lily were completely taken by her.

So, you think this is an appropriate reaction? Really? I think it is horrible and therefore it either shows cruelty or idiocy. And therefore Lily has one of those as a trait and therefore flaw.

************* If she hadn't replied it would have been considered flirting. Who's to say Sirius wouldn't have? He led Snape down there to the Willow against all his friends' wishes. I still don't see how it's inappropriate to say that but agree to disagree. Regarding Lily's 'brilliance', I don't think she was 'brilliant' and Slughorn was clearly a bit biased but is it too much to say she was good at two subjects?

************** I think she was a good student in general, but this is beside the point. There are plenty of academically successful people that are socially inept.

Look at everything said about Sirius, about James and about Lily. No, Sirius would have never, not in front of James, never ever, nope not happening and I think you know that.

I have said all I have to say about this. Her reaction was bad, either caused by inability or cruelty, pick one and you have her flaw.
