I like a good bashing fic from time to time. You could argue that a /good/ bashing fic doesn't exist, but as long as it's written well on a technical level and you read it in the right mind set (i.e. not very seriously, like at all), I have no /real/ objections about them. They can be quite cathartic.

I love to hate on Snape too. I tolerate him most of the time, but nothing makes me happier than seeing him get a good ole bashing!

Super!Harry/Indy!Harry can be fun, but at this point they are either filled with cliches or written so poorly that I have to put them down. Watching Harry mop the floor with people can be great, but if there is never any real danger it gets boring.

And finally, time travel/alternate dimensions. Knowledge of the future fics are probably the biggest guilty pleasure I have. I'll read any of them once, no matter how bad the writing is. It's pretty much carte blanch to rewrite canon and save every character you love from death (i.e. Sirius).

So how about you guys and gals? I know some of you have some out there guilty pleasures, let it out!


** Lord Potter fics.

Complete with inheritance, bashing and a bazillion galleons backing up his paragraph of titles.

Once every trimester I walk this path of darkness.

** For all the times I criticise a load of Fanfic writers for having no idea how real relationships work, probably due to their entirely knowledge of the outside coming from other Fanfics, but occasionally I'll take enjoyment out of a poorly done romance fic, if it isn't anything I have to think about too hard and just exists as a simple wank fantasy that falls flat, the second you start to think about it.

** I love a good OC. Like Sirius Black's daughter joins the trio or Harry discovers he has a sister or a Sirius Black / OC set in the Marauder Era. I also read a lot of next-gen so OCs in those are pretty acceptable.

I love stories where Sirius or Remus intervene and somehow get Harry away from the Dursleys at a young age and raise him. Or the Potters come back from the dead and raise him. Having Harry grow up in a loving family just makes me happy.

I like Hermione-is-secretly-a-pureblood. I blame [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11149377/1/The-Muddy-Princess][The Muddy Princess]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11153333/1/Presque-Toujours-Pur][Presque Toujours Pur]] for this. In general, pure-blood society stories can be a guilty pleasure.

**** I am ridiculously fond of /Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels/ (HG/SS), which I think I've recced here before, but it just tickles my id like crazy and it's an epic, really immersive.

/Second Life/ (HG/SS), despite the marriage being a Dumbledore machination instead of a ministry thing, as this one really struck me as in-character and so well plotted alongside canon.

/With Eyes Wide Open/ (HH/SS), which is forced marriage by way of fulfilling a life debt. This one was kind of sweeter than the others. I find it to be a good comfort fic.

And /Cambiare Podentes/, which I know is a bit of a controversial rec because it seems like everyone already has Established Feelings about it, but it really hit all my "awkward forced sex" buttons to giddy degrees.

  ((originally posted elsewhere as "Bride of the Potions Professor")) Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.The guilt from killing Draco is bad enough, and knowing she saved Dumbledore doesn't help it, but when a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. But, of course, she's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

  Lily & James have hated each other ever since their initial meeting took a wrong turn. After a shocking goodbye at the end of their 6th year, are things going to be any different in the following year when they are forced to work together as Head Boy and Head Girl?

This is my favorite lol. It has Draco in leather pants (really), time turner, weird veela mating rituals, Sirius back from the dead, Lord/lady pureblood worshiping, some Ginny and Molly bashing, and much more. I love reading it with some wine.

****** It is tricky, let me see if I can explain it right.

I THINK that Harry and Ron are gay in the story, and Gabrielle is a veela and at some point during the triwizard tournament one or the other accidentally got some of the others blood and somehow became bonded. And since Harry is gay and is attracted to men, Gabrielle became a man to suit him? Something like that. They are a very minor pairing in the story.

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.

** I'm a sucker for an interesting OC-centric story in Hogwarts. I love any next-gen story with action without tons of romance too, no matter how good it is. I'm also big on Slytherin Harry and a Draco redemption/trio joinup early on, as long is he isn't paired with any of them under any circumstances, and he isn't suddenly flawless.
