I can't find any Harry/Neville fics that are a decent length. I don't care what the fic comes in. If it's no magic time travel eight-year just the ship is necessary


** Yes Harry/Neville would be so nice! They can relate to each other with their parents and prophecy stuff, and Harry was always so nice to Neville, and they got close in 5th year and it wouldn't be a big stretch to just continue that into 6th year and make it a romance! :) It could even fit in with all the other stupid romance crap that year! :) :) Also MAKE HARRY CONTINUE THE FUCKING DA BECAUSE WHY DID HE STOP THAT RIGHT AFTER THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS VOLDEMORT IS BACK?!?! HE SHOULD HAVE RAMPED IT UP AT THAT POINT JESUS CHRIST!!!!!!

I hate book 6 so much it's so inconsistent and random it's like a FULL STOP on the brakes on the highway of everything the past two books were building up to!!!

*** Yes I love to see others who ship this. I can never find any ships so I was wondering if anyone has them. Maybe the plot could be like 'private DA'

*** They have the one of thehealthiest friendship in the entire series. They really but heads and when they do it's usually about Harry doing everything himself. In first year that cute little your worth eight if him and Neville confiding in Harry in book 5. Neville also stays Harry's friend in book 4. aIt's just super cute

#+begin_quote
  In an alternate universe where Harry really did vanquish Voldemort as a child, Harry is sorted to Slytherin. Tired of trying to get along with his housemates, Harry spends his first Christmas at Hogwarts with Hedwig in the Owlery. There, he makes a friend who will stay with him for the rest of his life, and eventually become so much more.
