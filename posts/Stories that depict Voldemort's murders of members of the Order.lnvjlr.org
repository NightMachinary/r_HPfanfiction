Hi. I was wondering if you guys know of any fics that depict the murders of the Order members (those listed by Moody in OotP) at the hands of Voldemort and the motivations behind them. It seems to me that he was basically trying to take the Order out one member at a time but I would like to read something that offers some context to them. Thanks!
