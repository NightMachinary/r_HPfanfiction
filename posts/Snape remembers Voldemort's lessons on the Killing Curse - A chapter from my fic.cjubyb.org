Hi all! This is a chapter from a story I'm writing. It takes place after Snape learns he will have to kill Dumbledore. I deleted one sentence to avoid a rather minor spoiler if anyone wants to read the full story.

************

Snape was a faithful death eater for all of five years, in which he never killed anyone. Not in person.

For the first two years, he was still at Hogwarts, and for the other three, he was too inexperienced, and Voldemort left the murders to more accomplished wizards. But that didn't mean Snape didn't want to learn everything he could about the curse.

He longed to use it. He wanted to use it so much he knew exactly who he would use it on. On James Potter, on Sirius Black, and most of all, on his disgrace of a father - if he ever laid eyes on that miserable bastard again.

He dreamed about it. Having them cornered and helpless and pathetic, just as they had made him. Sometimes he toyed with the idea of sparing James. He reckoned it would be nice to let James Potter have a life debt to Severus Snape, and see how he likes that.

Under Lord Voldemort's rule, everything was possible. His revenge was as good as guaranteed.

He was a very promising young man, and as such, he was tutored on the unforgivable curses by the Dark Lord himself.

“Now, Severus. You must mean them. You have to mean them, or they will not work.” He said, in one of their lessons. Back then, Lord Voldemort still wore his original human form, and he was tall, handsome, charismatic, and formidable. Everyone drank in the knowledge he imparted upon them.

“Even if you fully mean it, it takes powerful magic, to separate a soul from a body. In my view, the force that ties souls to bodies is the single most powerful force in the world, and breaking it takes substantial skill, focus, and strength. I have complete faith that you will soon possess this ability.”

As a young death eater, a compliment from Lord Voldemort meant the world to Snape. That was all the motivation he needed to apply himself to learning the Killing Curse and the dark arts in general, on top of the Hogwarts curriculum.

He wanted to learn everything he could learn from the man who, at 16, accomplished what Severus could not and killed his Muggle father. He knew he missed his chance to reproduce this display of skill and strength of character, but just because he was too soft the first time, didn't mean he was going to miss the chance again, if the opportunity ever presented itself.

As the Dark Lord told him how he killed Tom Riddle, fantasies of doing away with his own father surfaced involuntarily into his mind, as did the memories of him leaving the Snape house forever with his body and soul very much intact. He was ashamed of his weakness, and determined to overcome it.

“When casting this spell, you must view your target as nothing more than subhuman filth.” He inflected the word filth. “Nothing more than an object. After all, when you are done with your target, that is precisely what they will be.”

Severus committed the dark knowledge to his memory with greed, recited it, and fell asleep while picturing himself in a windowless room with his enemies, viewing them as the despicable, useless objects that they were.

“Should you fail,” Voldemort imparted, “you will have betrayed your intention to kill, and at the same time, your weakness - your inability to do so. This is why viewing your target as subhuman filth, at best, is crucial for the spell to work, Severus. Ideally, you will come to enjoy your kills and view them as proof of your inherent superiority over your targets. Do you understand?”

“I understand, my Lord.”

In young Snape's mind, the term subhuman filth described Tobias Snape very accurately.

He practiced emptying himself of any trace of love or respect for his father, or hope for a better relationship with him. His Master told him to imagine getting everything he ever wanted from the Muggle, and then murdering him anyway. So he did. He imagined Tobias Snape apologizing to him for everything he did to him and to his mother, confessing that he killed her, or telling him how she died, telling him he loved his son, telling him he was beautiful and perfect to him, just the way he was. And then he imagined pointing his wand straight at his father, whom he bore such a disturbing resemblance to, and rejecting his love and his attempt at reconciliation.

He imagined James and Sirius finally admitting that he was simply the better, smarter, more courageous wizard, explaining why they hated him so much from the moment they first saw him (that part, he left blank, because he truly had no idea), apologizing for pretty much every moment of their acquaintance thus far. He had Sirius apologizing for almost setting the werewolf upon him, he had James apologizing to him for making him call Lily Evans a mudblood, even for marrying her. And then, in his imagination, he killed both of them. He imagined how wonderful he will feel when James Potter finally dies.

Severus Snape was a faithful death eater for all of five years, that ended with the Death of Lily Potter.

He didn't know how she died, at first. But he knew he was guilty.

When he saw her body for the first time since they were in school, when he was physically close to her for the first time since she tried to make James leave him alone and he repaid her by calling her that awful name, she was beautiful, whole, and perfect in every way, except that her perfect soul had left her perfect body for good.

He knew exactly what his master thought of her as he took her from the world, and he knew James Potter, his bitter enemy, died to give her a chance to live, and he knew, he felt it in every living cell in his body, that the only subhuman filth in the room was he, himself.

Severus Snape was a faithful death eater for all of five years, and for a little over a year, he has been pretending to be a faithful death eater again. And now he learned that he would finally get to use the Killing Curse. He would have to perform the mental gymnastic feat of denying a human's humanity on none other than Albus Dumbledore, who gave him a second chance, who believed in his better nature when no one else would, who recognized his courage. He was certain he was going to fail.

**** Your post did have a working link previously, but I think you were using a link to a specific chapter so the bot didn't work. I could still click on the link, which is how I got to the story. Then you realised it didn't work, so you changed it, but the bot doesn't check posts it's already checked. You can fix that by commenting 'ffnbot!refresh' in response to your own post, the bot will look at it again.

Edit: nevermind I did the ffnbot!refresh.

Edit2: OK, it worked, the bot linked your fic now.

****** No, no it was working the way you had it with the story number. The bot did link the story after I commented ffnbot!refresh. You could have stay with that.

The reason it didn't work the first time is because the URL contained the chapter ID too, the reason it didn't work the second time was because the bot only looks at posts once by default, but your command was correct. When I commented ffnbot!refresh, the bot looked at your post a second time and found your valid command, and linked the story.
