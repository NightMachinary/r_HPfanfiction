Hi, I'm looking for a fic that I read ages ago. I'm not sure of the pairing, but here is what I do remember.

The war goes poorly and Voldemort has the upper hand. Fudge tries to pressure Dumbledore but Dumbledore had had enough and transfigures Fudge's security into marbles? He then opens the school as a refugee/crisis centre to the wider population, while declaring Hogwarts independent in the fight.

Harry and Dumbledore have a good relationship and Harry travels to the Gaunt shack where he saves Dumbledore's life by severing his arm when D puts the ring on.

Ultimately Voldemort breaches the school and pairs up with Bellatrix to kill Dumbledore and Mad-eye. Dumbledore gets first blood by using the gems in the House point glasses as a weapon. Harry escapes.

Any help is appreciated.
