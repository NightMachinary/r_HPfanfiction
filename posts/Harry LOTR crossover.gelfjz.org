Hello my dear friends. Hope u r doing well and safe. There is another odd request, can u please share ur most favourite LOTR\Harry fics? Thx for answers. Be safe and wash ur hands. P.S. Please no slash, not a big fan, sorry.


** Hands down best is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar][Shadow of Angmar]], where harry is pulled into the LOTR world by the witch king, who is not pleased with the results.

The Author has also done some other HP/LOTR crossovers if those interest you though only [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] is currently complete

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13314997/1/Five-Istari-and-Four-Warlocks]]) It has MoD! and op!Harry, but god is it good. It's a sequel to linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13206329/1/Through-the-Veil]]) You don't have to read the first one, but it does help. While the first one doesn't start out strong, it becomes so much better after about the midpoint.

  Harry, Ron, Fleur and Katie travel to Middle-Earth as part of their interdimensional apparition experiment. The four pseudo-immortals tend to procrastinate a lot. Just like Gandalf and the Elves, really.

  Two alcoholic men decide to jump through the Veil. This takes them back to August 1st, 1993. They don't have much to lose, anyway - the only thing left to do is to go around and piss everyone off, true Marauder fashion. So they do exactly that.
