  Loki, de-aged and lost, wakes up in England. Well, he didn't know it was England, or maybe it was Scotland, he couldn't be sure since all he had to go on was a forest, a lake, a castle, a slightly cloudy sky and basically no knowledge of Midgard country names to go on but there was definitely something odd about the place. He could be imagining it in his slightly concussed and confused mind but somehow he didn't think owls carrying mail and children wearing robes were very common place not to mention the magic sticks.

  Loki never thought of himself as heroic. Cunning, cynical and luckless were his favorite. Luckless when instead of death, he got stuck in a body of a blond child. Luckless when he was once gain the odd-one-out among the magical community with magic sensing ability. Loki blamed that ability for every single trouble he encountered at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
