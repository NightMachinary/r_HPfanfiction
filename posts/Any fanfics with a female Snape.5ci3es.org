I'm interested to see how the relationship dynamics change with Snape a different gender. I've read some interesting docs where Harry is born a girl and how that changed everyone's perceptions and expectations. I'm thinking the gender divide would be even more pronounced in the 70s

** I'm thinking fem!Snape lashed out at Lily after Lily turned her down and that's when Lily kicked her to the curb. There's need to involve the Marauders in that particular broken friendship, since I doubt the Marauders could especially bully Snape without everyone mocking them for 'having a crush' on the nerdy poor Slytherin girl or without breaking any rules of chivalry they were raised with.

Motivation-wise, it's a similar situation to canon: Snape was in an emotionally vulnerable situation and lashed out when she felt humiliated by being rejected 'by a girl who's only a mudblood anyway!'

I feel like Snape and Bellatrix would have an especially antagonistic relationship as they're both trying to be the unquestioned best female exception to the male-dominated Death Eater group (Bellatrix the most vicious and devoted DE, Snape the most indispensable DE) and both hold the Carrow woman in utter contempt for being stupid and yet still being grouped with them.

** Here's a self-insert as a fem!Snape. So you probably will see big diversions if the author decides to stick with the story. These-Are-All-Warnings-You-Will-Likely-Forget linkffn(12223065)

** I'm working on a fic where the Marauders and Snape have been gender swapped to females, with a pauper Sally Snape, who is dating Lyle Evans, the rich Muggleborn from the "posher part of Spinners End", but is seeing Slytherin Seeker Regulus Black on the side.

It's a story where, given the choice, does Lyle split up with his girlfriend to date the Maraudette, Jenny Potter, the granddaughter of a famous Wizengamot member or stay with Sally and stop her from joining Bellatrix Black and Lucius Malfoy in becoming a Death Eater.

Whoops. I thought this gender and role reversal, it's just role reversal.

** I'm not sure it would make Snape a relevant character at all. FemSnape would either just be another Death Eater or become a family friend to the Potters. The prophecy might not ever reach Voldemort. FemSnape could just be a maternal figure for Harry. Harry would undoubtedly start Hogwarts with an advantage in Potions.

You could(read: shouldn't) swap the Snape/Lily dynamic to FemSnape/James although that's just convoluted and pointless.

Edit: my point was that making Snape a woman would be utterly pointless lol

*** Fem!Snape, like male!Snape, could be just another Death Eater who overheard a prophecy, took it to Voldemort, and then panicked when she realized the target was Lily, her estranged friend (and deeply hidden love).

Granted, I doubt the Marauders would target fem!Snape quite so physically, lest they gain reputations as woman-beating perverts.
