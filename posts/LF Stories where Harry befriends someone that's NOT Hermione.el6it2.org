I love Hermione, i really do. But it's so annoying that no matter what house the writer decides to sort Harry in, he eventually befriends Hermione, it gets to be too much at times.

No Character bashing of any kind, characters disliking or hating someone is fine, but the author going out of their way to hate someone, is normally a no go for me.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

I don't want Harry being super smart or super powerful, a little bit more powerful, or slightly smarter is fine, but make it believable.

Can be on any site

Would rather it be completed, but if not; that's fine.
