There was a recent post here about what you'd change in canon (I would link to it, but I'm on my phone atm!), where I saw someone repeat an argument I hear often, that Harry can't match LV in a fight because of Voldemort's age/experience advantage. I would like to argue against that.

Strong and knowledgeable wizards are not invincible. Horcruxes aside, it is perfectly realistic to me that a Harry with an inclination for learning how to fight could beat LV in a fight. All he needs is one trick-shot, one surprise opening and it would be over. I'm reminded of jbern's "Bungle in the Jungle" where a (at that point) weak Harry beats a BAMF hitwizard using a nanny charm that ties the guy's shirt up.

We see this in canon. Fucking /Draco Malfoy/ is the one to disarm/takedown Albus Dumbledore. Right time, right place.

I guess i am just frustrated when I see this defeatist attitude in fanfics, because it gives JKR a pass for her shit-awful 'final battle'. She could have made Harry something more than a dull, mediocre instrument of Dumbledore's post-mortem will. It wouldn't have ruined the story to have the hero actually fight the villain, instead of grandstand and make speeches, while relying on (an almost literal) act of god to survive.

It would be like if in Rudy, instead of the undersized guy training really hard to make the football team, he just believed and trusted that a tornado would come and kill enough starters that he'd get to play.


** When we say this we mean like a Dumbledore vs Voldemort atrium type duel. And technically canon Harry does have a one trick shot.

Harry would have to be an adult. At least mid 40s and I feel like that's very generous for canon, father of 3 Harry. I mean Voldemort waited until his mid 40s to take on Dumbledore and he was a prodigy.

*** I don't think he would be siring childrens if Voldemort was after his life. He becomes father only when Voldemort is dead, he even broke up with Ginny because of his quest.

I do agree on the age though, Voldemort was at the age of 45 years when he started his War, Grindelwald was born in 1882/1883 and also waited 45 years to properly start his Global Wizarding War (if Crimes of Grindelwald - 1927 - is counted as the starting point). It seems that mid 40s is when a wizard truly starts to reach his/her peak.

***** Sure, if Dumbledore is personally training him right from the age of 11 then he could possibly reach Voldemort's level by mid 20s or around his 30s. Voldemort and other wizards would have to find obscure knowledge, while Harry would get all the knowledge crammed in by a master.

Of course, that could work. And since Dumbledore is an internationally famous wizard, he could even send Harry to outside Britain for training.

*** This is a great response, but I'd like to argue against it if you don't mind :)

We see Voldemort actually fight for real twice - once against Dumbledore in the Atrium in detail, once against Slughorn/Flitwick/.... McG? during the battle of Hogwarts in very vague terms.

We do know, however, that Frank/Alice and James/Lily both fought him 3x and walked away. They were (basically) fresh out of Hogwarts at that point.

So I disagree Harry would need to be 40. He has the power already (chased away 100 Dementors in 3rd year), just needs some basic training and battle magic.

**** Once upon a time I would have agreed the Longbottoms and Potters fought Voldemort, but I read a story on ffn which changed my perspective on "defied." I don't remember if it's a one shot or part of a larger J/L fic, but the author has a Death Eater or Voldemort demand James and Lily to join 3 different times and J/L say no.

So while it's entirely possible they fought Voldemort magically, I don't think that's the whole truth of it anymore.

I just personally find it unbelievable a 17 yr old, no matter how good he is, can take on a prodigy in his prime on a leveled playing field. Even 17 yr old TMR would get worked by middle aged Tom, Albus, and Gellert.

***** I think JKR said that both couples fought Voldemort or where present in a battle with Voldemort those three times.

Defied in this case means, "fought and survived".

I think that people are taking this on this like it's dragon ball and after some level of power the other guy's attacks just become useless against the other, and it's not like that.

I think it's closer to a fight in real life, yes, the more experienced guy, still not bothered by age, would certainly win more, but luck or skill could give the beginner an opening.

For example, Voldemort toys with Harry enough to give him a split second opening where he stuns/ blinds/distracts and then AKs him, that's it. I think of it like fencing, even the most experienced guy could open themselves to a well-placed riposte.

All that we know about Voldemort's fighting style(when he's not playing) comes from one serious fight we saw in it's entirety and that had him running around while Dumbledore tried to whack him like a mole or tie him up, the most effective thing he did was spam AKs like they were going out of style, while Dumbledore transfigured stuff around and used magic fire whips. Voldemort was on the defensive the whole time.

The other fight is a three on one where Voldemort couldn't really hurt the others because Harry had powered a Resist Magic 90% buff on everyone.

I like to believe if Harry was talented like Dumbledore, and practiced every day since second year like some fics have it, he would have a similar duel with Tom, just with inversed positions.

***** I agree. We don't really know the definition of what 'defies' means. It could be a scenario like multiple Aurors trying to fight Voldemort while James and Lily escape. That could count like defiance.

Logically, the Potters shouldn't stand a chance in a duel against him. He's meant to be a 53 to 55 year old wizard who has traveled the world extensively for knowledge of all sorts, has practiced and horned his skills beyond 99% of wizards, and the only person who is in his league happens to be a wizard with 45 years of advantage in age. Compare this with the Potters, who may have been very talented at spellwork but they're only just out of Hogwarts, with no special training, or anything of such. Longbottoms are a slighly better case seeing as they're meant to be older (Auror training takes three years, and they were celebrated Aurors so they must've already caught a lot of Dark Wizards), but it is still hard to imagine someone in their late 20s overpowering Voldemort in a duel.

I prefer to interpret the 'defiance' as just going against his wishes - declining his offer to join the Death Eaters, perhaps ruining a plan of his, escaping successfully when he wanted them dead, subduing his followers, and so on.

***** Ehhhhhh LV is hyped up though. He was terrifying because of the guerilla warfare (imperius-ing peeps, never knowing who was working for him, who you could trust). He ran from Dumbledore through most of the 1st war, so we know he isn't a magical juggernaught.

And it is canon that, as a shade, LV was confused and disoriented, so that knocks off what, 15 or so years from his 'experience'.

I'd say he capitalized on his enemies' terror, age (Dumbledore was way over the hill), and stupidity (if Harry put half as much time into learning to fight as he did Quidditch...).

**** Per JKR in 2007, one of the three defiances was refusing to join him when the Death Eaters attempted to recruit them. It takes very little to "defy" Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  MA: What about the three times-- The thrice-defying of Voldemort?

  JKR: Of James and Lily?

  MA: Of Neville's parents. Well, James and Lily, too.

  JKR: It depends how you take defying, doesn't it. I mean, if you're counting, which I do, anytime you arrested one of his henchmen, anytime you escaped him, anytime you thwarted him, that's what he's looking for. And both couples qualified because they were both fighting. Also, James and Lily turned him down, that was established in "Philosopher's Stone". He wanted them, and they wouldn't come over, so that's one strike against them before they were even out of their teens.
#+end_quote

Also, the Voldemort vs Slughorn/Kingsley/McGonagall is not really a "real" fight because the Order people were protected by Harry's sacrificial magic. Voldemort lands multiple hits on them, but the magic does nothing because of Harry's protection. So it can't really be taken as a guide - by all indications, in a real fight Voldemort would have killed all three very rapidly and moved on.

*** What canon evidence can you provide beyond 'street rep' that Voldemort is that strong? Nothing in the Atrium duel (the only time we see LV 'take the gloves off') is shocking. Imaginative transfiguration wouldn't be all that technically difficult based on what classwork we see.

I guess I just don't buy the hype. Everyone is piss-their-pants scared because of the 1st war (which as I noted in another comment, was mostly hit/run, imperius/betrayal) or is Dumbledore talking him up. We see Harry do incredible magic. There's no reason to assume, if JKR were better at writing combat, that a more battle-tested/trained Harry couldn't give a legit fight against LV.

***** (Really enjoying this debate btw!!!) Killing Curse can't be cast silently (or at least, we never see any Unforgivable being cast that way), and it is a... (counts on fingers) 6 syllable phrase. Nobody's spamming that shit (say it 10 times fast, right now. How many times did it actually come out correctly?), no matter how great they are.

Secondly, Lockhart shows reputation is pretty meaningless in the Wizarding World.

Third, we know a majority of wizards are woefully inadequate at spellcasting (most students with OWLs at HW cannot cast a protego or expilliarmus correctly, plus the Weasley Twins say most cannot when pushing their Shield Hats). So Voldemort's strength/skill is measured against a mean that Harry already vastly surpasses - keep in mind he is more capable than the overwhelming majority of British wizards /in canon/, as a lazy jerk-off who plays chess with his buddy and spends most of his time thinking about Quidditch and girls.

Since we don't see LV vs. Bones, we don't know how that fight went. He might have barely scraped out a win for all the info we're given.

My fic will have LV get housed by Harry. All it takes is some imagination and actual preparation by Harry. Nothing outrageous, no otherworldly deities interfering (cough Hallows cough). Just actually thinking about how to kill someone and trying, instead of taking an AK to the head on the advice of your dead school teacher.

There's nothing wrong with Harry winning unconventionally and using non-direct tactics

However your story will suck if you're making Voldemort weaker just so that Harry will curbstomp him

I have read hundreds of stories like that. Harry uses logic and unconventional tactics to kill Voldemort. The only issue is that a lot of the time they turn Voldemort into an idiotic clown

People say Hitler is the worst of all time, when he isn't(by most statistics), he's just famous, same for Voldemort.

And remember we are talking about JKR often times lacking worldbuilding(in a done before plot way). Gellert has more feats than Voldemort just from one movie. The guy no sold thirty adult wizards, Aurors at that, like they were first-years throwing jelly legs jinxes, he then summoned that Fiendfyre/Protego Diabolica spell that had to be countered by twenty or more wizards.

Voldemort's greatest feat was blowing up a battered shield cast by three people.

Voldemort was a local terrorist at most, I doubt his merry band of rich racists could stand up to a real government, instead of the corrupt and sabotaged thing Fudge had going on.

Voldemort was doing his best to kill Dumbledore and Dumbledore was making him apparate around and spam the AK while he captured Bellatrix and shielded Harry, I am pretty sure he didn't dodge or block that AK because he knew Fawkes would just laugh it off.

Honestly, people hype him up, but I like stories where he's just a particularly powerful Dark Lord and not the bringer of the end times.

******* I didn't see this til now, since you were replying to someone else, but doesn't what you said - "make Voldemort a powerful dark wizard and little more" - correspond logically with canon?

We know Merlin, the Founders, Herpo the Foul, and others were incredibly powerful. Magic was everywhere in the past; despite LV's grandstanding and Dumbledore's fearmongering, even when I was reading the books (and had never touched fanfiction) I never came away thinking "Wow LV is the most powerful wizard ever!"

I'd say that to the people living through his insurrection, he is the worst, just like Pinochet was the most brutal dictator /to the people of Chile/ that he was "disappearing". If you think of it that way, the world in canon makes more sense, like how:

- the ICW waged war against Grindelwald, but ignored LV's rise (he didn't compare to GG)

- Harry is famous for surviving an AK, not necessarily killing a small-time Dark Lord

- Still no international reaction when LV took over Britain in the 2nd War

- Besides his original pureblood followers, all the Snatchers/new DEs were the wizarding equivalent of rednecks/low-born trash (LV wasn't inspiring ordinary people)

None of this is to say LV is /weak/, just that we see the HP-verse through a young boy's eyes, a boy who lives in a community that is terrified of LV. There is nothing concrete to base LV's delusions of grandeur that he's the most powerful baddie ever on.

It was a nice 'Harry is a proper hero rather than just a tool of Dumbledore's plan' moment, but grounded and restrained and fits the whole "You're stronger with other people, Harry, because they keep sacrificing themselves for you when you get into shit." theme of the actual books.

In my headcanon, Harry would rally the DA and probably as many other allies as he could (from the Order of the phoenix, other students, Hogsmeade) and then face Voldemort and ask him how many people he could possibly shield against. Voldemort would never ask his Death Eaters to help him but Harry has no problems with that.

Soon Voldemort realizes that he might have been the "most powerful Dark Lord in the world" but he's still not more powerful than 300 people focus firing on him. The first 60 stunners knockback his shield, the next 60 stunners crack it, the next 60 stunners shatter it to pieces. And there's still 120 stunners left to stop his heart completely. All without any risk of friendly fire.

And THAT is the power he knows not. The ability to trust others with his life and enlist their aid. That is the "love" that Dumbledore was talking about.

At dawn, look to the East." moment where his allies appear around him and his friends tell him they all care and want to help rather than him actively bringing them along.

Either way, it'd definitely be a more Harry Potter thematic-appropriate ending than Rowling's Deus ex Dumbledore.

I believe I agree with you 100%. Canon!Harry would likely want to face Voldemort alone and it would require his friends to knock some sense into him and explain to him what Dumbledore meant by "love".

** You do remember Why Draco managed to disarm Albus, yes?? It had nothing to do with Draco. Albus chose to paralize Harry, instead of facing whoever was coming up the stairs.

As for Harry's training, that's by design. As far as Albus was concerned, Harry was never supposed to survive his final encounter with Riddle. So why bother training the kid properly? It's not like they had 20 years to do said training.

** Voldemort leaves School in the late 40s, he appears in the Early 70's and the almost dies in 81, that's over 30 years of magical combat training and experience that Harry will never be able to catch up too, add on to this that Albus Dumbledore who's had 80 years of learning and teaching is barely able to push Voldemort back every time they fight and is unable to even capture him with the power of the Elder Wand at his disposal.

** Why does everyone want Harry to defeat Voldemort in a straight duel?

Why can't you make everyone contribute, make every key player have their moments? In real wars, tactical positioning always tops raw combat power anyway. Gallant duels will no longer be necessary if you can deliver your firepower against an unsuspecting and unprepared enemy. War is all about deception and fighting UNFAIRLY!

Make use of Tonks's metamorphus ability, make her the super infiltrator.

Make use of Dumbledore's alchemy power, and let him develop aerosolized basilisk venom.

Voldemort may have superb destructive combat power, but he had to identify a target first! In fact, like in modern Muggle warfare, any Magical target that could be identified could also be destroyed. Voldemort may be super strong in offense, but a Killing Curse cast at his unsuspecting back would still destroy his body. And his Death Eaters would be of course far far more vulnerable.

--------------

Harry of course needs to be trained, but its main purpose is not to defeat Voldemort one on one, but defeat rank and file Death Eaters and their Ministry goons with relative ease. Harry will far more likely face these scums than the big bad himself, and Harry will absolutely need to survive these encounters with high chance to complete his mission.

Not training Harry just because he wouldn't be able to defeat Voldemort in a straight duel is totally retarded.

*** I doubt any of Hogwarts' staff has read Art of War. Why would any of them think to do any of this? Most wizards live completely separate from Muggles and especially Muggle warfare. Dumbledore spent years in Hogwarts teaching, probably only venturing outside rarely, and certainly not to go on a muggle battlefield or read up on muggle military tactics.

** It's not defeatist to assume that Harry has no chance, it's realistic. Draco disarming Dumbledore was a once in a lifetime lucky shot considering all the mitigating factors involved, namely Dumbledore was dying from a curse, hopped up on an unknown poison, and was preoccupied with keeping Harry hidden and safe. This would never happen with Voldemort.

I was fairly satisfied with the ending. It was thematically appropriate. Harry's sacrifice protected his loved ones and the villain was defeated by his own hubris and lack of empathy and love. Very storybook, which I feel was the intent.

*** Not trying to change your mind, but besides the satisfaction that Harry actually beating LV would have brought, what bothered me most about the ending was that it cemented Harry's status as truly lacking agency. When push came to shove, he was just doing the things that Dumbledore laid out.

And /that/ means that the tale of a plucky young orphan and his two best pals was /actually/ the story of a jaded old man who espoused a plan that was only matched in intricacy by his opponents mindlessly convoluted schemes. What an awful message.

**** To each their own. Harry having a big ol' fight with Voldemort is satisfying to read in a fanfic, but with the books that were built to be about something I find themes to be more satisfying. Harry's just a regular kid throughout most of the series. Of course he lacks agency. A child coming up with a winning strategy against someone built to be the most powerful dark wizard there was is like Frodo figuring out how to beat Sauron and telling Gandalf to suck it.

If that's the way you want to see Harry Potter then that's fine, that's your right, but I disagree categorically. Dumbledore gave him a plan, a vague one at that, but Harry and co did the work, struggled and suffered against seemingly impossible odds to come out with a win.

*** Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
