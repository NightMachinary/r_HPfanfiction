Is there any fanfiction that shows Good!Umbridge? If Snape, Dudley, Draco, and even Voldemort could be redeemed, why not Umbridge? Is the fandom hate her that much?

The only fanfic that I remember not showing Umbridge as a devil-spawn is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Prince of Slytherin]]


** Thing is, Umbridge is designed as a hate sink, and the best example of one I've ever seen. Every other character gets more nuance, but sometimes you need one villain who you can unabashedly hate without feeling any guilt.

*** For my money, her being such a perfect "hate-sink" makes her a /vastly/ better villain than Voldemort. "Crazy and homicidal and lusts after infinite power" is some boring-ass cartoonish characterization that's so removed from actual human behavior that it's hard to care about the character.

But "suck-up toady bully who's a low-key sadist" is a person that actually exists. Shit, I had to deal with two of them in one office I worked at. And putting her in the context of a novel that has Harry struggling with PTSD and anger and being-15-ness makes her just perfect.

** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] both Umbridge and Rita Skeeter are portrayed as more complex than their one-dimentional canon incarnations. Rather than being universally horrible to everyone, they turn out to be highly competent and useful allies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] portrays Umbridge as a bit more sympathetic. She's still as horrible to the students as she is in canon, but she also has moments of surprising loyalty and intelligence when not in front of an audience.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
