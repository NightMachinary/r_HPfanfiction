This is a note to all fanfiction authors, whether you are new to the fanfiction or you are a veteran author. We all pick up bad habits in writing and it takes an active attempt to correct them. I post this with no intention of causing offense, but rather in hopes that I can be of some help. I'll start off with some of the most common issues.

- It's okay to SAY things. This is something that many authors, including myself, have fallen victim to. We get tired of writing 'said' in every other paragraph, so we find any other word we can use. Every once in awhile, it may be okay, depending on the context. As a general rule, however, if we catch ourselves searching for a word to use, it's best to go with said.

- Using descriptives instead of names or he/she. This is one thing that will always pull the reader out of our story. Again, I know writing he or she over and over can feel redundant, but the reader rarely notices that. However, when we write something like, “The red-haired Gryffindor,” it draws the attention away from Ron. If the reader knows who we are referring to, use he or she. If it's unclear, give the name. The reader already knows what people look like, their values or their Hogwarts house, so we don't need to describe them further.

- Show, don't tell. One of the things that ALWAYS pulls me out the canon books is in PoA when Hermione is telling Harry what happened after he passed out on the train. If you recall, she told Harry about Professor Lupin standing and saying, 'None of us are hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks.” She then told about Lupin driving off the dementors. In all honesty, this needed to not be told through another person. The scene would have been fine if Rowling had just continued the scene after Harry fainted. Better to break PoV than have another character take the role of narrator. (Note: This seems to be a source of contention as many are using a few scenes to justify the scene, so I will say this. We have already seen a few instances where the PoV switched from Harry to show what was happening, such as when his broom was jinxed and Hermione ran off to solve the problem. The story wasn't retold later but shown as it happened. Also, I will say the dementor scene was jarring for me, but it may not be to someone else.)

- What's going on? It's easy to get caught up in dialog and forget what's going on outside of the dialog. Our characters are not standing perfectly still and talking (usually). They do move about and react to what the other says. Personally, if I see nothing but the dialog between two characters, I assume there is nothing going on. They are just standing there doing nothing. Tell us what they're doing.

- TMI. This is the other side of the coin from the last point. When we feel the need to tell EVERYTHING that happens or when we're trying to beef up a short chapter with endless little details. If our stories are engaging, it doesn't have to be a 15k word chapter. Tell us what's going on, but don't drag it on.

- Replying to reviews in the author's notes. Yes, feel absolutely free to reply or one or two. Or give a general statement on a common review topic. But please don't add pages to each chapter to reply to each one. You are able (at least on fanfiction.net) to reply to most reviews. There are some fics (I won't name names) that I have in e-book format. I had to go in manually remove pages of review replies per chapter. This, by no means, means ignore your reviewers, but to find a happy medium.

- Beating a dead horse. I'll say this simply. If you've grown tired of your story, take a break. Writing tires the mind as much as running tires the body. If you feel in a rut, have writer's block, are tired of writing or whatever the case might be, take a step back. You can come back to it later when you're refreshed and ready to go.

- Sneaking pairings in. This one is pretty infuriating to me. I'll be reading a good fic, it's shaping up to be one of my go-to's and then BOOM! Harry has a date planned with Draco and Fred is jealous. If you want to make a slash love triangle, go ahead, but not in a fic that's already five chapters in and has me invested into it. That will just alienate many people that would have loved your story otherwise.

What other tips do you have for authors?

Edit: This sparked a lot more conversation than I expected. Thank you to everyone that joined in.


** Broadly agreed, but the specific case of Hermione filling in the Dementor blackout doesn't bother me. I find it's just consistent because the books are told mostly in a third person limited voice with Harry as the perspective character. There are exceptions (the first chapter of PS, first chapter of GoF, first two chapters of HBP, etc.), but in general if Harry doesn't perceive something then we, the audience, don't get to perceive it. By stopping the narrative when Harry loses consciousness, we get to experience his confusion and embarrassment upon waking up.

** Oh /thank you./ The use of random description instead of names is one of my main bugbears in fic. "The bushy haired Gryffindor witch." JUST CALL HER HERMIONE, THATS WHAT NAMES ARE FOR!

I think it links to my second main bugbear, which is over-use of names. Writers of fic have a tendency to use the names too much, which is why it then gets repetitive and they look for alternatives and you end up with sentences like "Harry watched the sandy haired werewolf make tea." You don't need to name each character each time. It should be clear enough from your writing who you are talking about so you can just use pronouns about 50% of the time.

People also over use names /between characters in dialogue./ for example, Harry may shout "Sirius, wait up" because he wants to get Sirius's attention, which is fine, but if he was coming into the room Sirius is in, he would probably just say "hi", not "hi, Sirius" unless he's clearly brooding over something and wants Sirius's attention so he can talk. If he wants to stop Sirius doing something, such as, idk, opening a box full of Peruvian Darkness Powder, he would probably shout "Sirius, no" or similar. If he wants Sirius to stop poking him with a chopstick and giggling (totally something that would happen imo), he'd probably just say something like "can you not?" or "stop that," unless he was /really annoyed/ by it, then he might use the name.

But so many conversations in fic have too much name use. You'll get something like:

/"Hi Harry."/

/"Hi Ron."/

/"How was your summer, Harry?"/

/"It was good, Ron. How was yours?"/

/"Yeah, I did loads of flying. Did you get to fly at all, Harry?"/

/"Yeah I did, Ron. We went to stay with Remus and he lives in the middle of nowhere so loads of space to fly."/

/"Oh that's awesome, Harry. How is Professor Lupin?"/

By about the fourth line of dialog like this, I want to scream. You do not use someone's name every time you talk to them. Go speak to your partner, or sibling, or friend, and say their name in every single sentence. See how long you last before they start to think you're taking the piss out of them. It doesn't sound natural at all.

The best writing reflects how real people speak and think.

*** What pulled me out of a fanfiction once, to the point I closed the tab, is the descriptor instead name, when the descriptor wasn't really good for the character.

It was a story where Sirius was good, and clearly disguted with his heritage and family history. And author kept refeering to him as "The Pure-blood". It felt awkward and really wrong.

Also like some paradox was going on. The story was telling me that pure-blood stuff was bad. But the writing stressed it so much that it felt like the author did like all that pure-blood bullshit.

**** "the pure-blood" is probably the most annoying of all of the random descriptions instead of names. I mean, which bloody pureblood? That could apply to around 50% of the main characters in the series. Do you mean Sirius? Ron? Draco? Any Malfoy or Black or Weasley? Maybe you mean Neville. Or perhaps Pansy Parkinson or pretty much any Slytherin.

Also, how is "pureblood" even a description? Is it something you can tell by looking at someone? At least if they say "the haughty blond" you /know/ that's Draco. But still, just use names. The whole reason human beings have names is so we can identify ourselves and each other!

****** Yeah I can live with that, because Ron is Harry's friend so Harry will recognise him as such when he thinks of him, if that makes sense? Name or pronoun is preferred, but it can also be ok to refer to the person via their relationship to the POV character. I mean, if you're Harry Potter and you're looking at Ron Weasley, you think of him in one of three terms, broadly speaking. You [Harry] would think "There's /Ron/," "There /he/ is," or "there is /my friend/."

As an example, this bit of description works:

/Harry had had reservations about going on the hike Sirius suggested. And he was even more pissed off now, that he was hot, tired, sunburned and they had run out of water. He did have to admit, however, that it had almost been worth it when Sirius sat on a beehive and he got to laugh hysterically as/ his godfather /ran around clutching his arse./

Compare with:

/Harry had had reservations about going on the hike Sirius suggested. And he was even more pissed off now, that he was hot, tired, sunburned and they had run out of water.

"His godfather" works fine. "The dark haired animagus" just sounds clumsy and pointless.

*** So, my first name is related to sea. And it is also a common noun.

I was working in a classrooom, and teacher were asking kids words that are related to the sea. After just a few words, kids drew a blank.

Teacher then talked to me for a short convo, and said my name every time she'd talk to me, just as you wrote.

Kids saw it for what it is, and took the hint.

Point is, if even kids felt it was so weird that it might hide something, there's a high chance that your reader will notice how weird your dialogue are.

*** That's not exactly what the "show vs. tell" argument is centered on, though. Perspective is irrelevant; showing and telling are two styles of writing that describe what is happening in the moment. Telling is rote and informative, while showing is evocative and heavily centered around imagery. Take Harry's first meeting with Hagrid, for example. You could tell like this:

"The man coming through the door was tall. He walked through the door and sat on the couch. Uncle Vernon shook in place in the kitchen."

Alternatively, you could show like this:

"Harry craned his head as high as it could go. He met the man's beady gaze, positive his own eyes were bulging as much as a pale-faced Uncle Vernon's. The doorframe groaned as this bizarre man popped through it. Little plinks of metal punctuated every rock-cracking step he took, courtesy of Uncle Vernon trying to untangle his shotgun's stock from the teeth of his cardigan's zipper."

You can tell someone, in dialogue, about an event that happened while the perspective character wasn't there. That can still be showing. Perspective has nothing to do with the show vs. tell argument.

**** I agree that perspective doesn't generally matter but the OP made the point that they thought during the dementor train scene of POA that after Harry passed out the perspective should have switched to show what happened with Lupin driving them off because having Hermione tell Harry about it after he woke up violates the "rule" of show-don't-tell. I think that's ridiculous because once you've established that your narrative follows one character's perspective then changing out of that perspective midway through an actiony scene seems mad.

I agree that showing is very important but the idea of never telling seems like madness to me.

***** I feel like you didn't understand the core of my argument. Perspective has /nothing/ to do with show-vs-tell. Following a single perspective isn't showing or telling at all, it's a completely separate tenet of writing. "Showing" refers to the writer using evocative language, imagery, and metaphor/simile to give the reader information that isn't explicitly stated. "Telling" refers to the writer stating the relevant pieces of information without allowing the reader to infer. A lot of "telling" goes along the lines of "Harry was ___" or "Harry had ____". In contrast, "showing" often makes use of actions that indicate height difference (as only one example in character interaction) and language that invokes non-ocular senses. The reason people argue for "showing" over "telling" is because "telling" leads to robotic paragraphs that have very little sensory description in them, which damages the reader experience as a whole.

The PoA scene that OP is referring to has nothing to do with show-vs-tell. That's an argument of "Third-person limited" perspective vs. "Third-person objective". Show-vs-tell is easily one of the most misunderstood and misapplied concepts in fiction, but I can't stress enough that perspective has nothing to do with show-vs-tell.

** I definitely, definitely, wholeheartedly agree with the 'beating a dead horse' one. Sometimes there really is such a thing as trying too hard, and at those times, stopping and taking a break is very needed.

If you're just having trouble with one scene of many, though, a good tactic is to start writing just that scene on a blank page. It can really help, not having the weight of all your other words pressing down on you while you're trying to write.

**** The basic gist of the explanation I favour is that pre-existing stuff provides pressure. Pressure to continue it well, to be in the same mind-set you were when you wrote it, to follow-it up in an interesting way, it's all focused more on what you wrote before than what you're writing now.

Starting a new page gets rid of all that pressure and lets you just write the paragraph, without thinking of it constantly in relation to the stuff you've wrote before.

** Great advice. I agree with almost everything except this:

#+begin_quote
  The scene would have been fine if Rowling had just continued the scene after Harry fainted. Better to break PoV than have another character take the role of narrator.
#+end_quote

I disagree with this because the series in its entirety (aside from the first chapter of book 1 and the the chapters in book 6 with the prime minister and the one with the unbreakable vow. Oh, and the one where charity burbage is murdered) is in Harry's third person limited perspective. To pull readers out of that perspective to show what happened after Harry passed out just doesn't fit the style the books at all, and, frankly, that would have pulled me out of the story more than Hermione simply relaying the events.

I wouldn't say that the few chapters outside of Harry's perspective sets any sort of precedent for this because those events happened far away from Harry and any setting he's ever been in. Those chapters also have a tonal and stylistic difference than the rest of the story.

Yes, that scene would have been more interesting to read first-hand, but writers have to follow their own rules. If the story is told in one character's POV, it needs to stay that way. Writers are free to tell a story from multiple perspectives, but imo it needs to be established, and not just thrown in when convenient.

** No offence but I think a lot of these are personal preferences more than anything. I know they are fairly common advice for writers, so presumably fairly popular preferences, but I still disagree with some of them at least to a point.

While not going overboard with alternatives for said (or any other word) is a good idea, I'd argue how much of an issue it is depends on the overall style. If the writing is more plain or direct I'd say it might be distracting or out of place. But if it's more flowery, for example, it's less of an issue or might even fit better than the repetition. Though a lot of (fanfic) authors admittedly struggle with writing the latter well.

I know I'm in the vast minority on this, but I actually don't mind descriptors, on occasion I even like them. I think it depends a lot on the exact descriptor used and whether it fits the characters and situation. Again, it's often done poorly, but doesn't mean the concept itself is always awful. If done extra well, I'd argue it can even help with characterisation of the POV character.

I also think telling instead of showing is perfectly fine, so long as what is told doesn't contradict what is shown. Telling a character what happened while they were gone is perfectly fine, so long as it won't seem out of place for the characters and situation. The example with Hermione is fine, it makes sense and is fairly believable. The issue with "Show don't tell" is more with regards to characterisation. Where for example the narrative says a character is a certain way when their actions contradict or don't show this. This can be done intentionally with unreliable narrators, but I often see it done unintentionally.

The dialogue thing I think is also more of an issue depending on context. I've read dialogue only stories which were good, and it certainly wasn't an issue there. Similarly, if it's clear from context what's going on (i.e. they are walking down a hallway to class) then unless an action is important, depending on the overall style of the story, writing more than the dialogue isn't always necessary. Depending on the secene, actions may just not matter.

Detail is really just a matter of preference. Some people like that "Victor Hugo" sort of writing, with a lot of seemingly pointless/excessive details and digressions. It's only really an issue when it's very inconsistent with the overall style/tone of the story or results in a lot of non-style or story related repetition (i.e. he said angrily with a mad face).

There is absolutely nothing wrong with introducing pairings some time into the story. Unless the story explicitly says there will be no pairings or the stated plot gets completely and permanently derailed by the introduction, it's fine.

As for advice, I'd say:

Be consistent with your writing style and tone, or if you change it have a good reason for it.

If you decide to go for more flowery/poetic language, look up what words mean before you use them if you aren't sure if they fit or if you aren't too familiar with them. Even words that seemingly mean the same thing can have different connotations.

Don't interrupt your own story for notes unless that is part of the story. If you want to clarify or comment on something, use footnotes instead. They are less distracting/immersion breaking.

Don't be afraid to try around with different types of storytelling, especially if you are a beginner or struggling/bored/unhappy with the one you currently use. Third person limited/omniscient modern-novel-style prose isn't the only option. Write a first person travel account, stream of consciousness, or even a fake bibliographical essay and see how it goes/what works.

** Those are all good points. I suppose I may as well add that good paragraph breaks and paying attention to spelling and grammar helps maintain the flow of the story. Additionally, spelling things like the name of characters and Hogwarts houses correctly is appreciated.

As to story content, pacing is important, and taking the time to explore plot points. Sometimes fics get to a critical stage too soon, e.g. in severitus stories sometimes I have read where Harry and Snape are hating each other in chapter 1 and best friends by chapter 3.

** All excellent points! I have a couple that I would add that I see frequently:

- Please don't add multiple paragraphs of details or flashbacks in the middle of your dialogue. If you start a conversation between two characters but feel the need to add context, keep it succinct or move it out of the conversation. The reader shouldn't have to go back and re-read the beginning of the conversation because you spent three paragraphs explaining background details.

- Related to the above, you don't need to recap the entire story in every chapter. I see a lot of fics that feel the need to summarize every nuance about why a character feels the way they do about something every single time they are in a new scene. Trust your readers to remember these details, or keep the recap short at least.

Then in chapter 30, for the main male antagonist becomes just a bit nicer, and the story change to hate-to-love story, and by chapter 40, the woman had cheated, and break up with her long-time partner, and started a serious relationship with previously hated-on guy. And adventure became background.

Because realistically, Harry wouldn't just start dating someone that has made it their life goal to ruin his own. Not to mention the chapters and chapters of self discovery that would take. In the real world, people don't go from straight to gay in a matter of weeks. In the real would, that would take months to years. If your character goes from 100& straight to having a date with someone of the same gender in a matter of days, then they probably are bipolar.

**** I feel like this is mixing multiple issues. First it's etiquette to have your pairings tagged.

I find it annoying if I'm reading a Slytherin Harry fanfic without knowing that in a couple of chapters it's going to turn into a harem. Warn me so I can decide if I'm going to continue with pairings that I may or may not like.

Second, romance in general is hard to write. The truth is that most romance in fanfic is just jarring. It's very rare for me to find a slash or het pairing in a fic that feels genuine to me

The third issue is that sometimes people want to write more about the pairing instead of the journey. People want to explore the Draco/Hermione dynamic rather than spend time altering Draco and creating a fanon version of characters and events where such a thing would be realistic.

The same is true with slash. Sometimes people just want to write a gay Harry without dealing with the messy reality of what that actually means.

And honestly it can be exhausting to read about a person coming in terms with their sexuality. All of that angst and internal conflicts. Het pairings don't really have to deal with that as much, while a realistic slash fanfic often does

On the other hand, people comes to terms with who they are differently. It's not unrealistic for a person to just realize, “hey I'm gay” without all the drama. What you said about it taking weeks and years isn't a universal thing

It's just as realistic for a character to accept that they're gay as it is for a character to angst over it. Everything else is dependent on how well the author set things up

I find exactly one guy in Harry's age group interesting, and that's Harry. Kinda difficult to create a gay pairing out of one guy.

And for other eras, Sirius is the lone guy in that age group, and time travel shenanigans where he fucks the guy who is a carbon copy of his best mate while having the eyes of his best mate's crush would be more than just weird.

** One thing I would add is to avoid unnecessary repetition. I've read too many fics where something happened to e.g. Harry, but Hermione was gone for some reason.. Then later you have Harry tell Hermione what happened and the author writes in great detail what exactly happened again, prob. just a chapter after it happened. That is just annoying as a reader as you just recently already read what happened to Harry.

Of course there are exceptions to this, let's say Harry gets a dream about Voldemort and Harry then goes to Dumbledore about that dream and they analyse together what the dream showed to Harry. There it makes sense to retell the dream in more detail as it is getting used again as an element in the story. But if it's just Harry telling Hermione that Draco and Ron fought each other you don't need to retell the whole fight again, you can just say that, well, Draco and Ron fought each other.

Another reason to retell stuff is if it's an important event at the beginning of the story, but you are now 200k+ words in, then you can use a retelling as a way to refresh the memory of the reader, basically just don't retell stuff in detail if it doesn't serve any specific purpose.

** ALL WHAT YOU SAID!

Also:

- Show, don't tell and don't tell again, and again. Your readers are not idiots. This is one of the reasons why most fanfictions are so horribly too long (and 90% of all stories longer than one chapter could and should be cut in half at least, and some are way worse ... just wrote [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][review]] of linkffn(Breakfast in New York by Radaslab). Author in couple of paragraphs announces that this was the most important moment of their lives, then plays the speeches, than views whole talk from his point of view, then from her point of view, then she talks about it with her friends, and then author comments on what it really meant for both of them. And reader just wants to pull his hair out and runs away crying. Once again, your readers are not idiots, and if you think they are, then switch to writing advertisements.

- To the “Beating a dead horse”. To be blunt, if you cannot make yourself to care about your own story, why do you think anybody else will?

- Serialized writing is crazy. Whenever I published any part of story before I finished it whole I regretted it (and rewrote it again, and again, and again; “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.” Michael Crichton, alluding to Steele MacKaye (1889) article where he said this about theater plays).

- Let your characters breath ... there are so many stories, where author was very persuaded how it should finish, and who should end with whom, that he had to beat them into submission many times. If you open your editor with the resolution “I want to write the Harmony story”, you will write another of thousands nonsenses which are all over the Internet. Yes, you have some ideas, who they are, but let them live and find out during your story whom they like and do their mistakes.

- Second reason why so many stories are terribly boringly long is that authors need to describe everything: how they got up, they put on their clothes, brush their teeth, had breakfast, and another twenty pages before they get finally to the action which is really interested. If you write “After the breakfast they left house and ...” nobody will care, because we all know how people get up in the morning and how they eat their breakfast. Is there some specific point forced by the plot that we need to know which piece of clothing they put on (most of the time, reader cannot care less, whether her skirt was green or whether she was in old jeans)?

Yeah, but what if I want to get better?

Some people write just for fun and don't really are about actively bettering themselves. And that's fine. The tips OP gave aren't for them. They are for the people that search out how to write better stories.

**** Yeah exactly. I like to think I'm a pretty good writer. I mean, I know lots of words and I understand the basics of storycraft. But I /always/ want to be better, because the more people that enjoy my work, the more happiness I am bringing to our little corner of fandom. I've actually paid for writing classes, knowing pretty much that I'm paying to write better fanfic. But it's worth it because I get to improve my skills and anyone who reads my work gets a higher quality of story.

Constructive criticism should always be taken in the spirit it was given in - that the person offering it /wants you to improve your skills./

** It's annoying when people mix descriptions/ titles /names / relations.

Harry describes Lily as his mother not as Lily, and Sirius as Sirius not as his godfather, mutt or anything else when describing about them.

Descriptions are for strangers who never met that particular character. Harry can call Malfoy as blonde with pale skin, but once introductions are done it would be Malfoy/Draco based on relationship between them. We can also use nicknames like ferret when Harry was angry/ making fun of Malfoy with his friends.

Titles are used based on situations and familiarity. Ron and Hermione don't call Harry as Auror Potter unless they're in formal setting or making some joke about his work ethic. Same with Lord and other titles.

** I agree with most of these, but “show, don't tell” isn't always a hard rule. “Showing” is useful for emotional scenes; “telling” is useful for mundane details. Authors don't need to describe the intricacies of Harry's walk to Transfiguration class, for example.

Also, a lot of fanfiction struggles with bad pacing, even fics I often see recommended on the sub. Pacing is significantly affected by “show, don't tell”. If you “show” all the time, your pacing is probably going to slow to a crawl.

** Honestly, a lot of those multi hundred thousand word long fics are 50% filler, and another large chunk of mental ruminations. My big advice is, *"GET TO THE FUCKING POINT."* I don't need to see your character waking up, lying in bed, then launching into this long-ass brooding internal monologue about something that I'm going to see again once the character actually experiences it. All that shit can easily be cut, and nothing that effects the story will have been lost.

There are several times when someone will send me a fic for a quick once-over to see if it flows, and I can essentially cut out the first few pages all together, because the author is so busy trying to show that they've thought this through that they're putting literally every thought into the opening scene. You don't need to do that. Save that for your personal notes, and let the world unfurl as it needs to. *Only let out something that would be unusual, or worth commenting from a character in cannon.* That is, we all know that house elves wear raggedy clothes, and generally look like scrawny little things. If your house elf, on the other hand, is a plump little thing wearing crisply starched chef's whites, because their humans are bakers or something, mention it. Otherwise, leave it alone. We all know what they look like. You're wasting time.

Ditto that for heavy duty musings on exactly what the room looks like. This isn't an RPG. Chances are, nobody actually cares, and is skimming past those laboured descriptions of the decor of a particular room. In general, you can hand-wave away anything that isn't overly unique or standing out to a character in cannon. They walk into their 8th year shared dorm, and there's couches, a fireplace, and some rugs and shit on the floor? Cool. Nobody cares. We don't need detailed descriptions of the artwork, the furniture, the wall colours, the curtains, and every other minor, pointless detail. Get on with it. They walked into a shared dorm that had well-used but comfortable furniture. The rest you can hand-wave away, and nobody will lose anything.

Same goes for exposition about whatever pet theory you're entertaining. The mechanics aren't nearly as important as the amount of time you're giving it. Likely, nobody is going to think you're brilliant for droning on--either in narrator exposition or a character doing the same--about said pet theory. Handwave most of it, and get on with it.

** I fully agree! That said, everything in moderation. Some of these things can be good in really small doses (except sneaking in pairings, that's a no go man!) but fic writers (and publishes writers) can sometimes go way overboard.

** I appreciate that you have clearly thought about the (fanfic) writing process, and took time to write what I view as a helpful post for a sub where fanfic authors are prevalent and would benefit from it. I did benefit, from the ensuing discussion as well as from your thoughts and comments.

My suggestion to fic writers is to work with a beta reader, particularly if you are a new author. Storytelling is both an art and a science; it's useful to recruit a seasoned writer, or a writing group, into one's process in order to craft an engaging fic.

** I think descriptors instead of names is fine in certain circumstances like (this isn't Harry Potter but is a prime example) the red prince from divinity 2. That's his title we never learn his name so if some one calls him red then I think it's fine to use the red lizard or just red.

** I think there's a distinct difference between using an exhaustive amount of descriptors in place of a name, and using a SINGLE descriptor. In my personal opinion, it's perfectly fine to describe someone as "the slytherin" or, maybe even, "the witch"/"the wizard" so long as it isnt used excessively.

Of course, when you go about saying "the tall, dark haired, black eyed slytherin" every three paragraphs things are going to get exhaustive and annoying quickly.

It all depends on the persons writing style and tone, and what is and isn't a "bad habit" in a medium heavily based on individual style and nuance is hard to say in the first place. Still, most of your points hold water, even are very wise, but people shouldn't forget to keep in mind that even renowned authors of classic works had extreme variants in style, from long winded prose to short, staccato sentences. All I mean to say is that authors, especially new, impressionable authors, should take this advice but with a grain of salt as they develop their own style.

** Something else that I just thought of - authors sometimes invent customs for their particular wizarding world which can be difficult to read. I recently started reading a fic (can't recall the title) where all the children from magical families said "Merry meet" and "Merry part" to each other, instead of hello and goodbye. This seemed so silly that I did not read many chapters of this story.

** Good list, both for fanfic and for fiction in general. One quibble and one additional item:

*The quibble:*

If you are going to rehash a canon scene or dialogue word for word, the "show, don't tell" rule is suspended: tell, don't show.

The reader has almost certainly been shown that scene a hundred times. They are going to skim it anyway, so you might as well just summarise what happened or maybe show the aftermath. Don't waste the reader's precious time and increase their cognitive load by making them figure out where the rehash ends so that they could resume reading.

And, if you somehow tag the quotation from canon, that's not helping; that's just jarring.

*The additional item:*

Breaking the Fourth Wall should be done very carefully and with a clear idea of what you intend to accomplish by doing so. In particular, doing it to draw the reader's attention to how in your AU a character did something different in a situation from what they had done in canon is never a good reason. (You know what I mean: "Now, in another universe, Harry had meekly accepted having to stay at Durskaban, but this Harry was different, and...")

** I find Americans writing British characters really, really annoying. No, Hermione did not "graduate" "valedictorian" with her "Hogwarts diploma". You don't graduate from secondary school, we don't have stupid terms like valedictorian and you don't get a diploma from your high school. If she left school with her NEWTs, she would have 5 or 6 different, unrelated qualifications. She would not have a diploma. She wouldn't even find out her results until August.

Medical debt should not be a plot point. We have plenty of poverty in Britain. Medical debt is not a thing. We have the nhs. You can't get into medical debt, it's not possible.

No one drinks tea with lemon, and definitely not cream. A cream tea is tea with scones. A scone is a hard, flat cake with fruit in that's spread with jam and then clotted cream. The cream is never added to the tea. Milk is added, and sugar depending on the person.

** - Feels like most of this are tips for authors in general, not only fan fiction.

Moreover, I know, and have to agree! Especially if it comes to sex/smut/lemon scenes, it feels uncomfortable reading their names every second descriptive sentence, do you really call out each others names when you are that busy? I certainly do /not/ non-verbal cues are much more telling anyway!

Plus, in the novel / fan fiction, you already know who is together and doing what, I can forgive, dropping their names sometimes, when you have to describe polyamory interaction, or some tantric sex spell/ rite like that from Fate/UBW (good ending)
