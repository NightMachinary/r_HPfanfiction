** Hello! There's this really great (imo) fic of James/OFC on AO3 by ellory called ‚Äúi want no world (for beautiful you are my world)‚Äù.

You need to have an account to read it tho. And she has a bunch other James/not Lily stuff, too. But again, only AO3 members can read it.

Also sorry. I'm new here IDK how to link to stories. üòì

** I vaguely recall one where Voldemort was in charge and James dumped Lily for a pureblood with whom he had a child. But he had Harry with Lily, and Harry had an unpleasant life with a stepmother who detested him. I remember Lily being his tutor (Harry finds out, but I can't remember the rest of the plot).
