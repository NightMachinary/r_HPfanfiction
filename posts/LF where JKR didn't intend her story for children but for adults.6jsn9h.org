It exist, I remember seeing the summary somewhere, be it here or on DLP, for FFN or AO3.


** Wasn't there theory saying that JKR was actually Rita Skeeter and that the whole Series was a MoM disinformation campaign?

Although the end results were the same, the entire War against Tom Riddle played out very differently. In reality, the Trio was far meaner and Voldemort and his gang weren't a bunch monolithically evil cartoon villains.

*** Well I read a fic long ago that had kind of this premise: HP keeps getting harassed for a autobiography, so he writes a series of book, beginning with the first one "JKR and the Philosopher's stone". . But do you have the name of the one you speak about, please?

** I always wanted a story with the whole.

"You think you know the story, but you don't. The real one happened a century ago. The fake one, the one you know was made to sound all soft and sappy just to keep the children happy. But when a young Harry Potter was visited by his Magical Guardian, he was a much different boy. Not starved, but not happy either, neglected to live in a cupboard, unloved by his Aunt, Uncle and Cousin, he took refuge in Magic. And that is where our story starts, in the smallest bedroom of the largest house, on Privet Drive."

** Not exactly what you asked for(not at all, really)...

I've always thought that the never-ending road was rather canonish despite the obvious(fem!harry). I like to think of it as a what-if-Harry-Potter-was-a-girl-in-an-adult-novel kind of story. The interactions between characters are more complex, themes are more dark and there is a lot of swearing. Linkffn(the never-ending road)

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

I would read it if not for the fact that I abhor Snape's pairing. Especially with one of his students.
