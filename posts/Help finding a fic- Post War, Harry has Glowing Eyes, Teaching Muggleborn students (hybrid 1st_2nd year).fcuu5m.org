:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I am looking for a fanfic I read along time ago, but I can't remember the title. It is a Post-War mostly cannon fic where Harry and some other DAs go back to Hogwarts and teach courses for the muggleborn students who couldn't go to school during the second war. I also remember that Harry's eyes had a glow when he was experiencing emotion, and he was an amazing dueler who eventually dueled multiple Professors (and maybe Aurors?) at the same time, and won. Anyone remember this one?
