For example, a different one than your main one when you want to perform legilimency like Snape did in the movies I think. Another wand is for dueling, maybe potion spells, etc.

Or do you think that witches and wizards just have the one wand they get when young if it isn't broken? I like to think there's wands for different purposes as well to make your spellwork more accurate and powerful.


** I don't think so because then we would have heard of Draco having a different wand for each subject. I think some might have a second wand in case they get disarmed or perform illegal curses.

** I personally love the idea of "blank" wands that have a core that kind of fizzles out after one or two spells. It would be excellent for crime! Like a burner cell phone.

** It's just the one.

â€˜The wand chooses the wizard' isn't just a saying. It's hard enough to get one perfectly matched as a child. It makes no sense at all to have one for each subject.

** One ring to rule them all...oh, wrong sub-reddit :D

Well, the sentiment still applies:

We have not heard of specialized wands in canon (but it's not impossible that there once were specialized wands...wands were in development for a long time IMHO)

There is only one special wand known but it probably does everything well, while being especially good at fighting:

That's the Elder Wand of course!

** I think aurors and Death Eaters and other professional fighters might have a second wand in a pocket somewhere in case they get disarmed. Wands are just 7g and a second wand, while not a perfect fit, could certainly be a life saver.

** My headcanon is that wizards only use specialized wands when they dont have a fitting wand or are somehow unable to use it, like for example if Harry had James wand which was good at transfiguration, it would still be worse at transfiguration for Harry than any wand that actually chose him, but if he had it in book 7, it would still have been better than any of the other wands he used that didn't accept him as owner.

So it would only really be relevant for people like that Goblin in fantastic beasts who had three wands, or for wizards who dont want their to leave evidence of criminal use ofspells on their wands.

I could also imagine this to be the case in places outside of Europe, where they dont have a long history of using wands, resulting in wand maker not always being able to give people fitting wands.

** I can't quite remember which fic it was that i read but in it fem!harry gets a whole bunch of different wands and foci. Some were single use only and others were only able to be used for specific things like transfiguration. All of those extra ones she got though were able to be used by squibs. That's kind of my head canon now in regards to if people normally have more than one wand. It just depends on if you're willing to spend the galleons on it.
