It seems like a lot of fics I read treat the avada as a spell that is stupid to use, or the protagonists don't use it out of some moral reason. While there are many ways of blocking it that come to mind, there are still less ways to block it than say a stupefy or disarming charm. I want some fics where it is utilized effectively, maybe because it would be great for getting past protection charms on clothing (canon: Weasley's or like Starfox's patron where the rich have enchanted clothes with protection) or simply because it's an instantly lethal curse that cannot be blocked through shields, only physical means or dodging. I would prefer fics where there are not any side effects (like soul darkening or whatever) because it seems like a cheap way to avoid using it considering it was employed en masse canonically but I would still love to read fics with them.

Thanks for any recommendations. What are your thoughts on the killing curse? It seems like another reason a lot of writers avoid the killing curse is because of power requirements. But a lot of fics also have powerful Harry who casts fiendfyre for some reason or another (often horcrux destruction). The killing curse seems way easier to destroy a horcrux with considering that fiendfyre is considered to be near-sentient and very lethal to the caster as well (not so sure about this in canon but this seems to be in a lot of fics). Thanks again.


** I think AK is similar to Crucio. You need to mean it. You want your target to die without any remorse or second thoughts, that's why it is one of the unforgivable. It was difficult for good guys to cast it.

*** Pretty much this. I dislike it when authors try to make excuses for the unforgivables instead of making them as nasty as possible. The killing curse, in particular, must tear your soul and require hatred to cast. So no one can say they used it in self-defense- you have to want to kill.

"You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation."

It's the act of murder, probably of an innocent, that rips the soul, which can be achieved with a number of spells. And while murder and killing are often one in the same, we are shown that's not always the case. I doubt Harry's soul would take a beating if he hit Bella with one successfully.

Also, where does the hatred thing come from? All Bella says is "you need to mean it" and "righteous anger isn't enough." I would think that means you need to want to cause me pain/want me dead and the latter isn't a bad thing when speaking of Death Eaters.

***** I agree with killing being the thing to rip the soul. It seems with some intent and a hefty power requirement "t/he Killing Curse is a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed"/, it can be casted. It's why I don't understand why it's never utilized. Even in stories where Harry is a burgeoning dark lord does he rarely cast the Killing Curse.

******** That's fair, but do you know of any fics where it used often? And wouldn't an instant death be favorable in combat? Something like getting shot is not always very instant when it comes to threat removal. People have been shot many times and kept on posing a threat to law enforcement. I think it is a very effective spell and I would like to see it used in some fics.

********* I just remembered this one. There was another one that was longer. I remember the killing curse was unblockable. Like really unblockable- Bill and Harry were raiding a house, looking for horcruxes and Bill got killed by a killing curse through a door. Not even doors or walls could stop it. Unfortunately, I don't remember what it was called and can't seem to find it.

**** I always found this whole point of the Killing Curse ridiculous what's the point of mutilating yourself repeatidly, for an Instant and unshieldable move. That seems like an counter balance made to stop an over-use of overpowered spell, It's basically J. K. Rowling calling out the good guys "don't use it or you will as good as the bad guys" meaning becoming monsters. If it was this detrimental, Why dead eathers|KoW and Voldemort didn't use other way to kill their enemies, like for exemple Transfiguring objects into letal (spikes,swords,Daggers) ones and just shooting them at their target during a fight or large scale battle, you didn't need the Killing Curse to destroy your enemies, Bombarda maxima, Incendio, or just a good chunk of consecutive transfiguration spells would do the job, especially again adversary who don't use "Lethal" spells.

Noting (from a dark side point of view) that an instant peacefull death doesn't seems like a way to strike fear into your enemies, when you could do so much more with Magic i.e things like Crucio, Mind attacks, blood magic etc..

***** It's the murder, not the Killing Curse specifically, that splits your soul. Voldemort's first Horcrux was made using the basilisk's kill on Myrtle. The Killing Curse was made to be a lethal dueling spell, because the alternatives you mentioned were too messy and hard to explain to Muggles. The reason it's Unforgivable is because there are nonlethal ways that are just as easy to use if you need to defend yourself, and using the Killing Curse makes it clear that you just aren't bothering to try.

But most importantly, this is a Request post, not a Discussion one.

***** I agree that there are certainly many ways to kill someone with magic. However, I think you are discounting many of the advantages of having the killing curse in your repertoire. It cannot be blocked my magical shields unlike physical objects and many other spells (protego was able to physically separate two people). I also think you are mildly confusing canon and fanfiction as I do not believe blood magic was used offensively in the books (no source so I could be wrong). It does not actually mutilate the caster, and I think it would be an effective spell. Imagine casting an explosive spell to force a magical shield, followed by a killing curse to go through the shield.

***** The good guys don't use them because they are kinda stupid honestly, because using an unforgivable don't actually do anything to you in itself.

And really Crucio is the most OP incapacitating spell and should be usef more often. You Crucio the guy 2 sec, he drop his wand, and tada, you captured him. And it's not worse than actually injuring the guy, it's just pain for a small moment/

****** While I agree that the killing curse should be used more often, especially considering their ability to destroy horcruxes without chasing down basilisk venom, I think the cruciatus requires someone to take pleasure from it (wiki) unliked the killing curse. I agree that it would be an excellent incapacitating spell but it seems like it is channeled (I could be wrong) which would leave you open to retaliation unlike the killing curse which is fire and forget.

** Because there are other ways you can kill someone that are faster or easier in a fight. A-Va-Da Ke-Dav-Ra is six syllables and takes longer to cast than other deadly curses. It's also supposed to be difficult to cast and require a build up of negative emotions making it even more difficult and time consuming. For a powerful dark lord like Voldemort he can cast the curse easily and repeatedly without effort so it is effective for him. Weaker and less experienced death eaters would find other curses easier. Also the fact that the killing curse is instant and the more powerful death eaters are insane like Bellatrix Lestrange and would prefer their victims to die a horrible and painful death.

*** We know that is it entirely possible to use it silently - Bellatrix Lestrange killing a fox/Voldemort in his duel with Dumbledore. The main drawback appears to be concentration and power requirements (evidenced by my quote from fake moody) as Rowle tossed them around in the attack on hogwarts. Interestingly enough though, he was defeated rather quickly by Harry, Hermione, and Ron in the cafe. What other faster ways are there? Fiendfyre which seems to travel more slowly and is hard to control? A lot of diffindos which cut Ron's jeans? Perhaps the sectumsempra which can be healed and takes time to die from? Maybe some explosive spell? But wouldn't those be blockable with magical means unlike the killing curse? And even if it was hard to pull off, surely there are some fics where the killing curse is utilized.

** No reason a killing curse would harm a horcrux.

As for why it's rarely used, you either make everyone terrible at aiming or kill a lot of characters in every fight, and there just aren't that many to begin with.

*** They're actually one of the ways to destroy horcruxes. One of the common misconceptions about horcruxes is that they're inherently indestructible, they're not. Rather creators usually place enchantments to prevent them from most means of destruction. Killing curses disable/destroy horcruxes. And I don't see why not, you /can/ defend against killing curses and I think it removes from the story when characters do not use everything to their advantage.

***** I'm not sure what you are arguing against here. From my arguments on this post, I have emphatically declared they are /excellent/ at killing people and go through magical shields, adding excellent variety to one's arsenal. However, I hardly think they're that strong considering you can prevent the spell from hitting you like you can many spells through methods such as dodging. Basically they're good so they should be used in some stories, but they're not guaranteed kills. After all, Voldemort could not kill Dumbledore with his rapid use of the killing curse.
