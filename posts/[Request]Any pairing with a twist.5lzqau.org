Im looking for any good fanfiction with any pairing from any site but fanfiction.net.


** If it wasn't for the "NO FFN" I would have said Heterochromic linkffn(10938984).

I'm still saying Heterochromic because it is pretty good and has a nice twist.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

**** Well, I read a lot of stuff from Ao3 and also a lot from totally old sites like the hexfiles and even archived stuff. I have it all linked on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks][my bookmark page]] of my Ao3 account and you can sort through it and see if anything stands out to you. I read mostly slash, but if you like het, you can filter by het pairings only using the side bar. Hope you find something you like!

** Not really sure what kind of twist you're looking for, but linkao3(Bound by Duty by SoftObsidian74) is Dramoine with heavy BDSM and kinky love. It eventually shifts into a polyamorous relationship between Draco/Hermione/Harry/Ron--which I think is a pretty big twist when it comes to Dramoine.
