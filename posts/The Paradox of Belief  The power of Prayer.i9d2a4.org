*Plot*:

Mankind exists because the Gods Will it so, but the paradox of this, however, is that the Gods themselves exist because Man believes it so. An Idea can be the most Dangerous & Most Powerful thing in the Universe... So what happens when that belief is applied by the populace to One young wizard? For the first time in Millennia, a GOD is born!

*Rules:* *(Tropes/concepts that we MOST encourage be included in Challenge Responses)*

- It's up to you when the fic begins.
- Harry MUST become a God
- All Affinities Welcome (Though as a God, technically unneeded)
- Godlike Powerful Harry
- Harry Starts as a Mortal and becomes progressively more Godly as belief takes hold.
- Harry must perform Three (3) or more acts and/or feats of Magic that are Perceived as Miracles and attribute to belief in him.
- Harry's Enemy Must be or Serve another God
- Harry establishes a cult of Followers
- Just as Harry has Follower, so to Must he have detractors (People who see him as Dark, Delusional or Power hungry)
- Harry Creates a species of servants (Christ had Angels, Odin Valkyrie etc...)
- Harry MUST MUST MUST achieve Godhood through personal achievement and Belief of The People
- All pairs welcome except forbidden as always

*Guidelines/Optional:* *(As might be implied, these can be included or discarded by the writers Preferences)*

- Harry's Godhood is a Death God (Master of Death)
- Harry has a Spirit Animal/Totem that he can, in turn, Communicate with
- Harry's Totem is the Dragon
- When Harry Channels his Divine power there is a physical display (Like Avatar The Last Airbender)
- Harry Chooses to Join an established Pantheon (Greek, Norse, Celtic etc)
- One of Harry's Miracles is bringing Cedric and/or Sirius back from the dead
- The Resurrected character is Fanatically loyal to Harry
- Voldemort is an acolyte to Harry (Voldemort has always Feared Death if he thinks Harry can stave it off...)
- Harry acquires Muggle Believers
- Harry receives advice from other Gods
- Harry Sires a Demigod
- Harry Paired with another God/Goddess
- Harry Eventually Makes his Mortal Lover a God
- Harems
- Slash
- M/F/F pair
- M/M/F Pair
- Crossover.

*Suggested Pairs: (Optional, Not required!!)*

*Female Suggestions:*

- Harry/Ginny (Not a fan, but can see it here)
- Harry/Luna
- Harry/Tonks
- Harry/Tracy Davis
- Harry/Aphrodite
- Harry/The Morrigan
- Harry/Discord

*Male Suggestions:*

- Harry/Cedric
- Harry/Neville

- Harry/Jason Grace
- Harry/Luke Castellan
- Harry/Percy Jackson

*Forbidden:* *(I can't Stop you including these Tropes, but if you do I may not read)*

- Weak and/or Passive Harry
- Hermione Following Harry (Not out of a desire to Bash, but She strikes me as more Atheistic)
- Harry/Hermione
- Harry Rejecting or Surrendering his Godhood
- Harry Beginning the Fic as a Fully realized God
- Another God making Harry a God


** I want to read something like this, but very much doubt many people will have made it to the end in order to write it.

***** Plus remember that many of them are just Suggested plot points, so you dont have to include Every one in the story.

And Thanks :)

** Percy Jackson and the Game has some elements of this prompt. Still the best fanfic I've ever read.

*** Its not a fanfic itself, its a prompt to write one. And it *can* have Percy Jackson in it. I figure if you're gonna write a fic about Harry becoming a God... But it doesn't have to. Those are only *suggested as possible pairs*

** Tbh this post reads more like a commission than a prompt. If you really want something this specific you'll probably have to write it yourself or pay someone to.
