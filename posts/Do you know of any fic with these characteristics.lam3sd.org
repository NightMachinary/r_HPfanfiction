I'm searching for fics where Harry was kidnapped by the light as a baby and is Voldemort's, the Malfoy's or Snape's real son (any of these cases). I love to see them acting like concerned, kind and good parents.

I would prefer if they have Light Bashing, Dumbledore, Weasley and the Order of the Fried Chicken (ü§≠) bashing, etc. And if the good side is really the Dark one.

If at least the story includes any of the cases I mentioned at the beginning, I would be grateful.

Beforehand, thank you üíú


** This honestly isn't even specific. I read numerous fics that met all these requirements in my bashing phase a few years ago. I just don't remember them.

Edit: I hunted one down for you.

*** Now that I think about it, I'm actually in my bashing phase right now üòÇ, so if you manage to remember the names of the fics, can you tell me how they're called?

  Harry is sick and tired of the way everyone is treating him. Realising that drastic measures are needed, Harry stages a Potions accident. How was he to know that his actions would unravel secrets long hidden? And just whose son is he? AU year 5 HP/SS

  Harry has learned that speaking in Parseltongue makes some people hate him and others fear him. He had not learned that it would make Draco go straight to his parents and tell them that he has reason to suspect ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù is actually his missing twin brother. As far as Harry is concerned, life would be a lot better if he was the Heir of Slytherin.

** Don't wanna kink-shame or anything, but um

I really need to say it okay?

The "order of the fried chicken" joke? It's cringey, edgy, and overdone to death. Please never use it again.

**** I mean, even in my "hey, what if the bad guys were not bad guys" phase, I felt the "Order of KFC" and other names was already bad, sooo...

I mean, at least "the morons of the phoenix" doesn't just insult a beautiful healing flame bird for no other reasons than "lmao look I'm cool and shit"

** I think there's one where he's actually Bellatrix and Rudolphus's son who was kidnapped by James and secretly adopted by him and Lily. That's the only detail I remember about it though.
