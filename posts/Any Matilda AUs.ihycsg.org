  Everyone knew Matilda was a rather extraordinary child, but even she didn't know she was a witch. Matilda Honey receives her Hogwarts letter in the year of the Triwizard Tournament, and soon, she will leave her unique mark on the magical world.

** Little off topic, I know...

The Wormwoods were terrible people, but I can't help but think that their abuse of Matilda was rather mild, relative to the abuse Harry got subjected to.

Near as I can tell, a lot of what Matilda went through with her family was mostly down to her and them not really connecting, as opposed to the deliberate ostracism Harry suffered. It always seemed to me that the Dursleys wanted Harry miserable and downtrodden, but with Matilda, the Wormwoods just didn't understand why she wasn't happy(not that they tried very hard to understand).

*** you bring up interesting points, thought the similarities i saw were not so in depth- i just thought that the overweight, angry crook father/uncle, and the status obssesed mother/aunt and the overweight and callous brother/cousin shared a similar dynamic.
