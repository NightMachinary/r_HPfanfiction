I found a fanfiction on fanfiction.net it involved a harry and friends singing Def Leppard's rock of ages in the great Hall. Unfortunately that's all I can remember. I was an idiot and forgot to favorite it. If you can help me find it that would be awesome.


** linkffn(8775791) this one maybe? I just googled it, i didn't read it. The scene you mention it looks like is in chapter 21.
