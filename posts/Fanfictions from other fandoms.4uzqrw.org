I mostly read HP fanfics but I occasionally enjoy reading from other fandoms, mostly bleach, Naruto and pokemon. It would be great if people would recommend some other fanfictions or at least another similar subreddit for other fandoms.

For a recommendation: linkffn(9702026) is one of the very few good League of Legends fanfictions.

** [[/r/fanfiction]] recently started doing fic rec posts every Friday and self-promotion posts every Wednesday. They're both great places to pick up recs for other fandoms, and there are some people who read/write bleach, Naruto, and pokemon there.

If you like Marvel or Supernatural, [[/r/marvelfans]] and [[/r/fandomnatural]] also do weekly fic rec posts, though they're both a bit more slash heavy than here.

** My first Pokemon fic that I just finished reading. I was blown away... by both the fact it's only really on it's second arc and that it's at 930k words and it doesn't feel extraneous. If you are a 90's kid and grew up with Pokemon like me, read it.

linkffn(8466693)

This is a Harry Potter fic, but it crosses over with ASOIAF in a manner that is fascinating and well worth the read.

linkffn(11132113)

This is a Silmarillion fic that is written by a good friend of mine. Extremely well written and worth the look for any fan of Tolkien's mythos.

linkffn(9811563)

Last and by no means least is a Redwall fic that I wrote. Warning though, those expecting a bright and colorful Redwall fic may be put off by this, as it's violent, grim, and somewhat depressing. Feel free to leave me feedback.

Quite a niche fandom though - I'm pretty sure that most of this subreddit's readers would have never even heard of that story. (Worm, by Wildbow, in case you wonder.)

** Honestly you should check out some [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Familiar-of-Zero-Crossovers/2762/0/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][Familiar of Zero crossovers]]. It has literally more crossovers that actual fanfiction. This is because the anime series premise is really good, with a colourful supporting cast and epic quests. The only negative is the main character, who due to the plots introduction of him, is easily replaced by anyone/thing. You don't even have to know the series before you can hop into any one fanfic.

These two are my favourite: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359442/1/The-Familiars-of-Zero][This one]] is a high quality compilation of one-shot of all sorts of new main characters. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero][this is one]] where Napoleon Bonaparte is the new main character. And he decide to conquer this world.
