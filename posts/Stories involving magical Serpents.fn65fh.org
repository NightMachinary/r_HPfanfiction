I always thought it a little strange for Rowling to introduce the ability to speak with Serpents and to give Harry this power, only to pretty much forget about it after the end of the Second book (Aside from one or two moments in the fifth book but that was a dream so it might've just been Voldemort bleeding over into him). I like the idea of that ability and considering the sheer amount of mythological serpents there are around the world love to read fanfics involving them. Do you guys know any where Harry is either accompanied by- or regularly speaking with a magical Serpent?

  AU of PoA. Harry wakes in the night to a voice calling him from somewhere in the castle---and when he follows it, everything changes. Updated every Friday.

  Harry is still angry but this year he has a person to blame. A secret trunk, a kitten with a secret and an secret potion. I've been told this isn't complete. It is a complete year at Hogwarts as are the books so I considered it Complete.

** On top of my head I can think of:

- A Very Slytherin Harry series by geoffaree on ao3 , at age 8 Harry finds a magical snake in the garden of the Dursleys and this changes things

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

- the combined works of Angie Astravic, which form a series similar to the works of Northumbrian. Harry gets transfigured into a magical snake and it has lots of repercussions. Written before OOTP came out.

** Linkffn(If looks could kill)

If your enemy has a Basilisk, why should you not have two dozen? It's not like chicken eggs or toads are particularly difficult to get, as long as you have Parseltongue to control them it's easy.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.
