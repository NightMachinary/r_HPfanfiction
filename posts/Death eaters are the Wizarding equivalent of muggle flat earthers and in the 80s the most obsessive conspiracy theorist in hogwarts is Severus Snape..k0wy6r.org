** Conspiracy theorist is a [now often derogatory] term popularized by the CIA & the FBI COINTELPRO to dissuade investigation into the JFK assassination.

*** Is there a better term?

I mean his conspiracies would be things supportive of death eater beliefs so like theories supporting blood purity and anti magical creatures. So they wouldn't be like true in any way. Which i guess makes derogatory insinuation work. But like I can use a diff word not sure what else to use.

**** Conspiracy theorist as a term is used as an insult despite many provable conspiracies taking place in the last century alone, never mind older historical ones, such as, you know, the invasion into Iraq for "WMD's" & "mobile anthrax labs" that didn't exist.

If he's peddling information known to be false or misleading with a motive to deceive, just call it what it is --- disinformation.

Misinformation is false or misleading information released with no motive to deceive in mind.
