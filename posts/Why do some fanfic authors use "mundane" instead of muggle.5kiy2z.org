If anything mundane is more insulting. Muggles don't know if there is any ill will behind the word muggle but mundane implies they're boring and ordinary.


** I think it's silly to change the word (the meaning remains the same, you ain't got magic, babe) I could see a muggle getting offended by the term if the wizard or witch said it with a particularly patronizing tone, which is likely. But honestly, any other word used would have the same impact.

Real world example: The word "Thug" has pretty much become a more acceptable replacement for another racial slur that's fallen out of favor.

** The word "muggle" is seen by some amongst the fandom as childish and unsophisticated and thus in turn as insulting towards non-magicals. So they turn to using a "generic" muggle term they are familiar with from science fiction and fantasy fandom and that to them sounds more mature.

Of course they mostly have no clue that 'mundane' derives off 'mundus', a Latin word for 'world'. In ecclestical Latin it describes the worldly world of sin and death opposed to the spiritual realm of the Church and Christ's kingdom and has been adopted by the science fiction fandom to refer to non-fans from where it spread.

** Reading a fic now that uses "first-gen" to describe muggleborn wizards in America because they feel that Muggle is rather demeaning. This comes after the revelation of "No-Maj" in America, which feels more descriptive rather than insulting.

** I find the use of 'mundane' over 'muggle' to be especially weird since not only do muggleborns use the word to describe their own family, but even the Death Eaters don't have a special word to replace muggle like they do with using mudblood instead of muggleborn. I think its telling that the pure-blood supremacists don't use the word mundane but simply use the word muggle.

I think that the word muggle isn't offensive at all. However, its easy to make ANYTHING sound darker or more offensive than it actually is based on who the speaker is. It is the same reason that McGonagall referring to the Dursleys as "the worst sort of muggles" in PS is treated differently to Snape saying that Petunia "is just a muggle" in DH. While Voldemort does use the word 'muggle' by itself to describe others like McGonagall and Snape did in the above examples, its usually in a matter-of-fact way like with Frank Bryce where Voldemort basically called a spade a spade. Its not offensive for Voldemort to explain to Frank Bryce what muggle means since its not said as an insult but as a statement of truth in response to a question. The actual emphasis is on the rest of Voldemort's words, so Voldemort talking about his "filthy muggle father" in CoS places the emphasis on the word filthy. If Voldemort had just said "my muggle father", it wouldn't sound as offensive in that instance. By contrast, Voldemort calling someone (i.e. Lily) a mudblood would be offensive regardless of whether he called her a "filthy mudblood" or just a mudblood itself.

The usage of muggle is almost like the difference between Jewish and Jew, except with the word muggle, its less explicit on the meaning. Perhaps the analogy isn't quite the same, since there isn't an alternative to muggle whereas there is for Jew. The sentence "my parents are muggles" wouldn't sound bad, whereas "she's just a muggle" sounds a bit more antagonistic, albeit the "just a" part certainly made it sound more patronising than "she's a muggle" would. Likewise, there is a difference between the word Jewish (e.g. "he is a Jewish person" versus the word Jew, which can come off antisemitic if used a certain way (e.g. "to jew someone", or how to use the word like the Nazis would in a dehumanising manner). In both the case of muggle and Jew, there is nothing offensive about either of the words but its easy for them to become offensive when said a certain way.

Though either way, I think its still silly to use mundane instead of muggle since mundane is probably more offensive than the word muggle, especially since I think mundane is a word used to describe objects rather than people. Calling muggles mundane instead of muggles would be like the difference between the words "disabled" and "cripple" in regards to someone with a condition. Regardless of which word (disabled or cripple) is used, the meaning behind the word is ultimately the same (that the subject being addressed is limited physically and/or intellectually). Using a different term doesn't take away the meaning/implication since both words would be used to describe the same group. Though perhaps comparing those words isn't a good analogy either.

*** Good post, but I think you're missing something. You only address the case of what the speaker intends to be offensive. While most magicals may use the word muggle in an entirely inoffensive manner, what really matters is whether or not those on the receiving end are offended by it. I'll point you to the evolution of the use of certain racial epithets such as 'negro,' which back in the day was considered to be the inoffensive, politically correct term to use but these days is considered a racial slur. The only true determinant of whether term term 'muggle' is offensive is whether those subjected to it believe it to be.

Personally, I think the word muggle sounds demeaning and would be offended by it as it appears to be derived from the term 'mug' (whether it is or isn't does not matter, only my perception does in this case) and the sound of the word itself harkens to baby-talk as if the speaker were talking about something cute or childish in a dismissive sort of way. Mundane is slightly better but still has connotations of the subject being boring, not unique, and uninteresting. 'Non-magical' is probably the most matter-of-fact, inoffensive, term available and should be considered politically correct.

***** I may not have been clear. I didn't mean to imply that the intent of the speaker doesn't matter. It most certainly does. The intent and phrasing can change the meaning of an inoffensive word into an insult and vice versa. I merely wanted to add that that isn't all there is to it. Insults, like all communication are a two-way affair. Even if someone says something that they don't intend to be insulting, the listener may still be offended because they hold a different understanding of the words used. Essentially, 'to insult' is an act of the speaker while 'being offended' is an act of the listener. Something can be an insult but not taken as offensive just as something can be non-insulting but can still be received as offensive. Such situations are particularly prominent when dealing with people from different cultures that have different ideas of what is considered offensive; the muggle-magical interaction would be one such case.

I think your own post proves this point. You came to a conclusion based on what I said that was not what I meant to communicate because you saw a different meaning in my words than what I intended. Miscommunications happen. Sometimes they lead to continued polite discourse such as this conversation, but other times the consequences can be much less benign.

******* I wasn't advocating that at all. I was just explaining that people /can/ be offended without intent to insult and how the word 'muggle' could be construed as offensive and what a couple alternatives could be. I wasn't making any claims about what should be done in response to that, which is a whole other kettle of fish (no offense to merfolk intended) with no simple solution.

  Another example is "Him" and "Her" which are apparently offensive to people who think that there are more than two genders, and want to replace those words with a "gender-neutral" word like "Hen".

I find that rather amusing seeing as 'Hen' specifically refers to a /female/ chicken, lol.

I always thought it sounded slightly insulting. Like calling a handicapped person "cripple". A non-PC word for a condition we usually feel sorry for. We just see the wheelchair, and don't realize how much it takes to function well /despite/ the handicap.

Well, they are. They're boring because they're unable to impress a magical world, and the wizarding world seems to be ignorant of modern technological advances. They're ordinary because there's nothing special about them, like magic. Wizards are obsessed with magic, they use it for absolutely everything. Is there anything that they consistently don't use magic for?

**** While I do think magic could stop a nuclear weapon (we've seen magic do far more impressive things from a physics perspective, such as the creation of large amounts of matter) I think asking the question in the first place takes a discussion in the wrong direction. In the unlikely event that someone started nuking cities, wizards don't even really need to stop the entire bomb to survive. They just have to create a small zone of safety.

All the other magical communities have all the important parts of the muggle/mundane gov't mind controlled or subverted to prevent any foolishness from spilling over into their communities. It'd pretty easy to kidnap, interrogate, and mind-wipe someone and then rinse/repeat until you have all the movers and shakers under control.

** Well I dunno about others, but the reason I use Mundane in my fic instead of Muggle was because I figured Muggle is a British Slang term and Americans would have there own term. (My fic came out before Fantastic beasts.)

As for Mundane: (Bland/Normal) "Mundanes" is a term I've heard used in several different american book series describing normal humans. Its a obvious fall back for me.

As for being offensive its no more offensive then Muggle. "Mug" is a slang term which means a stupid person, where I'm from. So between stupid or boring I'd think boring is the less offensive.

As for people using it instead of Muggle for IN BRITAN fics I'm not sure. The books always said Muggle, (and I'm not sure about the movies) but the video games never used the term till late in the series, they always just said nonmagical people so as not to confuse people. The term is really well known by now though so why some authors are now making brits say Mundane instead of Muggle is an unknown to me.
