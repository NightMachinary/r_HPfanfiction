Are there any non-crossover fics involving aliens, tech, and superpowers?


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has tech and superpowers, but no magic and aliens. Hogwarts is a spy school with many very dangerous kids.

  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet? Especially one where the natives think nuclear energy is high science. And let's not forget the 42,000 lightyear commute.

  It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.
