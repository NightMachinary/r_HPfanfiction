I'm interested in the alternate history of what would the world be like if the Wizarding World never separated from the Muggle World.


** They would still have been prosecuted and executed for devil-worship, murder, blighting cattle and sinking ships, to name some common accusations in witch-trials. All of those things were illegal if done with no magic involved, and all carried the death penalty. The witch-hunts would have looked very similar to the historical ones, with perhaps a greater focus on evidence of poisoning than on evidence of devil-worship.

*** I don't know. There would still have been /cause/ to prosecute if you looked, certainly, but did the catch-all term of "witch" to bandy about not help rally the 'torch-and-pitchfork mob' mood better than if all those people had instead been accused of various independent crimes?

Besides which, do not forget this is a /HP/ sub, and the question was probably meant to be about the /Harry Potter/ universe. Whether the Muggles hanged a bunch of suspected wreckers, poisoners and murderers for being those things, or for being suspected wizards, would make a world of difference from the Wizarding World's point of view: would Grindelwald and Voldemort have been able to rally the support they did if they didn't have the "the Muggles would hang or burn us all if they only could! Just look at the witch trials!" excuse?

**** I think a big piece of why this is a discussion at all is that JKR's grasp of history is nearly as bad as her grasp of numbers: during the period of the witch trials - less so toward the end but massively so at the beginning - magic was a part of everyone's daily life. Every locality had its cunning-men and wise-women, people who mixed herbal medicines and performed various magical services. Witch trials happened when practitioners stepped over the socially- and legally-accepted line, whatever it was in their place and time (and it could and did move with religious, political and social tensions, and moved /very/ quickly with the outbreak of war).

The Doylist explanation is that JKR sucks at history, and 'printed the legend' from the likes of Murray's /God Of The Witches/, which remains remarkably influential in popular culture despite the fact that it's sixty years discredited as academic work.

The Watsonian explanation is that the likes of Grindelwald and Voldemort's propaganda about the witch-hunts is of the same character as any other blood libel: politically-useful lies. "They hanged us when we murdered them and destroyed their livelihoods" isn't much of a rallying cry when you're trying to convince people to commit acts of terrorism, now, is it?

***** I think a fact the /HP/ fanfiction community is inordinately wary of (because it admittedly makes one's brain hurts) is how suspicious any pre-Statute of Secrecy history as we know it should be. I am of the opinion that the rewriting of Muggle History to erase magical influence was a /massive/ undertaking, and Ancient and Medieval History were in truth not at all very much like what we Muggles learn about in school nowadays. Too little is made of the fact that we know for a fact that King Arthur and Merlin were real, and lived /in the days of Chretien de Troyes/, not int he VIth century.

This handily fixes any such problems of Rowling getting her history wrong: /we'/re wrong because we've been Obliviated, what we learn about in canon is the true part. Hence, for example, any "rational explanation" at all that we can find for witch trials, at any point in history, is most likely nothing more than a fabrication to disguise whatever imbroglio involving real magic /actually/ happened.

Which, frankly, is an even more absurd notion than King Arthur being an eternally-youthful blonde girl who had Merlin give her a magic dick to consummate her marriage.

There just comes a point where you have to shrug and just not sweat the details, because the details have become a nigh-insurmountable obstacle.

Why? Once you accept that Muggle history before the Statute has probably got about the same fiction/truth ratio as folklore does, one /should absolutely/ weigh the apparent chronological contradictions with the fact that most fictional depictions of Arthur & Merlin in popular Muggle culture look much more like the 11th century than they do like the Dark Ages.

******** It wasn't all that uncommon for historical and mythological depictions to include elements from the period they were created in, not the period they were set in. Christian art, for instance, sometimes depicted Roman soldiers wearing gambesons and mail coifs, because that's what was recognizable to people at the time.

********* That's true, of course. But I still think it makes the idea of an 11th century Arthurian cycle significantly less far-fetched than it's often made to sound when people criticize it.

** Well, not much, I'd assume, because there's no line in the Bible that says "Thou shalt not sugger a witch to live."

Being serious, the reason that it was translated that way in the first place was because of the biases at the time and the tensions that existed. For one, even the [[https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-18.htm][/literal/ translation of the phrase]] includes the word "witch" - it was specifically referring to an unmarried woman who practiced magic. But even if we disregard that, there was definitely a tension between the people at the time and displays of the supernatural, obvious or subtle. After all, the witch hunts happened in /our/ reality, and we don't even have witches! (so far as we know)

A more interesting question would be if there was any other way for witches and wizards to hide themselves aside from seclusion. I would say that, had they accepted subordination to the church (or more likely, used magic to take it over from the inside) and claimed to be a race of people blessed by God with the power to create miracles, the kind of integration between muggles and wizards you seem to be asking for could take place. Of course, a premise like that is almost /too/ interesting for fan-fiction.

I instantly regret thinking this, but: could fanon's beloved "marriage laws" have gotten started as a way to loophole one's way out of the Witch Hunts? Molly Weasley: "oh, yes, I'm a witch, but I think you'll find Arthur dearest places me above suspicion".

**** That could actually be a great twist on a tired cliche. But the trope is not necessarily the problem - it's the type of author that's most attracted to the trope. It's not as if the /justification/ is the root problem of most marriage law stories, it's other issues endemic in the author, like fairy-tail romances, dangling plot threads, or stereotypical gender roles. The same could be said for self-insert stories or OC-focused stories.

** Then while people would probably have Christianity as less of a bogey man, there would still be just as much tension between muggles and wizards. Some muggles would have been suspicous and jealous of the wizards power. Some wizards would have been exploitative and manipulative and tried to rule over and dominate muggles. Either way, they would not have easily gotten along.
