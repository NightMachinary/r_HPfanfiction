** Infinite. I wait until I forget the little details then read something again. If I can remember tiny details from a story then it is simply too soon for a re-read for me.

** I can usually re-read something a few times before losing interest, step away for a few months, and then re-read it again.

** I can reread anything that doesn't have fanfiction, funnily enough. Probably /because/ it doesn't have fanfiction. With fanfiction it's like canon just becomes stale for me, and I really have to force myself to reread the canon material. Anything else I'll have no problem though.

** My favorites I can reread many, many times so long as I wait long enough in between.

** Depends on the genre. I haven't reread any of the really popular wish fulfilment stories do-overs from when I first started reading fanfiction, but I've probably read Harry the Hufflepuff (and a few other humour fics) three to four times.

** I've probably read the Harry Potter series around 10 times now. I can read it twice in a row, but I'm on a sort of extended hiatus right now :3

** I used to re-read every hp book before a new one in the series came out, and re-read the book before the subsequent movie came out. I have yet to grow tired of them.

** I used to re-read the HP series dozens of times as a kid. These days I'm a little tired of it and haven't actually read the books other than re-reading a chapter for some detail when writing HP fanfiction. I think because I read HP fanfiction I'm a little exhausted of the canon material itself. Those plot points are discussed and re-done so much in fanfiction. I'll re-read books / fanfiction sometimes. I don't think I've ever re-read it more than 2-3 times, and usually it's been a few years so I've forgotten some of it and it's fun re-remembering some of the stuff like "oh yeah! that happened!"

** Considering I re-read "the 13.5 lives of captain bluebear" about seven times without ever growing even the least bit tired of it, I must say, I do not know.
