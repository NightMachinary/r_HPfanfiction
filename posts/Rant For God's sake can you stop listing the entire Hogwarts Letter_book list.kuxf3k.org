Seriously, you're just padding your word count.

I'm so sick of authors who just copy all 228 words, not counting the address (I didn't count them; I just copy-pasted to get a word count). You'd think they'd write around it just to avoid typing that much non-story material.


** It was actually noticing this exact thing that led to one of my favorite prompts.

Orphan muggleborn kid gets his hogwarts letter, but it's missing the second page, with the book list. He's pretty self-reliant and a bit of a miser, so when he's doing his school shopping, he goes to a dingy secondhand bookstore instead of F&B. He asks the guy behind the counter what he'll need for Hogwarts, and the guy just lists off a /mountain/ of books. A dozen texts for each subject. The kid is shocked, but picks up second or thirdhand copies of every book on the list. With all of the fantastical, impossible things he seen today, it doesn't occur to him that the guy just sold him the entire seven-year syllabus.

With a single summer before school starts, he figures that this has to be some sort of aptitude test or at least a trick. There's literal years of reading to do to be prepared for first year. He can't use his wand for anything as it's against the rules, but he figures there must be some type of magic he's meant to use to not fall woefully behind before classes even start. After the first few days of combing through textbooks, he finds a mention of something he thinks could be useful.

In short, the kid receives a poorly copy-pasted Hogwarts letter, mistakenly believes Hogwarts students are supposed to use magic to supplement their learning ability and spend their whole lives combing through arcane texts like something out of Arthurian legend, finds a way to actually pull it off (what exactly that is could be anything. I was visualizing something like Doctor Strange's astral projection, where you can have copies of yourself doing mundane tasks like reading at all hours), and is a walking encyclopedia of the arcane by the time he arrives at school. He still has absolutely no knowledge of wizarding society, on top of a bunch of erroneous preconceived notions about every wizard looking like something out of an AD&D source book and spending their whole lives chasing the mysteries of the arcane in order to keep up with the workload. As a result, he's basically LARPing a wizard, while all of the other normal students are simultaneously weirded out by how this kid seems like a muggle caricature of a wizard, and super annoyed that he seems to know everything in class but looks at you like /you're/ the weird one if you ask him about something normal, like your favorite quidditch team.

**** Honestly, interactions with Hermione were the most entertaining part of this prompt for me. She would be annoyed beyond reason at someone outperforming her, but would be simultaneously reassured by someone who seems to be totally comfortable in the muggle world, and also excited to meet someone who represented the high-fantasy image of wizards that she's had for the last few months.

I imagine that this MC would be the most frustrating person she'd ever meet.

***** I'm assuming you mean to 'Stranger in a Strange Land'? If so, it's actually a novel by Robert A. Heinlein, describing the experiences of a Martian-raised Human on Earth, knowing incredible things about science and skill-based things, but having absolutely no idea about most of the basics of Human culture. Incredible book, I absolutely recommend it, but it's not a fic or even remotely related to Harry Potter (since it was published in 1961).

****** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger%20in%20a%20Strange%20Land][Stranger in a Strange Land]]*

Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture. The title "Stranger in a Strange Land" is a direct quotation from the King James Bible (taken from Exodus 2:22).

"The Internationale" (French: "L'Internationale") is a left-wing anthem. It has been a standard of the socialist movement since the late nineteenth century, when the Second International adopted it as its official anthem. The title arises from the "First International", an alliance of workers which held a congress in 1864. The author of the anthem's lyrics, Eugène Pottier, an anarchist, attended this congress.The original French refrain of the song is C'est la lutte finale / Groupons-nous et demain / L'Internationale / Sera le genre humain.

**** You can't blindly apply any rule (well, beyond spelling and grammar) and expect to get out a good result.

"Show, don't tell" IS a good advice, but it's important to understand the context in which it's used - if you want something relevant to happen, show it in detail instead of having a line or two about it.

However, adding the fact that this is fanfic, you can get away (and actually should use it) with telling - if nothing of difference occurs, all of halloween troll incident can be summed up in a throwaway line on the beginning of a scene. However treating a scene like that in such way in original work would be a horrible approach.

Or even better, don't bother either telling or showing something that's roughly the same as in canon, and/or barely relevant to the overall plot.

***** I agree. However, the problem comes in when some people think that any form of telling is bad, which goes back to what you said about blindly following a rule.

"Show, don't tell" gets drilled in so many writing workshops (or even since school) that it's common to have writers think that they absolutely /must/ show whenever possible. This often leads to overly descriptive, 'wordy' sections of writing that tends to bog down the narrative more often than not. It's the "don't" in the rule that tends to cause the misconception.

Those excessive instances of showing are very much responsible for some of the clichéd descriptions we tend to see in writing.

I know original fiction is much different from the pre-existing world of fanfiction, but even in the former it's important to understand when to show and when to tell.

***** Exactly.

THe other problem however, is that many writers forget that when they change stuff, they have to actually show it as if it was an original. And simple having a flashback scene later isn't good enough for fanfiction, unlike original.

The problem is that in fanfics the character already has an established background/character/etc. If you don't immediately show a change, then the readers will automatically assume that there is no change and that it's all just like cannon.

**** Honestly, "show, don't tell" is just advice for beginner (often young, school-age) writers who excessively "tell" stories, but aren't quite ready for the nuance that comes with a more balanced approach. It's like when your teachers forced you to write without any adverbs or whatever other rules meant to break you out of a bad habit.

Some writers on the other end get so wrapped in flowery metaphors for every little thing that you have to read it 3 times over just to figure out what a character even /did/. It's a good exercise to practice being more descriptive if that's a weak point of yours, but from there on, you'll want to read professionally published works to find a style you enjoy and want to push your writing towards.

In general, if it's something important to the main character, I think it's better to show it. (Example: If you want to make your MC smart then show it by their deeds, don't just tell "Oh I'm super smart" and have them do completely dumb things)

On the other hand, if something happens that's outside the reach of the MC, it's better to tell. (Example: A battle that happened somewhere and the MC or the sub-protagonists weren't there).

** This honestly varies for me.

Simply rehashing exactly what certain things are in a /straight/ Harry Potter (or anything else) fanfic is most often a waste of time, both the reader's and the author's unless it's something where a scene is going through something similar or splitting from a canon scene or canon events take place.

Just if you're doing that, try not to block quote entire scenes.

Using parts of a canon scene and breaking off from it because that portion is pretty much canon can make sense, for example the Goblet of Fire champion choosing or the sorting if you're saying it's canon to a point you can probably start with a bit of quote from the books or if it's running as canon from someone else's view it can use bits as long as they're worked in and not called attention to by using odd formating (bold/italics/markers).

Likewise running someone else's view on an event can be viable for some quotes, presuming you're actually breaking things up and trying to rejig them should you need a PoV change, for example someone else's view on the usual Worm locker scene, the 'dueling club' for HP or Umbridge's raid on the DA when it's say Chang's or Finch-Fletchley's view for example.

In crossovers, it's somewhat more flexible with the explanation side due to possibly catching the eye of someone that doesn't know one particular canon but having been interested in the summary. (I've bounced into various anime/manga fandoms off a crossover from something I've read so don't necessarily know the anime/manga's canon).

Another point with crossovers is that you might have a character that's not conversant with what's going on. You mentioned quoting the Hogwarts' booklist, having someone involved say from Elder Scrolls they might read part of it, stop then go back and reread while thinking, which could be a possible reason to include some or all of something, if it's written right.

There's also the 'edge case' that involves the 'character(s) reading the books' style fic. Most if not all of those tend towards block quoting the books or transcripts from movies/cartoons, which can work, though they tend to be better off when you're doing a 'minimal quotations' variant with more focus on the people reading and their responses/reactions, especially when a lot of that type tend to also have sections of just 'quote line, character comment, quote line, comment, response, line... etc' that gets old in a hurry.

** If you mention the list or the song you have to change both and make them either funny or outrageous. In a WIP that I have not posted I just replaced the Sorting hat's songs with random songs by the American grunge band HOLE 1) because it's hilariously innapropriate and 2) Dumbledore headbanging. Perhaps Dumbledore should not have been listening to muggle music where the sorting hat could hear.

** I think it really depends on the word count. My own personal book I have the list and the sorting song but my word count so far is 42,418 and I am only in the first class of DADA (second day of school) in book one and I'm doing MOST of the books. My 400ish word "buff" wont matter in the end. If the majority of the chapter is the list (or is only the list) then ya you can just skip it and not write it but if your chapters have 1000+ it's fine.

*** I'd say if you're at 42k in a long slow story you should be cutting the extra stuff. Otherwise it feels dragged out and boring so I stop reading.

I'll happily read 600k word stories but not if nothing (or only repetition) is going on.

**** I began reading a story once, and after a few chapters, I felt there wasn't much going on, so I broke one of my rules, and skipped ahead to the latest chapter posted, and I gave it up.

It was a fourth year fic, and 430.000!!! words in, the author wasn't even past the first task. Seriously. That thing would have ended up being 3 million words long, if they meant to finish year four. I can't remember the name of it, so I can't link it.

***** I love Fremione. The premier fic for it is called Snipe, a 200k+ fic. I was ultra excited to it... then forced to give up.

First 13 chapters are a rewrite of book 1 with many word for word exerpts with only the mildest additions of Fred and George appearing in ways that didn't impact the story at all. If you're going to keep it all the same... I know what happens. Just skip it.

****** Sounds like The Arithmancer. Man, is that story SLOW. I love the idea of it, but I just couldn't read it because it seemed that the author used 10 words where 2 would do EVERY TIME. It's so fitting that it's a story about Hermione.

******* I had a second read through of that one. At least SOME of the stuff was new like mapping the castle or meeting with Vector.

This one's hust... the exact same story with background Fred, George, Neville, Lee.

******* Erm... show the story but what would happened if she was friends with the twins? I'm sure it splits at some point just not soon enough for me. Like she still did the wizards duel, troll, fluffy, Hagrid scenes.
