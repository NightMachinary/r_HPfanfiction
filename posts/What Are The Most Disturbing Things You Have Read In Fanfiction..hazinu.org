I recently read a story in wich Voldemort possesed by a Sith Lord, turns kidnapped squib children into dementors by using sith alchemy. That was not the disturbing part however, it was Narcissa watching her son commit the act with glee and realise how evil he is.

That got me thinking, whatare the most disturbing things you have read in fanfiction?


** Probably Hermione who is in a secret relationship with Lucius and gets pregnant. She than had a daughter and moved to Lucius, who is hiding from the order of phoenix in France. There she marries him. Narcissa is just fine with it. Than Hermione becomes a death eater and it turns out Remus us one as well and together with the dark lord, who seems to be very pleased with Hermione, they destroy the order and take over the whole magical world. Hermione than has three other kids, one with Voldemort himself, one with Lucius and one with Draco. Don't ask me why, I don't get it either.

This story was just super strange to read😂

It is basically the "I drove drunk and I turned out fine".

In addition to my intuition against spanking, there have been actual studies, and the average IQ as an adult, (and other metrics) was worst for kids that were spanked.

Frequently, the descriptions of spanking are way outside of British law at the time. These days, Scotland and Wales have total bans and England say you can't leave a mark but are dragging their feet over banning.

**** On one hand, I can understand this, because at one point we genuinely believed that spanking did not lead to any trauma (and several places in the world still believe this!), and there's canon implications that the Weasleys were spanked. On the other hand, just because it's kind of realistic doesn't mean it's right. I'd much rather read a fic without it.

I just mean that in a lot of places in the world, spanking is still seen as normal, so saying that the Wizarding World probably doesn't view spanking badly wouldn't be out of the norm. But just because technically it's probably realistic canon-wise, doesn't mean it would be good to have in a fic.

** Don't remember the name, but it was some story where Harry carved magic runes on his skin that gave him supernatural libido that basically made women super horny for him.

He precedes to mentally coerce a bunch of women to start his own harem of magically brainwashed witches.

The worst one was when he somehow makes Narcissa his legal slave and forcefully magically brainwashes her to love and obey him unconditionally.

Harry makes it so Narcissa doesn't love Draco anymore and isn't bothered when he dies. Very creepy and uncomfortable.

At the end of the story, Harry ends up nuking the entire planet to destroy Muslims and feminism which is also pretty terrible.

There was also one where FemHarry was forced into sexual slavery by the Goblins for the break-in. It also did not end in brutal retribution but in Stockholm syndrome. I was sufficiently annoyed to outline a "resistance against a victorious Goblin rebellion" fic where Bellatrix goes full terrorist and yet is the (anti)hero because the Goblins are worse.

Bonds of Blood goes from zero to "FBI, Open up!" real fast - and takes an almost clinical tone with it, which makes it even more disturbing.

The worst part is it starts off /great/ - Harry's interactions with Ginny are hilarious when they first wake up and can't let go of each other for more than a minute, and it has a pretty sweet redemption-moment for Petunia early on when she takes Harry and Ginny out shopping.

Come on now. Just branding writers like that goes a bit far, don't you think? Stephen King isn't branded a paedophile after having preteens have a gangbang in "IT". GRRM isn't branded one after having teen girls married off to old men on a regular basis, or a sicko for all that incest and inbreeding going on in his books.

I mean, I get that such scenes can make people uncomfortable and can make them stop reading. I totally get that and some stuff I read, both in published literature (Kafka On The Shore by Haruki Murakami, the other already mentioned books) had scenes which, at the very least, shocked me at first. I wasn't sitting there and shouting "Pedo!" at Stephen King though.

At the end of the day, it's literature. It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't mean the writer is getting off of what they are writing.

I get that some stuff makes you really uncomfortable, but this general lashing out and branding people with /that/ is absolutely uncalled for.

****** I agree with you there. Writing preteens with adults -- in pornographic detail -- is borderline paedophilia, if not outright so. Still, I stand by my point when it comes to teens with teens, teens with adults (I mean, come on now, there's more than enough consensual real-life examples that one can ignore the actual implications in written form, which does not mean that I think it's an okay thing to do, especially when it comes to adults in such relationships, who are in a position of power in such a situation and almost abusing it), or even preteens in any manner -- when it is not romanticized, fetishized or anything else of that sort. Unless such scenes are blatantly pornographic, I refuse to accuse any writer of being a potential child molester -- because that's what being a paedophile means.

**** It's grim. I opened a fic with a description that led me to believe the Weasley's rescued Harry at the start of the fic and then dealt with the aftermath. It was not. Based on first and last sentence checks it was just graphic material. I reported it to AO3, but they didn't find it violated their community standards and I couldn't find anywhere else to report it to - I tried.

** [VERY NSFW] When I got into fanfics, out of curiosity I was trying to find the worst things out there, and here are some of my results:

- Luna surprising her boyfriend, Neville with some breakfast. She stuffed scrambled eggs in her vagina, sit on Neville's face, and fed him like a mother bird feeds their nestlings.

- Hermione using a time turner to have sex with herself.

- Hermione marring Bellatrix, helping Draco (now her nephew) fix the vanishing cabinet, letting the Death Eaters in Hogwarts and murdering Dumbledore.

- Harry choking Hermione to death and making love to her corpse.

- Angelina Johnson being hanged in the Great Hall by Umbridge and kept alive with a spell while choking continuously.

- Ron getting gangbanged by his brothers, doing his mom, getting ballbusted by Ginny, etc.

- Harry doing a foursome with the Dursleys (yes, everyone with everyone).

- Luna having a baby with her father, while being married to Rolf Scamander and keeping Ginny as her lover.

- Hagrid using Hermione pretty much as a fleshlight (at least with consent).

- Students forming a sex club for doing watersports, BDSM, banging ghosts, etc.

- And the absolute worst: The entirety of My Immortal!

Edit, I forgot one: Ginny's soul being switched with Voldemort's in the chamber of secrets, making Ginny dead and Voldemort living on, but Harry only finds it out after they got married. He kills Voldemort, who has Ginny's body now, creates a Horcrux necklace and puts it on Ginny's body. His soul possesses and reanimates the body, and plays Ginny's role, so their children will never know that their mother is actually dead.

I mean, there are people that find that kinky (myself, unfortunately, included). And unlike a lot of the other nasty shit on this list, there was consent, which goes a really long way to making things less weird in this instance. Plus, if you got rid of the weird age and authority disparity, that would be basically how any normal relationship between Hagrid and a fully-human woman would inevitably wind up.

** From the Sacrifices Arc series:

#+begin_quote
  "The Death Eaters took dozens of Muggleborn children from their homes, and, most unusually, did not kill their families. It was believed they did this as part of their strategy, to encourage desperate hope and anticipation, and even to encourage their families to withdraw from the war. Of course, when the news of the Children's Massacre came a few days later, all thoughts of strategy vanished in a tide of overwhelming grief.

  "The Death Eaters raised crosses from the ground near Ottery St. Catchpole, and crucified the Muggleborn children upon them. They used spells that heightened the pain of the nails being driven through their wrists and ankles, and other spells to make sure that they stayed alive throughout it and did not die from the shock. Finally, they set a ward around the crosses in one of the rare examples of Dark wizards cooperating during You-Know-Who's War. The ward took hours to knock down when the Light wizards and the Aurors finally reached it. When it finally fell, lines of lightning lashed from it and struck every child dead before they could be rescued. The emotional destruction of many families was complete, and far fewer Muggleborns remained in the war; instead, they applied for sanctuary from the Aurors and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and retreated into hiding."

** In general, what I consider the most creepy in fics is Obliviation abuse. I'm desensitized from most other things fics throw at me, but simply the act of abusing Obliviate to screw up a person's memory always distressed me, more than anything else in fics.

I once read a crackfic oneshot with Lily going full Snape-apologist, so she decided to switch the lives of James and Severus, giving Snape James' fortune and giving Potter Severus' misfortune. She then obliviated James (now in Snape's body) so he would only have Snape's memories left (while Severus got both his own and James' so he could fit in). The premise was ridiculous in general, but add the Obliviation on top and I found the entire thing incredibly disturbing. Even if we, for a moment, pretend that Severus did nothing wrong and James was horrible -- the moment James' memories was Obliviated, he would at that point be deserving of the exact same thing Snape was -- the act of punishing someone for something they don't even remember is just plain wrong.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4760794/1/Lily-s-Ultimate-Revenge][Lily's Ultimate Revenge]] is the oneshot in question. I consider it the author's weakest work HP-wise (haven't read his/her non-HP fics).

** Alright, I wasn't going to share this but this thread needs a different kind of disturbing. It's not a sexual disturbing (at least for the vast majority of the story) but it was a sort of Lovecraftian call of the void kind of story. It was a Fem!Harry x Fleur story. Fem!Harry is at first slowly immersed in the Dark arts. Later on, she throws herself into them. Fleur was on the opposite side of the spectrum where she was immersed into the Light Arts but was no less gruesome. The author was verrry descriptive about what their magic did to others, and to themselves. Near the end, it turned into the call of the void trope I talked about before, and some of the descriptions ruffled my not so ruffleable feathers. >! The ending was really cool, as it turns out that what happened to Fem!Harry and Fleur throughout the story was the birth of Life and Death as apparently even primordial beings who exist outside of time need to be born as well. !< The horror was in the details really, and I had to take a step back at times when the story got too intense. Overall it was a very good read and was really a step outside of both my comfort zone and any other fic I've ever read. linkffn(12768475)

** Most horrific one I read was a fanfiction where during their Occlumency sessions, Snape, who is an established pedophile, discovers that Harry is also one, and they bond over it. Thats a very bare bones plot, the majority of the scenes are just different, in-graphic depictions of having sex with minors. In particular I think Snape has sex with a little girl, and then as a treat kidnaps Harry a little boy. No moral story to he told, its literally straight up ch*ld porn.

But the most disturbing part of it all were the comments. There were so many that were all just board with it... praising how hot the story was and suggestions for what to do next with the children. I checked and the authors other work all seemed along the same lines, ChildHarry/AdultJames, ChildLilyLuna/AdultHarry, etc. Again, no relevance to it actually being Harry Potter, just sex scenes. Messed up that kind of thing is so readily allowed, accepted and encouraged.

** Harry starts identifying girls by whether they'd started menstruating or not in Chapter 2 of a very well recommended fic.

(different fic) Hermione whores herself out to Lucius Malfoy so she can spy on the Death Eaters. She then pretends it's a humiliation fetish when Snape uses Legilimency on her. The story then becomes Hermione/Snape when Hermione is around 16.

Every Snape/Harry story ever.

In general there is a horrific amount of teen/adult relationships in fanficton and it's just weird.

** I've stumbled across some pretty fucked up stuff on A03.

There's one where Harry, Cedric and Kris repeatedly rape Fleur.

Another where Ron figures out how to turn everyone into sex slaves, so essentially rapes everyone from Mrs. Weasley to Ginny to Hermione to Harry and really every character you can think of.

But the one that unsettled me the most was actually an incredibly well written fic. The other two I could pass off as sick trash, but Manacled (I think that's what it was called) was SO well written, and was a cross between HP and the Handmaid's Tale. That one left me shook for days.

this is written as: \>\!see no spoiler\!\> (here I used \\ for single backslash in front of a character)

or you could just use code block, which turns off any reddit formatting by either having 4 spaces in front of a line, or enclosing text with backticks `like this` ---> =like this=

** Discounting the mlp shit I've forcibly forgotten there was a naruto story recently that had all "abused naruto" things and Anko stumbles across him and, after a long fucking mission, says "I'll feed you if you let me kill you" and naruto just demanded the food first. Then she poisoned him and watched him die horribly before he came back. This became a regular thing until eventually she just faked naruto's death and forced him to live under a henge where they continued the weird big sister little brother abusive relationship. Weirdly fascinating story in that it was well written and there was no porn.

**** basically; Voldemort is far more twisted. So demon-like that he can be calmed and satiated by the murder and feasting of newborns. As a fragment inside of Harry, this remains true; and his influence is powerful.

Dudley and Petunia have since learned how to dull him, weaken him with muggle spices that have magic of their own through occult learnings. Snape is affected by this as well, and so he concocts a potion that can heal his and Dudley's magic, removing the occult's affect.

Harry is self-aware in all of this, remaining sane and conscience through it as he commits horrible deed after horrible deed, a sad little boy simply wishing to see the outside world and make friends. Yet his teeth are stained in blood.

He has murdered and feasted on hundreds of baby animals, vernon, and Arabella Figg.

Tom Riddle is inside of him. A vile thing twisting through his skin and flowing through his blood like a worm. Ready to feast on the world for all it has. And all it will spill.
