It's always been my headcanon (maybe that's actually canon?) that Aberforth is in Hogsmeade to keep an eye on his brother and step in if Albus goes crazy again.

Is there a fic where Aberforth learns of Albus' obsession with Harry, Voldemort, Voldemort's Horcruxes and the Deathly Hallows and decides to take matters into his own hands?


** Not that I know of, sounds interesting though.

*** I've only read one or two fics where Aberforth is a badass before and I could use more in my life as well.

*** His brother most likely. Although Aberforth ripping off his robes to reveal that he looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger before he beats up Voldemort with his bare hands would be entertaining as well.

**** Yup.

Or him huffing and puffing the Piggie Dursley house away works too.

*** I'll second this. Another one that involves Aberforth, but in a subtle, not badass way, is linkffn(Tournament Woes by Bobmin356).

  Another repost. This was our first attempt to take the tournament in a new direction.
