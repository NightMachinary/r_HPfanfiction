  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

Ginny in Slytherin: linkffn(the changeling by annerb)

These two are (in my opinion) on par with On the Way to Greatness.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I'm rather fond of Slytherin!Hermione, so here are some recs. (Note that Slytherin!Hermione is to be distinguished from Hermione in Slytherin, which is a much lower bar.)

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is currently /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic.

- linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood) and sequel isn't bad.

- linkffn(The Brightest Witch and the Darkest House by Belial666) would have been a Slytherin!Hermione fic, except that the author had bought into AuthorityWorshipping!Hermione fanon, so he or she created a Muggleborn OC to replace Hermione instead.

- linkffn(Who's Afraid of the Dentists' Daughter? by TardisIsTheOnlyWayToTravel) is an unfortunately abandoned comedy fic.

- linkffn(Labyrinth by Kroontjespen) has Hermione and Harry meet up pre-Hogwarts and end up sorted into Slytherin. Not great, but amusing enough.

- linkffn(A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story by cosette-aimee) has adult Harry thrown backwards in time, into a younger body, and into an alternative universe where the indigenous Harry died in Dursleys' custody, and the world is a very a different place as a result. A big part of the story is him attending Hogwarts as Sirius's illegitimate son, going to Slytherin (with Hermione in tow) and trying to bring around Draco & Co., even as Voldemort begins his return.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkffn(Marionette by Shizue-sejin) is about an OC who's a Death Eater's kid in Slytherin basically being the/a boss. It's not just about Slytherin and it isn't really about Harry, but it still gets updated occasionally and has one of my favorite portrayals of power plays and the hierarchy in Slytherin

  In the last years of Voldemort's reign, more than one child lost their family. Amongst those poor souls, one child was not like the others. One child didn't lose their home to Voldemort, but to Albus Dumbledore. When you can't trust your own mind, how do you know right from wrong? What wouldn't you do to survive? Who wouldn't you kill or betray? And how do you fix your mistakes?
