It seems my urge to read something new has been awakened once again. This time, I would like to know if there are stories where Harry has a skill/talent that would make people be amazed with him.

Harry is a good cook?

Yes please!

Harry is a magnificent bartender that produce the best drink?

Definitely!

Harry as a pianist?

I want it!

Harry the matchmaker?

Ouh la la!

Harry as a barista?

Most definitely!

Yes, stories where Harry is a talented person in mundane things is definitely something I need right now. Thank you in advance!


** Skilled Harry

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][the Problem of Potion]] by Wyste. Harry spends a lot of time cooking and making sweets. Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples. Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world. Complete. Ao3

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants series]] by Endrina. Harry is raised by Snape and Lupin. All he wants to do is be normal and open up a resturant. He doesn't get to do this until after the war. Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.” What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms. Complete. Ao3.

**** The first is great and I just finished rereading it yesterday but second one is my absolute favorite in the fandom. It takes a little bit but Harry does amazing things with magic. I don't want to say too much because the story unfolds so beautifully and it's better to go in knowing less

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year

** Oh man there's one I can't remember the title of to save my life so maybe someone else can pipe in after I give a preview of what i remember.

Sirius was able to get away with Harry from “the night”. He took him to America on the run from death eaters. I remember a snowy mountainside. Where to be able to get Harry away from an attack Sirius had to set up a bomb. Killing himself in the process.

Harry is adopted into a normal family and learns a love for music. He goes through most high school I believe and his music passion grows. Something gets Harrys families attention over his magic and they contemplate sending him to this magic school.

The Weasleys visit this family. Percy bonds with Harry over playing a gameboy.

Harry eventually makes it to Hogwarts. He feels it lacks music. So he starts some kind of movie magic feel good sound making scene with everyone in the great hall trying to get them to appreciate the music. Then I stopped reading because that was way to embarrassing for me to read any further.

But you might like that kind of thing?

- Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. In this fic, he makes amulets and sells them at open air street markets. It is complete.
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852/chapters/1692695][Turn]], Harry gets a glimpse of a world where he made different choices. It is Drarry and epilogue-compliant. Harry develops a skill over the course of this fic Complete

*** So it's really really AU, but I loved You Get What You Give by Watermelonsmellinfellon on AO3 and it does have figure skating as a really big feature of the story which was the first time I've really come across it. Some of it is quite dark and quite adult though and it definitely should have content warnings for other parts of the plot.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way.
