** - Lord Potter: Harry gains a magical Lordship which usually enables him to be a member of the Wizengamot and partake in politics. Usually Harry's power is absurdly high explained through some pseudo political science and fanon relations to other magical families such as Gryffindor. Usually also includes:

- Pureblood culture: Somehow, the purebloods developed a rich culture with a strong sense of tradition, a well established picking order (where Harry is at the top) and a lot of power behind the old names. About half justify Voldemort's civil wars as "preserving tradition". Often also has

- marriage contracts, where someone made a contract a couple of centuries ago and now Harry has to marry one or multiple girls, all of whom are blander than porridge and lack anything resembling character. They are always attractive and the contract turns into true love

- OP Harry: Harry is a much better wizard than in canon and has no issues bitchslapping everyone with magic. Usually incudes a training montage and an elaborate plan to deal with Voldemort that is executed without a hitch. Usually includes Harry having a ridiculous, overpowered wand as well.

- Slash:A gay main pairing, usually with Harry as a submissive bottom and Voldemort/a Death Eater as love interest. Guaranteed to have everyone out of character and in 95% of the cases includes :

- Death Eater whitewashing/revisionism: Stories where the magical Nazis are portrayed as not that bad or even as righteous. Mostly done because fangirls find the actors hot and don't even realise that they justify genocide and racial persecution along the way.

Sadly, this covers 90% of all fanfics and those tropes are almost guaranteed to be part of a shitty story. The one term you'll also see used quite a lot is bashing, which means a character is reduced to their flaws, which are then grossly exaggerated.

** There is TV Tropes [[https://tvtropes.org/]] which contains all the tropes ever used in almost every single work of fiction.

*** I'm looking specifically for tropes in relation to Harry Potter fanfiction that I continually see referenced here not necessarily Harry Potter tropes which I've read before on TV tropes.

And when you click on fanfiction there it doesn't actually reference fanfiction tropes themselves. Just what Fanfictions fall under their tropes.

Like Slytherin!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, or Evil!Ron. Which are ones I know.

** It would be easier if you were to mention some tropes that you are unfamiliar with and need explanation for.
