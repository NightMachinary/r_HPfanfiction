*** This is what made me ask the question! I couldn't for the life of me remember the name of the fic but remember enjoying it. Might be time to re-read it.

** I've read two that start on that day, though they continue further:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3727017/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Return-to-Hogwarts][Harry Potter and the Return to Hogwarts]], canon-compliant as far as I can see during the day after the battle, but later AU
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8090116/1/Miles-to-Go-Before-I-Sleep][Miles to Go Before I Sleep]], Severus's perspective, AU in that Severus survives and never gives Harry any pensieve memories.

I'm not much of a fanfiction reader so I don't know what else is out there, but I hope that's a good start. /Miles to Go/ is definitely the better one of those two, actually one of my favorites (though, again, I haven't read a lot).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation]]

Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation, by Vera Rozalsky. Hermione centric. Hermione/Neville, with some Draco thrown in.

Some weird sex stuff, and the author hates at least 2 Weasleys, but it fits criteria.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7755315/1/Those-Gilded-Chains-We-Wear][Those Gilded Chains We Wear]] picks up /during/ the final battle and goes AU from there. Bellamione, and very very well done.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]] picks up the morning after. Fairly good read, explores some of the psychological impacts on harry among other things.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554615/1/The-Lost-Summer][The Lost Summer]] technically starts a couple weeks after the battle, however it is basically as if it was the next day.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9787334/1/Faintest-Slimmest-Wildest-Chance]] Faintest, Slimmest, Wildest Chance by keeptheotherone Canon-compliant, amazing writing. It should be way more popular than it is!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days]] Grave Days by Northumbrian Canon-compliant, and one of many post-Hogwarts fics by this author.

** Harry Potter and the Summer After the War [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803]] and its sequel, HP and the Winters after the War, are excellent. One of the first fics I ever read and still one of my favourites.

EDIT: Just noticed somebody else already suggested this - +1!
