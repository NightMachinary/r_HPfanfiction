I'm getting kind of bored of the whole evil slytherin thingie not to mention Lord Potter of Black or what ever. Anyway are there any fics where harry ends up plausibly evil or ruthless but is not a damn slytherin?

In most of those slytherin fics 11 year olds always talk like adults, i'm like wtf man.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** Hmm. Maybe linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

Not really sure if that's what your looking for, but that Harry is certainly immoral. It's very AU, being a crossover with the Dresden Files, though you don't need to know anything about the Dresden Files to read it.

** Ok i'm recommending this because i liked it a lot but the thing is, Harry is in Slytherin. Ok don't stop reading hear me out here, he joins Hogwarts at his 7th year so no '11 year olds', there are no poltical moves so no Lord bullshit either. And he is in the bad side of moral line. Fic is linkffn(Hail Odysseus) if you're interested. If not, sorry for taking your time :)

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  In a world where twisting the very fabric of space and time is commonplace, Harry Potter is considered something extraordinary. Yet when he finally arrives at Hogwarts after being missing for seven years, no one can quite figure out what kind of person he is. Himself included. Darkish themes, no slash, no pairings, some lemons mixed in.
