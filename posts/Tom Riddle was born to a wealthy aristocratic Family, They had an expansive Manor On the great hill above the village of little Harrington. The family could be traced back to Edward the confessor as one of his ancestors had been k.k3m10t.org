Tom Riddle grew up to be an arrogant Young man, He grew up In a time when technology was constantly changing, Electricity was the latest thing his grandfather had the house wired just before his passing in 1903, Tom has been just 2the time, Fascinated by the magical lights, He had spent hours as a little boy switching them on and off much to the annoyance of his nanny. He quickly became accustomed to technology but electricity became a hobby for him he spent hours in his nursery converted to a makeshift workshop by the time he reached his early teens, Tinkering with electronics and little machines, Much to his mothers concern, He expressed interest in hunting riding and fishing like any young man of good breeding in that age but he also had a thirst for invention. He filed his first patent with the British Patton office when he turned 13. It was a bit of a scandal in the family having the heir to the manor, File for some thing so common as a patent. But then the profits started coming, And while the lesser manors and old Families in England of the aristocracy started downsizing their staffs and selling of land for a pittance the riddle family started buying, Their pockets well padded, By young Tom's ingenuity .

​

This blissful. Was unfortunately short-lived when the great war broke out with Germany, Tom's father took a position in the home guard his mother started an initiative For ladies of good breeding to train in nursing, And Tom turned his mind to aviation. His father paid for the lessons in flying, By the time he was 16 the war had been raging for almost 2 years and Thomas finally persuaded his father to let him join The rfc As a pilot, He also spent a great deal of time tinkering with the engines making improvements to nearly an 80% efficiency, Something that gave British airman a much-needed advantage. Thomas was an officer of course being a young man from the aristocracy, His father had paid for a year at oxford When he was just 14 before pulling him back to the manor making him finish his courses through correspondence know that he had complained. The boy is there were much older of his ilk, Young Thomas had made quite a few times but most of them had started in listing when the war began Oxford became eerily quiet in the first few weeks of the war declaration. He much preferred the chaos and calm of little Harrington rather than a desolate Oxford sick with apprehension over a war that would one day overshadow all others.

​

When he joined the fighting force he was a lieutenant in the royal flying core, Just 16 though his father had fudged his paperwork so he was recorded as 20. Some thing Thomas found quite amusing, As his voice still broke from time to time, His superiors knew he was lying but never questioned it as they needed competent pilots more than they needed proper documentation.

Young Tom met quite a few of his own aristocratic elkikl in the flying force, But he also commanded quite a few experience pilots from the lower classes. Some even saved his life from time to time his most trusted wingman Who became a dear friend within the first few weeks was a lad who is actually a year his senior also lying about his age who has worked as a milkman since he was 14. It was a novel experience for young Thomas owing his life to a commoner such as Nicolas. Who couldn't tie a cravat for anything but could tell you exactly what region a dairy cow was from just from its leavings. Their conversations were quite fascinating considering Nicolas also had a love for tinkering with engines and electronics they spent a few hours repairing the aircraft along side the mechanics when neither of them could sleep because of a bombing raid, By the Germans. Tom left the royal air Corps in 1918 after 18 months of service with a few dear friends surviving he had lost more friends than he had gained due to the violence. The aristocracy and lower classes had all been decimated by the great war the Austro Hungarian empire was no more and Thomas noticed More than one of the ballrooms for parties he had attended were sorely lacking in gentleman to dance with a debutante. It was something truly depressing how many friends and brothers they had lost.

​

Thomas will eternally grateful he's old cohort from Oxford though he had been very young when he knew them had actually third all right only losing about a third of their number out of 20 young lads it was better than a lot of the others.. Nicolas followed him back to little Harrington taking a position as his head of operations his friend helped him start an airplane manufacturing business in the village as many young pilots from the war wanted to keep flying as a hobby rather than in a time of war after peace was declared it was a business that turned quite profitable despiteThomases father being quite dubious about the endeavor in the beginning, Though he sat on a chair newly refurbished by an expert restore paid for with money as per cured from one of young toms Earliest Patent patent, For a safety modification to a novel invention called a blender. One that practically every housewife now had in her kitchen.

​

Thomas turned his eye towards aviation and towards the succession at his mothers insistence he started dating a young woman named Helen whose family had fallen and slightly harder times since 1907. She was beautiful intelligent a Spitfire in the sheets and Thomas had been smitten until he slipped a cup of tea given to him by a young lady working at a shop in Little Harrington. A young woman that was rather ugly half mad and had the last name of gaunt.

​

The tea had tasted quite funny and when Thomas opened his mouth to comment on this instead of a complaint the only words that left his lips were a declaration of devotion to a woman he had scarcely met.

​

The next year was a blur Mostly, Though he remembered snippets of being frozen by magic, Feeling cloudy but with a sickening feeling of love towards the creature who he had been forced to marry though his brain had screamed know when the preacher had asked him. He had been forced as if by some external force to give his ascension to the marriage. His hands still started to shake whenever he thought of the consummation, Of their union . The woman started to haunt his nightmares m gaunt, Became Mrs. Thomas riddle relatively quickly. And Thomas' tea always tasted. His absence in Lidl Harrington has been noted rather quickly thanks to the business his father was formally making inquiries they had a retired both Street runner combing all of London looking for him. And Mrs. McGregor his old nanny was making quiet inquiries to the serving community To see if any of them had seen him.

Thomas might be an arrogant young man but at least in this life he was well beloved by those who knew him.

One day he went for a walk instead of staying for tea when his wife was sleeping and things started to happen his devotion started to Wayne rather quickly. By the time he came back to the cauldron his mind was reeling and he was thinking clearly, And then he started screaming when he saw his wife a woman who had drugged him and forced him into an unholy union.She was a witch and he knew it. He bolted out of the leaky cauldron in another life he would've turned left and gone out the front door into Mago London but instead in his heist he made a right through a freshly opened brick wall onto Diagon alley and the wizards that inhabited It. And then he started to panic at being surrounded by magic.

Thomas Riddle still somewhat drugged and erratic in the mind bolted into the least threatening shop he could find, Which just so happen to be the book shop closest to the menagerie, Flourish and blots. He was scarcely there a moment before he ran headlong into a young woman with bushy brown hair, And a fierce demeanor. Making her drop her packages and having them both careening towards the ground. Instead of screaming and berating him for the tumble, The young lady took one look at his panicked features. And asked ,” What the bloody hell happened”

​

Making Thomas just start speaking for what seemed like ages but was really only about 10 minutes.

And then something miraculous happened the young woman which this one wasn't evil it seemed didn't drug him or berate him for his actions. Instead she offered something quite easy she offered help instead. She got him out of the alley and to a physicians office somewhere in the East End she promised no magic though the physician seemed to know about the wizards in the end. Thomas wasn't about to trust anything anyone said at that time. The chewing beet root that the Physician handed him seemed harmless enough he had watched him chop the ends off the vegetables he knew exactly what they were. But whatever happened from those leafy greens they cleared his head enough for him to actually speak, Without being in a blind panic, The young woman which was named Hermione Granger she was the owner of the book shop In Diagon alley and the young physician was a friendly enough young man named Harry Potter.

​

They seemed genuinely interested in his story and invested in helping him. In that moment Thomas Riddle felt there Intentions were genuine and it seemed to him that maybe all magic users weren't evil

*** Probably but I don't know yet.... I'm debating between making it where harry and Hermione time travel back to the 1920s or if I should have them be of that era. Either would work I'm just trying to figure out which works better with the over all story for the fic

**** It might be interesting if they were planning on going back and killing Voldemort, but shot too far back and came across this situation by accident. Are you planning fir them to take part in the magic equivalent of ww1?

***** Possibly.... However considering at least for the 1st chapter they meet Tom riddle senior sometime around 1921 or so maybe a little later I don't think that time line matches up quite right. But I do have an interesting idea for Hermione to run into newt scamander, And having a conversation about house elves. Perhaps causing newt to research into the species more closely and include it in some of his books as well as perhaps start the work towards elvish welfare legislation and that sort of thing.
