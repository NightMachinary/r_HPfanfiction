When a small Under-Faé is hurrying through London trying to collect "Innocents Tears" he comes across a small bundle on a doorstep, now despite being in a hurry he knows that he needs to invoke the Olde Law's of abandoned children belonging to the FAÉ, but the Lamia Queen(Naga/Half snake female) needs tears of the innocent to ensure her clutch of eggs is born healthy.
