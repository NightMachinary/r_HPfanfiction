I rlly love fic where everybody just love/adore/respect Harry

Doesn't have to be romantic (can be platonic or even familial) and I don't rlly mind harem fics either

My absolute favorite of this trope is linkao3(3390668) C'est la vie by cywscross and linkao3(21527806) the princeps series by Lomonaaeren

But I'm open to any fic suggestions and also thanks in advance!!


** No real help but thaaank you I have been looking for Princeps for awhile but couldn't remember what it was called! And C'est la vie is amazing too but sad it's not updated in forever. =/

And yessss, I'm so sad it hasn't been updated in so long T T. The author did say they have plan to continue sometimes soon, so might want to subscribe to the work to see if it gets updated

***** If I'm not wrong, I read it first in the comment section of the latest chapter around mid to late 2020. But then, the author puts it in the notes of the ninth chapter because way too many people were asking if the fic was ever going to be continued

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.
