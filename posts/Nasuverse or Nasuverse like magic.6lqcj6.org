TYPE-MOON has the best magic no questions asked. where is the Harry that uses magic that is or resembles Nasuverse magic?


** I wish we had more HP x Typermoon Xovers.

Do you think Voldemort can beat servants, OP?

*** Voldemort would win against a few specific servants like Gilgamesh and Gilles de Rais but not against most of even the weaker ones like Angra Mainyu or Hassan-i-Sabbah. what Voldemort has going for him is that if given a chance he can wall people in and has a one hit kill move though it is super slow meaning that he can take anyone who can't or won't get away or kill him quickly. What makes Voldemort weak is that he himself is relatively low mobility and his attacks are slow meaning that when against people who dodge bullets like it's nothing and destroy city blocks with a word and the swing of a sword he is super screwed unless he is himself a servant Berserker.

edit: the only reason he would win against the likes of Gilgamesh and Gilles de Rais is because they are examples of servants who either won't or can't move faster than a relatively fit but average modern human.

P.S. he would win against Gilgamesh because Gilgamesh would gloat while getting surrounded by fiendfyre and get offed either in a quick spell to sword exchange murdering Voldemort who would give a sucker punch killing curse or similar on his final breath or constrict the fire to kill them both while Voldemort vs Gilles de Rais would be one simply because Gilles would trip over himself babbling about God like a moron while Voldemort gives a killing curse to the back.

Edit 2: It is of note that Gilgamesh could pull a plot device out of his gate of plot devices and either win via plot device or actually get his shit together before using said plot device unnecessarily

**** But servant's is just a copy of heroic spirit from throne of heroes. It is debatable if they are magical constructs or even something that is considered as souls. Now, on the nature of avada kedavra, if it is just separating souls from body, then it would have no effect on servants. Well, it is clearly able to tear the soul for the caster (I don't know about the recipient). Seeing the shade summoned by resurrection stone to have no damage, though, made me assume that there is no damage being done to the soul itself. Not to mention avada kedavra itself is just one line word, which gives the caster high speed incantation but worth pretty much nothing on the magical power scale. /s

***** eeeh kinda...

so as far as I understand the throne of heroes is essentially the chapter of the Akashic record dedicated to famous people where a servant is a copy of a soul pulled directly from Akasha tethered to and powered by a magus and given the ability to subconsciously manifest itself.

Further, as far as my understanding goes the root transcends time and dimensions with the Akashic record being like the theory of forms where it contains the definitions of *everything*.

this means that barring certain exceptions the grail is pulling from the very concept of a given famous person rather than a shade of a specific soul meaning that servants are literally legends given life which presuming the killing curse removes the soul from the body it leaves only the legend behind the spirit lifeless with no power nor right to manifest or remain manifested leaving no corpse

tldr: you say that a servant is a copy of a heroic spirit I say they are legends given souls which require sustenance so long as they remain incapable of the third magic which the killing curse not only removes but it also removes the soul from the legend rendering both incapable of existing without a true magic.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Swords and Sorcery]] sort of fits, with some caveats.

Firstly the main POV character is a dimensionally displaced and de-aged Shirou. There are plenty of chapters that follow other characters as the story goes on, but if you want a fic where Harry is the main focus this one isn't it. Especially since there is no Harry Potter in the story, because it's a fem-Harry fic and her name is Iris.

Shirou does make friends with her, and teaches her to do some things using his sort of magic though.

**** There is a tagging system in place, but no one really seems to use it on SB. People do actually tag stuff over on SV (a forum that splintered off SB) but even there the system itself runs up against the limits of being a forum rather than a dedicated fiction site.

** Debateable. TYPE-MOON's Magic is more Supernatural Powers than actual Magic. The general consensus for me is that if something is called Magic but has clear-cut limits based on arbitrary rules that defy its own nature, then it's not Magic, it's just Supernatural Powers that sometimes make an asspull for the sake of the lulz.

*** First off, type moon has magic, ^{^{fiveofthem.}} Second off nasuverse has magecraft which covers literally anything that does not make an it just happened or nothing happened after or it just is or it just ceased to be being the domains of the five true magics and therefore the only things not doable via nasuverse magecraft. Third off nasuverse magecraft and magic makes sense rather than the clusterfuck that is Rowling, Kishi, or anyone else's.

Finally nasuverse magic is self consistent excepting five set quantities of which four are known and two have clear use that. Further, nasuverse magecraft while limited is limited in a clear cut and non-arbitrary manner being that the end goal of any magecraft has to be something doable with science.

I see that you clearly are lacking in knowledge so I shall explain my earlier points nasuverse magic is decided by magic and magecraft with magic being legit impossible shit and magecraft being the manipulation of some variant of od and mana to invoke a mystery to accomplish a function that could be replicated by science or affect variants of mana and od to do or prevent the accomplishment of something that could be replicated by science. the rules for the use of magecraft are that a mystery or act of magecraft is dependand on the skill, nature, state, training, and preparation; skill being ones knowledge of things related to the magecraft meaning that one has to know what they are doing, nature being the personality, mind, and soul of the castor meaning that someone whose soul and mind are blade will have an affinity to magecraft involving blades or that someone hateful will have an easier time at invoking mysteries revolving around hate such as Rowling's killing curse, state being the condition of the castor meaning that a castor who was born with low capacity circuits will have difficulty channeling large quantities of prana at once without preparation and someone with a weak body will find limits to how far they can positively reinforce the structure of their body, training being simple practice with magecraft meaning that if you have created a thousand blades and are the bone of your sword making another sword will be easier, preparation being what you have done, acquired, or made before and during the course of a magecraft meaning that if you cannot channel large quantities of prana you would be able to store prana externally for use negating you limitation and that if you need to actualize a mystery but have something connected to that myster you may be able to use the object to aid in the actualization of the mystery.

Point: TYPE-MOON is consistant, general, mystical, and methodical in enough quantity that magic is still magic but can be measured, used, and enhanced like science so that while anything is possible things have to be done.
