I was wondering whether there are any fics that depict Voldemort as more than a cruel tyrant who torments everybody (or at the polar opposite a bad boy who needs to be tamed). Instead he is actually still quite charming and pleasant when not pissed off and his followers as well as his enemies respect him. For those who had seen the Sopranos, I'm thinking he'd have more of a Tony Soprano-like personality.

****** My head canon was that the Horcruxes themselves, even though they mutilated certain aspects of his personality (and his body), did not make him insane. In fact even in the few appearances that he makes, he doesn't seem to be crazy (in the coo-coo way). My head canon is that the fact that he saw his experiments work and see himself defy death turned him into a megalomaniac with a god-complex. He considers himself unbeatable so he becomes more and more reckless.

***** Agreed. Wasn't he portrayed as red eyed and on edge/not nearly as suave and charming as early as when he came and applied for the DADA position he knew he wouldn't get so he could apply the curse and hide the diadem? That was supposedly in the mid 50s or so, right after Dumbledore took over the Headmaster position. The horcruxes were already having a visible effect on him that early, far before he recruited the second generation of Death Eaters like Lucius, Bellatrix, the Lestrange brothers, Barty Jr,, Snape, etc.

** The divergence point of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is that Tom Riddle stopped after killing Myrtle and decided that Horcruxes weren't the way to go. He reintegrated his soul and went into politics instead of warfare, succeeding in barring muggle-borns from government employment and then all non-Pureblood students from Hogwarts. He's intelligent, charismatic, and actually does want to protect Wizarding society from death by inbreeding, he just also wants muggle influences out of it. With no mass murders or terrorism, his views get a lot of traction.

  All it took was on look into the Headmaster's pensieve for Harry's world to crumble. When Dumbledore catches him, the manipulative bastard decided that changing Harry into animal and sending him all but gift wrapped to Voldemort is the best way to get rid of him. What the headmaster didn't take into account was Harry's knack for survival. Stuck as a cat and living amongst Voldemort and his Death Eaters is not how Harry planned on spending his 5th year, but he may just learn something from it.
