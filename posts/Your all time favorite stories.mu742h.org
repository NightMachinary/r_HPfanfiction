** My favourite story is Of A Linear Circle. It's a 11 book long monster filled with magic and history and forrest's of family trees. I adore Sal and Nizar with all my heart. (Fecking hundreds of all sorts of pairings but it's not a romance story. The pairings are just there. You read it for the plot and adventure and drama)

I also love The Second String which is a fantastic adventure story that made me cry. M/m pairing (but it's not remotely the focus and not relevent till the end)

I love All the Young Dudes for the character development. Wolfstar full Marauder Era.

I love anything by TheDivineComedian. Particularly Calibration which spooks me. No pairing (implied Wolfstar)

Antithesis spooked the crap out of me. No pairing

Manacled I loved but it was incredibly heavy. Dramione but.... not a romance imo... A Handmaid's tale story.

Sweater Weather was good fun though not my sort of thing. Too smutty but the author clearly loves hockey and I liked reading about hockey so yay! Nsfw wolfsfar

Text Talk by Merlywhirls is the only textfic I can tolerate and it's fab. Wolfstar

The Life and Times by Jewels5 is brilliantly written and I just adore it. Its finished enough for me, I don't need a happy ending. Jily (on ffn)

The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights by CHDarling is a brilliant Jily story that's still in the works and I love it. No pairing, eventual.jily.

Break by K1toftheworthies is so fucking underrated. Brilliant story about Remus and Sirius and the 12 inbetween years. Big look into ministry prejudices which I thought was great. I love it. No pairing but implied Wolfstar.

Please don't @ me for not linking them, I've had a real shit day and can't be arsed. They're all huge stories in the field, put any of them into the search bar with the HP catagory and they'll be the first to come up.

** The Like None Other series has been a favorite of mine for years. I really enjoy the developing relationships between characters who once hated each other and how they grow to be a family. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]]

The Pureblood Pretense. I didn't expect to like this one going in but I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the fear of discovery kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

Harry Potter and the Nightmare of Futures Past. My favorite time travel story and the one that set the genre for me. I wish it was finished, but I reread it about every two years regardless. [[https://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=9305]]

Yellow Submarine is my favorite Harry/Ginny fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine]]

Better Be Slytherin was my first introduction to Slytherin Harry and remains a favorite, I wish the author had written more in the series, but it has a lot of good stuff. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin]]

Leo Inter Serpentes is my favorite Harry/Draco, and has some of my favorite representation of Slytherin House. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590]]

The Perils of Innocence is my favorite pre-Hogwarts fic, but it's also not finished. I really enjoy what is there though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/495672/chapters/86771]]

The Changeling is my favorite Ginny focused fic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Getting the Hang of Thursdays is my favorite Snape focused fic, also includes Hermione. Time loop. [[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/]]

That is everything that comes to mind for right now, though I'm sure that there are others I'm forgetting to mention.

*** This is the summary:

A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
