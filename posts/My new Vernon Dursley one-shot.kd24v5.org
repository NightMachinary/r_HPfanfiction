** I like it! I never thought of the Dursleys trying to find alternative magical guardians. Probably bcs they would be freaked out of sending the first letter :D

** I appreciate the concept, but it seems to brush aside everything that actually made the situation as complicated as it was. Off the top of my head:

- At what point would Dumbledore politely inform Sirius that he is about to throw away 15 years worth of the best protection Harry could have against Voldemort and his agents? That Harry would have to be raised in seclusion to even come close to that level of security?
- Would Sirius /want/ to be freed at that point? He could have walked out of Azkaban any time.
- As far as everyone is concerned, Sirius /confessed/ to the crime in front of aurors. At a trial, he would have to weave a complicated story about how contrary to the testimony of everyone alive, someone else was the Secret Keeper, that Pettigrew was an animagus, etc..

*** And just after that, Sirius would politely tell Dumbledore to fuck off.

What Sirius wanted from inside Azkaban wasn't really relevant. The lawyers got paid to free him, so they freed him. Then they took him to a mind healer.

The case didn't actually go to trial, it was dismissed on a technicality. Peter not actually being dead makes it hard to charge Sirius with his murder, for example.

**** - That is his prerogative; but I am not sure whether that's what he would do under the circumstances. A vengeful Death Eater with a bottle of Felix Felicis is all it takes.
- What's a "mind healer"?
- As far as anyone---including, possibly, Sirius---is concerned, Peter /is/ dead.
