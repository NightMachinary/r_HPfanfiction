** There's already a [[http://my.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1jnwcd/im_looking_for_a_good_harryluna_story/][Harry/Luna]] thread going where you may find several stories of that pairing.

If what you're looking for is a Harry/Voldemort slash pairing fic, then I can't help you, as that's not a story type I'd ever read. (That said, there are some that [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][have extensive Harry/Riddle friendship/interaction]] that you might find readable.)

*** Well, I guess I'll try it. But you should really try the pairing. It's really good if written correctly.

**** It's a matter of personal preference, but I do not read HP fanfiction with slash pairings unless by one of a rare few authors (Sam Storyteller, e.g.).

***** Ah. I hate most slash pairings, honestly, but something about Harry/Voldemort...
