Has anyone encountered a Harry Potter CYOA?


** They are banned by FFN, so you won't have much luck in that regard.

** I had some fun with choose your own adventure stories in my childhood.

Though I imagine the format doesn't suit fanfiction very well, because you have to think through everything and write the majority of the content before you start publishing.

I'd love to read something like this if it's well done.

*** You could let the readers decide the choice, for example, and write an update to the story based on that choice.

**** Oh okay, that's not at all what I have in mind when I think of a "choose your own adventure" story. That's more writing by committee or popularity - and I'm absolutely against democracy/popularity-contests in arts & humanities.

** The [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/tags/harry-potter/][SpaceBattles]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/tags/harry-potter/][Sufficient Velocity]] forums have some quests, but I couldn't find an index, so you'll have to dig through the HP tag. Quests are stories where the author posts a chapter and gives some options at the end for readers to vote on. They don't (usually) have branching paths, but it is interactive fiction. [[/alt_text][]]
