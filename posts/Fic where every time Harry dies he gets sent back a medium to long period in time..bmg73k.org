:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm not sure exactly how far back he went each time but i remember it being something like a week to a few months.

I also recall that it was thanks to this ability that he did really well in class.

This happened at least 4 different occasions from which i remember him being attacked by a death eater and crushed by the express and eventually Voldemort learned of, and benefited from, the phenomenon

I'd appreciate any help in finding it, thanks!

Edit: Solved!


** Sadly it looks abandoned.

*** How can a story already completed be abandoned? Does it have many typos and the author doesn't bother fixing them?

**** It's complete and not abandoned. It does have some typos and a bit of homonym confusion, but nothing too bad - and it sort of goes with the territory. Much better than the average of course, but that's practically a requirement for coherence.

**** I think it was dormant for an extended period, then finished off. I guess someone missed the memo?

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
