** on the way to greatness.

"On the Way to Greatness is ongoing and I sincerely hope to see it through till the end. I get a lot of comments asking me if I've abandoned it, and, inevitably, the answer is no. Whenever you're wondering this, even if I haven't recently popped back here to say "hello, still writing"... the answer is nope, not abandoned. "

  Jamie has survived an entire year and has successfully kept her employment at Hogwarts. Now she has to deal with a family that knows who she is, a government that doesn't want her in the country, and people demanding to know when she'll get married. That, and there's also the pesky after-effects of throwing herself backwards through time.

  One of them is desperately trying to remember their past while the other is forever trying to escape theirs. It's seven years after the war and Draco has managed to avoid almost everyone from Hogwarts, living a lonely life on a small island, far away from the wizarding community. But a familiar face in a cafe window capsizes his world into chaos. Dramione. EWE. Memory fic.

** Every fic by DireSquirrel. From Buffy to Worm to HP, I've been left hanging in every single fandom that I was majorly into. She'd be my favourite author of all time if not for this.

  ::::A Mini Sequel to 169:::: Remus is the DADA Professor at Hogwarts in 1993. Of course, there are no Dementors or wrongly imprisoned Azkaban escapees threatening the school. But even without the Boy-Who-Lived's baggage endangering lives, Hogwarts still seems to attract danger. Someone wants Remus dead, and they are willing to put the whole school at risk to do it.
