i just really wanted one that he was at least part of the main characters or that he had a love interest just because he really deserved better than what he got and i just want to imagine he had some happy times


** For Regulus as the main character, maybe try the Renascentia series. A lot of it is from his point of view, lots on how his mind works. They're long stories with original plot, era is AU of Order of the Phoenix. He's paired with Emmeline Vance. First one complete, second one wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14495823/chapters/33487077]])

If you like the writing style, then the same two authors have written another Regulus-centric story which is an AU on the first wizarding war. He's paired with an OC and it's a wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375733/chapters/38325272]])

Then there's a time travel Harry one that's really good but a bit slow to update. Looks like Regulus will get a happy ending and end up with Harry but no romance yet. First wizarding war era and the charactization is top-notch. Wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

Blackpool is Regulus-centric and is very very angsty but with a happy ending for Regulus, although no romance. Marauder's era, first wizarding war. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) has a lot of different main characters and Regulus is one of them. He gets a happy ending and there's some romance at the very end. AU of the first wizarding war. Complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]]) is a long time travel fix-it with Regulus in the supporting cast. Main characters are Sirius, Hermione, Ginny and Luna. Regulus is paired with an OC pureblood witch and I think maybe also with an OC wizard in the beginning. He has some chapters from his point of view and becomes more relevant around half-way through the story. Complete save for the epilogue.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

#+begin_quote
  As the wizarding world is forced to face the reality of Voldemort's return, a new focus sharpens the efforts of the Order. Trust grows between Regulus and “the vigilantes,” granted to (and by) some members more freely than others. The shadowed chaos of the previous year billows to new heights of aggression, setting aflame the spread of an escalating war, but as the attacks grow more frequent, the quickened hunt for the horcruxes resumes with more pointed aims. Family, allegiance, and ideology are put to the test as conflicting sides yank and clash, push and pull, calling into question what it means to stand for one side or another - or what it means to try to stand somewhere in between.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

  James is having the time of his life, Bellatrix enjoys a spot of nail-pulling, Marlene is an excellent dancer, Dorcas gets the job done, Remus finds a purpose in life that doesn't revolve around his werewolf alter ego, Sirius should perhaps try out a healthier lifestyle, Lily brews the best Polyjuice Potion, Alastor keeps an eye on things, Mary is scared for a reason, Gideon would probably be scared without one, Regulus can't wait to do the right thing once he figures out just exactly what that is and Peter had a great time in school. The question is, where is Voldemort's soul and is it safe to go looking for it?This is a self-indulgent take on the first wizarding war with canon divergence from chapter 25. The story is told from several points of view in a would-be attempt to scrape the surface on each character's psychology. There are mature themes throughout the story, but most chapters are supposed to be more humour than angst.

** This story is in my top five favorite Harry Potter fanfictions and it has Regulus Black in spades. He has happy times and some angst. Also fair warning this is a WBWL, Slytherin Harry story and is really really long so if its not your type well then don't read it. He shows up around chapter 80.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]]

​

Also there are these other fics on another similar question to this one.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/79d9wy/any_good_regulus_black_fics/]]

Finally I remember reading a fanfic where Regulus survives the Inferi and becomes a Dark/Light vigilante person who helps Sirius and the Potters fight Voldemort but for the life of me I can't remember it.

*A Second Chance at Happiness? Maybe?* By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5482960/animeotaku20][animeotaku20]]

A stupidly curious Harry Potter accidentally ends up in the past ... right in front of Regulus Black. Deciding he might as well stop the world going to hell, a - slightly insane - Potter drags a bewildered Regulus with him. Between ending a war and accidentally saving the Blacks, the two quickly get close. Will they have a second chance at happiness? Maybe? Slash, mentions mpreg.

Stopping a war was surprisingly easy. Falling in love and getting married was even easier. (Sort of.) Being an adult and living life should be smooth sailing ... right? Getting older totally made you wiser, meaning Harry and Regulus' lives together will of course get easier as they go along. Can they ever have a normal life, or is their version of normal just absurd?
