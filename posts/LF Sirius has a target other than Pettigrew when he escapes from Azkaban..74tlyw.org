Just a random thought I've been thinking about; are there any fics where Sirius has a different motive for escaping Azkaban than revenge on Peter Pettigrew?

Such as, aiming to kill Crouch for wrongfully imprisoning him, or Fudge for heading a ministry full of death eaters, or he aims to warn the Muggle Prime Minister about the total corruption of the magical ministry?


** ...Nothing?

Sheesh, well now I know what's going on my to-do list.
