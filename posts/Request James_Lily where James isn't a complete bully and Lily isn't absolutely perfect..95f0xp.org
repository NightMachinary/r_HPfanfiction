  Lily Evans' and James Potter's relationship has always been a complicated story; it's just about to get a lot more complicated. And so is everything else. They might not know each other well, but they're about to know each other a lot better. Cover art by anxiouspineapples.

** What do you define as 'absolutely perfect' though? Goes flawlessly through every single class? Can beat down two Death Eaters twice her age with a flick of her wand? Can do no wrong? Sings lullabies to her pets? Is prettier than a veela? Can you be a bit more specific?

Linkffn(The Life and Times) is the best Jily fic out there, if you haven't already read it. The characters are 3D and compelling and you actually care about the OCs.

There's also Prelude to Destiny, which is quite good but doesn't fit with canon as it was written before Half Blood Prince. I used to have it as my headcanon, which sucks seeing as its not really canon-compliant anymore. Anyway, it's very good and it doesn't bother me that much. Lily has great OC friends and she isn't annoyingly perfect.

SunshineDaisiesWindmills tends to write a good Lily, too. Linkffn(In Fields of Poppies by SunshineDaisesWindmills) comes to mind. I can't remember if it's Jily tho. But she isn't characterised as 'perfect'.

Linkffn(Haggis from Alegrnon) is very popular as well, although I haven't read it. And so is linkffn(A Month of Sundays by Marziipan).

** I'm not sure if that's a legitimate critique. After all, the only true memories we see are from the perspective of Snape, who is not exactly the best source for unbiased history. We also only see perhaps 1% of both of their lives.

To me, it's a lot like seeing someone snap at a waiter in a restaurant. We may see it and think, "That person must always be unpleasant to waiters" but in truth, we don't know anything about said person. They may have just been fired from work, or had an argument with their spouse, or maybe the waiter was simply lousy. I believe the same concept can be applied to Lily and James Potter. I can say without a doubt they aren't perfectly how the brief glimpses we see portray them.

And I do agree, Lily and James Potter WERE two-dimensional, but that's because the books never called for much character development for them. They served as tools to further develop Snape and Harry's relationship and t also gave Harry more perspective into the parents he never knew, albeit not much in the large scheme of things.

As beautiful as Fleur. Lily had a temper? Take Harry's and Molly's tempers and combine them together. Lily was Head Girl?

At the beginning, both James and Lily seem very 2 dimensional, but as the story goes on, we get to see glimpses of their motivations, and why they made certain actions.

But regardless, if the OP can't tolerate James being a real dick for the first 50 chapters or so, PoS probably isn't for them XD

Edit: Also, how did you do your spoiler text? The way I do it (which is what the sidebar recommends) it shows up as a standard link on mobile and in the inbox page, which is less than ideal.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
