Probably found in SlytherinHarry stories more than anything, but I can't recall one where he did. Doesn't matter if it's a crack fic. I'm just in the mood to read about Harry using spells he normally wouldn't.


** There's one where he uses them in the Triwiz, but Idk the name. Plus, he can do it in hpMoR.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** Is it the AK or the Killing Curse? This is(EDIT: IS NOT TARGETED) targeted at this post, but the best to put it.

Why do people go around calling it the Avada Kedavra? I thought it was called the Killing Curse. People don't say they used the Crucio. They say the Cruciatis Curse.
