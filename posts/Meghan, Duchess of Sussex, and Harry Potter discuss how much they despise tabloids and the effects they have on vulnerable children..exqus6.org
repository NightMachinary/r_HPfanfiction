With her help, and that of his friends (including Hermione, Minster of Magic, and Ginny, his journalist wife), he creates the Wizarding World's first libel and defamation laws.

For timeline reference, in January 2020, Harry is 39 and Meghan is 38.

** Oh yes, the following scene is derived from my one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628), in which a certain "Skeeter Conspiracy" is mentioned:

#+begin_quote
  [Office of the Deputy Director of the Department of Law Enforcement, British Ministry of Magic]

  Hermione: Well, Ginny, it seems you have gotten yourself really into trouble this time.

  Ginny: You got a problem with that, Hermione? I thought better of you. This Skeeter bitch stepped over the line and I taught her a lesson. I regret nothing!

  Hermione: Calm down, Ginny. My staff told me that several opinion pieces calling for your head appeared on Daily Prophet as soon as the game was over. Almost too fast in my opinion, as if they had anticipated your response.

  Ginny: What? You mean that I had been set up?

  Hermione: Possibly, so far we have no proof, and Skeeter hasn't woken up yet. Your really put some power into your hex. It could have killed her.

  Hermione: Anyway, I have already mobilized our Network to stage a rally outside the Daily Prophet's Diagon Alley office later today. They will be calling for Skeeter's head instead and demanding an end to her slanderous pieces. Luna and Lee will soon publish their articles about possible conspiracy. They will encourage her slander victims to make a stand. Once the accusations are coming in, we will have a valid pretext to bring her in. Harry, you need your Aurors to put Skeeter under â€˜protection' soon. We couldn't afford some of our radical followers to harm her, and we couldn't let whoever are behind her to silence her.

  Harry: Thank you Hermione, you are always a step ahead of me. I love you.

  Harry: So, you believe there is a conspiracy behind her sudden attack against us?

  Hermione: Again, no proof yet. Once she wakes up, you will be conducting your standard procedure. It's better to be overcautious one hundred times than to let our guard down once. Constant Vigilance!

  Ginny: If there was a conspiracy, I doubt her backers would have exposed their true identities. They would be all polyjuiced anyway.

  Harry: Then we just have to be clever about it. I'm sure Hermione had already put her thought into this matter.

  Hermione: First, we need to establish that Skeeter is part of a conspiracy, which I'm very certain about it. This will change the public narratives and give us the initiative. I will coordinate with our friends in the DoM to step up our surveillance effort, and we will make a big splash in the press and on the street. That should hopefully scare off our enemies into doing something stupid, so we can catch them in the act. Harry, you know what to do.

  Harry: Well, let's get started then!

  [DMLE Interrogation Room #4, a few Hours later]

  Skeeter: You can't do this to me! I shall expose you all! This is a blatant abuse of power...

  Auror 1: Cut the crap, Skeeter. We know everything about you. Let's see what we've got here... Yes, 157 accusations of slander and defamation, more coming in by the hours. Well, you already confessed under Veritaserum that you were bribed by certain subversive elements to set up Mrs Potter. Of course, we know you are an illegal animagus too.

  Skeeter: Granger. She kidnapped me back then, held me captive for two weeks, and then still had the nerve to blackmail me. I will let the whole world know what she did...

  Auror 1: Nobody cares. Madam Granger is a great war hero and reformer, and you are just one yellow press journo who lied, slandered, and pandered to the lowest of the rabbles. Whom is the world going to believe? Besides, what happened during the War is all covered under Minister Shacklebolt and Wizengamot's Blood War Exemption Act. You were conspiring with Lucius Malfoy back then to commit character assassinations of Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr Potter, and Miss Granger. So you were basically one of them who had escaped justice for too long! But no more, we now have enough evidence to send you to Azkaban forever.

  Auror 1 pulled out a jar and let a beetle out, and crushed it with his fist.

  Auror 1: Skeeter, now it's time to carefully consider your options. Fully cooperate with us for leniency, or end up worse than this beetle.

  Skeeter after a long pause: If I fully cooperate, how much leniency can I expect? And how do I cooperate?

You just don't fuck around with Harry and Hermione (and Ginny), who btw never care much about rules when they interfere with their goals.

I hope you like it.
