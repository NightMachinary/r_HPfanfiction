I'm trying to find 2 fan fics. Both include sex and homosexual relations.

The first is one that I read years and years ago. It was set and The Burrow and the 2 main characters were Harry and Draco and there was a fair bit of sex between the 2. If i remember rightly Draco had to stay for some reason (to stay hidden for his own safety perhaps?) I think somewhere in the story we find out that somebodies soul is trapped in draco or draco is possessed but I'm not 100% sure about that.

The second is a story I started reading quite recently (maybe 2 weeks or so ago) and have been unable to find it since. The first few pages gave a great deal of detail into the life of the characters. For example if I remember rightly it explained that Blaise was bullied by Theodore, Harry was beat with belts on his bare behind by Vernon and Dean and Seamus could be found on the edge of the forbidden forest doing some sort of wiccan or pagan type magic (I think) but I could be getting stories mixed up. What I remember from the actual story is that harry ends up being some sort of healer and there's a part when he is travelling home after his first year I think when Blaise runs past their compartment naked. Harry and the gang protect Blaise from Theodore (who had stolen Blaises clothes and I think he has cursed him). Harry then heals him and explains to Blaise that he is now connected to harry and his friends. Once off the train Hermione and Blaise go to Gringotts to deposit Blaises family heirlooms into Hermiones vault to keep them safe.

Any help would be much appreciated. Especially with the latter as I'm dying to see how the story goes.


** I feel like I've read the first one somewhere on Skyehawke, but try as I might, I have not found it. Closest I can think is Secrets by Vorabiza, but I don't think that's the story you're talking about.

You might try posting this on [[http://hd-ficsearch.livejournal.com/][hd ficsearch]] and/or [[http://drarryficfind.livejournal.com/][drarry ficfind]], both of which are surprisingly active communities.
