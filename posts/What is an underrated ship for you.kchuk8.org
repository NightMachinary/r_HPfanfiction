** Harry/Katie is appreciated on this subreddit, but it's very uncommon in actual fics.

I almost never see any magical person shipped with a (non-crossover) muggle. With how much the Death Eaters push their superiority over muggles, you'd think that the good guys would actually act like they care about muggles more, and one of them actually hooking up with a muggle would be a great beat to show it. And I know it would be hard to do much with a Hogwarts long distance relationship, but there are still other options.

People seem to love Bad Boy/Good Girl fics, but why are they always Hermione with Draco, Snape, or some other Death Eater? Why not try a few Hermione/Dudley or Draco/some random muggle fics or something?

I like the idea of andromeda going to muggle grief counseling/support groups to work through everything in her life (disownment, loss of husband & daughter & son-in-law, sister was a nazi who killed her daughter, other sister is non-muderous yet still a nazi, raising her grandson alone, etc etc etc) and meeting someone that way. that poor woman deserves happiness.

Harry/Katie seems very cute. I would love reading a fanfic like that! If you ask me, Draco should have married a muggleborn/muggle. I mean, what's the entire point of his arc if he marries a pureblood? No offense to Astoria.

** Ron/Lavender didn't even have an entry on the [[https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_(Fandom][Shipping Wiki]]) until recently, and it's still a redlink.

Logically, a girl who spends time making sure she looks good, is not shy about expressing verbal and physical affection, and doesn't obsess or nag about scholastic achievements, is quite a reasonable match for Ron. If he didn't get into the relationship for the wrong reasons - ie to spite Hermione and Ginny - then maybe he would have been happier to be with her.

RonxLavender makes a lot of sense, and Rowling managed to find a way to make it somewhat canon. I honestly didn't even realize that Hermione liked Ron (and usually I am very emotionally in tune), I thought it was one-sided! So I was like, good for you Ron!

**** Maybe I was just too young at the time to notice, but I didn't see anything romantic between them, either. Even his disastrous attempt to ask her to the Yule Ball fell far short of expressing a clear interest; he literally turned to her because every other girl seemed to be unavailable and it had just occurred to him that she was a girl too. And her response did suggest that if he'd been a bit smarter and/or more sensitive and asked her up front, then she'd have been happy to go with him, but that's hardly proof of anything except that she doesn't hate the sight of him.

I think it might be because I don't relate at all to the bickering-all-the-time-but-they-really-do-love-each-other relationship dynamic. Apparently it works for some people, but I would never want it for myself, and perhaps that's why I didn't recognise any attraction between Hermione and Ron. I'm still dubious about their relationship in the epilogue, where he's lying to her to cover up doing things that she wouldn't approve of.

****** I go with the idea that she's obsessed with Harry, and being close to Harry means being close to Ron. That this is the basis of their entire relationship. This is before romance is a consideration for any of them.

Once romance is a thing, Harry's completely uninterested and Ron is very interested. Hermione can marry into Harry's family and be his sister-in-law. Hermone and Ginny can have a good time bitching about other witches too.

I think Hermione settles, and it sort of works because Ron likes to have someone do all the emotional labour, and Hermione likes to tell people what to do.

Reasons why I shipped them:

- I'm a sucker for vivacious girl getting together with a shy, timid boy.

- He took her to the Yule Ball.

- What better way to show that Ginny had gotten over her childhood crush on Harry by falling for the other boy who could have been "The Chosen One".

- They freaking got D.A. back together during Voldemort's reign at school. Fire-forged buddies!

** I think Harry/Katie or Harry/Cho. The first ship could basically a lesser Harry/Ginny. I could see the Harry and Katie stories working and maybe have Harry getting closer to Angela and Alicia. Maybe have the other chasers be with the twins. With Harry/Cho it depends on when you have the relationship start. During and before GoF circumvents Cedric. Having it after could have them bonding of either losing Cedric or seeing him die. You could have Harry backing Cho's backing of her friend after turning on the DA by stating to Ron and Hermione if it was one of them wouldn't they do the same?

** Agree, Harry/Luna is totally undervalued. I think its (partially) because Luna is so hard to write well.

Let me get creative with my response, rather than picking a specific rare pairing (fem!Harry/Fleur or Daphne are good examples of that), I'll say that Harry paired with the protagonists of crossover fandoms are strangely sparse.

For example, in Mass Effect/HP crossovers we see Harry paired with Liara, Tali, or even Benezia quite often, but you rarely see Harry paired with Shepard him/her-self. I think this is largely because Harry tends to take the place of the protagonist in crossovers.

Here's another example, in Buffy/HP crossovers, Harry is usually paired with Dawn, Faith, or Spike, but (with some notable exceptions) rarely Buffy.

I've long searched for this sort of thing, but its uncommon. I guess HP fanfiction usually only has room for one protagonist.

********** About Twelve Dark Moons, I just wanted to say that this story is anything but romantic; it's sexist, cruel and realistic, very well written and a great read, I also like the ending. Into Your Gravity and Dark Matter is a lighter story, it's my favorite. Dark Matter is a continuation of Into Your Gravity.

*** Postwar SSHG is a ship I personally don't mind, and is the SSHG I read the most (I don't like teacher/student ships), even if I don't really care for SSHG all that much. I mostly read it because it's by far the most common Snape ship, and I read it as a side effect of that since I read a lot of Snape fics.

But I'm not comfortable with the idea of her as a replacement Lily, since that would be a rather unhealthy relationship. Or did I misunderstand what you meant?

EDIT: I also wouldn't call the ship underrated, it's one of the most popular ships in the fandom. You wouldn't believe it by looking at the subreddit, but it is obvious if you look at how many fics with the ship there is, compared to various others.

**** Agree with this. I love SSHG, but only with a couple of caveats - has to be post war and she's 25 or more, and they've not had contact in the intervening years. Means there's no student/teacher dynamic because that's grim. Or if its time travel and she goes back to the 70s or teenage Snape finds himself in the 90s, it's all fine.
