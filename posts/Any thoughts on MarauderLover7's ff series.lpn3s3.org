Today I was searching for something to read while waiting for the next chapter of DP&SW to get posted, and I came across the five works of MarauderLover7, namely *Innocent* , *Initiate* , *Identity* , *Impose* and *Intensity* . The series got my interest solely upon its magnitude, since I prefer to read long fics - especially during this lockdown - , but I'm hesitant to jump at it, because unfortunately the quantity doesn't guarantee quality as well. Have any of you read at least some of these works? If yes, would you please say a few words (without spoiler) , whether I should invest time in it or not?


** So, it is generally good. There's no bashing or bizarre author appealish stuff that people often complain about, it has lots of interesting plots, the characters are pretty well realized and reasonably similar to their canon counterparts iirc

It's just kinda slow. I keep coming back to it every so often, getting burned out and dropping it.

*** Thanks for the feedback :) I'm definitely considering to give it a go, slow paced story doesn't bother me, life itself slows down in these weird times

** I must have liked it well enough at one point, because I'm signed up to get notifications when it updates. However... it's been so long since I've read it, that I don't really remember it. So- I'd say good, but not memorable?

** I'm my opinion it's the best "sirius escapes and raises harry" fic in the fandom.

*** Woah, that's what I needed to hear :D It seems that I've found a worthy opponent for the Marauder's Plan

**** Have you really? I love that fic and I've been looking for good parental Sirius fics since then... Have you tried it? How does it compare? I think I tried the Innocent series a while back since I've heard so much about it, and as you said, the size appealed to me as well. But it didn't really work for me if I remember right. But I might revisit it.

***** Well, I'm 13 chapters in, and so far I must say that the beginning and the foundation of the Marauder's Plan was stronger/better than those of the Innocent. However, that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy reading it; the writing is good, the characters aren't OOC , the premise is interesting. What I like the most about the Innocent is that the author is capable of intertwinining canon elements with original ideas in a clever way, resulting in a captivating and twisted plot. I definitely suggest you to give it a go, but be aware that it's indeed slow paced, despite the great time gap it has to catch up on (the story starts ~2 years before PS)

****** Thanks! I think it was the slow pace that did me in last time. But I can't remember clearly. I'll give it another go. Happy Reading!

****** What I like the most is that the characters are just people. There's no secret Black family magic, Harry isn't a prodigy, he just gets a flawed-yet-caring parental figure.

*** How does it compare to The Wise One, if you have read it?

**** Closer to canon than wise one. Also if I remember those correctly they more focused on year 5 and on? Innocent is currently in year 4 so we haven't to that age yet.

**** Less of Sirius sleeping around than The Wise One, Harry is more normal and less prodigy, I don't recall any Dumbledore bashing in Innocent, but I didn't finish The Wise One so couldn't fully compare them.
