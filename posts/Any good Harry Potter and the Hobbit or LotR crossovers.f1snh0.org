Any reallllly good ones? Finished and all please.

I would prefer a Hobbit crossover (I prefer it over LotE fight me) but a LotR ones would do me fine.


** I've got no clue about any crossovers with the Hobbit, but there are several good to excellent fics by the Steelbadger ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger]]) with the best being "The Shadow of Angmar" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]). A quick word of warning regarding it though, it is unfinished and updates very slowly.

The premise of the fic is that Harry is summoned to Middle-earth by the Witch-King of Angmar about a 1000 years before the end of the 3rd age ( LotR). It actually manages to capture the tone of LotR very well.

Another fic I can recommend is "The Archmage of Ardra" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13407891/1/The-Archmage-of-Arda]]) which is basically a super Harry at the beginning of the third age. It is a more light-hearted story but still a fun read. The author said he was working on a sequel at some point, but the ending works quite well as it is.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

**** That person made a mistake by putting the wrong fic ID in their comment. They later edited their comment to remove the bad ID, but they didn't use the command to make the bot overwrite its reply. Thus, the bot looks like it linked something that wasn't requested, but it's actually functioning correctly.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  With basilisk venom and phoenix tears within him, Harry's body, spirit and magic is transformed and his lifespan is greatly increased. So, when given the chance to go to another universe where he would be able to grow in peace with other immortals around him, Harry accepts it, and finds himself near Rivendell at the start of the Third Age of Arda.

  The one grateful thought that he threw to the sky was that he was not surrounded by trees. Truly, Harry was used to waking up in enchanted and lonesome forests and while he could surely survive in one again, the wide-open, grassy plain was a sight for sore eyes.The untamed magic and general feel of a land unknown to him were far outweighing any relief he could find, however.Because of course Harry Potter, the boy who had never stuck between the lines of “physics” and “magic,” would again defy the rules and end up very, very far from Hogwarts -- the place where he should have been at the moment. Appearing in a world with nothing but the clothes on his back and the wand in his holster for protection was very unfortunate indeed, and it was only the mind-numbing shock Harry was in at the current moment that saved the grass in a small radius from him from an explosive destruction.“What,” he said, “is this.”OR.The one where Harry finds himself in Middle-Earth and goes with Bilbo on his quest, making attachments and saving a few lives along the way. But don't be fooled: Fawkes is the real hero of this story. This is basically an "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH FAWKES" story. I'm a big fan of his.
