  Hermione respected all of her professors. But none more so than the ill-reputed, possible sadist, suspected Death Eater, Professor Dolohov. Antonin never paid special attention to any of his students. But somehow managed to develop an unwelcome, not-so-platonic, highly inappropriate fixation on one Miss Granger. AD/HG Student/Teacher AU

  Professor Malfoy had everything planned out. And it was all going to plan, too. And then along came Miss Black; and the damage would be irrevocable. Lucissa, AU but follows canon timeline, Marauders era, teacher/student, M for a reason.

** “The Untitled Cheekquel Project” (linkffn(2477165)), which is a sequel to “Where in the World is Harry Potter” (linkffn(2354771)), has Nicholas Flamel/Hermione, with a nonsense twist ([[/spoiler][the bear is hairy]]) because it's a nonjon story. Although it may or may not count since Flamel is kind of an ex-professor at that point.

Also, there's the fact that [[/spoiler][Harry is Nicholas and he is a professor at that point]] which you are aware of and I am aware of but people who hadn't read it ... somehow, are not aware of.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
