Hello [[/r/hpffn][r/hpffn]]!

Now that I have more free time and summer approaches, I am reviving the Wiki Project! If you don't know, the Wiki Project is a resource to help fanfiction writers write better and help readers find more fics! You can check out the main wiki page [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index][here]].

Here is my To-Do:

- +Organize the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/crossovers][cross-overs page]] into categories for each fandom.+ edit: just finished doing this

- Organize the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/timetravel][time travel page]] for which character time traveled.

- Continue adding [[https://www.reddit.com%0A/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/book_club][Book Club]] threads to the list.

- Add to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/history][history]] if something meta happens.

- Add to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/romance][Best of Romance]].

- Add more to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/writingcenter][Writing Center]].

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the Wiki, and feel free to help out! You should see some more discussion posts coming soon.

** Maybe rework the pairing list so it is better organized. Instead of fifty links to comment chains a table would work better. It could be sorted by the main pairing and could have the following slots.

- Title

- Main Ship

- Additional characters/ships

- Time

- Summary

- Status

- Link to story

- Link to discussion thread

The result would look like this:
