I am looking for some fics where Harry as MOD is not too pleased with Thanos' attempts to woo Death and decides to take things in his own hands.

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8410168/1/][*/Steve And The Barkeep/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1543518/Runaway-Deviant][/Runaway Deviant/]]

#+begin_quote
  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.
