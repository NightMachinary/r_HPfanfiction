So i imagine him to be like a mini horace slughorn, just a generally prime slytherin but he begs the sorting hat to be in another house so he can make good allies without the slytherin prejudice

In this one, he specifically asks the hat to not put him in Slytherin so that people won't be suspicious of him.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** A little different, but in linkffn(Princess of the Blacks), fem!Harry describes getting sorted into Ravenclaw as her most Slytherin move (she really should be a Slytherin).

Be aware though, it's a /dark/ fanfiction, definitely not for everyone

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry
