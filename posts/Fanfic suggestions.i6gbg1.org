:END:
Have been reading HP fanfics for a couple of years now and there are still so many gems to explore. Saw a recommendation on the sub for "Grow Young With Me" and just finished it. Looking for some more gems. I tend to prefer longer fics but any fic with great writing would be appreciated.

Thanks a lot.


** Ah, Grow Young With Me is such an excellent example of a story that /really needs a better summary/...

The linkffn(Innocent) series has a summary that's not especially misleading, but is very insufficient to really describe it. The first book is half a million words, and the series is over a million and still actively updating. Sirius escapes from Azkaban early and raises Harry. No secret Black family magic, no Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-British, no character bashing, but lots of heartwarming scenes of Harry getting a parental figure and at least a few years of a childhood - albeit in sometimes stressful circumstances, as the country searches for the "kidnapped" Boy-Who-Lived, and their efforts to clean out Grimmauld Place put them on a collision course with the Locket and the dark magic protecting it. The following books are at Hogwarts, following some canon stations but with many events accelerated or otherwise altered.

And the summary for linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) is reasonably accurate, but undersells it. Yes, it's a female Harry in a situation comparable to Alanna the Lioness, but the author has not simply blended the two stories. It's a whole new story of its own, with the identity swap being merely a jumping off point, and it keeps revealing more and more depth as it continues. The main character is powerful and skilled enough to make for interesting times, but that power always comes with a price; high magic reserves make for poor control, drawing attention puts pressure on the pretense, and gaining influence means that more powerful people will try in turn to influence you. It's been a few months since the last update, but I think that's mostly because the author writes /mammoth/ chapters, 20-30k words or sometimes even more.

*** People really don't recommend Pureblood Pretense the right way. I put off reading it for two years because I thought it was going to be some slice-of-lifey fluff about fem!Harry dealing with living with boys. Absolutely not that. It's got some of the most intricate worldbuilding I've seen, period, delightful characters, politics actually done well, suspense every chapter...highly recommended.

**** I was quite impressed with the recent reveal that Riddle is trying to battle the Fade while maintaining his own prejudices, deceiving both his allies and opponents to bring about a result that's bigoted but actually does save the world. That's a quality antagonist.

***** The whole point of divergence of him gaining prominence in politics rather than through terrorism is brilliant and should be what's in the summary. It's really a different wizarding society just because of that, where the classism is more systemic than overt and so many aspects of that are explored.

** Linkffn(The Half-Blood Romantic) Never read a better Fleur characterisation. This has no unrealistic elements. Fleur doesn't appear as a demure damsel in distress. It's an amazing read and definitely the best (though that doesn't mean much) H/F pairing I've read.

** Fortunately, there are indeed some gems out there, and a variety of them. Pick what floats your boat.

*Stygian Trilogy* by Slide. Adventure next-gen trilogy with a dash of romance. Lots of globetrotting and historical nods in the second and third books. Long (700,000 words).

*Alexandra Quick* by Inverarity. Debatably a fanfic. No canon characters. Brash Americana. A bildungsroman of a precocious, annoying, impulsive teenager. Five books complete (~1,300,000 words), sixth in progress.

*Forging the Sword* by Myst Shadow. Minimalist mastery. Everything stems from a single divergence. A better-than-canon interpretation of Ron Weasley. Incomplete (170,000 words) but worth reading.

*The Accidental Animagus* by White Squirrel. A soap opera with terrifying villains. A sibling relationship between Harry and Hermione. A cat animagus Harry. Complete through four years, fifth year in progress (600,000 words)

*Victoria Potter* by Taure. Polished. Precise. Compact. Creative. An intricately slightly AU retelling of canon, with the divergence that Harry is a girl. Second year in progress (180,000 words)

*The Pureblood Pretense* by murkybluematter. As someone else said, avoid the summary. This series has it all. Mystery, magic, duels, politics, pranks. Cap it off with great writing and execution. Complete through three years, fourth year in progress (a stunning 1,300,000 words).

There are of course more, but I'll leave you with these...linkffn(Ignite by Slide; Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle; Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow, The Accidental Animagus, Victoria Potter, The Pureblood Pretense)
