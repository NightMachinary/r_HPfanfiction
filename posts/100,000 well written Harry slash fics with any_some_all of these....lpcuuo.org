Looking for long good reads that I hopefully haven't read already. I want Slytherin or Ravenclaw Harry who meets and befriends Draco, Blaise, or Theo. I'll admit I love Harry befriending Draco early and breaking him of his whining spoiled attituded.

I love Mentor Snape fics that give Snape more character then just angry and bitter.

Love manipulative/bad/evil Dumbledore as well good or sane Voldemort. I always pictured him more smart and charming then he appeared. After all we are told how smart he was and ho he had every one thinking he was perfect and charming, then he pops up and is all vile and cruel and nothing like I imagined.

umm Sirius/Remus either as a couple or just close, either way I prefer them supporting Harry even if he goes dark/gray.

I would love to read a fic where Lily or James (or both, or L,J,R,&,S) where dark and followers of Voldemort, but it was covered up and Harry only finds out the truth later.

Harry making allies or taking an interest in politics.

Please no Harry being insanely smart and over throwing the government at 11. I love smart Harry but I prefer them more realistic with him gradually building up his allies and resources before doing anything drastic.

Love slowburn, enemies to lovers (Harry/.Tom), Friends to lovers (Draco/Harry, Blaise/Harry, Theo/Harry, or Harry/ Weasley twins. okay with Bill or Charlies as well. money stealing plotting Weasleys is fine as are goblins fixing everything lol. Idk I like drama and angst as well Dark/Gray characters not taking anyone's crap.

Yes this crossposted in several Harry Potter Fic communities.


** Train to Nowhere hits many of those.

Harry isn't a slytherin but is in Durmstrang, everyone is pretty dark arts oriented since is an AU where Voldemort won the war.

Harry is pretty dark in a number of ways.

Voldemort is not good but he is charming and sane and an effective ruler. and the main character along with Harry.

Harry knows Draco since childhood and he meets the rest of the slytherins but they are not very close.

Harry slowly turns super political and little by little start to plan his own resistance. This is very well managed and realistic. No 11 y/o Harry taking over the world.

Lily and James are dark Lord followers.

There is Sirius-remus interaction but is a bit unusual. Remus is super supportive of Harry though.

And is an extremely slowburn Tomarry

The world building is excellent and the writing is great quality.

** The site Potions and Snitches has more mentor Snape stories than you can ever read. The whole purpose of the site is Snape being a mentor/father figure to Harry (no slash). I used to go there all the time when I was writing a Snape adopts Harry fic, and they're still active. Their kudo system is chocolate frogs. Sort by chocolate frogs. üê∏üê∏üê∏
