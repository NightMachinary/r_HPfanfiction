It's that time of year again. There's a cool crisp in the air, a crunch underfoot, and seasonal depression welcomes me back with open arms. In an attempt to forestall this, please give me good fics to read. Old or new, long or short, stunningly AU or a familiar retread of canon. Doesn't even matter if it's an OC fic, really. Could even be a Time Travel AU/SI power fantasy about a grimdark edgelord with far too many synonyms for "cool" in his descriptors.

Just looking to stock up on things to read, so please give me your favorites, your honorable mentions, and even just the fics that you think are alright.

​

My only "deal breakers" are:

- Draco/Harry, Draco/Hermione, Draco/Ginny, etc
- Snape/Harry, Snape/Hermione, etc.
- Voldemort/Harry, Voldemort/Hermione, etc.
- Future-Kids-Era
- /Edit: My Immortal/


** In all seriousness though - linkffn(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) is consistently updating on Spacebattles (and regularly copied over to FFN), and is pretty awesome. An SI with none of the usual SI bullshit. It gets rec'd here pretty often so you may have already seen it.

I've also come across linkffn(Weasley Girl) which is a well-done "What if Ron was a girl?" fic. Ron's (Ronnie's) character is not changed much, and IIRC none of the other characters felt OOC, but the few changes butterfly outward so it's not just a canon rehash.

By the same author, linkffn(One-Eighth Of A Chance) is an awesome oneshot if you like Discworld.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

And I never see this recced except when I do it - which I don't understand because I'm very fond of it ( surely there are others who love it as much?) It's a graphic novel that's very lo-fi and just perfect in tone. [[http://emilymcgovern.com/category/my-life-as-a-background-slytherin/]]

** My favourite fic of all time - linkffn(Protection From Nargles). Really sweet and fluffy, my favourite pairing in Harry/Luna and no bashing. Just wholesome af. Honourable mention goes to the sequel linkffn(Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor). Sadly incomplete and likely abandoned, which is a real shame.

Changing vibes completely from light fluffy romance, we have linkAo3(834125). Insanely dark and quite gory horror. It's a long-ish (10k words) oneshot but so worth the read, and deeply chilling.

  A fire burns deep within Iris Potter, and such things must be tempered --- even if it's with Albus Dumbledore's idea of education and guidance. After a disastrous end to a school year, the two find themselves tangling with old enemies, eldritch magic, time travel, and that which should have perhaps been left well alone. Morally gray fem!Harry, mentor!Dumbledore.

Harry/Fleur (otherwise known as "Flowerpot") is my OTP, and I have a veritable library of fics in that pairing (40 in all) and I felt like sharing them.

Before any other Fic is recommended, here is one of my favorites. It was taken down from Fanfiction.net and now only exists in this archive. It is a miracle, lightning in a bottle, a blend of the absurd humor of a crack fic with the literary skill of Shakespeare. It is without doubt worth a full read.

[[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_fleur/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]

Before I begin, please know this. Not all these fics are complete. Not all these fics are long, not all these fics are short, not all these fics are recent or even good. What they are, is a record. A history written in other people's words, a history of the love and passion of a single person for Harry Potter manifesting itself in a way familiar to all of Us here. This is my OTP. Starting with my all time favorite fic in the HP fandom.

** I'll suggest you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12311767/1/Noctilucent][Noctilucent]] by: You Talk Like A dentist. It's a crossover with John Wick and it's pretty well written.

If I had to suggest a second, it'd be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10669803/1/Vulpine-Wizard][Vulpine Wizard]] By: SmilingJester. it's an interesting crossover with the Fallout Franchise.

I've also liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11863465/1/Lord-of-the-Wind][Lord Of the Wind]] Where he becomes a Phoenix animagus at 9 and appears at Hogwarts, and is cared for by Snape, It doesn't pair him with Snape.

** Some of my go to ones are:

linkffn(The Changeling): The character development, world building, and overall writing quality of this fic make it awesome. Ginny's separation from the trio is also nice because it really allows her perception and her journey to be the focus. There's also an amazing follow up series.

linkffn(A Keen Observer): This is kind of similar to "The Changeling" because it follows Andromeda throughout her time at Hogwarts. Amazing character development and writing quality, but the interactions between the characters makes this one stand out.

linkffn(The Aurors): This is probably the one that is most "fall-like" to me because it's a mystery/detective story. The OC, Theia, is a delightful character to follow, and I love how unique her world view is when compared to other characters in HP because she's a half-blood. There's an amazing completed sequel, and the third book just started. As a warning though, it definitely has dark moments.

linkffn(Dudley's Memories): This, and the rest of the "Memories" series, is delightful. Even though Dudley is a lot different to how he is in the book, he still is how I would imagine a better Dudley to be. The follow up stories of "Snape's Memories" and "Severus' Dream" continue the universe this story establishes and I love them just as much.

linkffn(Remember Remember): This is such a great, bittersweet story. The next-gen elements aren't heavy because the focus is on Harry, Snape, and their relationship. Is a very healing story for me because of its emphasis on growing after a family trauma, but seeing Ginny in that state really hurts.

linkffn(Moment of Impact): Snape mentoring Harry is one of my favorite tropes because of this book and this series. It doesn't start off with the best writing and there's some weaker, cliche plot points that thankfully don't get followed up on, but I think those are worth it for the amazing development in Harry and Snape. Also, no Dumbledore bashing!

linkffn(The Jumper Chronicles): No idea if you like Sherlock or crossovers, but this story is outstanding. Its premise of combing John Watson and Remus actually works out really well and gives depth to two characters who deserve the spotlight.

linkffn(The Magic of Torchwood): Another crossover, but this is with the "Doctor Who" spinoff, "Torchwood." At first, it seems like a pretty basic crossover fic where the team gets sucked into the world, gets sorted, and gets pulled into the PoA, but it quickly becomes so much more as things change and twist to the world. The writing, characters, and humor makes this an incredibly fast-paced read. I hope the author finishes it.

linkffn(Only A Boy): Yet another crossover with another different show, "Merlin." There are a lot of crossovers between these two, but this one is my favorite. It stands out with amazing writing and characters, but its uniqueness comes from it being an AU. While Merlin does fill the role of Harry, it's done in such a way that nothing feels like an exact copy of the books.

linkffn(The Summer of the Phoenix): This is my "I didn't know I wanted this until I read it" story. There's humor, there's realistic characters, and it has a perfectly balanced pace.

linkffn(Wag the Dog): Percy is a neglected character in the fandom, so having an entire book be dedicated to his heroism during DH is awesome; the heroism being completely in character for Percy just makes it even better. As another fairly neglected character, following Arthur as he tries to find out what happened to his son during and after DH makes this story take on a bit of a detective flair.

linkffn(94926)

linkffn(457489) -- very old. two sequels. Complete.

A Fairy Tale Ending by BJH [[https://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story/1783/]]

The Letters of Summer by Kokopelli Summer after 5th year - Harry gets his act together with a little help from some friends. A/U to HBP. (Complete -- Harry/Ginny. This has one of the best OC's i've ever seen in the character of Jasmine.) [[https://kokopelli.nsns.fanficauthors.net/The_Letters_of_Summer/index/]]

========== ========= ========== ==========

Here are some newer ones:

linkffn(5604382) -- I like a lot of what this author writes. Nothing epic, but lots of fun stories.

linkffn(9631998) -- complete, also two sequels complete

linkffn(13113518) -- seriously A/U, and a bit smutty.

linkffn(7548963)

linkffn(7382549)

linkffn(2919503)

linkffn(7591040) -- Pern crossover. two sequels, but will sadly never be completed due to author death

linkffn(11577249) -- Star Wars crossover -- VERY little to do with HP, but fun, and ridiculously long. WIP.

By Right of Conquest by Kokopelli "Magic is all about intent, but sometimes ritual carries its own message. After Voldemort's killing curse rebounds on him, Harry picks up Voldemort's yew and phoenix feather wand - and ends up inheriting everything Tom Riddle owns, by right of conquest."

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so.

And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

** More people need to read linkffn(Rebuilding Life) by kezzabear. It's probably the closest thing we will ever get to an official Book 8. Characters are concrete and feel like they are taken straight from JK's pen, there's an accurate depiction of the postwar reality and recovery, and Harry and Ginny's relationship grows and matures in believable ways. Not to mention this fic contains one of my favorite scenes in probably all of fan fiction. I laughed, cheered, cried, and more. Read it.

I really enjoy the ongoing Harry Black series by AuthorK. It's a Harry/Daphne fic where Harry had been taken by Sirius instead of given to Hagrid. Harry returns for his 3rd year and progresses from there. He's not overpowered!Harry but definitely has a leg up magically. But the real treat are the character interactions themselves. There's a diverse cast and a multitude of plotlines woven together. The sequel is currently underway at a fairly frequent update schedule as well. linkffn(Harry Black Book 1: The Hero's Return) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13319565/1/Harry-Black-Book-1-The-Hero-s-Return]]

Remember is another example of a Soul-Bond fic but it's one of the few that I feel pulls it off successfully. Ginny is sent to France after the events in the Chamber but when Harry arrives in the country they keep being drawn to each other. In addition to the romance there's an actual mystery for the main cast to unravel as a Memory Charm was applied to people post-Chamber as well. All in all, a very good read. (EDIT: copying link because the bot got bamboozled) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4936039/1/Remember]]

I have more if you'd like some! :D

** I seriously keep a tab open for Meaning of One by Sovran because I love it so much and I want to share it with everyone.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a Hinny Soul Bond fic starting from Harry's first time on Platform 9 & 3/4. Only PS/SS and CoS are done but it is still highly worth reading.

The Bond itself establishes itself and how it works very quickly, and doesn't do anything to change it suddenly. It properly and maturely explores what it would be like for Harry and Ginny to share /everything/ between them, and the reactions of family and friends.

The characterisations feel ripped straight from the books. It's tense, heartbreaking, heartwarming, exciting, and seriously the best HP fic I've read so far. Nearly 600,000 words of pure goodness.

I absolutely love this fic, I really do.

** I've got a classic that you might have head of and some others I've found interesting and haven't seen recommended too often.

linkffn(Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot) It's where Harry finds out about the prophecy and figured he's not going to survive. So he decides to take a vacation and live a little before he dies.

linkffn(A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking' by Bakuraptor) Is mostly about the concept of sperm banks and trying to get more muggleborn witches and wizards born through replacing muggle sperm bank stocks with a magical person's sperm.

linkffn(The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl) Ron-centric time travel/dimension travel fic. Ron has some of his adult memories but has a lot of blanks. He's actually pretty cool and is trying to make things right. It's incomplete and the author hasn't updated since last year, but I still have hope. It's well worth the read even if it's not completed.

linkffn(Strangers in Bars by Whispering Darkness) It's an HP/Avemgers crossover with only 4 chapters. It's super cute, just showing the different interactions Harry has with those he meets.

linkffn(The Rise of a Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda) This is one of my favorites. Quite well written too. It's a dark!Harry story as one might have guess from the title. He ends up gathering quite the following of friends that are actually friends unlike Voldemort's followers. It is Tom/Harry, not my favorite pairing either, but I feel like it doesn't really focus on it too much and is easily skippable. I mostly enjoyed his interactions with his friends.

Last one! linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale) I've read this one a couple times when I'm between stories and whatnot. It's sort of time travel, Hermione-centric story taking place in the Marauder's era. She's James Potter's twin sister and she's as brilliant as Hermione should be, trying to prevent the war in the future from happening. I love most long stories written by MaryRoyale, so if you like Hermione-centric stories you might just want to check her out.

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.

  Harriet Potter died at one year old. What was left of her slogged through life, alive in body and mind but not soul. Six years later she was finally cremated. This is not the story of Harriet Potter. This is the story of the brilliant flame who inherited her place, and her journey in the strange world of humans.*****Harriet is trapped, surrounded by humans, and painfully easy to extinguish if she doesn't keep her flames hidden. After the Dursleys, Hogwarts is a step up for her, but now she has to unravel the mysteries surrounding the body she stole and fight to survive against a monster who may be even less human than she is.One by one, Harriet's friends will find that they are playing with fire, and the price of failure is greater than they ever could have known.
