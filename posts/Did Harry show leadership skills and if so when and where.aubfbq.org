My entire canon knowledge is pretty useless when I'm sleep-deprived for the better part of a week now and I had this thought.

Dumbledore says Harry was thrust into leadership. But I see him more as the lone wolf type of guy. I might be wrong of course. What does canon show of Harry's leadership?

EDIT: Alright. Other than him being Quidditch Captain and leading the DA, I'm talking about his core values. A leader should be someone who can rally people together, be decisive, assertive, delegate tasks, and know when to ask for help.

Are there any individual instances when any of these traits or related ones shined through in his characterization?


** One of my favorite moments for Harry is in OotP when they're surrounded by death eaters, and I think it shows pretty well how he takes the lead. In the DoM, everyone ends up physically behind him when the death eaters show themselves. When death eaters try to grab Ginny, he steps in front of her and redirects the attention of the death eaters. He comes up with a plan of escaping and communicates it to the others while holding a distracting conversation with Lucius. He gives the signal for their escape. Neville and Hermione clearly look to him for leadership while they're trying to stay ahead of the death eaters.

*** Thanks, this is kind of what I've been looking for. Though Harry might lack in some skills, he's brimming with courage and a willingness to do what's right.

He might not be a typical leader, but he is a leader nonetheless.

** He was a leader by nature : remember in Deathly Hallows when the golden trio went to the Ministry to steal the Horcrux : at the end everything was messed up so Harry made the Patronus Charm and led the group of muggleborns to save them. He was the leader of the group without even asking or thinking about it.

** He has the skills, as he demonstrates with the D.A., but he doesn't want to be a leader, because he hates endangering others on his behalf.

I imagine that once he's Head Auror, he still picks the most dangerous missions for himself, driving his friends and family mad.

Usually, the head of a police force or military is a desk job. The days of leading from the front are over.

******* Which was the reason Voldemort had a puppet to run things.

Can you imagine the Dark Lord filling out forms and having to redo them all the time because he lost his temper and smote the form for the fourth time?

** Just shared this in on another post but it applies here as well. It all boils down to this quote near the end of OOTP.

“It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew - and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents - that there was all the difference in the world.”

He has, at his core, the values from the beginning but comes into his own in embracing it at the end of GOF, standing up to face Voldemort in the graveyard. Dumbledore's actions regarding Harry as well as his youth effectively stunted his ability to develop some of the skills (being assertive, delegating tasks, etc.) you cite during his first four years but they start coming out with the DA in OOTP.

As far as rallying people together the final battle at Hogwarts is the perfect embodiment of this. Voldemort trotted out his body to humiliate and destroy the morale of the resistance. It only served as a rallying point to those who had been influenced and inspired by Harry during his time at school.

Harry is reluctant but in the end he is a far better leader than Voldemort.

** Year one when he gives his mini speech about why stopping Voldemort is worth risking expulsion is the only time I can think of where he actively motivates others to follow him.
