** Sinyk is pretty similar to Robst in the sorts of plots he has, but he doesn't the writing skill that carries Robst's fics to readable levels. His fic "Harry Potter and the Daft Morons", in particular, feels like an angrier, less literate Robst wrote it. It's coincidentally one of the few fics I couldn't get myself to finish reading, along with Harry Crow and a few select others.

I get that you're looking for this sort of fics, but I'd feel bad if I didn't point out that there's a lot of better authors out there.

** I don't like him much for the same reasons, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/616007/old-crow]] is more or less the same as robst in my books.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5]].

**** I didn't mean it that bad ... all three of them have some good stories (“Harry Potter and the Lady Thief” and “Democracy” are unquestionably good ones), all of them are hard-core Harmony fans (which, just to be clear on this, is not a bad thing /per se/), all three of them had unfortunate tendency to fall for bashing and schematic stereotypes. For robst and old-crow it is difficult to be too hard on them for falling into stereotypes, when they invented most of them.
