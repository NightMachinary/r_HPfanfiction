:END:
I don't remember a lot of it just that everyone knew what Harry did was impossible except Harry himself. They just told him to try something and he did it becouse he didn't know it was supossed to be impossible.

it was probably a humor/crack OP Harry story, I think a one-shot or short story but I'm not too sure.


** I think it's a Jeconais fic called "This means war".

** I remember this being a big plot point in a Harry/Ginny/Luna menage a trois fic where wizards had an Instant-Messenger/Email system with parchment, does that sound familiar?
