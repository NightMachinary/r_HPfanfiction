I've read some dark and depressing stories lately and I would love recommendations for something fluffy with that pairing. I don't mind if it's OOC but the writing needs to be good. It doesn't have to be great. It doesn't even have to be realistic, but the story has to be believable if that makes sense. Snape can be a unicorn for all I care if he is a damn convincing unicorn. I just want some light stories that will make me smile. I would especially love something not on FFnet because that tends to be my go-to so there is a higher chance of me reading it already if it's from that site, especially in the Mature rating.


** That's a tough one! I don't generally /do/ fluff where these two are concerned, but I'll dig around in my favorites and see if I read a fluff piece by mistake somewhere. ;) On the flip side, were you reading something dark that was SSHG (and if so, what was it? lol)?

*** It was actually a dark Hermione/Antonin Dolohov story. I decided to switch things up a little bit. I highly recommend it though!

Voldemort promised Hermione as a war prize to Antonin Dolohov for his bravery and loyalty following the Dark Lord's victory over Harry Potter. On the run for almost a year, when she is finally captured by the Death Eater she learns not everything in a postwar world is black or white.

** One-shot scene; cute and funny. [A Little Hope: Severus has had a long night; life doesn't get much better when he finds someone sleeping in his bed.] [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=15469]]

I'd consider this one humor/parody more than fluff, sort of reminds me of Bridget Jones' Diary. [Revenge of a Hermione Scorned: Stuck in a rut at Hogwarts, Hermione Granger overhears some less than flattering remarks made about her by a certain Potions Master. Overreacting, she seeks her revenge in the art of seduction. Penguins, bitterness, and much irrelevance follows. Revenge is a dish best served cold. In bed. With chocolate sauce.] [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=13156&i=1]]

**** I think it is the perfect story for what you asked for! It has some wonderful /awwwwhs/ without diverging (much) from their canon characteristics. Let me know what you think! :D

** Bundle of Joy? I love the partial epistolary style and all the fluffy goodness. Another Dream tops the fluffy charts as well.

I think one of my favorite, non-dark, not on ffn/ao3 is Frogs in Winter... It is honestly a smutty, fluffy explosion of ridiculousness, but if Snape talking dirty is of interest, take a moment to read this short one. [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=8602]]
