It was a long one-shot set during the Marauder's era; Voldemort is "good" and is the DADA professor and goes Prof. Gaunt. Remus comes to ask him about Horcruxes because of something Snape said and it's revealed that Tom still struggles with a fascination for the Dark Arts. I can't for the life of me remember what it's called, but I'm fairly certain it was posted to either LJ or IJ.
