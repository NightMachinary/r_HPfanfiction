I noticed Hawthorne & Vine is down, and I'm looking for epub files from there, specifically, everythursday's fanfiction. Any help is appreciated!


** [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xFIuty-3AMtuLv3gs14acto2EzNREGJD][Here are all everythursday's fics.]]

If there are any other specific Dramione fics you're looking for, email “bibliophile1030 at gmail dot com” and ask if they have them for you. They're the admins over on the lostdhrfics tumblr.

Alternatively, request to be added to the facebook group “Dramione Fanfic Recommendations”. They archive fics that have been taken offline in their group files.
