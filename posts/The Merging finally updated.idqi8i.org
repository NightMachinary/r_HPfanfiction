** I don't remember what the story is about but I got an email notification for it. It must have been interesting if I set up an alert system for it before. Could someone please give a brief summary and use the black-out function to hide the spoilers?

If you write something in between >! Something !< (without the spaces, of course) it will appear like this: Something

*** Harry absorbs Tom's Horcruxes and starts gaining power. Sounds silly, but is well done, has some great action scenes and some humour, too

*** I don't know how to explain without spoilers... it's a great read however and thoroughly recommend it, I had long given this up as abandoned right at the crux. Thankfully this update ties up majority of the loose ends and I feel satisfied now after 2 years. I would say only an epilogue chapter is left and if it doesn't come, it won't detract from the story.

**** Haha, people seem really excited about it, so I guess I'll save it and give it a go later.

What about the genre? Or like... tropes. Is it some kind of slice of life, or canon rehash, or adventure or something?

** Well, I'll see you all never, when this is completed.

Lmao don't get your hopes up people. I can't tell you how many stories updated with promises of being back to weekly/monthly updates this year, which have ALL already stopped updating after that first "Im back" bullshit.

This guy never completes stories. Cry some more.
