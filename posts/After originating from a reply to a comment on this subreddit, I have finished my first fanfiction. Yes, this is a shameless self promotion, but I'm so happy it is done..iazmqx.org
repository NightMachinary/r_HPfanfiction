It's only 15k words and is essentially a satirical representation of as many tropes as possible, but it's mine, and it is complete!

'Good Severus Snape', 'Severus Snape Has a Heart', 'Bad Severus Snape', 'Evil Severus Snape'

If that's not intriguing, I don't know what is.

** That was pretty good, I especially liked the constant breaking of the fourth wall. Even though it's a parody but I do find it a little bit excessive that 3388 of those words are "Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell" (and yes I saw the note about padding the wordcount, I actually really liked that note)

*** Thanks! I originally thought the 3.3k number was an exaggeration, but after a CTRL+F and some mental maths, it is indeed correct. Thinking about it now, it is rather excessive, however I'd say ‚Äòexcessive' is this fic's middle name.

All the beautiful ‚Ñ¢s~

I adored varius variations of the names of bashed characters. It wasn't always easy to tell if you mean them as Dumbledore or Voldemort and, in one memorable moment, if it's Dumbledore or Umbridge xD (but I don't think that /it mattered for the plot ah well xP/)

***** I agree‚Ñ¢. To both. But once while reading:

- I was convinced Dumbledore attacked Harry at Wizengamot and then realized it was Voldemort all along

- I got heart arrhythmia when I through chapter 5 is a ship of Umbridge x Dumbledore

- I through that Dumbledore wants Grindelward to duel Harry and I was very confused where the f did he came from (spoiler: it was also Voldemort)

Everyone of those is great in it's own right and I got really into them but it lead to many disappointments :'D

*** Everyone must be reminded of Lord Hadrian Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Ravenclaw Hufflepuff Peverell's immense power on a regular basis! But without copy/paste, I'd say it's possible (albeit barely), but would add about a decade to the writing time. Also depends on if my shift key could survive that long lmao.

** OP, I have to say, I think the only thing that could possibly make your fic any better is if Draco (and possibly Crabbe and Goyle) used some mixture of potions and rituals to become girls so they too could bask in Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Gaunt Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Peverell's affections. Because I seriously think that's the only trope you didn't use.
