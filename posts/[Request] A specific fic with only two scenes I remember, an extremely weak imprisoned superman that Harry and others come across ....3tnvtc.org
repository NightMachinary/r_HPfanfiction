Okay, I really don't remember much of it, but for two scenes.

The first if I remember correctly Harry Potter and... I want to say some xmen? It's a multicross over I think, it may even be a harlem fic but I'm not sure.

Anyway, Harry at least comes across a military compound of /some/ sort, and comes across a teen that looks super skinny, just skin and bones near literally, shackled in a cell, pretty sure there was red light as well- red sun lamps- one of superman's weaknesses, Harry Rescues him from the prison, trying to explain that he/they are friends. After the breakout the mysterious extremely weakened teen in a ..silvery suit? flies away.

--------------

The next scene I remember is.. weeks? Months? later that during a war of some kind which Harry is involved in, the silver dude is back, this time for sure in a silver superman suit, and wreaks havoc on the bad guys before getting killed himself in order to save his first and only friends.

--------------

Those two scenes were an extremely minor part of the overall fanfic but really stuck with me and I've been craving to reread it.

Edit: Oh, and in that world/fic, Kal-el was taken by the military along with his ship just as soon as he landed or close to it, no Superman, no justice league either I think..


** Wait. Someome did a Flashpoint crossover? I need this.
