I'm not very good at naming.

- Nevaeh Storm - Half-blood, Harry's generation.
- Magnus and Katarina Hall - Magnus is half-blood, Katarina is Muggle-born. Marauders' generation.
- Augustus Ivymar - still undecided background.
- Kayarose Goldleaf - Half-blood, Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Marie Noverre (pronounced no-Vay) - Half-blood, 1/4 Veela. Close in age to Teddy Lupin.
- Adalina and Sylvan Berrycloth - Pure-blood. Harry's generation.
- Acanthus Briarwood - Still undecided background.
- Holly Everhill - Pureblood. 8 years older than the Marauders.
- Maia Gliese - Muggle-born. Hard to say she's from Albus and Scorpius' generation, as she is noticeably younger than them.
- Iris and Cadmus Everett - Unknown blood status. Iris is 9 years older than the Golden Trio, Cadmus is two years younger than her.
- Sal Azurely (Sal is short for Salvia. They're Non-binary.)
- Valerie Lake - Muggle-born. Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Luna Tansy Gaunt - Pure-blood. Marauders' generation.
- Phoenix and Arya Waters - Half-blood or pure-blood, what to say if one parent is a Squib from a pureblood family and the other is pureblood? Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Aurora Moonstille (later Black) - Pure-blood. Four years younger than the Marauders.
- Mintaka and Rigel Black - Pure-blood. Maya Gliese's age.
- Clover and Camille Aure - Half-blood. Clover is a Squib.
- Jasmine and Adam Starflower - Half-blood. Marauders' generation.
- Natalia Wells - Muggle-born. Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Kiara Anderson - Muggle. Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Cassius, needshelpwithalastname! Half-blood. Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Alisander Ross - Pure-blood. Albus and Scorpius' generation.
- Arnica and Celeste Lestrange - Pure-blood. Arnica is from the Marauders' generation. Celeste is from Albus and Scorpius' generation.

*** I didn't intend Holly and Penelope to be related, I completely forgot about her!

There are scenes set in America, that is when Nevaeh and Kayarose are seen. Sorry about not clarifying that bit.

Yes, I understand it's a bit weird. I'm a bit weird. Sadly, Iamcompletelyattachedtothischaracter'sname.

I didn't realize, <(O.O)>

***** Thanks!

Will go change Holly's last name now, as she must be either Half-blood or Pure-blood.

** As long as YOU like them for your story, then that's all that matters!

However, if you want help with names, might I suggest BehindTheName.com? They have a great search filter by regional area, biblical, mythology, and pop culture -- I've been using it as my covid project is creating a MASSIVE Sacred-28 family tree that ties all pure blood families together. (Mostly for fun and my own sense of mind with my stories)

Another great thing about the website is, at the bottom, there is a tie-in website called BehindTheSurname, which gives you popular last names by region. That might help if you're going to use very regional names like Magnus or Katarina, for example, or you want to be ethnically correct and not pull a Cho Chang. ðŸ˜¬

There's also a random name generator!

** I mean... for who? Like, a child of the Black Family might be named 'Rigel Black' and that'd 'fit', but it'd be an odd name for a Muggleborn Northern Lad born in the 80s or a tribal kid from a rural village in Zimbabwe.

If you just want opinions on how the names sound, then they almost all sound like animals from the Redwall book series, but in terms of how they might fit or if they sound right, then there's not much to say without knowing what character is attached to them - are these people Magic Raised, Muggle Raised; born in the 1800s, 1980s, 2030s; born in the UK, born in America, France, Germany, Indonesia, etc.

**** I'd recommend also adding nationality/place of origin/cultural background. It does make a difference. It'd be perfectly fine to meet an American named 'Gabe Fortune', but that would be very out of place in England, for example, and the likelihood of meeting a Russian named 'Sinead O'Connor' is quite low.

Also, is Kayarose a single name or is there supposed to be a dash in there? Like 'Kaya-Rose' or 'Anne-Marie'? I've never heard the name before.

** This reads like a list of edgy teenagers who chose their own names. I guess it's fine. Don't know why saliva is specifically mentioned as enbie but whatever makes you happy, it's your writing and your list of names.
