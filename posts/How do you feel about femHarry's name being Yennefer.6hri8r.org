** The fuck kind of name is Yennefer?

Out of that list, the least offensive would probably be Evelyn. Sure, it doesn't have the flower name theme (but I hate flower names, so whatever), but it doesn't feel like a wish fulfillment name or utter nonsense.

I apologize to all Yennefers I have offended with this post. But not to their parents.

*** yennefer, i think, is some form of juniper, which goes with the flower theme. so it kinda makes sense.

** Yennefer sounds like someone who would grow up to change their name.

Like, the story should have an entire chapter related to the name change ritual.

** Evelyn or Iris are good.

The rest are kind of meh (Alya) and no (Melania, Yennefer, and Lily)

** Most names given to fem!Harry either don't have the same "feel" that Harry does for me (ordinary name, classic, simple). They're easier to remember when they start with an "H" -- Holly, Harriett, Henrietta. The one name I'll give a pass to is Violet since it has the right "feel."

But, out of your list given, I'd go with Iris. It's not bound to confuse people like Lily is and it's a classic name, if a bit rare.

***** Yes. She gets tossed into Middle Earth. I felt that Yennefer would work there. Perhaps I'll go with Evelyn. Who knows. Find and Replace will fix it lol

** I'm not okay with Yennefer, Evelyn, or Alya. None of those seem like something Lily and James would name thier daughter. Iris is much more realistic, Lily would kinda be sweet, and Evelyn would be okay.
