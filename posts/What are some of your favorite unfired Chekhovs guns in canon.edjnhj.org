JKR famously throws out details for fun and then went back through them later to retroactively make some of them into foreshadowing, eg, the necklace that almost killed Katie was introduced in book 2.

What are some details you noticed that might have been able to be used for major plot points that weren't?

The Flame Freezing charm introduced in Harry's history of magic homework in PoA really seems like it should have come up again later. Harry even fights a dragon one book later! Seems a pretty natural precaution to take if you're about to fight one.

There is a /bit/ of magic-of-writing going on in the books - the Monster Book of Monsters grows teeth and tries to bite the reader, and the book of Invisibility tends to up and vanish - so it's not too great a stretch to think that Ancient Runes might be a foundation course that might let you learn to do that later once you've learned the language well enough to be magical in it.

**** In between books 6 and 7 I was a part of an online forum dedicated to collecting evidence that Dumbledore was alive. This was one of the biggest pieces of evidence. Snape and Lockharts duel in second year was considered supporting evidence, as Expelliarmus is just supposed to, you know, disarm, but it sent Lockhart flying backwards. It really felt like Like Snape was capable of "casting" one spell verbally while another one silently. How much of Book 6 was focused on silent casting felt like foreshadowing, as did the focus on Snapes ability to create spells. Could he not have created a spell to flash green light and launch someone forward for casting silently and only said the incantation for the killing curse? Could that spell also be a switching charm that spelled the contents of a vial of the draught of living death into the stomach of the target, rendering them in a state almost the same as death (a potion foreshadowed as important in the same scene as relevant potions Amortentia and Felix Felicis)? Would not such an ability have allowed Snape to continue as a spy without compromising whatever level of moral integrity he had found through continued killing?

I think in the end, before Deathly Hallows was released we had collected some 80 pieces of evidence, most were applicable in this thread. Chekhov's Guns that we believed to have been fired in faking Dumbledores death, but were actually discarded

Since the locket itself was a fake, Dumbledore actually died, everything went to shit and Snape fell apart.

** I don't think it was retroactive, Chamber and Half Blood Prince are designed as parellel books. The reveals in Half Blood Prince were even considered for reveal in Chamber.

So I suspect Borgin and Burkes was introduced in Chamber /because/ of the large role it would play in Half Blood Prince. In fact, even the Vanishing Cabinet is introduced there.

Personally, the Ford Anglia whilst returning to save Ron and Harry from Aragog, I thought would make another appearance later on. It never did. Also the amount of times Goblin Revolutions were mentioned in their history classes you'd think it would come to something.

*** Agreed about the Goblins. Which just speaks to JK Rowlings treatment of them. She gives us a friendly werewolf, socially passable vampires to the point where candy stores sell blood lollipops, a friendly half giant and his brother, as well as anthropologically understandable Giant culture, proud but eventually helpful Centaurs, interesting merfolk, and most importantly house elves. All of these creatures she gives at least some unique characterization too or redeeming qualities, but Goblins she sticks to the stereotype.

Goblins have no redeeming qualities in the books, there is no positive interactions with them. Hagrid calls them unpleasant, Binns enjoys telling people how horrible they are so much that he wasnt willing to stop when he died, Bill doesnt like them and he works for them. The only insights given to them are that the rebellions are because wizards wont let them have wands, and that they have a different view on property rights. The first is never addressed as being a bad thing, not even by Hermione, champion of House Elf Rights, and the second is folded into their greed when Griphook tries to steal the sword.

It would make more sense if JK had gone with a Tolkein inspired goblin interpretation where they lived under ground and were all around bad guys with no redeeming qualities. But she (intentionally or not, that's for another post) went with the Jewish caricature interpretation, giving them only negative attributes and yet putting them in control of the banking system. Not a good look.

I would love to see more fics properly exploring Goblins, but the tropes of Harry Crow and the likes have turned a lot of the fandom off of any interpretation of Goblins other than nasty awful bankers.

- Unspeakables - You are a participant of a prophecy against a Dark Lord who has multiple horcruxes? And there's this nifty Department that researches esoteric magic? Why didn't they go there to ask?
- Chamber of Secrets - They go down there twice. Not really searching it either time. There could have been other cool stuff down there. Like Slytherin's personal library, or painting or something.
- Harry's blood - He has basilisk venom and phoenix tears in his blood. That has to have had some effect on his body. Faster healing, becoming poisonous. Something! Hell, he probably could have injected his blood into his brain or something to do with the Blood Brain Barrier and destroyed his horcrux that way.
- Veil of Death - After Sirius, that seemed like it would be the way to finally off Voldemort. You know, a way already introduced that doesn't have to do with a stupid Hallow mechanic that was introduced in that book...
- EDIT: The fact that Harry knew who broke into the vault from Book 1 - That could have been an instant "in" with the Goblins for the Cup horcrux.

Harry doesn't have basilisk venom in his blood. That's what the phoenix tears were for: removing the basilisk venom.

**** Yes, thus unfired gun. If fanon can grab a hold of it, there has to be a reason.

Basilisks are made from dark magic that is a crime against nature. Phoenixes are creatures of extreme light. You don't expect their venom and tears to just collide with each other and just poof out of existence. That's the kind of reaction that is usually explosive. And fatal.

No, they either make something new, counteract each other forever, ANYTHING. It would play the whole light vs dark thing that JKR was beating the readers in the face with her plot bricks.

Unspeakable do all sorts of stuff for horcrux hunt. Plot goes out the window and now there's all this time and space for activities like freeing Sirius, romance, Dumbledore overdosing on Sherbet Lemons, and Harry discovers his animagus form of a Umgubular Slashkilter.

Tie it all up in a nice package of chapters of drama/adventure of the government actually doing its job alongside chapters of Harry having a normalish life.

One where he is gifted a Goblin Sword for returning ALL of the goblin artifacts the Potters have and when he anneals the sword with his blood, it takes on the properties of his blood (Basilisk was shown, not sure about the tears. It was mentioned though).

I think there was another one where Harry messed with the bone of the father ritual and Spidermort was born. The Basilisk venom actually hurt him too. Another fic had the blood make the Homunculus unstable, and without the Scar horcrux, blood protection + Phoenix Tears + Basilisk Venom = messed up magical core that was constantly draining the healing, damage, and whatnot the three were doing.

During the book, we are told that Ginny is powerful. We also see her being used by Voldemort so she now has a better motive than most for getting some sort of revenge. Rowling even mentioned the important role Ginny would play. Again, 7 is an important magical number.

But in the end, Ginny plays no role in the final battle except to get sidelined from the fight, and then needing to be saved by her mother. Meanwhile Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Dumbledore and even Crabbe get to destroy a Horcrux, but not Ginny.
