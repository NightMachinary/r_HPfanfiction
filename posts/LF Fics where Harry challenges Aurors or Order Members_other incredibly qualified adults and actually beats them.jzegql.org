I know this is unrealistic as hell and often featured in Indy!Harry stories, but I find these scenes so incredibly funny to read. Like, imagine if in the 'real world', John McClane, Rambo, Jason Bourne, and James Bond all lead a bunch of Navy Seals and Special Forces types bursting into a house, yelling and all big and scary and intimidating, only to get their arses utterly handed to them by a vaguely emaciated and angsty teenager. The internet wouldn't stop laughing for /months/. :D

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I actually kind of like whenever Harry is a powerhouse in terms of magic and dueling.

The first few books were clearly building him up as a chosen one archetype. He drove off over a hundred dementors at age 13, no one has done that before in their records IIRC. He clearly has a lot of power

*** This gets to me everytime I think about it. I loved all the books, even DH, and I also loved the ending...but it did not make Harry the hero he was supposed to be. It just made him a lucky average wizard who had the guts to committ suicide.

Up until GoF, he was shown as very strong. Remarkable. Extraordinary. Then book 5 onwards, J.K. turned into a wuss. Love is power he knows not! Frankly, J.K. should have kept a scene of him thanking Greyback of all people because had he not captured him when he did, then Elder wand wouldn't have thought twice b4 offing Harry, expelliarmus be damned!

*** No offense, but in the books, magic is an academic activity. All of the "magical powerhouses" we see in canon are top of their class. Dumbledore and Tom Riddle were both described as the most brilliant student in Hogwarts. Harry's power is not his magical ability, but his emotions. It's the difference between Harry and someone like Hermione, who is very good at magic, but fails to cast a very strong Patronus. Also, someone has fought off more than that according to Pottermore. It was a random orphan who wasn't special at all, but had a good heart.

Things that don't happen in the books aren't canon? Why not? Also, even if you don't consider it canon, it shows the author's intent in canon. An extremely powerful Patronus Charm isn't an indicator of being a magical genius, but shows that the caster has strong, pure emotions.

****** Because Remus didn't say a specific branch of magic, but magic as a /whole/. There are clear examples in canon of people who are more ‘in tune' with magic than others. Who cares if this is the case, anyways? Why even argue against it, Rowling was making Harry a powerful character until the nonsense in the later books.

I feel you are so assured in your belief of what Harry was /supposed/ to be that you're ignoring the obvious signs that love and pure emotions were always supposed to be his power, not magical ability. In the first book, Harry says that Hermione should go instead of him since she's better at magic, but she responded that there are more important things than that like courage and friendship. The fact that Harry could master a spell that needed pure happiness to work while that spell was said to be the only spell Hermione ever struggled with isn't a coincidence. If you want a main character who is a prodigy at magic, there are a lot of fanfics like that, but let's stop trying to say that Harry was supposed to be like that.

********* It's not a fact that Rowling did that. Harry could never suddenly defeat Voldemort in a battle of magical prowess. Magical titans are analogous to those prodigies in real life who are publishing scientific articles by 12, and Harry just isn't smart or hard working enough to be like that. He wasn't even above characters like Hermione, who are just valedictorian-level talented, in magical ability. She was already taking O.W.L. practice tests in fourth year and reading about N.E.W.T. level transfiguration. The stereotypical "Chosen One training to defeat their powerful enemy" story doesn't work in a world where magic is purely academic. A 17 year old Harry could never defeat a 71 year old genius.

I honestly don't know where you read that Aberforth couldn't read. He went Hogwarts for seven years, so he must have passed his O.W.L.s and taken some N.E.W.T.s. He'd also have to read his course books and write essays for his classes. All we know about him was that he was aggressive, liked dueling and goats, and wasn't as talented as his brother.

********** Dumbledore in fourth year said he may not even be able to read. When he said that Aberforth had charmed a goat in some way and stood up to the backlash?

In the priori incantatem(spelling could be wrong), Harry was literally matching Voldemort's strength for more than a second. The fact that he was able to suggests he's powerful. Magic was more than just something you studied as seen. Harry did shit adult wizards couldn't, battled adult wizards, and was on his way to becoming powerful before the later books had him struggle with magic. He threw off the fucking imperius curse at 14, and fought a battle of will's with Voldemort AGAIN later in said same book. Come off it

*********** When he said that, it was obviously a joke. If Aberforth managed to pass his O.W.L.s he had to have been able to read.

The Priori Incantatem proves my point. It shows his strength of will and heart just like the Patronus Charm does. Also, notice how you don't actually have any feats of /actual/ magic besides the Patronus Charm? When does Harry do any magic except for that one charm? Harry was never extremely powerful. He never even mastered any spell before Hermione, who is nowhere near Voldemort's level. His emotions and the strength of his heart are his powers, and that's a fact.

**** Like many of the things in canon, this was inconsistent. The survey that was on this subreddit had people overwhelmingly voting that magic required a knowledge of theory.

Yet when Harry cast Sectumsempra on Draco --- a spell that he literally knew nothing about, other than it was "for enemies" --- it worked. There wasn't even a specified wand movement. We aren't even told that Harry has enough Latin knowledge to figure out it means "cut forever".

I can't remember the title, but I read a fanfic where McGonagall tells the class that Transfiguration is literally only six spells, and the rest is visualization. I assumed that was inanimate to inanimate, inanimate to animate, animate to inanimate, animate to animate, animate to human, and human to animate. (Human transfiguration is mentioned in canon as being a separate branch, which includes the animagus transformation.)

***** I will admit it was very inconsistent sometimes. But most times, we see that magic is academic. Hermione, for example, could never reach the level of Dumbledore or Voldemort, because while she's the top of her class and the cleverest witch her age that Lupin had ever met, she's not a genius who could publish scientific articles discussing the nature of magic.

I don't think that Transfiguration being only six spells and the rest being visualization would really work. We're told many times that Transfiguration is for those with a logical, scientific mind. If it was visualization, wouldn't it be more artsy? Also, Hermione masters every transfiguration spell weeks before everyone else and is described as reading books on the theory, not practicing how to visualize things. For Sectumsepra, it's probably an oversight.

I'm pretty sure she even created the SNEAK spell, since it was stated to have never healed for the rest of Marietta's life (it faded into acne scars eventually), so unless she was dabbling with some extremely dark magic, she probably created it, since every known hex has a counter to it, which the SNEAK spell doesn't appear to have.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
