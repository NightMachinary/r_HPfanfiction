So I have been reading A Slytherin at War([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1030535/chapters/2053034]]) and have to say, this fic is pretty darn good. (At least in my opinion). Consequently I am search high and low for a decent fanfics where "Slytherin does not mean Junior Death Eater" applies and you get Slytherins been Slytherins rather than just assholes. Of course if the fic is Draco-central that would be marvelous. And if it has him chummy-ish with the Gryffindors all the better. :) Side note: NO Slash, please. Draco/Ginny is preferable, but I can live with other pairings.

**** I feel like you would be horrified at my top three OTP's.

1. Voldemort/Harry

2. Snape/Harry

3. Draco/Harry

***** I still think there is a good case to be made that Draco was crushing hard of Harry. Not really sure Harry would ever reciprocate those feelings even if he was bi/gay though.

****** The only possible canon way that Harry would go for Draco, in my opinion at least, is if his obsession with him in 6th year brought out his feelings.

***** Not so much horrified as flabbergasted, stupefied and pirouetted in state of stupor. ;D ....mostly by Voldie/Harry. Though to be fair I have trouble dealing with Dramione, considering their characterization.

****** From an astrological point of view, both Voldemort and Snape are good matches for Harry. For fanfiction purposes, I think that's perfectly legitimate. :D

**** I never really got this argument, since we don't really know a lot of the character's orientation. Especially those that are students in the books, since lots of people don't know themselves at that point. I mean, like what you like (I'm not a fan of romance fics in general) but isn't that kind of silly?

** So I have something... It's my fanfiction and it isn't complete yet (it's over 100,000 words now and I just posted ch25), but one of the things I am doing is trying to show the Slytherin side of the war in it. Example Draco doing the things he did for his family. It's AU and one of the main characters is Neville. The pairing is Neville OC, but I think it could interest you. The OC is a Slytherin and Draco's twin sister.

** I recently read a fascinating one about the Malfoy and Black patriarchs (Malfoy's grandfather and Sirius' father). They're Slytherins right? It was a peek at the time when Voldemort was just starting out. It's called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6733750/1/The-Pillars-of-Power][The Pillars of Power]]
