So ive been looking for darker fics lately and ive not read to many fics that portray the effects of the abuse Harry received as a child. Hell, at one point in the books its stated that Marge sics her dog on him. Thats serious child abuse but it gets brushed over in the books. Also the after effects and the healing harry has to go through to deal with that.


** FYI, there is a psychological concept called "resilience", which refers to an individual's ability to come out of adverse/traumatic experiences relatively unscathed. Some individuals have more of it than others, and the causes of this variation are the subject of much research.

Harry's high level of psychological resilience is unusual, certainly. Very few people have that level of resilience and it is perhaps his most laudible characteristic. Dumbledore certainly seems to think so, because in HBP he describes Harry's continued good nature despite everything he has been through as his greatest power.

But it's not /unrealistic/ in the sense of not being able to happen in real life. There /are/ people out there who do just have higher psychological resilience than others.

*** That's the one thing I try to get across in my fics. Harry is a survivor, a fighter. All the shit that life threw at him didn't keep him down.

BUT, everyone has a breaking point. It might be something completely mundane or random and yet trigger a flashback. In canon, it was the deaths of Cedric and Sirius. Yet it also won't just reduce Harry to a moping mess of angst and tears. For Harry, it would probably be an episode where he feels like shit or breaks down, but he'd get his shit together the next morning because he is highly functional.

Same with those atrocious "Hermione gets raped" stories. That girl went through some quality time with Bellatrix Lestrange and came out slightly worse for wear. Does anyone really believe that "Random Thug No 4" could break her if not even Voldemort's right hand could do the trick? If anything, Hermione would lay back and think of +Britain+ 28 ways to extract retribution to her rapist and anyone even remotely connected to him.

**** "Harry is a survivor, a fighter"... really? did we read the same books?

as far as I can remember Harry is most often than not an impulsive child with a Hero complex that usually waits until the shit hits the fan and then marches unprepared and survives by the skin of his teeth when he probably shouldn't... probably because of fate. The only instance of which I remember Harry behaving as a survivor is when he basically said: "hey there are those soul sucking thingies that are around the school and totally want to kill me, I should probably look for a way to protect myself against them"

***** He survived "10 dark years" filled with child abuse and torture (the cupboard and ridiculously small rations) without becoming a wreck or a psychopath. He continued the fight after +Berlin had fallen+ Voldemort took over the Ministry. He defied Umbridge. He told the Minister to go fuck himself.

Harry might not be Rambo, but he sure as hell is a fighter, someone who comes out on the other end alive no matter what you throw at him.

****** -"He survived "10 dark years" filled with child abuse and torture"

result of "off-screen" backstory, hardly counts as actual characterization. Even more so when the author treats it as cartoon violence

-"He continued the fight after Berlin had fallen Voldemort took over the Ministry. He defied Umbridge. He told the Minister to go fuck himself."

again "Hero complex" is not survivor behavior, and notice how he pretty much always waited until everything crashed down onto him and then pretty much bashed his head against the problem unless St. Hermione was around, again hardly a survivor behavior

But then again the Harry Potter franchise has more plotholes than a swish cheese, these ones only adds to the load

as far as saying he's a fighter... well I would argue that a "figther" should be willing to use more than a training sword when his opponents are using guns and that he should accept that in a war you should aim to the permanent incapacitation of enemy combatants. (read: his fixture in expeliermus and his unwillingness to kill are both retarded) but I guess that would depend in how one saw such things

*** It is actually unrealistic, while is true that "resilience" can get you trough a lot of shit Harry's behavior is not really consistent with a really resilient person.

Resilient people who have been submitted to systematic abuse more often than not have one or more of the following characteristic

-unemotional reaction to most social interaction as a defense mechanism -fanatical and almost unbreakable belief in a concept or idea -high level of proficiency at any given skill that they relied to survive (resilient people are known to show different grades of obsessive behavior, it is believed that is this single mindedness which allows to tolerate hostile environments)

the unrealistic thing about the books is that Harry doesn't really show so much resilience since his reaction to negative environments is more often than not brooding and mopping

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417][Saving Harry By The Seeker]]

Words: 316056

Summary: What if JKR had never intended the Harry Potter series to be for children? How would Harry's time at the Dursleys been written? This story focuses on the years Harry lived in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive, as well as his first appearance at Hogwarts. The treatment he receives during his decade there is not described in fairy tale terms. The boy who initially develops is not the Harry Potter we know. The story is liberally AU, with different personality traits, events, and relationships used to reflect the changes in this very different Harry and the environment in which he grew up. In the end, through the assistance of a certain redheaded young lady, Harry ultimately finds the life he should have had and rediscovers the qualities he always had inside of him. While I am not a psychologist or child development expert, the symptoms, actions, and behaviors portrayed reflect the realities of child abuse. Appropriate disclosures will be contained in the Author's Notes above the chapter when warranted.

  HPTMR slash. AU. Harry has been raised from the time he was five with full knowledge of what he was, a Horcrux, and how someday he would need to die to avenge his parents. Thus, when he finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he recognizes it. Horcrux speaks to Horcrux, a game of persuasion and manipulation. Twoshot. COMPLETE.

** Well, I have a post Hogwarts female Harry story I'm writing that does include issues and troubles that she still has as an adult due to her abusive childhood, most of which I took directly from my own experiences as a child in an abusive household, and my own experiences now as an adult with issues from it still, even after therapy and actual love and care given to me.

But I'm sure it's not what you're looking for, because it's not canon rehash Hogwarts years in the slightest, and it's not a huge focus of the story, because in my life it's not a huge focus to me either. It's there, it always is, and sometimes it bursts out and totally takes over, makes itself known, but...it's not a focus. I don't focus on it. So it's not focused on in my story.
