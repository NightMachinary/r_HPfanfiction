The current harry potter category has 686k stories and in the last month 511 stories were publish and are unfinished at five thousand words. Every week we see new announcements of possibly habitable planets so I'm wonder why I can't find any non crossover space based stories. Can anyone recommend one? Is anyone thinking of writing one?

** This is the entire thought I'd put into this.

"Brit-60, you are cleared for EVA. If yer gonna pull some sorta Doctor Who whammy to fix that widget, I'm wantin' a debrief about it later. You got thirty-three minutes."

Harry rolled his eyes and replied, "Acknowledged, CAPCOM. Ehhm... there may be a drop-off in comm signal. Don't panic."

"That's real cute, Brit-60. Don't panic. You just get your Douglas Adams-lovin' ass in gear."

"Affirmative."

This was the worst. During all the training, Harry had operated with the utmost regard for suppressing any use of magic. Warping reality to your will had proven to cause all sorts of trouble for fragile technologies like those integral to space flight. Harry's discipline had been put to the test throughout mission training and during their launch and docking with the ODIN platform.

In fact, Harry was developing a theory that the problem of the hour was actually his fault- he had been napping when the alarms had started, and he wouldn't put it past his psyche to stir the situational pot after so many weeks under constant restraint. If so, he and his subconscious were going to have to have words later.

[The plot: Luna and Hermione put him up to it. They Confunded the British partner program into sending Harry along as their 'Race Bannon', accompanying the Scots neophysicist Archibald King. It didn't hurt that Archie actually liked Harry, or that Archie was a squib, and related to Professor Minerva McGonagall. Harry is out there to be in the right place at the right time. The American program to launch an unmanned warp vehicle of Archie's design draws the attention of an interstellar species of Monitors, and Harry is along to survive, return and report. Initial short story should be about the first contact. Subsequent story could be about ODIN being hijacked by the Monitors and Harry using every trick to survive and escape.]

** I've considered doing a Potter-Star Trek:TNG crossover fic, but can't decide how to bend plot devices to make it work. I was thinking along the lines of using some pseudo-temporal/phase shifting to bring the Enterprise-E into the the Potterverse, but still need to flesh out my ideas.

** It's not set in space exactly, but on another planet...groups of magical people settle on other planets after the war. It's Draco/Harry, so if that's not your thing you might not enjoy it, but I found it very engaging and could easily picture the new world and its inhabitants with the author's writing style (Lomonaaeren). It's a series, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8155503/1/Reap-the-Hurricane]["Reap the Hurricane"]] is the first one.

** Have you tried the Crossover tab at Fanfiction.net and searched for Harry Potter fics crossed with a Space-based fandom?

At first glance, there are quite a few stories in the HP/Star Wars link ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/Star-Wars-and-Harry-Potter-Crossovers/8/224/?&srt=4&r=10][here]]) and there are some in the Harry Potter/Star Trek 2009 link ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Star-Trek-2009-Crossovers/224/4863/?&srt=4&r=10][here]]) as well, for example. Alternately, you could browse through the Harry Potter link using Sci-Fi as a filter ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&g2=13&r=10][link]]).

Quality, story length and completeness will vary, of course. :)

Because HP has nothing to do with space travel. Why would anyone who is a fan about wizards and magic start writing stories that explore space travel?

*** It may have nothing to do with space travel, but there IS the space chamber in the Department of Mysteries that we have zero canon information about. Which means that wizards to understand the universe to a degree, so why not explore it?
