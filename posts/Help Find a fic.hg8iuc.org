:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I just remember a scene:

The Ghost of Salazar Slytherin (i think, it was definitely a ghost) was instructing Harry on the brewing of this potion. Harry messes up and has to pull Snape in to help.

I think it might be a snape mentors/parents harry but i can't remember any pairings or even which site it was on.

any help (or recs) would be appreciated


** I feel like I remember reading this. Which means it was most likely on AO3 OR FF.net, because that's really all I read on. Didn't Harry end up, like, bursting into Snape's office and practically dragging him off to help?

*** YES! that's the one. and now I'm worried it wasn't a ghost but a portrait and I'm so confused but REALLY want to reread this fic.

**** I'm super sure it was a ghost, and Slytherin feels familiar. I have NO clue what the story is though.

***** Do you remember anything else about the fic?

I'm trying to search through ao3 and ffn, but there's too many fics with Harry and Snape.

****** No, I don't. I just remember they were like, practicing as if they were in their own little classroom, to show Hermione how to chill. I literally don't remember the rest of the plot about it, lol. But weird things stick in people's memories about fics, so I thought I'd ask.

****** I think I remember that fic also, but not what it's called.

As I recall, Harry discovered Slytherin's ghost while looking for something in Slytherin's study in the Chamber of Secrets. It turns out that Slytherin, as well as the other founders, are bound to the castle in a state half-way between life and death. Slytherin tricks Harry into completing a task for him that proves himself worthy of being Slytherin's chosen champion (or something like that).

The potion is something that Slytherin said would help Harry against Voldemort (maybe something to do with the horcruxes or mind magic? I forget what it was exactly.) Slytherin was helping Harry brew it, but then he claimed that he had to leave suddenly midway through the brewing. Thus, Harry had to run and somehow convince Snape to help, otherwise the potion would have a dangerous meltdown when it reached the next brewing stage. Later it turned out that Slytherin had set up the situation so that Harry would be forced into an alliance with Snape.
