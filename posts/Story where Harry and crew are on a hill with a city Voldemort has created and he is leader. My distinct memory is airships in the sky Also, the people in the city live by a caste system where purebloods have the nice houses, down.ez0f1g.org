#+TITLE: Story where Harry and crew are on a hill with a city Voldemort has created and he is leader. My distinct memory is airships in the sky? Also, the people in the city live by a caste system where purebloods have the nice houses, down to muggles cleaning. Also Harry wears the skin of enemies.

:END:
I'm looking for a story, it might be 2 different ones. The first part like the tile says, there are airships and the like. The second part is I distinctly recall Harry wearing the skin of a recently killed enemy on a boat to sneak into and retrieve something. I recall blood seeping out of the skin and it not quite fitting him right.

At least in the first case, Dumbledore is still alive as far as I recall. At the time I think it was unfinished.

Any thoughts or hints would be great!!

Posted this a year ago with no replies, hope for a more successful outcome.


** The one with him wearing someone's skin is maybe linkffn(2680093) He wears zombie Fudge's skin at one point.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

It tasted of tainted honey and carried the ineffable weight of centuries down with it, until they hung heavy beneath his ribs and drowned his lungs in ice crystals.Harry Potter and Voldemort, and the inevitable baggage of a millenium.
