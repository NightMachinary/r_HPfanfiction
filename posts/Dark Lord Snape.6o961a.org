Is there any fanfiction where Severus Snape becomes a Dark Lord instead of a death eater. I know that this isn't much promising as every dark family worth a knut was all about kissing the hem of Voldemort's robes but still if there is one where Snape is a Dark Lord, it's bound to be interesting.


** From what I recall Soulplay by Snapesforte has this. I'm not sure whether it's still available online though.
