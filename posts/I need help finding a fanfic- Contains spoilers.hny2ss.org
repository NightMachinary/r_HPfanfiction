There's was a fanfic I read a while ago and it was about Harry going back in time to stop moldyshorts. It really didn't focus on Harry as much but more of Hermione's reactions to Harry acting like a broken older Harry. It's a Harry x hermione fanfic but the thing that made this really non forgettable was the end. I don't want to spoil it because it is a good read but this part really helps narrowing down the searches. SPOILER- in the end of the fanfic, Harry confess to killing death eaters. Hermione doesn't like that and treats Harry a bit cold. Towards the end they make up by hermione using logic involving Hitler to justify harry's murders. Yeah I kid you not that's how they resolve the conflict. So yeah that's what I need help with.

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
