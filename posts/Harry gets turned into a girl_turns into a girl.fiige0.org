But NOT Harry/Draco please, it's so annoying trying to find ones that aren't. I'd also rather it isn't an angst fest, but I'd like it to actually be a pretty big part of the story.

I'm fussy :) thanks!


** May I offer you my own fic? linkffn(A Different Perspective) || linkao3(A Different Perspective)

Beware that the genderbend is not Harry into fem!Harry but into the twin sister of a Harry from a different reality. That's kind of the twist of my fic. And while there is some angst about the whole situation, I don't think it's overdone üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**** linkao3(22953583) and linkffn(13512039), there are so many stories of similar names, that just name is not enough anymore. Either write directly storyID (you find it in the URL of the story), or at least linkao3(A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic).

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

Although, technically it is Harry/Ginny...in the new reality.

  If Ochako had to choose anyone to be psychically connected to as a result of an unfortunate quirk, Bakugou is about the last person she would choose. Really, the only people who she'd hate being linked to more are Deku, who broke her heart last year, or Minetta for obvious reasons. Naturally, that means that while she was in a fight with some evil child-killing bastards after a long day of saving lives, it had to be him the villain tied to her mind. They say two minds are better than one, but Ochako doesn't think they meant it for this particular context.

** I've recently started reading What's in a Name? Or a Face? by Over.Thinking.Daily.Life. The story is a nice fluffy read so far. The premise is that the polyjuice plan in CoS goes wrong and Harry gets turned into someone that could be Theodore Nott's twin sister so Snape has him masquerade as Theo's long lost sister. There's no angst so far and real pairing yet.

****** Well, it depends on your definition of smut. For me it is any scene, which doesn't bring anything to the overall story and its sole purpose is to titillate sexual feelings of the reader. So, the start of the chapter 7 qualifies in my opinion. And yes, I understand that for the connoisseur of this type of stuff, this is so weak, that it doesn't even register.
