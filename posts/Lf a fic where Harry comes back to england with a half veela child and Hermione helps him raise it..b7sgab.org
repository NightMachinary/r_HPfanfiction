From what i remember Harry and Ginny break up and Harry goes to france, marrys a Veela but divorces her after their child is born for some reason...he moves back to england and Hermione ends up helping him and they end up getting together with Ginny trying to get back with harry throughout the story


** This one has him with a son instead of a daughter, but the rest seems to fit.

*** When Harry grabbed Hermione and said, “Come on now, you didn't bring your pretty arse all the way here not to tell me off properly.”

**** If one line makes you leave a story behind, you're going to miss out on a lot of great stories. Be a little less picky. You'll be happier in life. This is a great story.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
