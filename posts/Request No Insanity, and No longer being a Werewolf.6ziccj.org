Looking for stories where Frank and Alice are freed from their insanity, would rather it be multi-chapter and completed.

And looking for stories where Remus Lycanthropy is cured. Would rather it be multi-chapter and completed.

But if not it's fine I suppose. Any rating is fine.

Doesn't have to be cleared all the way for either of them, but still better off then they are now.


** Well...[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]] has sort-of-cured lycanthropy, as I recall. Sort-of-cured in that they still turn into werewolves, but now aside from the full moon they can transform at will and they don't have the acute misanthropy.

It goes off the regular rails by miles, though, by introducing Star Wars concepts and one character (Ahsoka Tano) who single-handedly helps to bring Earth up to Star Wars levels of tech.
