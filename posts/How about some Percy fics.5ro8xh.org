Used the search bar and there doesn't seem to be an even remotely recent request for my man Percy! I'm looking for any story where he's either the main character or a significant side character. It can be romance (even slash) or he can be evil etc. I really don't have any preferences! My three favorite so far are:

Linkffn(9591994) - Short one shot from Sirius's POV.

Llinkffn(11448018) - In which Percy joins Draco on his quest to rescue Harry from a tower, because the Ministry says so. The banter is simply amazing and Percy is so painfully in character haha.

Linkffn(3784000) - Probably the most well known Percy-centric story and for good reason!

Thanks!

Edit: WOW! So many people responded with so many amazing Percy stories! It'll be hard to tear myself away from my screen for a long while haha! Keep 'em coming and thanks to everyone for giving me (and others) plenty of options :)


** linkffn(harry potter without harry potter) heavily features Percy and he is AMAZING. Seriously excellent character growth. The story follows a ton of characters though, not just him.

Edit: AND IT JUST UPDATED THE OTHER DAY!!!!! :D :D :D

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

**** Yea, it does. Did you make it as far as the Halloween troll incident? It diverges from there, for some characters much more than others.

Canon stuff still happens, like confronting Voldemort over the stone at the end of Year 1, but different characters are involved so it goes differently.

** Percy is a significant character in the later stories of the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/306153][Lion and Two Snakes series]] - but they'll make no sense without the first one, which is light on Percy.

And the second story has a lot of explicit slash. You can probably skip that one entirely, I think the third one would still make sense.

*** Well, I tried. Let's try again - linkffn(11960965)

Actually, the one I tried to link above is Percy/Hermione fic that isn't that great to be honest - characters are comically unbelievable. This is the one I was thinking of, but if you want the other one too just let me know.
