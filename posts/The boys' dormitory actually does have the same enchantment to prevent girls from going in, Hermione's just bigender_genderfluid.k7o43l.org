Depending on your interpretation Hermione might already know this and just didn't want to draw attention, or another girl triggers the enchantment, leading to a session of self discovery. Bonus points for my favourite ship, Harry/Hermione/Ron

Students have been finding ways to defeat these enchantments and get their needed dose of daily nookie ever since five minutes after the enchantments were installed. There are more secret passages between the male and female dorms of each house than in all the rest of Hogwarts.

*** To be fair, Hogwarts was built in a time when, even though still not socially acceptable, unscrupulous men could get sex by force quite easily if they were denied it when they asked nicely. So those protections don't seem so much sexist but rather a way to protect girls from thirsty guys and they make sense in the historical context.

** Nah, I prefer the concept that it doesn't. Back when it was implemented women hadn't gone through the sexual revolution they had in like the 60s, and were still very reserved in their actions -- especially in the wizarding world.

Now, after that revolution and women being more confident in themselves and less under the thumb of societal expectations, they really should enchant that stair case... Just none of the girls exploiting its absence are dumb enough to get caught, and none of the guys benefiting from it want to put an end to a good thing.

** I'd just like to point out that it's unlikely for such an enchantment to take one's sexual inclination into account (gay, lesbian, bi) and with the array of transformative magics available, a wizard or witch unsatisfied with their birth form would alter it to their specifications (queer, trans)(or at least they would if it was an issue important to them).

As such, KISS says the spell would just check on the general physical characterisitcs and call it a day.

*** I... don't really know where to begin with this.

I never said anything about sexuality being involved, so I'm not sure where you got that from.

There are two possible reasonings for why it might work the way I mean:

1: In my mind, the original spell was indeed intended just to look at physical stuff. But! Magic hardly seems like a hard science, and a small change in wording could result in a different set of conditions to be met than intended. And they'd never know if the only people they tested it with had those traits line up.

2: Taking into account all the seemingly sapient magics around Hogwarts (sorting hat, moving stairs, portraits) it's not out of line to think that the stairs themselves could have changed the rules over time. Perhaps as a result of learning from all the magical people coming through, that require old spells to adapt for more modern views

I was just covering my bases. LGBTQ involves all of those, so I responded to all of those. Am I aware that these concern different things? Yes. Am I wlling to put in extra effort here, despite the fact that many people who are more involved in the topic do not bother? No.

That is very true. Wording is very important, and the meaning of words change over time. A very good point.

I agree. When taking the "Magic is Magic/Magic is alive" stance, this makes perfect sense, and in the hands of a good author makes the experience much more satisfying.

The problem is not with the prompt, of course. It's with the implementation, because the *elements responsible for the changes need to be accounted for in the narrative* if the changes are to happen. That is all.
