Basically looking for:

- Non-Canon (Harry is not married to Ginny, and so on)
- Adults (as in 18+ years of age, likely older though and obviously post-Hogwarts)
- Mature content (Mature language, sexual content, humor, topics, and so on)
- Fun (Comedy, funny situations, enjoyable banter, smut, and so on)

Basically, I am in a way looking for, well, young adults being young adults, relationships and all. I still want some sort of plot of course, but it can be a bit loose. If it's an "older" Harry that's ok, but everything else still applies.

For example, Harry is a Quidditch star, enjoying his life, and banging Tonks and Fleur on the side. Or Harry is an Auror, fighting the good fight against any leftover death eaters, and being pursued by Gabriel or Luna or an OC. Or Harry trying to be a teacher at Hogwarts, and dealing with female students crushing, while actually trying to court an older woman (Narcissa perhaps?). Or Harry exploring the wizarding world with Hermione by his side, dealing with funny situations, and amusing adventures.

You get the picture. Fun, mature, exciting, amusing, comedic, and smutty fics dealing with Harry as an adult. No slash please. Included romance or mature sexual situations preferred (no kiddy gloves here).

As far as clever I'm not sure it ever gets super clever but it does get more interesting past that. Much more interesting (even if in retrospect it seems a bit cliche). Well. Maybe not retrospect but reflection.

Still. I've read it a few times and enjoyed it each time.

********* Well i just finished it and the first thing i have to say is that it was way to fucking long. Author could've quite comfortably shave half of fic length and it still would have been way to many words for the amount of things that happened during that fic.\\
it would have been worth 200+k words if it didn't cram most interesting things into epilogue chapter.\\
But at least we got semi-decent resolution, because after reading half way through i started to fear that maybe we won't even get that. That maybe, after two hander thousand words, it will all end with some lame tease for a sequel or something equally horrible. We still didn't get all of the answers, but "some" is better than "none at all".\\
IMO it would have been much better fic if everything from chapter 1 to chapter 24 happened around first third or perhaps even first quarter of the way through. And rest of it was spent on expanding and fleshing out events glossed over in the epilogue and "bonus" 26 chapter.\\
Also i got to say for a fic set in Harry Potter universe it did not felt all that "magical". It would have needed disconcertingly little amount of tweaking and we could've had another one of those "no magic AU" things.\\
Also also everybody got over "people vanishing during portkey travel" way to quickly.

****** She has sex once with Astoria, before she kills her. which is the psycopath part. While also showing Harry the memory of this, while he's chained to a chair. So yeah, she's weird.

Random accident and no, they don't come back.

******** Yeah, its a pretty dark fic... if you're looking for some incestuous Daph/Astoria, check "Animagus Mishap" Heavy smut, but there's a couple of chapter with both of her. There's bestiality too, if that's not your cup o' tea, i'm sorry.

**** Its a marriage law fic. I tried to read it and gave up after the first chapter. To be fair, the prose wasn't bad.
