** In terms of numbers, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A Long Journey Home]] is critically under-exposed for how good it is. The female Harry and ambiguous first couple chapters might have something to do with that, but as you read on you start to really pick up on how intricately, lovingly constructed it is. Very solid characterization, especially the small details.

In particular, the arc that covers the origin of Merlin is fantastic, and the September, 1964 chapter is one of the most poignant, beautiful bits of writing I've come across lately.

*** When I first read this a day after its most recent update (October 15th) I strove through it all without break for anything else. Such eloquent writing, with the author having excellent skills in pacing and as Lane points out wonderful characterization.

Anyone who is looking for a new fic to become enthralled in should look into this fic as soon as possible.

It's tragic, but summaries are really terrible indicators sometimes. Books, covers, etc. Good writing >>>>>>> everything.

***** Indeed! I did!

Good writing can make any single story worth reading, which is a fault I find in this sub. Most people ask for a specific type of story and it's the rare thread that only asks for "anything written well."

********** Yeah, I get that. My tastes are broad yet specific. Stories that are heartwarming and moving like /A Long Journey Home/ are great if they're well-written, and few and far between. /The Lie I've Lived/ and /A Black Comedy/ are completely different, but (for me, anyway), entertaining as hell. I like all different kinds of stories as long as they're compelling in their own way, and I tried to have my Top 20 reflect that.

** There are many fics that I wish were more popular. If I had to pick one, it would either be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080247/1/Lost-Time][Lost Time]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]]. Its sad that both of them have less than 200 reviews on ffn despite being so great.

It's brilliant. Characters are spot on. Over 6 years old and it only has TWO reviews, really a shame.

** [[http://www.fanfiction-junkies.de/efiction/viewstory.php?sid=2377][Practical Solutions]]. I usually dislike the HGSS pairing, but there are a few where the writing is so damn good that you can't help but love the story. This is the ultimate example, and since it isn't on any of the big sites very few read it. Absolutely hilarious, with incredibly sharp dialogue.

**** No one ever does. The first 6-7 times this was recommended to me "HGSS? Nope!" was my immediate reaction. Then I read it and laughed my ass off. One of my absolute favorites ever since, and easily the most underrated fic I know of (because of the trepidation when it comes to HGSS stories).

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick]] series, by Inverarity.

Of course, I know why they're under-read - next-generation, American and with little-to-no reference to anything that takes place in canon, including no characters from canon - so maybe this shouldn't count, but it really is a great series, with the second book being quite possibly my favorite fic of them all.
