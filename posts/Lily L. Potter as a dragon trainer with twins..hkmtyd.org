:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I just randomly remembered this fic last night. I read it a couple years back, and I remember it being so good. Lily is married to an OC or maybe just a minor character, not actually sure on that. They have twins and live and work on a dragon training farm in Australia or somewhere similar. Something happens and they are going back and forth from England to wherever it is they're living. Lily is working on some kind of potion to help. Please tell me someone else has read this!
