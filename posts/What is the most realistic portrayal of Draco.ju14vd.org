In fanfics Draco seems to swing back and forth between being completely ineffectual without servants to the point that some fics have it that he can't cook for himself and doesn't even know what a TV is

​

other stories have him being fairly up on things. He would never use them but he knows what TV or helicopter is and he can actually cook


** didn't he brag about how he outflied a helicopter in the books?

*** Which is obviously a juvenile boast.

Helicopters fly at an average of ~160mph. The one figure for a 'good but not best' broom is 60mph I believe. He didn't have a Firebolt when he was at home, I'm sure, and I doubt the Firebolt is -that- much faster than a Comet or Cleansweep.

** I don't think he would know how to cook or what is a tv.

the canon helicopter is at least reasonable because helicopters and planes fly around and magical children might see them and ask what they are and they might be a more common knowledge.

even Arthur who was a muggle fan had no idea about muggle things. but he had a muggle car. since it's normal to see a car outside, there is also a magical bus and then the hogwarts express. but not many muggles were inside of muggle houses, so tv and phone are not part of that known bubble.

**** I know it is a children's book, and thus most of the audience wouldn't be able to give a detailed explanation of how airplanes stay up, but this is such a basic concept that anyone with a basic secondary education would be able to answer in like less than ten minutes. Basic physics.

So that changes this line from childish curiosity to "have you never talked to any muggle?".

I mean, it isn't quarks or string theory or something like that :/

** I wouldn't be surprised if he did not know how to cook, he had house elves at home probably doing the cooking and if not his parents would have with him being young. Then he spent his teenage years at Hogwarts getting everything cooked for him by the house elves there. I feel like he probably wouldn't know anything about TV or helicopters or other muggle items with no magical equivalent until he was out of Hogwarts, as he has no real opportunity to run into anyone who would talk about that until after the war and I doubt he ever ventured into the muggle world with blood purist parents. Maybe you could portray him as learning about these things after the war in an attempt to move away from who he was as a Death Eater and better fit in with the winning side of the war.

** I think canon Draco is entirely in the dark about Muggle technology and will have no idea what a TV is. I doubt, during the book series, he has ever even talked to a Muggle, let alone set foot into Muggle world. As for helicopters - hey may have seen them, in the air, but won't know what it is or how it works.

*** No not really. I see more as Viserys Targaryen to be honest

​

also I don't think that affects his Skills

​

what does that have to do with whether Draco would know how to use Muggle appliances or be aware of Muggle things ?
