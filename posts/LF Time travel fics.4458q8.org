Not anything related with the marauders or founders era, a completely different time. Like ancient Rome or the wild west, just something completely different.


** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh)

Touches upon early eras in the world of magic like ancient Eqypt, bronze-age India, Arthurian times and the sixties, man.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.

**** No crossover, though "Dirty Harry" springs to mind.

It's a ridiculously powerful Western-style gun-slinging macho Harry with a few but annoying spelling mistakes. The longer the story goes on, the harder it is to suspend disbelief.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
