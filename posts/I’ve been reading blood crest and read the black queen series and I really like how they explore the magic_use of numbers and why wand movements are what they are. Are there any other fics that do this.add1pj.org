#+TITLE: I’ve been reading blood crest and read the black queen series and I really like how they explore the magic/use of numbers and why wand movements are what they are. Are there any other fics that do this?

I enjoy it. I mostly like the more in depth look into magic the author gives and the story interests me.

  Part 3 of The Arithmancer Series. Hermione won the war, but her career as the world's greatest arithmancer is just beginning. Now, she has places to go, spells to invent, and a family to start. Oh, and a whole lot of dementors to kill.

****** How do the numbers interact with the whole magic thing? I remember reading one fic where harry travelled back in time sort of and advised his past self Hermione, some sister of Harry's or something and it ended up having spells legitimately being nothing but a string of numbers that normal kids easily figured out in like a month and were making huge advances.
