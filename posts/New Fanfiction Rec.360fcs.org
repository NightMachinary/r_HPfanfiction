** So you are building a fanfic categorization site? Why not allow users to do the categorization for you instead of having it all manually done by one person?

Edit: Also, what kind of standardizations are you using for linking to fics? It would be awesome if each fic had a list of places to find and alternate versions if for example there is a NC-17 version on FF.net and a MA rated version on AO3.

*** Having the users do the categorization is the only way it can really be done. If one tries to do it all the themselves then it is likely that the site won't have enough content to be any good.

** You should completely avoid categorizing slash and straight just to irritate people
