If there was a fic where someone, say harry, could see the spirits of the dead, if he saw Dumbledores sister, which would be a better state to see her spirit in, as she was right before she died, with her mind altered, or would it make more sense for her mind to be restored to what it use to be?


** That's an interesting topic to approach, and I think it all depends on what the author is going for in the story.

Is it a tragic story? Is it sticking more to the themes of canon, with it being somewhat light-hearted and adventurous?

Whatever sort of genre the author has gone for, that should dictate the way she's written.

*** Not a tragic story per se, closer to canon in that it would be adventurous, but as it continued, more fantastical elements would added over time.

** Personally, my opinion is that if the Potterverse afterlife exists, that's pretty strong evidence that a benevolent God exists too (which is most certainly the case in Rowling's mind, considering her IRL beliefs). Now, would a benevolent God make it so that the souls of the dead could never heal from whatever mental disability they had in life? What do you think?

*** I would hope restored, but its one of those questions that verge into dangerous territory.

**** Perhaps.

For what it's worth, my headcanon is that all mind-manipulation (be it Muggle brain damage, or Obliviation, or Amortentia, etc.) in the Potterverse only happens to the physical brain; the soul is an unaffected. (It's by reaching directly into the soul that you can break through a Memory Charm, which is why it's so dangerous.)

***** I like the way you think, its a good way to view it.

Now I just got think of a way for the person to revel their ability to see the dead, i dont think "BTW, I see dead people" would really work

****** Another important question is what the non-ghost dead are doing in the mortal world. Shouldn't they be frolicking in the green fields of the Beyond or whatever it is you do in the Potterverse's Afterlife? Did someone leave the Resurrection Stone switched on?

******* Not quite, more of someone is walking around as lesser stone, functioning as basically as a classical meaning necromancer, after they came extremely close to dying
