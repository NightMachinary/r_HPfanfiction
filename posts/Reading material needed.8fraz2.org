I'm currently hooked on Dodging Prison & Stealing Witches by LeadVonE. Its bloody brilliant and as I'm up to date with it i m looking for something similar. If any of you dont know what it is its a time travel fic where Harrys been chosen by fate to defeat voldermort after 10 years of Azkaban with all the skills and knowledge that Voldermort possesses. Its AU but quite complicated to explain. Basically looking for well written longish fic similar to DPSW thanks.


** I'm not entirely sure what you are asking for. Do you want AU's? Do you want time travel? Do you want powerful Harry?

The issue with asking for something "like DPSW" is that it's just /so damn unique/, no other fic has the same feel or handles tropes so well.

I would either ask you to refine your request or instead point you to the DPSW discord server where the fic is discussed at length and other avid readers like yourself discuss the story and rec fanfiction.

For example when the horcruxes were fakes our discord had multiple theories on what happened. Perhaps there was another time traveler? The prevailing notion is that Luna is also a time traveler. These sorts of intricacies are discussed at length and I'd imagine you'd enjoy this sort of thing.

** I'll recommend Prince of Slytherin on pure principle, but yea, you need to tell us what you want when you say "similar to DPSW".

What parts of it did you like? The magic system? Time travel? Harem? WBWL? Manipulative Dumbledore? What?

Travel Secrets was kinda sorta like DPSW maybe? Been a very long time since I read it. It's also abandoned though.
