I can't remember the name of the fic for the life of me. I know it had Harry/Daphne/Tract pairings and had some smut scenes. I know the premise was that Slytherin has two leaders in each year (Malfoy and Harry) and the duke it out. They sort members into teams at the beginning and Harry saves all the girls. Really been wanting to read it again.

I can't find a working link to How Fleur Delacour Seduced Me: AKA I'm a Lucky, Lucky Man :(. Anyone have a copy of it?

  Harry was sent off to live in a muggle orphanage, after Voldemort failed to kill him and his twin, Jaina Potter. Now, as a first year at Hogwarts, he has only one goal, one dream. To do what no one has before: Rule the World. Some crossover characters, influences from other Fics, Darkish/Evilish!Harry, WBWL, mostly later. Hogwarts begins at age thirteen, silly with plot, edited.

  Yr 2: Harry has returned in time after one too many things went wrong, his careful plans have been messed up, so he's trying a few new things. He's searching for the diary, but while things are similar, his presence has altered enough to keep him on his toes! No pairings. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 2nd in series. Rated M because I'm paranoid. Everything belongs to Jo!
