Found this story a few months back and just finished rereading it. While its not purely Harry Potter (sherlock fandom is mixed in) you dont need to know sherlock to understand the story. Its quite good.

Here's chapter 1 of 10 for those interested. About 65k words, or 2 hrs of reading. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768]]


** I read this one a couple of weeks ago, and I really loved it. It's very, very much not your usual HP fic, but it's really quite brilliant. Do you have any recs for similar styles of fic in either the Sherlock or Harry Potter universes?
