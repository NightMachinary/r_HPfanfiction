So i was thinking of writing a fanfic set in an AU where the battle of Hogwarts is lost, and they have to flee and continue the war in other methods.

would anyone have any handy hints to help me get on with it?


** Plot, plot, plot. While it may be tempting to just wing it and make up plot as you go, a war-fic will, almost certainly, be crap if you do.

Do research, write timelines, note down plots. JK's [[http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/legacy/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/rowling_spreadsheet.gif][spreadsheet]] is a great example on how to keep order in your timelines and plot threads, which is vital in a fic like this. Good luck!

That's like, step one of the planning process. Before you even start writing you should sketch out a plot, work out who and what you want the characters to be and do, how that fits back into the plot, and how they develop the plot as it goes.

You should know virtually everything that happens in the story before you start writing it. And that's the most helpful hint I can give.

** The other two suggestions are for plot. Good suggestions. But you might be more of a discovery writter. See what works for you.
