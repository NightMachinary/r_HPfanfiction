I am looking for some good next gen fic with some adventure or mystery as the main plot. Ideally canon movie pairings I.e H/G R/HR. I've read all of little0birds and Northumbria. I just finished The Revolt and it's sequel which was very enjoyable. Any recommendations would be appreciated


** linkffn(11815544) is a okay with that. I don't really like it, but I recognize it's well written and fits your parameters.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** "Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard" (linkffn(11251021)) follows Teddy's 1st year at Hogwarts. I really enjoyed the author's take on it, there's some mischief and some adventure but it's not like there's a huge plot where Teddy has to save the world (like Harry had to!) But there are parallels between them, Harry had to struggle with being famous, and so did Teddy. There are other repercussions of the war too (Hogwarts reconstruction/rebuilding, few muggle born children, smallest class of Hogwarts). If you liked it, there are three more books detailing his 3rd, 5th and 7th year ... all drawing parallels as well to the canon books.

  Teddy Lupin begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well! (This is an older story, just being posted to FFN for the first time.) Cover by Papillon82.

** My personal favourite next-gen fic: linkffn(8255131). It fits your requirements perfectly: adventure and mystery are the main focal points of the story, canon pairings. It has two sequels and is really well-written.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.
