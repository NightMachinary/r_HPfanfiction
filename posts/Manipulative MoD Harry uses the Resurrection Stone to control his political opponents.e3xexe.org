Post War Harry has entered politics, using the Resurrection Stone to manipulate his opponents and supporters by offering them tantalizing moments with their lost loved ones. Basically acting as a necromantic drug dealer. And if they don't play ball, so to speak, they instead get those who they cared for yet wronged acting as a knife to the heart to break them.

I've seen plenty of fics where he uses the elder wand to great effect, or even interrogates the dead with the stone to learn their secrets. I've never seen one where he basically bribes and blackmails the living with the chance to see those they've lost.


** Which fanfic is the last part of your request, I would like to read that.

*** Where he interrogated the dead? The primary one I'm thinking of there is The Havoc Side of the Force. As far as the wand, any MoD fic really.
