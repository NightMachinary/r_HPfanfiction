:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay, I know this is an old fic. I've been searching everywhere for this. I know it was originally on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], I just can't find it. I read it circa 2010 but it was an old fic by that time.

It's a Time Travel story. Here's what I remember: On Harry's Sixteenth birthday he tried to commit suicide in Grimmauld Place. Mrs. Weasley (i think it was her) finds him bleeding and yells for help. Harry's tutor (which Dumbledore arranged to help harry to fight voldemort) is a mage or something... anyway, he saves Harry's life and accidently gives Harry some of HIS powers. After his 16th, he has had silver eyes. He's grown apart from Ron and Hermione and his closest friend is his tutor. Voldemort is alive and ruling he wizarding world. A little later on, Hary and his tutor decides to time travel. Harry travels back to his fifth year, trading places with his younger self (who's now in safe hands with his tutor in the future). BUT he is still in his older body. I remember him discussing what the future held and how they had failed to everyone in Grimmauld Place. Sirius is horrified.

That's literally all I remember. I don't know if it was even good or not and really it sounds depressing as heck but the mystery of it has gotten to the point it's making me PO-ed that I can't find it. Gah! Any help on this would be appreciated.


** That sounds interesting, hope someone can help. Would like to read it
