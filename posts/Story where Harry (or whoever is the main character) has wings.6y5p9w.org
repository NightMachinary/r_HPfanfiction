I was playing GTA5 when suddenly I thought, as I was flying through the air on a motorcycle, "Hey, it'd be cool to have wings and be able to fly." It was splendid. So, whatchugot?

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

*** The only reason I have not read this is it Has more words than I think the first five books put together, and it doesn't start first year until almost half way through. If you wish it, and because I really want to believe it is worth reading, please try to convince me that it is worth it. I'm not trying to be sarcastic or rude about it I really want to believe this story is worth my time.

*** This was a huge, very involved story. I really ended up enjoying it. It was quite different to many other things I've read. I could see the author's work improving over time and then started her other story "Blindness" (which is even more off the wall unique but fascinating). I can't give a more detailed review because it's been quite a while since I read it, but it's one of the few fics that have stuck with me.

  Ron Weasley has his fair share of secrets. (Not the least of which is the pair of dusty red wings sticking out of his back.) /Basically an AU in which Ron was taken by the School when he was little. Eventually he gets back to his family and attends Hogwarts, but he wasn't, by any means, left unscarred by the ordeal.
