  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

*** Luna raising Tom; now that sounds interesting. But how is Luna written? Is she close to canon or like seer Luna or acting the way she is because of her mother's death as some people have written her. Sorry, just want to know.

Will check out the rest; thanks for the recs, and will check out Doubting Thomas if Luna is written closer to canon; I tend to dislike defense mechanism Luna or Seer Luna just because that's not who she is; and I love Luna, she's one of my favorite characters so I can be rather picky on how she's written.

**** She's close to canon. No Seer abilities. She only plays dumb to conceal the fact that she's a time traveler and to fly under the radar, off the wall conspiracy theories are never mentioned if i recall correctly. (Though to be fair she is in a conspiracy of one...)

*** +1 for Likes Grains of Sand in the Hourglass, awesome stuff. Of note is it is only a 1 year (well 9 month) jump, which sets it apart from a lot of more distant travel fics.

*** Started reading LIkes Grains of Sand in the Hourglass and am liking how the characters are being written. Only characters I'm a bit iffy on are Molly, Dumbledore, Ginny and maybe Luna a little bit. (I love Luna she's one of my favorite characters so I can tend to be rather picky on how she's written).

But other then those characters I'm really enjoying the story, thanks for the rec again and will check out the rest.
