Hey all,

I'm looking for a fanfiction where Harry Potter takes Healing with Professor Snape and Politics with Andromeda Tonks. I know the politics classes are on Saturdays. I also want to say that this fanfiction has Ron and Hermione talking to Remus behind Harry's back, but I can't be sure.

Thanks in advance!

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.
