*** Naidhe's fics are all so good! Hermione and Pansy have pretty good character development in Coven too, linkao3(coven by naidhe). Pansy's transition away from being prejudiced against Muggleborns is drastic and yet happens slowly and realistically so that it's completely plausible to the reader.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

  Two more people heard the prophecy entirely. They took it upon themselves to change the course of the war, as they saw fit. This is what happens when the True Marauders, including Lily, Frank and Alice, and their friends from the Order, and three wise guides, the main characters, avert the prophecy. Good Dumbledore (somewhat); horrible Snape. Horcrux destruction implicit. COMPLETE.

**** I mean I definitely enjoy Harry-centric stories too, but I do enjoy to read about everyone doing awesome stuff (in sympathetic properties he's the central character, but the author is purposefully running as many story threads as they can)

I think the issue is that Harry's a cardboard cutout Everyman in a lot of stories which doesn't really make for rich characterisation! So for his particular question I don't think you'd find many Harry-centric fics that have that depth

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.
