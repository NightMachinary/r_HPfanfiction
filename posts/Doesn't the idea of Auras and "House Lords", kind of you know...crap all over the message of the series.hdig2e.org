I must confess to enjoying "House Potter (and often Black)" fics not because I find enjoyment in them, but because of how ridiculous they are. Goblins willing to perform magical contracts to befit Harold "Harry" Potter, Lord of the House of the Potters and descendant to the House of black by heritage, to be bound in political marriage to no less than 20 different witches, one of whom is for some reason always Susan Bones, all the while Ginny tries to use a love potion to recapture his love on the orders of Dumbledore...

You can see the appeal in how stupid it sounds right? However somewhere in between the "Political plays" where Harry confronts the Malfoys (sometimes even inheriting it all after Lucius is captured and making Draco his bitch) I found the increasingly more common element of magical auras - of the ability to sense and controls others' auras to be problematic.

Now to be clear Canon does at least make it possible to read off magical ability (see the boat in the cave with the goblet in HBP but the whole idea of a nobility and class system to the magical world - as well as a system where Lords have inherently more magical power than mere half-bloods rubs me the wrong way.

It's not that I would not be able to see a feudal system in place with wizards, or that they are bigoted enough to hold family titles above individual personality (see Sirius' mum), but in mixing those two things - heads of houses become powerful witches or wizards - I can't help but feel dirty in a way.

Despite JK's personal feelings on some hot topics the series has made it abundantly clear that muggleborn, half blood or pureblood one is not inherently superior to the other in magic. While kids raised in a magical environment might have a head start it's nothing other wizards can't catch up to with study and practice.

So if everyone's equal, at least in potencial, isn't the whole idea of "Lord Potter is suddenly as powerful as Dumbledore, Grindewald or You-know-Who" something that flies against the message of the series?

Obviously when you're deviating so far from canon that's the least of your worries, but It's just a feeling I can't shake. Thoughts?


** Yep.

​

A lot of common fannon tropes are... well... poorly thought out.

Magical Cores: It was pretty much explicitly stated that magic was not based on some inner supply or strength, but on imagination and practice.

Wizarding Culture: Making it into some feudal society kind of defeats the entire purpose of this fun, magical world just beneath the surface

Canon character bashing: Often character bashing is just a disguised rant about the canon character, which almost never acknowledges the very important reasons the character was the way they were. For example, making harry powerful/independent when his place in the story was to be the everyman the audience viewed the wizarding world through

​

HOWEVER, these are all in response to either flaws in the canon or simply missed opportunities that would be interesting to explore.

Magical Systems: It is nice to think out the rules and restrictions of any fictional system, and fun to try to exploit the holes in those rules. This is the classic "Weaknesses, limits, and costs are more important than powers" rule from Sanderson. Canon Harry Potter falls into the "rule of cool" way too often. Thus, Magical Cores.

Culture Clash: There is something interested about the interactions of an isolated culture that has its own standards, and how that would be resolved. HP Kind of glosses over it all (Wizards are declared to be super-isolated, but then somehow pick up all sorts of modern technology to be adapted and such). This is mostly a missed opportunity: Canon never really explained why the wizarding world was the way it was. Thus, the lords and ladies concept.

Character Bashing: It is quite natural to note that there are character flaws that are not explored very deeply, and there are character archtypes that are never really introduced to the wizarding world. Thus the bashing.

​

Just because these are good areas for fanfiction to explore, doesn't mean they are done well. Standard rule of fanfiction: 90% is crap. I have read good fics that explore a characters flaws, but most fics I read end up just being the author on a soapbox bashing canon. I've read good fics that try to expand on the muggle/wizard culture clash or try to place limits/explain the HP system of magic, but most of them just slap on a framework and go "Hey, problem solved"

** Agreed 100 percent. A lot of fanon tropes are just a pain to slog through, mostly because they're almost always used the same way. Magic Cores and power rituals are just a cheap and easy way for Harry to rival or surpass Voldemort and Dumbledore. Magic Aristocracy is used as a way for characters to be "better" than others.

I never see fanon tropes used to develop the story or the characters, they just serve as shortcuts to world building and wish fulfillment, function over form.

** I don't know why people just pick up a trope and interpret it as if it's always used in the same way.

A Magical peerage system is not that out of place for a society that still has roots in Victorian England and never went through the Revolutions. But I agree that reading and controlling other people through their "auras" is just boring.

I have never read/seen magical auras used in any way that wasn't to just perceive if one had a spell or charm placed upon them. Or by Luna.

And on people using the lineage to make a wizard more powerful or something, well, I don't see the problem, maybe not powerful because they are the Head of House or Lord, but because all his ancestors were on average, powerful wizards? Maybe it's random too, since the last generations of Gaunts were very weak magically.

JKR may say it so, but it`s not a far cry to imply that even in canon, not all wizards are equal? What makes Dumbledore so powerful? Or Tom Riddle? Or Gellert Grindelwald? It wasn't just the Elder Wand. And yet these guys were just above their peers, was it training, study? Or talent? And what defines talent? Blood? Chance?

It could be said that some wizards are just born more powerful than the rest, regardless of lineage.

I find no trouble in many tropes people complain about when they are used in a good and exaggerated way for the good of the story.

*** It's one thing if the writer in question actually makes it part of the story, but every example of magical peerage I've ever seen reads as pretentious self indulgence from the characters disguised as sophistication from the writer. What does making Lucius Malfoy a Lord do for the story? What is he Lord of? Would the story be exactly the same if he wasn't a Lord of [Data Not Found]? More often than not I get no answers to those questions, it's just taken as a matter of fact that rich English people must be nobles. Tywin Lannister wasn't just Lord of the Westerlands for shits and giggles, it shaped his life and defined who he was. I'm not asking for George R. R. Martin levels of detail, just expand on a concept you decided to add to the story.

Some wizards are more powerful than others, in the same way a linebacker is stronger than a baker. Life is intrinsically unfair, everyone's got natural talents others don't, and some people, like Dumbledore and Tom Riddle, rolled Nat 20s when it came to understanding magic as a whole. But by and large magic is portrayed and taught as a skill you develop and understand as you get older, which is more interesting to some people than having a larger power level just because. Not saying you or anyone else can't have it your way, but for some of us it looks boring.

That was exactly my point. I wasn't defending power through blood I was saying canon doesn't support the "all wizards have equal power"

***** I don't think that's what people have a problem with. I think it's more how the idea is expressed, often through what I can only describe as Shonen logic. Harry getting stronger through study, imagination, and experience is fine; Harry getting stronger through rituals and increasing his 'magical core' is anime talk. From a technical point of view all wizards and witches are equal, in that they can cast the same spells and produce the same results with sufficient practice, but experience and innate talent are what separate them, not blood, legacy, or power levels.

I think it depends on how the rituals work? Magical core bullshit is a no, no.

But a ritual to increase his reflexes? A ritual to make him physically stronger? A ritual to fix his eyesight? Make him more resistant to certain poisons? (All within reason, not super strength, just peak human)

I think those fit general magic, it doesn't fit canon because JKR did a whole lot to distance HP from paganism to avoid the Bible Patrol, but, I think it would fit a magical system to have rituals to improve or fix your physical body. All with the law of equivalent exchange in mind though.

Voldemort did a ritual to build him a new body, I don't see a problem with rituals for other things, as long as it's within reasons.

For me, blanket banning tropes is not the solution, normally fics that misuse those have a slew of other problems that make them hard to read or bad stories.

******* I agreed wholesale. Tropes are tools, how you use them is what matters. It's just that some writers are more interested in making the characters overpowered parodies of themselves, and they constantly use the same tropes to do it. Makes it hard to take those same tropes seriously when you see them used poorly so many times.

**** Well they Malfoys we're lords coming over with William the conquerer they would likely be gifted a Barony and that land stuck with the family and is the reason for their wealth. They were said to be a key player at court so were almost defiantly lords or had some type of peerage.

** As far as the title of Lord is concerned, hereditary peerage is still part of the British government. The House of Lords still contains individuals who are sitting on seats that they inherited, without being elected by the populace. As far as the feudal nature of Wizarding Society is concerned, one need only research the Witenagemot from the 7th - 11th centuries to see the institution that JKR modeled the Wizengamot after.

In the British legal system, judges are referred to as my Lord or my lady depending on their appointment. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that Lords and Ladies are more common in British verbiage than you think.

Portraying Wizarding society in a feudal manner with Lordships and all that is just another way of showing a fictional, fantastic version of British Society in the past. And honestly, when we read the books, didn't it seem to us that Wizarding Society was stuck in the 16th century? The only thing missing is a proper monarchy.

As far as the power level of Lords and Ladies are concerned, I look at it this way. The implication is that as a Lord or Lady, you definitely have more /money/ than the common folk, so why wouldn't you have more power? The titles are inherited through the blood, so why wouldn't the power be inherited the same?

On the subject of auras and reading them, I played too much Vampire the Masquerade to really be upset about the ability to gauge someone's truthfulness, intentions or relative power level from their aura. Seems legit. Those darn kids and all the wacky things that they're doing with pretend, made up magic these days.

** There was a message?

The whole blood supremacy thing had nothing to do with actual literal purity of blood. It was a social class asserting their dominance, nothing more. Halfbloods and mundane born witches and wizards are 'lesser' because they aren't raised fully within that society, and any difference in outcomes is down to the purebloods enforcing their own privilege over them.

Obvious, really. How easy is it for a kid who grew up in a magical household to come into school knowing the basic theory behind what they're about to be taught? How much less do they struggle when they are effectively immune to the restriction on underage magic due to living in households where it is impossible to detect them casting, so they can practice at home on breaks?

How easy is it to keep pushing this viewpoint when the good jobs go to the purebloods, and most of the mundane born witches and wizards go back to the normal world after graduation where they can have a real career?
