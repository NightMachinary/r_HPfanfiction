*** Sadly, they pulled their material a little while back.

I'd direct you to any number of harem fics which might qualify, except that their authors don't realize that their version of Harry is evil.

Beyond that, there's this:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8190004/1/The-Star-Alliance][The Star Alliance]] by RahXephon

The year is 2599 and the Hogwarts Training Fleet of Witchcraft, Wizardry and Space Travel is accepting the latest batch of magician cadets. A bewildered Harry Potter enters a world of starships, intrigue and interspecies war while exploring new worlds and meeting diverse alien races. Yet will the human race be able to maintain its monopoly on magic? Sci-fi space era AU.

Again, author isn't quite clear that his Main Character is evil, but he is an acknowledged asshole (the character I mean- I know nothing about the author's possible ass-holish qualities).

***** It happened at the beginning of March (or at least that's when I discovered it). Hearsay indicated that at least one of the authors was turning pro and didn't want the fanfiction stigma affecting his chances at getting published.

****** Actually it was simply the result of a tantrum.

The author had an IRC channel that myself and a few others used to hang out in on a regular basis. After about a year or so without logging in I thought I'd go back over to say hi, catch up, see how people were doing etc.

He banned me from the channel as soon as he came online. I still have absolutely no idea why. I can only imagine that it was some kind of fit of jealousy based on my frequenting DLP instead of sticking with his dead IRC channel.

Anyway, in response to this betrayal I may have trolled the hell out of him. In response he pulled all his fics from FF.Net.

******* Just so we're clear, it was your childish tantrum and subsequent trolling that caused it?

I think most non-mustache-twirling villains think they're in the right. They've self justified their own actions. Is there anything in particular about them that makes them unintentionally /evil/? or are they just asshats? I haven't made it past the first chapter or 3 of this sort of fic yet and I'm curious

***** In many of the harem stories, our 'hero' is blessed with some sort of unusual power that permits him to assume control over any number of witches, all of whom join into the brood due to subtle adjustments of their attitudes towards sex and polyamory. Whether it's a life debt, the radiant effect of Harry's aura of power (with that 9000+ magic core) or simply because once he's had them, they want nothing more than to serve his urges ... it's all magical subjugation.

I don't have a problem with characters sleeping around, or even forming a true polyamorous trio (if properly developed)- so long as the witches keep their wits and their own interests alive.

There's something really pitiable when the writer feels that any woman who has been bedded by the main character should now permanently become part of his menagerie. How rejected one must feel to insist that the fantasy partner is henceforth incapable of saying 'no' or betraying them or even simply leaving them?

****** Wouldn't /evil/ imply that /Harry/ is doing that to them with malice aforethought? It's not, strictly speaking, the /character's/ fault that they exist in a world who's author has dictated that that's how magical people work... But yeah... that seems sketchy at best.
