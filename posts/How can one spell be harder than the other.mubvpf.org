I'd like an explanation of why some wizard and witches are more powerful than others. Like, why can't most cast a decent shield charm, for example.

I mean, what does talent in transfiguration, or charms even entail?


** Okay, so I hand you a 1x2, a hand saw, and some wood glue. Make me a picture frame. Barring actual physical infirmity, everyone can do it. It'll look like crap, but you can do it. Hand those same tools to someone whose been practicing their woodworking for 20 years and they'll make you a better frame faster than anyone else can.

I did quite well in math courses in high school and college. Give me a integral problem right now, and I have serious doubts I'd be able to do anything with it. I wouldn't even know where to start. Give me a integral problem and a high school calculus textbook and I could probably work it out eventually. But give that exact same problem to high school me? No sweat.

Why should magic be any different? Why can't most cast a decent shield charm? The real question is why would they be able to! And if they don't need to cast the spell, why would they have practiced diligently?

** I always assumed that practicing Magic was a mental excercice, comparable (while not being the same) to doing Math. Basic spells are like simple Calculus (2+2) while the most advanced one are like the kind of equation people with PhD in Math must deal with.

** Your question is the same as to why some torture a piano simply looking at it, and some are Lang-Lang. I actually don't know if there is a satisfying answer in science on "what is talent". In everyday use, though, it simply means you have an "intuitive grasp", things "make sense to you" when looking at it once, it "comes easy to you" etc.

I see no issue extending this to the use of magic. Some people struggle to produce much of anything. For others, it's all there at their fingertips. And all this is of course excluding theory, which is perhaps the most directly comparable situation, to any IRL theory, Maths, Physics, ... Such theory is abstract, explaining connections and deeper issues. Some grasp this at once or even develop their own ideas. Others are happy if they can follow along recipes to use, and simply are unable to comprehend the theory.

** I always assumed mages harnessed the energies of the world around them to do magic. In my mind, a difference in power refers to the amount of energy a person can draw within themselves, as well as the ability to convert that energy into something you control, in order to use it productively.

Some magic requires more power, which is why some people struggle. Their lack in power might be counteracted by the application of what power they do have, however.

** Well from what I gathered in the books, magic is kind of about concentration and intent, so it depends on how much you concentrate and want it ? Thats seems to be the case with accidental magic in children and the crucio.

Apparently some spells need more magic than other spells, or i like to think that they need you to be more in control of your magic. Hence why first years are taught simple spells, and the patronus i.e is more for the newt level. It doesn't mean one can't cast it (harry did) but you need to put more effort ? It seems like it was easier to cast by the D.A members in 5th year.

Maybe it means someone is more confortable doing that kind of magic. The books made it sound like transfiguration was kind if difficult ? So i guess it's just like in normal life when some prefer maths over history or something like that. The more you like something, the easier it comes to you because you enjoy doing it and put more effort in it.

I don't know if there is such thing as "amount of magic" in a person. Some witches and wizard are more powerful than others we can't deny it. ( take Dumbledore and Voldemort as an exemple) but was it because of their magic or did it come with hard work ? No idea.

** How is playing football/soccer "harder" than playing a violin? Anybody can learn to cook dinner, but not everybody has the creativity to be a chef.

People have different natural talents. You can improve on a natural talent (high or low) with practice, but there's a limit to how much improvement you can achieve. Somebody with a low talent but lots of practice can still lose to a talented amateur.

In your example, however, a shield spell is more difficult because it takes SUSTAINED effort. It's not a cast-once-and-it's-set: you have to hold the spell the entire time you want to be shielded.

** I'd like an explanation too!

Cannon really doesn't go in any depth about it but there are some hints that it may simply be a psychological thing so in my Headcanon it all depends in brain power.

That's the reason Hermione is such a powerful witch, because she can comprehend the theory better than others and therefore is easier for her to cast, this also applies to Harry in a slightly different manner. Being able to comprehend a spell allows Hermione the necessary confidence and emotional stability to cast it, on the contrary Harry doesn't really need to understand it he simply believes it will happen. This works on and off for Harry in classes but makes him a good wizard in battle where he has no time to doubt himself.

Continuing with my Headcanon I believe spells can be more or less complex in theory depending on things like Gamp's Laws and whatever magical theory there are teaching in those classes and how they were created.

So technically transfiguration of a match into a needle would be psychologically less difficult to imagine than the transfiguration of a rabbit into a house for example. They require the same amount of magic but different levels of conviction and/or discipline. Hermione is able to accomplish this by the understanding of transfigurations laws, wand movements and incantations and how they interact. Harry would be able to accomplish this by try and error and a superficial understanding.

Of course my Headcanon is rather vague and may not make sense depending on what are you applying it for...

** Maybe they use spell slots? Like if a spell is level 2 it requires a spell slot of 2 and you only get a spell slot of 2 when you've learned a specific amount of or practiced a certain spell long enough.

Say you cast burning hands 100 times you now know it enough to cast Scorching Ray's.

** Well maybe they can't keep track of all the different wand motions for a wide range of spells?

For the Patronus it is explained that you need to focus on a happy memory which becomes increasingly difficult when Dementors are sucking the happiness from you so that requires a lot of willpower. The Unforgivables also require you to "mean them" and I think that implies you've actually got to want someone to die and not because of a moment of anger but because you really want them dead... which most normal people don't wish upon others. The summoning spell requires you to have a vivid image in your head of the target and someone not paying attention to details or with a wandering mind may not be able to properly cast it. The shield charm weirdly enough does not appear to be part of the curriculum as this is one of the self-taught spells by Harry in preparation for the Third Task. He later teaches it to the DA and Snape, who asks them to use it in his class, is surprised that so many people know how to cast it. So with it I think it's a matter of people not learning it in school and since they mostly experienced peaceful times until Voldemort's wars (prior to which he cursed the DADA position) it's probably that they never bothered much with knowing it.
