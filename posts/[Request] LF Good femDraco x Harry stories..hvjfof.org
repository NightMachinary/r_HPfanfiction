I was reading that prompt(trying to write for it even) and I can't recall any good fem!Draco stories, so I would like to see some.

And before someone says 'Just read some HarryxDaphne' (lol) that's not what I want, I would like to see some conflict over her parents and/or allies if possible.

Would accept some fluff pieces too.

No slash involving Harry, please.


** I read one where Draco is sent back in time turns into a girl and rescues Harry from the Dursley's

  Draco Malfoy died at the venerable age of 107, and who awaited him at the crossroads? His mother? His wife? No, it had to be his eccentric former rival, eventual best friend, and far too often partner in chaos Harry Potter. Oh, and of course he had a deal to offer Draco to live his life anew, and obviously there was a caveat to it all that he wasn't privy to, damn Potters.Fem!Draco
