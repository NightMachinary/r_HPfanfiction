So tasty that Harry never forgot its juicy taste. He is quite disappointed that there are no burgers in the wizarding world so he decides to open a burger joint on Diagon Alley. The business is a massive success... so successful that people start attacking it during the closed hours demanding for more burgers. Turns out there is a reason for why the burgers were banned from the wizarding world in the first place.

When Voldemort summons his Death Eaters to announce his return and show them how he'll kill Harry, the Death Eaters form a wall around Harry for he is the only one that the knows the secret to their juicy happiness.

*** I was craving a burger after reading through HP to discuss a point with a user. But yes. Also, funny you say this, but I think Sabrina has the most consistent magic to the HP universe. Sad they don't appear in xovers more often.

** As Voldemort tries to gain followers, the burgers attack him. It got to a point when Voldemort stood in front of a boggart, he sees the burgers.

Legend states that Harry impales Voldemort with a fry in front of the Diagon Alley in front of his story, The Burger Who Lives.
