  Harry Potter is dead. In the aftermath of the war, in order to strengthen the might of the magical world, Voldemort enacts a repopulation effort. Hermione Granger has an Order secret locked away in her mind. She is sent as an enslaved surrogate to the High Reeve, to be bred and monitored until it can be accessed.

**** The [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/940338/chapters/1832675][Survivors Guilt series]] is a canon-compliant set of fics that give you Sirius' side of the story after he is captured for supposedly killing James, Lily, and Peter. It goes through his years in azkaban and later the events of POA. The second part of the series is about Remus' story starting from POA with lots of flashbacks. The plot is essentially the same as that of the books except the author fills in the gaps of things we didn't see. It's also really great especially if you like angst, but it is very explicit with the slash and there are a few warnings with that. Probably my all-time favorite canon-compliant fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1145357/chapters/2318859#main][Teenage Kicks]] is a fic meant to span from 1978-1996 and the start runs through the first war with voldemort. This fic has my absolute favorite characterization of James, everything about the him feels so authentic and non-idolized. I'm also a big fan of Regulus' story and that is also explored in this fic. However, it is not complete, yet. The author takes quite some time between updates but she is still working on it. I have to say that her writing style is addictive and entirely worth the wait, though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/927712/chapters/1803877][Common Woodbrown]] is about Remus realizing Sirius is innocent and working to get him out of azkaban. Short but really good.

If you're up for something really (and I mean /really/) long, there is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]] which starts from Remus' first year at Hogwarts. Only difference with this fic is that Remus grew up as a muggle in a pretty bad orphanage(think Tom Riddle). The fic is over 500k words so it requires quite a bit of dedication to get through it.

Also, seconding The Debt of Time.

#+begin_quote
  1981-94: From the unbearable torments of Azkaban to a life on the run, Sirius has known little peace in twelve years. But when he comes to Hogwarts looking for Harry and Peter, he finds Remus, the man who could break his heart or save his life. A retelling of Prisoner of Azkaban from Sirius's point of view. Heavy in Marauders-era and First War flashbacks.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione sent her memories and powers back to her 2 years old self in 1981. Both hilarity and heartbreaking moments ensued. This fic is an excellent example of time traveler maximizing the benefits of their future knowledge.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]], linkffn(4586362): James survived, and he and his friends made them pay dearly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry got thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. This is my favorite Marauder Era fic, even though the second half plays out again in 1998, and Hermione still makes a major appearance.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): AU after Year 4. Due to different circumstances, Hermione was forced to become an effective and ruthless guerrilla leader. Harry, Ron, Dumbledore, and Sirius all have their great moments however.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): Adorably lonely Hermione summons demons as friends, and makes ally with both Harry and Voldemort.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This fic is a little controversial as it's set in a non magical sci-fi AU. If you can't over that, you will find it a great read. I at least like its plot a lot better than canon, especially beginning with Year 4.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Hermione time travel to Marauder Era from James Potter's POV. Very unique outcome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred and Sixty Nine]], linkffn(8581093): Another Hermione time travel to 1981. But unexpected complications arose.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Harry time travel to 1991 from Hermione's POV. Harry defeated Voldemort and his minions quickly and effectively, but that doesn't mean he would have it easy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU in which Lucius Malfoy managed to outmaneuver Dumbledore after Halloween 1981. Dumbledore and his remaining followers had to flee for France, but they would have their revenge 18 years.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Hermione makes new friends at Hogwarts -- and one lifelong enemy -- with her newfound love for proper skin and hair care. The wizarding world will be changed forever! A silly idea turned serious, and dedicated to those who skim read the title of my fic "Hermione Granger, Demonologist" a bit too fast. Hermione POV, humour, no pairings, complete.
