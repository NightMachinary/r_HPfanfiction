Hello Fandom!

I am currently plotting out a canon divergence story that I want to try my hand at writing. I'm pretty nervous though. I've written in several other fandoms I enjoy (Daria, Worm, X-Files), but Harry Potter always intimidates me. It is so easy to get it wrong (be it world building, magic portrayal, or just assumptions one might make as an American writer for a story set in United Kingdom).

All of that said, I like to think I am going about things the right way (write way). I've identified my point of departure from the established story and I feel like it should have sufficient ripples that I will fairly quickly divorce myself from a good number of the stations of canon.

If I had a specific question for this sub, it would be this: Is it better to attempt to complete a book/year before posting anything? Daria was a short format cartoon. X-Files a serialized television series. Worm is a web serial. In all of those cases the format of the source material lends itself well to a fanfiction that is published a chapter at a time. For a Harry Potter story (particularly one which may require more active revision than normal due to all of the factors cited above), is it better to publish as it goes, or to try and drop a year at a time?


** Nah, it's usually done a chapter at a time like a webnovel and that's what we're used to. It may not be unwise to build up a year at once so you can have some buffer to maintain regular, fast updates at the beginning (audience getting bored in-between updates because you're updating too slowly is a very real risk), but posting an entire year at once would definitely be a waste.

** I would suggest having a buffer of an arc or at least a couple of chapters in case you are unable to write for a couple of weeks. Have a solid structure of main events that are going to happen in the fic and on other details you can be as flexible as you like based on readers input.

My advice on the plot is not to include any cannon events such as the Stone,Chamber,Prison Break/Dementors, tournament or Umbridge as the main plots if you are writing from the beginning. Have a proper teacher introduce Harry to the magical world and please make Harry not just being wondered about magic but also making an effort to learn it to make his life better back home. He need not be a Super! Harry but at least a harry who realizes that his life is in genuinely in danger and that he has to learn to protect him self and that adults are not to be trusted with his safety after growing up in an abusive home. Sorry for the tangent/rant. All the best with the fic.
