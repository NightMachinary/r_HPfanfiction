I JUST FINISHED [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26364097][THIS]] FIC AND OMGOMGOMG ! All I can say is I 100% recommend it and that I am dying to fill the gaping hole finishing this fic has left me with. You know when you read something so amazing you mourn it being finished while simultaneously being so thankful you decided to read it? Yeah, that.

So if you have recommendations for anything like it (or even just a single similar thing i.e Voldemort's characterization, his complex relationship with Harry, Voldemort being a mentor, or Harry's grey-ness etc etc. (Sorry if I've spoiled something big in my excitement, if someone who has read it thinks it's too spoiler-y pls let me know so I can edit it.)

I don't like Snarry, Tomarry, (really any big age-gap or adult/minor ships tbh), Dramione, and I'm not a huge fan of Hinny. I'd like it to be slash but that's not a requirement because I actually like a wide variety of ships of all kinds and I don't want to limit myself too much.


** Hey thanks for the rec!
