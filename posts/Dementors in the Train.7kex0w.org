If I were Harry, I would sue. For a lot. Like, so much, he could retire immediately without having to work a day in his life. Actually, a class action lawsuit with multiple classmates.


** Who are you going to sue, though, exactly? I'm not sure the wizarding world's legal system has a concept of suing the legal system itself. I don't think so. Or are you going to sue the Dementors? Good luck with that --- inasmuch as the Ministry treats them as people at all (and they're really more like attack dogs to them), they're more of a different people in a treaty of subservience than they are citiziens that you could actually sue.

All this being said, I do see where you're coming from.

** Harry sues the Ministry. They award him damages in the form of 250 Dementors and their home in the North Sea. Harry leaves school to act as Warden of Azkaban.

** Actually, this brings up something I never thought about. Why I never thought about it, I have no idea.

What if the Dementors /had/ Kissed a student? On the train? That's a pretty interesting canon divergence point.

** Sure you could sue the Dementor, but how much money do you think a Dementor actually has? I seriously doubt it has insurance.

*** Canadian, actually. And having soul-sucking monsters in a train filled with children isn't exactly a responsible act. I mean, it's pretty stupid. Any sensible person would have convicted the person responsible for letting the dementors running free.

**** It's not the idea that the guilty should be punished, it's the idea that an individual should receive money from that, that is so "American".

***** Uh huh, and what exactly is your point, here? You realize that there's a reason suing is a good reason for negligence, yes? It dissuades others from repeating the same mistake for whoever the fool let out the Dementors in the first place.

Student Liam Allan sued after rape trial collapse, where he was accused of rape which fell apart after evidence came to light. Problem is, the police hid the evidence for a long time, causing psychological and emotional problems for the kid, his family, and his personal and public life.

This kid is British and he sued the court and crown in London. There isn't anything 'American' about it. Whoever thought so is a fool with not an ounce of common sense in them.

***** Americas. You should have added the 's' at the end. Being clearer would help.
