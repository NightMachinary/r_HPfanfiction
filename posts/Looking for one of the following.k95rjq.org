-HP fic that has premise, events, setting similar to the book/movie [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89OP78l9oF0][Annihilation]].

-Crossover fic between Harry Potter and Annihilation (yeah, I get that this one would be trickier...)

I'd really appreciate anything like that.


** I loved the book, I'm trying to think if there's anything in the HP fandom that's even remotely similar.

Song of the Trees, maybe? It has that mysterious vibe about it.

  DH disregarded. Damaged by the war, Harry flees everything that used to be familiar to him and instead roams the night, haunted by unsolvable questions -- what truly killed Voldemort? And what lurks in the Forbidden Forest, where the trees seem alive?

*** Thanks, seems interesting. Pity that the author hasn't come back to the story since 2015...
