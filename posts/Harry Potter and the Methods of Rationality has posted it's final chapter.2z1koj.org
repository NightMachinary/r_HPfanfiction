I know there are some people who have problems with this fic, but that doesn't change the fact that it's the most well recieved Harry Potter fanfic out there.

If you were waiting for it to be finished before reading, now's your time.

If you haven't read it yet, be sure to give it a look.


** Well, I read through everything that had been posted to that point about a year ago. I remember there was a big gap in posting from December 2013 to sometime last summer, but I haven't picked it up since. I suppose I'll get around to it at some point, but I've got waay too many stories I haven't touched yet.

** I got as far as Harry asking McGonagall to come up with a random word in Hebrew as they're walking in Diagon Alley and gave up.

I'm really mistrustful of pessimistic circlejerks, but I strongly suspect this fic just isn't for me. Thanks to this subreddit for the heads up.

** I know that this is probably an extremely trivial question to those of you who have dedicated an awful lot of time to read 660K+ words, but I noticed the tag is Harry and Hermione. It's really shallow of me as a reader, but I really don't like like taking chances on fics that don't feature my preferred pairing.

I've heard what happens in chapter 89 and I was just wondering if that tag is still truthful. If it is I'll give it a shot.

*** Well, if you're worried about shipping, you don't need to be. Harry is 11 in this fic, and /stays/ 11 for the whole fic. There's no shipping in it. The story is tagged for Harry and Hermione because they're the main characters.

**** Not /entirely/ true. They do have not only a friendship, but a closer-than-just-friends friendship for most of the book. It was setting them up for future relationship.

That said, I've only read to chapter 101 and am actively working on finishing this fic, so I shouldn't even be reading this in case someone ruins the ending. It's a LOT of reading to have it ruined by a random spoiler. :)

** An epilogue is coming (but not soon), but the author said this is the complete experience and the epilogue will just be an extra. A list of omakes of alternate Final Exam solutions is coming soonish too.

This was a great ending IMO, most of the things I hated about Harry in this story were successfuly character-developed.

** Sometimes it really saddens me to see the hatred poured out to this story.

I was around when the Weasley twins sung the Ghost Busters' theme to Harry's march got hastily edited out, and when most people thought HPMOR was just some adventure/crackfic with SCIENCE!

It seems to me that the great popularity the story has achieved - and yes, questionable publicity stunts - has led people to look upon it as some kind of attempt at a meteoric work of art, and criticize accordingly. To these people I'd like to remind that HPMOR is first and foremost a fanfiction, which we love and spend much of our waking days on, and for that... well, it's more than good enough.

Also, many of the 'problems' people point out with the story does get addressed later in the story, so I'd like to advise people that suspension of belief is yet a reading technique. While it's never worth forcing yourself to read a story, there's no harm in giving it a try.

Why do so many people assume that if someone criticizes something then s/he must be hating it? This creates an image of a hateful person instead of one who just doesn't like certain things about the item they are criticizing.

HPMoR has its problems regardless of how you chose to view it --- in context with everything that comes from Yudkowsky's corrosive personality or dis-attached from it.

For instance, while [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/search?q=rationality&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all][many people said]] that they didn't like the book for its preachy nature, that was exactly what /I/ liked about it. I saw that the author was consciously trying to tap into HP's popularity, but I hoped that the story would eventually develop into something that would be 1. introducing its readers to the scientific world and make them interested in it; 2. making its readers more rational by exposing various fallacies and misjudgements that our brains are prone to fall into; and 3. influencing its readers and people in general to be more tolerable and less hateful towards each other. I don't know how much has Yudkowsky changed the first chapters now, but back then the story [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgMO6eGi9VEhdEJLdmllQldjWTgwYld3SU1CLWpVWVE#gid=0][was doing exactly this]].

Then, alas, this story's Harry became a Mary Sue not for the sake of introducing and explaining all these concepts but only for explaining just how powerful, smart, and awesome this Harry was. Harry himself became rather irrational in those of his choices that mattered the most, making the story lose its integrity. Harry --- and story's narrative in general --- also became more and more intolerant of those who possessed less logical intelligence than Harry and his friends did.

So I think part of this “hatred” comes from disappointment rather than the author's antics.

I think this idea that HPMOR has attracted hate groups can be traced to Yudkowsky. He's [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2n3yh5/what_is_it_with_dark_lord_potter_and_hpmor/cmad6x3][attributed]] criticism of his fanfic to "sneer clubs":

#+begin_quote
  Dark Lord Potter (I infer) aggregated as a Sneer Club targeted at Harry Potter fics they considered inferior, mated with a self-conceptualized elite fanfiction forum for properly dark, gritty, adult HP fics - the most elite HP forum on the Internet, or so they considered themselves. HPMOR came along and was critically acclaimed by mainstream authors despite not (then) being dark and gritty, and it was by an outsider. So the sneering club encountered something that seemed to threaten their status. There is also a common attitude that nerds are designated bullying-targets; or to write it out at slightly greater length, people who talk about science are acting like they think they're snootier than you, which is especially deserving of a slapdown since the person is probably just some nerd in their mother's basement...

  The natural response of a low-Dark-Triad non-bully who encounters HPMOR and doesn't enjoy it is to stop reading it, maybe with a small note of gratitude to the author for warning them in advance to give up if it wasn't fun by chapter ten. To /hate hate hate/ a vegetable stew and everyone who ever said they liked it, you need to have something else going on inside your head besides having tasted the stew and having said "bleah" that one time.
#+end_quote

By referring to criticism of HPMOR as hatred, fans are just following Yudkowsky's lead.

My [[http://www.reddit.com/r/badmathematics/comments/2bazyc/0_and_1_are_not_probabilities_any_more_than/cj43y8k][experience]] with non-fanfic-related criticism of Yudkowsky is that he's quick to jump to accusations of hatred and bullying.

***** This is why I really should not read too much about the authors of fiction I like. I really enjoyed reading HPMOR. I don't think it was perfect but neither was canon. At the same time, however, I've heard enough about the author to make me think he really isn't a very good guy. It's sad really. Same reason I can't read Orson Scott Card's books without feeling a bit guilty.

#+end_quote

I mean, it's not like people are claiming that all criticism of HPMOR is hatred. I think the claim is that there exists hatred of HPMOR, and that there's a surprising amount of it.

For example, take a look at the thread "[[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2u2vhl/final_arc_of_harry_potter_the_methods_of/][Final arc of Harry Potter & the Methods of Rationality is finally underway!]]". Not a lot of the phrasing explicitly says hatred, but nearly every comment is critical of the story, and in a manner that doesn't come across as literary criticism. Some examples (all of these are from upvoted comments):

19 upvotes:

#+begin_quote
  The fic was horrible and the author is very arrogant.
#+end_quote

7 upvotes:

#+begin_quote
  I hope it doesn't make the list of recommended fic on TV tropes.
#+end_quote

5 upvotes:

#+begin_quote
  This is the best fanfiction news I've heard in a long time.

  No, really. *I hate the story* and think the author comes off as complete douche. It's just that I can't wait for him to leave the fandom and then we can all stop having to tolerate his legion of fanboys pimping this story at literally every opportunity.
#+end_quote

However, to be fair, I have to admit that a lot of extremely valid criticism is unjustly considered hatred by people that really, /really/ like the story. For example, I think this guy in the comment thread for the last HPMOR chapter is likely to react a little bit more emotionally to criticism of the story than I might:

#+begin_quote
  Kind of a lengthy comment, but the ending has me emotionally charged in both good and bad ways.

  I'm crying, sobbing, even as I was reading and now as I type this.
