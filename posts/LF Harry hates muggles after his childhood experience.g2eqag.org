I am sure there must be some, but I don't know of them.

I am looking for fics where Harry's experiences of childhood in Little Whinging (Dursleys, other children, other adults, etc) cause him to hate muggles, or at the very least have zero interest in protecting them.

He might be okay with Muggleborn - maybe he pities them more than anything else.

I can see a grey-side Harry. He thinks magic and anyone with magic is special and all those without magic are spiteful and abusive (Dursleys, Fitch!). So not fully on V's side but totally okay with wiping out or dominating muggles. But this is just a thought - happy to see this in a fully Dark Harry.

I am hoping to see interesting takes on the idea. Bonus if it is a short story or timeline. Double bonus if Dumbledore realizes and regrets he caused this by allowing Harry's getting abused.

Edit --- Thank you all for your suggestions. I think I haven't read a single one of these before! I will go through them one at a time. You've given me a nice project to keep me occupied while in seclusion. Thanks again!

*** This occurred to me, but I am unclear on Grindelwald's ideology, or what it became.

Was his plan to weaken the muggles through WW2, before stepping into the aftermath openly as a Wizard who could dominate them easily, or maybe save them with magic? Or was it something else entirely?

About Dumbledore's early thoughts, I am even less clear. I am totally guessing that it ran along the line of ‘benign caretakers' on the wizarding side, and I wasn't thinking of any ‘benign' in Harry's attitude towards Muggles.

**** Grindelwald and Dumbledore wanted to abolish the Statute of Secrecy and bring the wizards out of hiding. They believed that wizards were naturally superior to those without magic and so wanted wizards (namely themselves) to rule over muggles for the /greater good/ of the muggles themselves.

  Gellert ---

  Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES' OWN GOOD --- this, I think, is the cru­cial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)

This is entirely fanon.

Even the Fantastic Beasts movies don't say this. In the movies, Grindelwald seems entirely focused on building up his base and finding a way to kill Dumbledore. The only reference to WW2 is that he has a prophecy that predicts the war and the nuclear bombings. Nothing to state that he was involved in causing it yet.

That is ridiculous. What gives you the right to rule over someone even if you are more capable than them? Just because you might be better in one thing than them doesn't give you the right to rule over them.

You say that's by nature, but you couldn't be more far from wrong. In true, human, nature, you would be kind and helpful and stick together. Humans prospered not because of their strength alone, but together.

A human who tried to force their rule over others, both then and now, no matter their strength, would be left behind. In old times, probably to die because you CANNOT survive on your own, and in these times, probably worse like drugs and suicide and depression and lonliness.

***** YES IT IS A TRAGEDY.

You know how in Romeo and Juliet, or in Code Geass, everything that could go wrong often did go wrong.

Like when Juliet faked her own death, the message to romeo of the truth was delayed, so Romeo thought that she had died and killed himself on her tomb. And Juliet woke at just the wrong time, not too early or too late, and saw the dead romeo and killed herself too. Or the Euphemia moment from Code Geass.

Anyways, this is definitely a tragedy. I remember, near the very end of this series, there was a tiny little chance for stopping the entire gruesome end, but it was blown and it felt SO unfair.

**** There are some interesting discussions about this topic in the later chapters, the older Harry gets, and the more Voldemort's present and his ideals overshadow Harry's and his schoolmates' time, the more relevant it becomes. It is never "I want to kill all the muggles" but expresses itself in more subtle ways (how he thinks/talks about the Dursleys and Voldemort's ideas for the Wizarding World). It's a good fic that only gets better and more original in the later chapters. (I think my favourite parts started in year 5, but I did enjoy the rest as well). Did you read any other Sylterhin or anti-muggle-Harry fics in the meantime that you could recommend?

***** I will keep reading. It is an interesting study on how a Slytherin!Harry might play out.

The only story I would certainly recommend in this vein is linkffn(6206646), but it is not a 'bloody-violence' sort. The follow-on story is also quite good but is not really focused on anti-muggle (though it includes it as a primary background).

I am looking to see if any of the "revenge" fic recommendations have something like this, but of course most are focussed on anti-wizards of one sort or another.

** I really liked the first Ninja Story. It was imaginative and presented ideas/scenes in a pretty tight way. It was only the second story that was so off, and more towards the beginning that the end.

The sentiment was fine, and actually the ideas and support were a nice twist. It was the presentation, making the first maybe 5 chapters (I don't remember when it stopped) read like some political polemic, just extended presentations that go on far too long linked together by some story beats.

The main problem character was Hermione. There never seemed to be any resolution or hint of anything happening from her horribleness. It was just the same thing over and over again without much point. It got so grating.

I am not anti-bashing, but after this constant chronic low-stakes one-note negative characterization I am starting to see why some people are against bashing. It just does the same thing over and over again over some 30 chapters so far that leads nowhere.

There is also negative stuff about Ron here but it is not just the same thing over and over, and most of it is woven into the story for humor or showing that his failing is mostly not thinking rather than genuine hurtfulness.

There are others with constant niggling issues, but it is not so frequent nor so grating, and I can sort of see them serving as reminders that people just don't think, and that someone might be playing with people's minds.
