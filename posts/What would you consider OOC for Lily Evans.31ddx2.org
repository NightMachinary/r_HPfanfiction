I've really wanted to write a long fic about Lily that's set right after she joins the Order. But one of the things holding me back is my worry that people won't like my version of Lily because she's a lot more flawed than most fanon versions of Lily Evans.

It will honestly be discouraging if people say oh it's so OOC, she's too __ or too ___, just not how I pictured her.

James obviously isn't a perfect person, and I don't think Lily was either. I see her as just as flawed as James.

Like I've got this picture in my head of Lily Evans, but I think it might be very different from what most people think. To me, she's this somewhat anxious person who has this need to fix people (like Snape) though obviously it comes from a place of love. She can be mean when she wants to be. She's a good person and a Gryffindor, but she's a little bit less rigid than James. For example, she's more okay with playing the spy or even with something that could be considered a little bit more morally ambigious.

For example, I read a fic where Sirius said that he and Lily would team up to infiltrate something like a Death Eater watering hole and that Lily was good at getting information, but that James didn't have the poker face for that stuff, he was more of a smash+grab guy. Which made a lot of sense to me. It kind of stuck with me as an image of Lily.

But I think that's hard for some fans because Lily is usually drawn as almost perfect.

So the question is, do you think it would be a massive turn-off to read a fic with a more human Lily? Do you think there's a limit? For example, I feel like Lily being anorexic would seem OOC but Lily being kind of hung up about her general body image would be more okay.


** We don't really know enough about Lily in canon to say what's OOC and what isn't. The general vibe you get from the only sources we have - Snape's memories, Harry's single memory, and a letter from Lily to Sirius (and her ghostly appearances in GoF and DH, I suppose, if you want to go there), paint a picture of a bright, pleasant young woman, and that's basically it.

I think as long as you paint her as a basically good person (good people can have flaws), you can do whatever you want with her. Far more important is to make her character compelling and interesting on her own, no matter what direction you go.

** From the impression given by those remembering her- Snape, Lupin, Sirius and Slughorn - Lily would seem to be much like Hermione in smarts but more Ginny-like in popularity. She's more intellectual than physical and forgiving rather than judgemental. We're never given the sense that she doubted herself.

Things that would seem out-of-character: cynicism, sporty-ness, elitism, defining herself by who she dates, cattiness and/or being manipulative.

It's not that she couldn't acquire those traits during a story, but basing from her canon self she wouldn't start off that way.

That said it's fanfiction, so write her the way you need her to be for your story.

To a point. She never forgave Snape for calling her a mudblood despite his repeated attempts to apologize.

**** We don't actually know that for sure. Snape's memories jump from him trying to apologise to Lily right to the point where he defects Voldemort.

However there a bit of evidence in the books that suggest at least some interaction between those two moments. Snape's message in his potions book, /"just shove a bezoar down their throats"/, is clearly meant for Lily. As we know from Slughorn when instantly remembered Lily when Harry did the same thing.

This particular lesson from Slughorn is in the sixth year of school. The Mudblood incident is in the fifth year. I can at least see Lily acknowledging that Snape did help with the antidote problem, maybe even expressing a thank you later. This however, doesn't have to mean she forgave him for calling her a Mudblood, or that their relationship returned to what it used be, but I think it would be enough for them not to part ways on sadder terms.

***** Hmmm, what makes you think those notes were for Lily rather than himself? Is it stated anywhere in canon?

****** No, it's not stated anywhere in canon. You just have to ask yourself the question, why would Snape write that in his own book?

He clearly doesn't need that information written down, he already knows. The book contains corrections upon corrections to various potions. Extensive iterations to spells he created until they were perfect.

Snape is naturally gifted at potions, he simply wouldn't need that particular information about the bezoar there, he could have easily made whatever antidote he needed using Golpalott's law.

I think the fact that Lily is the one who used a bezoar in the lesson is enough to prove the message was written for her, because, like we see with Hermione, making antidotes isn't an easy task.

Slughorn being Slughorn obviously doesn't remember Snape making a perfect antidote that day, he only remembers Lily being cheeky. In fact, Slughorn doesn't seem to remember Snape at all from when he went to school, I'm pretty the one student he mentions to Harry who did the perfect living draught potion before was in fact Snape.

******* He might have written it down after she had said it because he found it funny. In lectures have you not found yourself jotting amusing thoughts and things people have said?

Sorry, I was going off of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Snape%27s_Worst_Memory#Hogwarts_years_.281971-1978.29][this link]] which mentioned the repeated apologies. You're probably right and it's most likely a case of fanon overwhelming canon.

I'd say she is more like Hermione than Ginny overall. It is interesting to note she didn't use her wand at all when James was threatening Snape in the pensieve memory. That seems to match what Hermione would have done. Both Ron and Ginny would have hexed first, asked questions later.

She was made head girl too, so she was probably good at academics. Probably not the best dueler, seeing her reluctance to use her wand and her mindless panic before being killed by Voldemort.

I'm not sure where you got the 'popular' vibe from. I'm pretty sure she never played Quidditch in canon, nor do we know anything about boyfriends other than James Potter. Both of the canonically popular girls - Ginny and Cho - were very pretty, played Quidditch, had lots of boyfriends and dated the resident celebrity Harry potter. Lily, as far as we know, never did any of that.

So overall, somewhat like Hermione in her characterization.

We actually don't know that she didn't but I agree it's unlikely on Quidditch anyway. Also different eras might produce different reasons for popularity. Also Lavender and Parvati seem to be popular despite not playing Quidditch.

#+end_quote

The 'plain with poor body image' trope is sorta stale. It's predictable enough that E.L. James even used it to describe his/her protagonist in order to give her a 'fault.' It's everywhere in H/Hr fanon, but maybe you could make it work with Lily.

  less rigid than James
#+end_quote

James was a Marauder, so I'm not certain what you mean by this. If anything I could see her being the brakes to whatever plan James & Sirius concoct.

Faulty /motivations/ produce far more interesting character flaws. Does the character have a rigid sense of honour that forces them to make the wrong choices sometimes? E.G. Ned Stark. How are the character's talents/flaws used by others in their environment?

** When I think of Lily portrayals that I've especially liked, I immediately think of two stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3325624/1/The-Age-of-Inertia][Age of Inertia]]. Now both of these stories have their major flaws, but I think they each have a very believable version of Lily. TLAT's Lily is a little more black and white. She has rigid morals that define how she views the world, and she kind of sticks by her guns. Also, she has a very self-sacrificing personality. Always puts the needs of others before her own, which is both frustrating and endearing when you consider the fact that she STILL ISN'T WITH JAMES after 34 chapters. AoI's Lily on the other hand is a writer, and she talks about her past a lot...and often in a retrospective morbid fashion. That's a story where she becomes a spy for the Order.

Both of these stories are "supposedly" abandoned, so honestly, anything is better.

A lot of people try to make Lily a version of Hermione (wish fulfillment?), and I honestly don't like reading about a Lily who is rule-abiding and snotty. Also, I see a trend where she reads a lot of Muggle stories...like, Jane Austen, and they make her personality very romantic (bleh). She's canonically very nice and kind, but remember, it's human nature to put the dead up on a pedestal...especially when only the good die young. I personally picture her as very popular ("nice to everyone" popular, not "sporty" popular) and very involved on campus. Remember, you don't have to be the top of the class to get nominated in a position like Head Girl...you have to be the one that would be most comfortable in a leadership position. Also, there would have to be a side to her that's either vain or shallow because she fell in love with James...and as much as I love James Potter, he was a jerk and a bully during school.

I like your Lily, especially the anxious need to fix people. You could really do a lot with you, and I'm excited to see what you come up with. As long as you stick to the "canonically nice" and don't go extreme, you can't go wrong. Keep us posted :)

** I would definitely like to read a more human Lily. I think you seem to have a good grasp of what would be too OOC for her. Don't worry too much about it- we don't see enough of her in the books that you can't take some liberties with character flaws.

One thing I like to do when developing a character is come up with a lot of scenarios and write down how the character would feel/react about them, even if it's a scenario they will never face in the story I'm writing. It's especially great if you use the same scenarios for all your characters, to see how they differ/are the same. (This is kind of dumb, but for example to prep for the the Marauders-era fic I'm writing I wrote a brief paragraph about how each of the characters would deal preparing to and actually battling a dragon a la Triwizard Tournament.)
