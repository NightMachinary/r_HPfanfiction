** linkffn(13041698) What's her name in Hufflepuff? - SI, starts kind of weird and boring but past like first and a half chapters it gets quite good.

linkffn(13230340) Harry is a dragon, And that's Ok - the title is riddiculous, the premise and summary doesn't help, but the story itself is great.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequenes of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

***** It IS a crack fic, but in the sense of having an absurd premise taken very seriously, and it has it's humorous moments, sure, but if you've read it at all you know the tone isn't humorous. I'm just saying it because if I were in a mood to read something funny, I wouldn't go for Art of Being Sisyphus.

Edit: Also, I realise I didn't really answer OP, so [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9om75k/Any_crack_fics_with_over_20k_words./e7v5gqt][Here]] is my list of humour/crack fics I found worth reading. Hopefully something there will appeal to you.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
