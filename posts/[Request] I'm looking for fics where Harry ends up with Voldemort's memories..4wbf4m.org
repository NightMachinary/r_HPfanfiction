** Harry Potter Dark Memories, Linkffn(3655940) is a much lighter fic than most of the Voldemort memories stories I've read. It has Harry facing the memories but not going dark or even really grey as a result of them.

I hesitate to bring it up but Partially Kissed Hero also fits that premise. I won't ask the bot to link that one though.

I hope that what you're talking about is just set-up though. Cause I don't how long it's possible to keep this interesting if it goes on this way.
