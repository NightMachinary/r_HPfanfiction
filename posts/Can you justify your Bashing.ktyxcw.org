Do you have a character you hate? Do you love fics that bash them? Even better, do you write fics that bash them?

Great!

Can you explain why you hate the character? I'm very interested to hear people's opinions, and their reasons to back it up.

Hoping for arguments that are more eloquent then (bcoz he SUX!!!! GRRR!!!)


** I've always felt that Voldemort was kind of, uh, not a great person.

Like, you can't tell me that he has a permit for that exotic snake he owns, and the fact that he keeps her in a confined space during Book 7 is just icing on the cake.

He borrowed Lucius Malfoy's wand, broke it, and didn't apologize.

When he hugged Draco Malfoy in Deathly Hallows, Draco was clearly uncomfortable but Voldemort either didn't pick up on that or didn't care. Whichever it was, I think that's clear evidence that Voldemort isn't good about respecting other people's boundaries (though if we assume he just wasn't aware, then there's lots of potential for improvement there). It's almost as bad as how Tonks kept asking Lupin to go out with her until he gave in, if you ask me.

Voldemort is also very unkind to others: he insulted Hagrid and he's always so demeaning to Pettigrew. Honestly, the way that he makes Pettigrew hurt himself, then hurts Pettigrew, then gives Pettigrew a shiny new hand, well, it feels like a bit of an abusive relationship there, you know?

I could go on, but I think you get the idea.

** I was playing among us of all things and I usually act dumb when I'm imposter and this dude told me: “ you can't act dumb and smart at the same time” cause I was playing detective the other game. In the same token, Dumbledore can't act both omniscient and ignorant at the same time. “I didn't know Harry was being abused” isn't a good defense at all. Mf you put him there with his abusive relatives, apparently with no paperwork and no input from his rightful guardian at all. You can't just leave him be without checking up on him at least once a year. And even if you don't want to interact with his relatives in case they don't take too kindly being reminded of magic, (which shouldn't be the case considering harry is magical.) you are after all a transfiguration master and failing that, you can become literally invisible at a flick of a wand. If you're too busy to visit the child of two war heroes and the child you put in the hand of abusers, then you have too many positions and need to vacate at least one of them. So you see, you can't act like you always know what's going on but act like you're ignorant of the abuse that is being inflicted on harry. Can't have it both ways.

Now /there's/ a fic idea: Harry is taken away from the Dursley's because law enforcement tends to ask questions when people randomly get new children without filing for it.

Harry ends up in a really nice foster home, loved by his new foster family, all because Dumbledore didn't get the paperwork done on the non-magical side of things.

Overall: I agree, Dumbledore is a bit contradictory like that.

** So there needs to be a distinction made between bashing (which in some sense exaggerates flaws) and holding characters to account. Most of the adults in Harry Potter deserve to be raked over the coals or imprisoned for their actions.

The problem is both there isn't a good label for lambasting characters nor does most fanfic favor a moderate take.

For me there are few characters I don't like being bashed, though that doesn't mean they can't have their flaws pointed out in ways meant to help them improve. But for most of the rest I tend to have to take what I get.

For instance, there's not nearly enough stories where a Gryffindor Harry is dismissive or antagonistic towards Mcgonagall, who you can really ask the question of "what has she ever done for Harry?".

This. So much this. I actually scoffed in disbelief when Harry used the Cruciatus on Carrow for spitting on her in canon. I would've found it much more believable if he blamed her for not doing enough to protect the students and doing the bare minimum to protect her job/position.

Edit: There's an incomplete story in this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11181910/42][one-shot collection]] called Quantum Leapfrog where Harry says that the Gryffindor House Ghost is called Nearly Headless Nick, because they're the Nearly Headless House. This, in front of the school champions and their Heads, in the antechamber after the Goblet selects the champions.

Also, Ian Hycrest's /Cry of Freedom/ series on FFN is an AU which blatantly calls out McGonagall's uselessness.

This undeserved punishment includes the Forbidden Forest detention, which I can't remember if she knew about them trying to investigate a unicorn killer, but if she did should have gotten her sent to prison and have Harry hate her for putting his life in danger.

That said, the best line I've heard (said in earshot of a subsequently distraught McGonagall) is "And that is why it's appropriate that our house ghost is Nearly Headless Nick as we are the nearly headless house": [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11181910/44/Yet-Again-Still-Even-More-Fragments]]

*** I actually hate him far more for his treatment of Harry.

James, Sirius and Pettigrew were his best friends; friends who made the effort to become animagi just to keep him company one night a month. They were not random classmates.

Yet, he made no effort to contact Harry, visit him or write letters? Harry was abused and horribly neglected at the Dursleys and I hold Lupin partially responsible. Sure, he had no legal or fiscal responsibility for Harry's care, but he definitely had a moral responsibility to at least check if Harry was safe and happy.

Even after he became DADA professor, Harry did not know how close Lupin was to his father, even though he agreed to give private lessons and spent time alone with him. After Sirius broke in twice, he still did not inform the staff that there was a secret entrance into the castle under Honeydukes and that Sirius was an animagus. All because he cared more for Dumbledore's opinion of him than Harry's life.

He made no effort to contact Harry in his 4th year even though his help might have made a lot of difference to Harry, both emotionally and in magic, not to mention Sirius' health. Sirius was living in a cave, and off rats that he caught, while Lupin was... elsewhere, I guess? Bloody hell, I /loathe/ that guy.

Then there is Lily's death, he was the one who gave the prophecy to Voldemort, almost certainly aware that it would lead to the murder of a baby and likely their family. The only reason he defected was because he realized that his obsession was in the crosshairs.

*** Just finished a rewatch with friends around Christmas, and the Lupin bit really hit me hard this time.

Snape outs his extremely disadvantaged and discriminated against minority colleague to the public and gets him fired from what is probably the best, most stable job he's ever had, forcing him to return to his life of miserable, likely Wolfsbane Potion-free poverty. And it's probably even worse now that a good portion of the country is now aware that Lupin is a werewolf that ran amok at a school, so he's probably not getting hired again anytime soon.

Considering that lycanthropy is written as a strong analogy to HIV/AIDS, and can be read very easily as a metaphor for other issues, (being LGBT, for one), it's such an utterly irredeemable thing for Snape to do.

***** That's some questionable logic.

For one, Snape probably knows about the DADA curse because he keeps getting turned down, but it's never explicitly stated, as far as I know, and everyone else besides Dumbledore seems to regard it as more of a rumour.

Secondly, by outing Lupin, he goes from being hireable by only a few people who can work around his absences, to basically no one, because now everyone is aware he's a minority that basically everyone hates. Lupin probably would have resigned anyway because he's self-loathing and feels guilty for endangering kids, but that still doesn't give Snape the right to blab to everyone and torpedo any chance Lupin will ever have of finding another reliable job. It is never appropriate to out someone. Snape does so because he's a petty bully, and only ever punches down.

** Dumbledore left a boy, a 14 year old child, completely alone in his abusive household right after he had just been kidnapped, tortured and watched his friend die infront of him. He offered no help. No consolidation. He sent Sirius out of the fucking room so he could interrogate Harry alone. He cut Harry off from his friends, his family for 2 months and forbid them from telling him the truth about what was happening in the wizarding world.

He creates such trust issues in Harry (who already doesn't trust adults from the years of abuse from the Dursleys) that Harry won't go talk to ANY of his teachers about the fact he is being LITERALLY TORTURED by Umbridge. And on top of that, he forces Harry to have occlumency lessons, a skill that is very intrusive and personal, from Snape, a bully who actively dispises him.

And this is without even bringing up the emotional issues if the Trial or the visionsor the stress of Voldemort being back and no one believing him that, again, Harry wouldn't talk about not even to his friends because he wasn't given a chance to when it happened and instead was isolated for 2 months.

Dumbledore is the reason Sirius dies. If Dumbledore had been open with Harry about the visions and what they mean, he wouldn't have believed them. If Harry had any scrap of trust in adults, he would have trusted Snape. If Dumbledore had taught Harry legilimency rather than Snape, he wouldn't have had the visions. If Dumbledore hadn't have isolated Harry then maybe Harry would have talked to someone about his issues. But no. Dumbledore created the anger, fustration, fear and mistrust in Harry that leads him to wildly follow Sirius to the Ministry. that wouldn't happen if Dumbledore cared for Harry.

And this isnt even going into the HUGE stockholm sydrome twist shit that happens in the 6th book where suddenly Dumbledore won't leave Harry alone. And there's trust issues there. The opening to HBP is heartbreaking. Harry doesn't even pack because he doesn't trust that Dumbledore would actually show up when he says he will.

And again, I'm not touching the fact that Dumbledore kept so much ridiculous shit from Harry that definately would have helped him defeat Voldemort waay faster but noo. Dumbledore fully expects Harry to die and not survive the killing curse. That's why he doesn't tell Harry any of this shit. Because he needs Harry to be niave so he won't run from his 'destiny'. Because the only way to defeat Voldemort is for Harry to die (neither can live while the other survives) so he needs Harry dead. And he'll manipulate Harry in any way he can to get him there...

I've issues with Dumbledore in the other 5 books too but I won't get into them. He works as a dramatic character in the story to create mystery but I don't like him he's aa dickhead.

He then questions Harry and Hermione about where exactly they were when Lupin transformed and Pettigrew made his escape, and then tasks them with freeing Buckbeak. When asked what he'd be doing, he says, "laying down mousetraps."

When all is said and done, with the hippogriff free, the rat captured, and the werewolf subdued, Harry drags them to the edge of the lake because he swears they were saved from the Dementors by his father.

Dumbledore looks at him and says quietly, "Harry, perhaps you may have tired of hearing this, but you do look remarkably like your father."

Harry stares at his headmaster blankly before charging off and casting a brilliant patronus.

They then watch Snape take their past selves to the castle, and once Sirius is locked in, they break him out again and take him to the Hospital Wing (and watch their past selves go back in time).

When Fudge and Snape arrive, fuming that Black escaped and the latter blaming Potter, they find the trio in their beds, Sirius being treated by Pomfrey and all of them, including Dumbledore happily drinking hot chocolate. Also, Pettigrew is tied up in the middle of the room.

Bonus scene at the end: Dumbledore asks Snape to meet him in his office. He wants to know how multiple Death Eaters in Azkaban knew Pettigrew was responsible for the Potters' deaths and that Sirius was innocent, but his spy somehow didn't know the same.

Edit: Pomfrey, not Pomfret.

This idea has the same problem that a lot of "Dumbledore isn't incompetent" fic ideas do: If Dumbledore got off his ass and actually did something? The entire series would be over by book 4.

Teacher is possessed? Dumbledore fixes it.

Chamber of Secrets open and the students are being paralysed? Dumbledore knuckles down, works out that it's a Basilisk (if Hermione can figure that out, so can he) and starts getting Basilisk protections put in place (like a lot of roosters). And also pays for all the cures that he needs for the students.

And so on and so forth.

Even if he did believe that Harry would return from death, there's still so much more he could have done to help him, to help defeat Voldemort sooner, rather than later.

Also: Dumbledore is a pretty respected man, why the heck didn't he contact Amelia Bones and tell her the truth about Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew? He also has (retired) Alastor Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Tonks on his side to help in the Auror department.

To be fair, Dumbledore recognises that a lot of his actions were mistakes later on.

That man is 150 years old. He knows when he is making mistakes. He is old enough that his mistakes shouldn't be this detrimental to a child's wellbeing especially not when he is headmaster of a fecking school. And undoubtedly McGonagall, Molly or Sirius would have raised concerns about how Harry was being treated and still nothing was done. Sirius didn't even know Snape was teaching him Legilimency until Harry told him and Sirius was furious.

He can say sorry all he likes but I don't forgive him. He caused too much damage to be forgiven. Isolating someone after they've just been tortured is bad, that's not a mistake that's an active choice. Sending Sirius out of the room when Harry came back from the Graveyard when Harry SPECIFICALLY DOESNT WANT SIRIUS TO LEAVE is not a mistake it's a choice. Those things were wrong and a blind person could see they were wrong. So no. I don't forgive him and he can have all the shit that comes his way because Dumbledore at no point in that series ever looked out for Harry or showed any ounce that he actually cared about him as a person rather than as a pawn to defeat Voldemort.

** Several people have already mentioned him, but I'll mention him again (repost from an old comment of mine)

*Albus Dumbledore.*

First chapter of the first book. Rather than knocking on the Dursleys' door in the morning, informing Petunia that her sister and brother-in-law have been murdered, that her nephew is now an orphan, and asking her to look after him, he abandons Harry at the doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter. But /fuck/ common decency, right?

Then, it gets worse. And /worse/.

- Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
- Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
- Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
- Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
- Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
- Keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts knowing a Dark Lord was after it and thus risking the lives of all students.
- Suspecting Quirrel but not confronting him even after there's an attempt on Harry's life during the Quidditch match.
- Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
- Not doing anything about the Chamber of Secrets even after five decades, though he knew Voldemort was the culprit. Twelve year olds solved the problem.
- Leaving the petrified Muggleborns in the hospital wing for months rather than buying the restorative draught. Not evacuating Hogwarts even though the attacks killed a student last time. (Why was the Ministry not involved except to arrest Hagrid?)
- Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
- Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
- Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
- Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
- Then, telling him half the truth when Harry was emotionally vulnerable after Sirius' death. Emotionally manipulating him throughout the conversation.
- Isolating Harry in an abusive, neglectful household and forcing his friends to cut meaningful communication, even after he's witnessed a student's death and the resurrection of his parents' murderer, even though there were viable and safe means of communication available like the bodyguards following him secretly.
- Having bodyguards follow Harry /secretly/. Trusting Mundungus for the position.
- Allowing Malfoy, a wannabe murderer and terrorist, free access to the school knowing that he's been tasked to kill him, even after two students are nearly killed. Admonishing Harry when confronted about this and then blatantly lying that he gives a shit about the students.
- Leaving the hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes to three teenagers rather than a few trustworthy and qualified adults. Not telling Harry /how/ to destroy horcruxes straightaway.
- Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)
- Scheming Harry's forced suicide-by-Voldemort with Snape, leaving Harry with no *practical* choice but to walk to his death because he was informed at the last possible moment that he was a horcrux. (Why? Because his answer is the only possible answer and that no one else could've found another way?)

This list (or rant) is not comprehensive by any means, but honestly, Aberforth was right about his brother.

And I sympathize with Dumbledore!bashing fics coz their worst flaw is that their authors lacked the talent/skill to express their anger and disgust with Dumbledore properly.

Rowling does this a lot.

I'm gonna get flak for this, but my favorite example is Molly. Rowling tells us that she's this great maternal figure for Harry, but when it comes to Molly's actions, it's the twins who decide to rescue Harry from being starved in Dursley prison (and Molly is mad at them for taking action). IMHO she doesn't really do anything that shows deep caring, worry or affection for Harry, but she (and Rowling) talk a lot about it, so it feels like she does.

McGonagall has similar issues, where the idea of her character and stereotype trumps any of her actions (looking at Harry like more of a nuisance than anything else through most of the series).

But there are other, less controversial, examples. Like Snape: We are told that he is a double spy and therefore his actions make sense... but he doesn't act like a double spy would. If he's trying to pretend to be a good guy, it doesn't make sense to act blatantly evil and "death eaterish". Voldemort: "Yo snape, how come Dumbledore doesn't fire you? Shouldn't you pretend to be good if he's supposed to believe that you are reformed? It's almost as if Dumbledore is in on it, protecting you and you're only pretending to be evil...". Imagine if Dumbledore had a spy in Voldemort's ranks and he'd constantly be openly defying Voldemort and protecting innocents. "Gosh darn, it sure is strange that Voldemort hasn't uncovered my obvious spy yet".

We're also told that Snape holds genuine regret for his actions, but what we see is that he has no affection or sympathy towards Harry, a direct victim of Snape's heinous acts, who's also the child of the woman Snape (supposedly) loves. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This goes so far that many fans think he's just obsessed with Lily and doesn't know what love is, directly contradicting what the narrative is telling us, simply because his actions and his narrative idea are so incommensurable.

(a) Forget the plot and try to do the character ideas justice. For example a believably good/non-evil Dumbledore requires writing an almost unrecognizable AU, where everything is different (plot wise).

or

(b) Take the plot and character actions as is and at face value, which leads to what many consider character bashing even when it's just being honest with how they usually act.

These are the two fanfic categories that interest me the most. I really love a wise and grandfatherly Dumbledore, as long as he appears in category (a) fics.

** I don't write fanfictuon much. But I do like to bash dumbledore. The reason is quite simply his actions surrounding the students in his care is appalling.

In 1st year. He has teachers create a series of potentially deadly traps to protect the philosopher's stone, but then he leave the door with it locked and a waring to pre-teens and teenagers (whi are too curious for their own good (o would know im 17)) and doesn't think to do something like the fields charm with Nicolas Flamel as the secret keeper or something else to keep the students away.

Im 3rd year, it is said that the minister was always owling him to ask for advice, so why couldn't someone with that much political sway, a) stop the dementors being at hogwarts and traumatising students, and b) get Sirius a trial for something he was innocent of.

It is similar in 4th year, he has all of this political sway, yet he is being pushed around by the ministry.

In 5th year (and this goes for all of the staff as well), how did he not notice that lots of students were getting words carved into their skin. The lack of awareness of their students makes me think they should have been fired ages ago.

In 6th year and 7th year, he kept his cards way too close to his chest. He never told Harry anything until he absolutely had to, and he was as cryptic as possible about it as well.

The other major thing, is lack of care for his student's home lives. He sent 3 major boys back to abusive situations repeatedly, after being asked by them not to be sent back. Tom Riddle grew up in an orphanage during WW2, he was exorcised at aged 6 and he was mistreated by everyone there. Severus Snape's father was a muggle who would hit him and his mother, so he found refuge at Lily's house. And Harry Potter relatives kept him in a cupboard for 11 years, locked him in, starved him, then when he was moved, he got 12 locked on his door and a catflap in which they would put tins of soup (uncooked), put bars on his window and would only let him out for 5 minutes to shower and use the bathroom. Dumbledore kept sending these kids back to their relatives and it's upsetting and in my opinion deserves to be bashed. Also, the argument that he was brought up in the 1800s and doesn't understand is a bad one as he has had over 100 years to learn what is and isn't acceptable any more.

Anyway, these are, in my opinion, the reasons why Dumbledore deserves to be bashed.

Thanks to whoever read till the end

** I try not to show my disdain for him in my own fics, but Percy Weasley is undoubtedly my least favorite character in the series. How he treats Harry in GoF and OotP combined with how he treats his /own family/ just leaves me feeling sick to my stomach every time I think about it. Also, his last-minute redemption leaves me seething in rage as it was just so unexpected and also felt like it didn't really pull through with his character arc.

Like, not saying Percy should've joined the Death Eaters or anything, but if he had died instead of Fred (or even alongside Fred), I'd have a better opinion of him and the direction that JKR took with his character.

Edit: it's actually the sequel where Percy is spying at the ministry, the first one just explains some of Percy's character in GoF in a sympathetic way. Linking the sequel instead, though the first is definitely worth reading also.

•I never really saw much character development, as I said, /(I know it was sorta from Harry's POV, but I would at least expect to be shown)/

•I can understand her getting mad at Ron for him nagging her about dating so many different boys or whatnot, but her making personal attacks about people having been kissing, and he hasn't? Not my style.

•Spelled a boy for asking/nagging about what happened at the DoM, /(I can understand being annoyed, but seriously. I mean Siriusly!!!)/ and then she gets into the Slug Club for being good at that spell, not getting in trouble at all.

Don't forget, Fleur was meant to be very condescending and irritating, maybe even more so to Ginny than we see in Harry's perspective. Also, Zacharias Smith was also portrayed as incredibly obnoxious and the bat bogey hex is quite harmless. It's not like she crucioed him or something. I believe he said something quite personal that made her hex him, and it's not like she was the first person to do something like that /cough/ Hermione /cough/.

** Albus Dumbledore.

Like, I get where the man is coming from, but seriously, jeez, most of the things he does borders on psychopathy. He literally has 17.5/20 on a test I found. It's pathetic, honestly. Now, for the reasons....

At the beginning of PS, he left a /baby/ on a /doorstep/ in /November/ in nothing more than a /basket/ and /note/ to tell his aunt that her sister is dead and that she now has to take care of her sister's child who just saw his parents get murdered. Also, I'm, like, 98% certain that Dumbledore knew exactly what sort of person Petunia was, and not just because McGonagall told him that the Dursleys were "the worst sort of muggles imaginable."

And the letters. Like, I know they're automatically addressed, but, /that/ many letters couldn't /possibly/ be sent. Dumbledore did that on fucking purpose.

And about Mrs Figg... Surely she saw Harry working like a house-elf. He was so thin and he always worked so much. So when he did some painting or gardening for hours she should have noticed. And she did, clearly.

And sending Hagrid to get Harry? /Seriously?!/ That man is a bumbling fool (He's great, but still) that hasn't even completed his education!

And the whole Hagrid getting the stone from Gringotts thing... That's obviously a setup.

And when Hagrid stopped Harry from getting a book on hexes to use on Dudley? Well...looks like someone didn't want their weapon to be knowledgeable...

And first year.... Well... That's a shitshow.

First, there was the Weasleys at Kings Cross and Ron... He said that there was no more room on the train. Liar. It was a magical train. And he could have sat with his siblings.

Now, I don't think that was outright malicious of the Weasleys. Course not. But it was likely that Dumbledore asked them to befriend Harry. Probably to make sure he was a Gryffindor. And Light. He didn't want another Tom Riddle.

And as for the troll, surely there would be creature repelling wards on Hogwarts, or else the creatures in the forest would be coming in nearly all the time! Dumbledore must have wanted that to happen for Harry and Ron to befriend Hermione, so Harry wouldn't want to research and study things himself.

And the trials at the end, those were /easy./ A first year did them! And surely Snape knew better than providing the antidote and a way to escape during his riddle. Idiot.

Also, what are the odds that a staircase could send Harry and Co right to the third floor corridor? Hmm? And Dumbledore telling everyone that the corridor was forbidden is like asking the group of reckless teenagers (Gryffindors) to go there.

And showing down with Voldemort... Well, that was just no...

Dumbledore didn't react like a normal adult when finding out that an 11-year-old boy faced down with the terrorist who killed his parents and then killed one of his teachers. Harry should have gotten therapy!

And surely Pomfrey, or anyone, could have seen that Harry was malnourished. Neither one of his parents were that small, and his ribs could clearly be seen! He could barely eat right!

And second year...surely Dumbledore knew /then/ that Harry was abused? There were /bars/ on his window and the Weasleys had to rescue him. They clearly spoke about how he was treated!

And what with the whole Chamber of Secrets thing... Dumbledore was over a century old and the Chamber was already opened once. And he probably had an idea of where it was, what with Myrtle and all. He knew damn well where and what the basilisk was.

And really, couldn't they buy mandrakes from someone else instead of waiting for theirs to grow? We're talking about comatose children here!

And Dumbledore knew damn well about Lockhart. That man was a clear fraud and the fact that he didn't fire him was clear negligence at best and maliciousness at worst.

And Snape too. That man didn't teach a thing! He bullied everyone he was Neville's worst fear! Take that in, Nev's worst fear was not Bellatrix (the woman who /tortured his parents into insanity)/, but his /teacher/ instead.

And letting Harry go into the Chamber? Only giving him a sword and a bird? Pathetic. And it was not "Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore" either. That's pure Albus Dumbledick™ bullshit.

And third year... All I'll say is that Dumbledore either knew Sirius was innocent or he wanted him to stay away from Harry. He was the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot! He was able to call for a trial for a man who never got one if there was new evidence to be found. Just use Veritaserum, memories, and witnesses you dick.

Fourth year. That was less fabricated by Dumbledore, but surely he could have helped Harry in the tasks? All the other headmasters did. And yeah, I guess it wasn't fair with Cedric and all, but at least he could have arranged for extra lessons. Harry was only 14 and competing in a death match!

And during the end, Harry was clearly weakened and hurt, and Dumbledore still made him tell exactly what happened instead of immediately sending a /clearly traumatized/ boy to Pomfrey.

And fifth year... The idea that Dumbledore thought Harry was possessed was bullshit. And an excuse to keep things from Harry.

That whole year was a bunch of bullshit. Dumbledore and McGonagall knew damn well what Umbridge was doing. It's why Minnie stopped Harry from finishing his sentence and telling her. She already knew.

The Occlumency lessons were bullshit as well. Snape didn't teach Harry a thing. All he did was rape his mind and that was it. It likely opened Harry's mind to Voldemort even more.

And about the prophecy, Dumbledore really went to great lengths to keep it hidden from Harry. For years.

It's simply pathetic.

And sixth year... Dumbledore didn't even properly train Harry! He barely knew how to fight! And Hogwarts's education was mediocre at best. Harry had no chance to defeat Voldemort in a duel.

And asking Harry to get Slughorn's memory was a stupid idea. Dumbledore could easily have gotten it himself instead of asking a teenager to do it.

And he didn't tell Harry he was going to die either! Why?!

And making him go on a Horcrux hunt was stupid, too. The Golden Trio were just kids!

That's about all I know, for the moment. Though there was also the time where /Harry was a horcrux and Dumbledore planned his death ever since he was a baby./

He was just a boy! Dumbledork had no right!

And yeah, that's about it. Dumbledore is a manipulative, psychopathic bastard. There's a reason I bash the man. Kinda.

Yikes. This is long. It says a lot about Dumbledore's character though. And I didn't even speak about anything before the series.

** I enjoy ron bashing as long as it's done well. Ron is a jealous, low work ethic no talent who rides on Harry's coat tails and is constantly bashing hermione in canon. Simply put, he's the kind of person I would greatly dislike in real life, so I can't find anything I would like about him in the books. Also, even though he never used slurs like malfoy did, Ron was about as mentally abusive towards hermione as draco was. In some ways, Ron was worse, as malfoy was obvious in his contempt of hermione, ron did all his mental bashing under the guise of being "a friend", and we all know that the social knives that cut the deepest don't come from your enemies, but from your friends.

I also enjoy dumbledore bashing. I won't list the reasons because many of them have been posted here, and to be honest I would have to write a small essay to enumerate all the reasons why dumbledore from canon is deserving of bashing.

For the fic I am currently writing however, I am reducing ron to a background charector rather than bashing him, and I am taking the opportunity to write a good dumbledore, one who actually HELPS harry rather than USE him

**** I haven't posted it yet. It is a series rewrite, starting from 3rd year and will go through the rest of the series. I won't be posting it until the first book is fully written, but I'll give you some info on the premise of the first book

Dumbledore puts harry in augusta longbottoms care to grow up with neville as I'm using neville's mother as Harry's godmother (got idea from other fanfics, though I haven't read any where harry grows up with the longbottoms.) Both harry and neville are sorted into ravenclaw instead of gryffindor (I wanted to do a smart and talented harry, but not overpowered harry, this is important because the voldemort in my series will be much smarter and more dangerous than he was in canon. Neville will also be in ravenclaw because he was never depicted as unintelligent, just low confidence and poor casting due to having a badly matched wand). I am using neville growing up with harry as a way to explore a neville who didn't go through the series with confidence issues.

The main problems will be the same for each of my books, but how they happen and the details will all be different based on how I have changed other details of the series from canon. Harry will be shipped in this fic with daphne greengrass, but it won't be through marriage contract our soul bond tropes. Her family will be a death eater family instead of neutral and she will be ordered to befriend and use him for voldemort to gain access to him. How they get together instead of her giving him to voldemort will be a surprise! Tracey davis, normally daphne's best friend will not be her friend first at all, as she isn't even in slytherin in this story, she will also be a claw.

Dumbledore in this story will be a good dumbledore who actively helps harry throughout the series, keeping far lest secrets from him and starts giving him private lessons on all things death eater and voldemort from the very first book.

Hopefully this gets you more interested for when I finally post the first book!

Edit: also, voldemort wasn't fully destroyed by the rebounding curse like in canon. In my series, voldemort survives, but with very negative effects on his body from the rebounded killing curse. I am using this to bring in voldemort as active from the begining of the series, allowing me to have the evil villain involved in the plot more, as well as allowing me to do something different with the horcruxes than has been done with them before, to my knowledge. This will eventually lead to more of a war time for the 7th book rather than a horcrux hunt like deathly hallows was. It will truelly be Harry's war this time around, not "go on a scavenger hunt before meeting him in battle one time"

****** It will be a bit as I've only just completed my 3rd chapter. I'll probably be knocking out 2-3 chapters a week though so I don't think it will take TOO long to complete the first book. I'm really excited to write it, because I'm doing a lot of things different in this book than I have seen in any other canon rewrite. Harry even plays a chaser instead of seeker on the house quidditch team! Though I'm pretty sure that's been done before, harry has likely played every position of quidditch with all the fanfics out there lol.

And yeah both voldemort and dumbledore will be much more active in my rewrite. I never understood why voldemort was such a small part of canon even though he was the big bad of the series. Even in books 5-8 he didn't have a lot of text time. While my voldemorts text time won't be a ton at first, it will ramp up over time as he regains his strength.

And it will be nice to see dumbledore take a more active and benificial role in Harry's preparation rather than keeping him in the dark for 90% of the series then dumping everything on him in the last 2 books

I'm particularly excited on how I'm getting harry and daphne together. I haven't read a fic that gets them together in a way that's even close to the way I will be getting them together.

** I'm against bashing but, I'll give thoughts on criticisms of characters.

I have questions about Snape. He behaves rather poorly as a teacher. The only justification that would make this passable for me is that he's putting on airs as a spy, and it was all part of the plan. Kid Snape was just an sad kid who was bullied by the popular kids who were otherwise nice to everyone else. He gave as good as he got because he was finally able to fight back. To him the entire war was personal. It was to fight people like the muggles he grew up around, and then to fight for Lily. Adult Snape seems far more contradictory and awful.

Lily seems like someone who thinks of themselves as perfect. She was the perfect child who befriended the poor kid. She was the only mother who's love was enough to save her child. I don't like characters like this. She's a contradiction inside of a conundrum. She has no flaws. So she's probably the devil. :)

*** That's a rather interesting take on Lily. She most likely did have flaws, she was only human, just that no one probably talked about them. She is in a sense kind of a mary sue in that she was perfect in every way possible, but you also have to think: if the wizarding world heard that a 21-year-old woman that had been murdered protecting her 1-year-old son, people would most likely remember their fondest memories of her, paint her in a good light. I can't remember exactly, but most of James' faults were told to Harry by Snape, who had a grudge against the man (i know Sirius and Remus talked to Harry about James' faults, but i think those were after Harry asked about James and those situations specifically). Also, the narration is through Harry: most adults wouldn't come up to this famous kid who had had his parents murdered at a young age protecting him and tell him that their parents did this and that wrong. Not a great impression.

So yeah, Lily is painted as this woman with no flaws, but when you look at the narrative, it makes sense for her flaws to not have been told.

There's a whole bunch of stuff not mentioned there as well. Creeping over Harry's scar on the Express, anti-Slytherin behaviour, the Scabbers/Crookshanks thing, accusing Harry of lying about entering the Triwiz, abandoning the Horcrux hunt and major anti-intellectual vibes.

It's been a while since I reread the original series so I can't remember exact quotes, and it's not an important enough matter to merit the effort.

I admit that I don't hate /everything/ about him, though. Red hair grants +10 awesomeness points, and I like having a reason to use the word 'twunt'.

Not a fan of Dumbledore either, but [[/u/WhistlingBanshee][u/WhistlingBanshee]] already has that covered.

*** Crookshanks was on Hermione. She bought a cat that has a taste for rats, when her best friend has a rat. When Ron tells her that crookshanks has it in for Scabbers, she rejects the possibility. All Ron wants to do is let Scabbers roam the dormitory so he can die in peace. When Scabbers goes missing. There is a substance that appears to be blood. Hermione rejects the possibility of crookshanks having eaten Scabbers, despite multiple prior attempts. Crookshanks and Ron were in the right. Hermione was the one at fault there.

From memory "cat" was one of the animals on Harry's list when he went shopping to prepare for his first year (he chose "owl"). So, assuming my memory is right, that means that a fair few students didn't just /have/ cats, they were /required/ to bring cats (out of a selection granted, but still).

And if he was truelly a loyal person, his jealously wouldn't be a repeating wedge between them. It could also be argued that this is more his immaturity than a lack of loyalty, but I am of the opinion that these 2 things go hand in hand, or at least have a large ammount of overlap.

Also, even though he never used slurs like malfoy did, Ron was about as mentally abusive towards hermione as draco was. In some ways, Ron was worse, as malfoy was obvious in his contempt of hermione, ron did all his mental bashing under the guise of being "a friend", and we all know that the social knives that cut the deepest don't come from your enemies, but from your friends.

I don't see the awe of her. Yes, she sacrificed herself for Harry, and Narcissa would have done the same for Draco. Yes, she was pretty and Narcissa was beautiful as well, that doesn't make either Narcissa or Lily as good human beings.

Lily didn't try to understand Petunia's feelings. If there was one moment I pitied Petunia, it was when she wrote to Dumbledore to let her come to Hogwarts. And Lily rubbed it on Petunia's face, as though she was a laughing stock, mentioning how Petunia was begging to come to Hogwarts. And Saint Lily easily redirects the blame on Snape.

In the end, whatever her problem was with Petunia, she dumps it down on Snape.

And the almost smile in SWM. What horrible person would do that to their friend? Would Hermione ever almost smile at Ron or Harry or even Neville if, they were embarrassed by Draco? Or would Hermione ever forgive any of those boys if she found them almost smiling when Draco embarrasses her?

That's when I really disliked Lily. Considering how Snape's childhood was, I really wished she was a better person.

The only thing I like is, she cutting off Snape. I mean even on moral levels, they were different and it was better to prune the relationship that was anyway going to hurt him.

Lily didn't cut Snape off early enough. Snape was already throwing bigoted slurs against people like lily and hanging out with people that want muggleborns heavily oppressed (at best) and brutally murdered. Lily already expressed her disapproval at this. This all happened before SWM.

It's not lily's duty to ensure that Snape stay on the path of good if Snape himself is dead set on doing the opposite. Being an unpleasant person with a shitty childhood doesn't entitle Snape to shit. Lily doesn't have any obligation to remain friends with someone who is bigoted against people like her just to "save" Snape.

Calling Asian is an identity, that Asians themselves approve and embrace. If non-magical people don't approve and embrace a certain term, and if that particular term is often passed off as an insult most of the time, it isn't complimentary and it is as much bigotry as much as mudblood is.

Irrespective of her concerns with Snape she still chose to be his friend right until that point in SWM.

Vernon vehemently dislikes that word and he is a non magical person. No human without magic would like to be addressed as "muggles". They hate themselves being represented such way. If I am an Indian or Chinese, I need to first accept that term. Did Vernon or Petunia accept that term? Didn't Vernon feel insulated over the term? And all the situations in which they addressed "muggles" are all with inferiority.

And there was always a "us" vs "them" with the wizarding world. The term mudblood is only for wizards and witches from non-magical community. Just because the witches and wizards hate to be demeaned among their lot, it doesn't make them good people. They demean and disrespect non-magical people. So, I give a little less shit when the word "mudblood" is used. It doesn't impact me as a reader, at all.

Now, coming to how Lily was able to give multiple chances, I would tell, that's her huge flaw, considering she even went ahead to marry the big bully of her child hood friend.

She isn't a good friend if she is able to almost laugh at Snape being bullied. Let us reverse this scenerio. What if Hermione was bullied by Draco and her knickers were shown in open, and Harry almost laughed. Wouldn't you think that's betrayal? And Fyi, Harry would never almost smile and he would hex the bloody hell out of Draco. Where was Lily's wand? She just came with fancy words, no real fight, well, that we could add because of her taking fancy on James Potter.

Snape being a bad guy doesn't justify Lily being an awful friend. As much as Snape was awful, Lily was an awful person too.

Reread that vernon scene again. "Even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy happy day!" You can replace muggle with quite literally any nonsense word (mufolist, abugos, tolkrast) and Vernon would be rattled because of the way the word is used in context. If you aren't willing to accept this simple fact then I don't know what to tell you.

You keep saying that Snape is a bad guy but somehow I doubt you believe that. You downplay the use of the word mudblood. You think Snape's friendship with Lily was bad for *Snape* because they had different moral values. Different moral values don't even begin to cover it. Lily's moral position is that she would like herself and people like her to not be killed. Snape's is all mudbloods can die except Lily because she's my special mudblood.

I just don't see how it's a bad thing to finally cut out a toxic relationship from your life.

Like I've said Lily's flaw isn't being a bad friend to Snape. Lily's flaw is being a good friend to Snape. Her flaw is being naive enough to think she can save him. Her flaw was being willingly blind to Snape's foul behavior because she knew him as a kid. Her flaw was equating James' bad behavior to Snape's when anyone can see that Snape's is so much worse.

As for James bullying Snape. Just think back to the internet debate a while back on "Is it ok to punch a nazi?" My answer is yes, every time. You don't get to claim victimhood when you're a nazi.

********** Lily was as toxic to Snape as much as he was to her. It is easier for people like Snape coming from abusive household to create co-dependant relationship with people who show even very little care. And it's a wonder if Lily hadn't known Snape's feelings were more than friendship. Even Harry notices that Snape has romantic feelings on her.

I ll not indulge in all characters. Snape had made terrible and wrong choices in his life. And his treatment of Harry would need another century of life to remorse. Similarly, James had equally done wrong deeds. One right thing will not compensate for the wrong thing. So, you can be assured that I am not here to justify his actions.

My point here is, Lily being described as epitome of love, goodness when with all the evidences shown a piss poor friend.

You keep repeating that Lily didn't owe Snape anything, because he was in the wrong.

But, friendship, at the end of the day, is about two people and the trust they have in each other. If Snape had almost smiled at Lily, if she was abused in front of a crowd, I would call him out that he was a shitty friend. She didn't even raise her wand. And enjoyed James's mischievous stints. Accused Snape of being nosy, when he was almost to be killed by James's gang. And the matter with Petunia, and Lily having another instance of being awful.

And all this happened before Snape calling her mudblood.

Which even Harry isn't bothered to feel sorry for, because of the physical abuse he is seeing right through his own eyes. And mudblood is a built up slur that isn't as worse as being called muggle.

If it's not the identity I approve, you can't call me with some random word, and that would definitely be slur. Muggle is as much slur as mudblood because both are used in inferior tone and looking down at other people.

*********** I'm not even going to touch the whole Lily should have known Snape has romantic feelings for her part. It's completely irrelevant.

As for the term Muggle, I don't know how many times I have to explain it to you that just because a term can be used in a racist context does not mean a term is racist.

"I'm not staying at the Leaky Cauldron. I'm staying at a muggle hotel in London." Descriptive.

"These muggles with their silly ideas." Racist.

Wizards need a term to describe the human population that doesn't have magic. The term they came up with is muggle.

And why are we talking about how the term affects you as a reader for? None of the terms are real. It's not about how it affects you. It's about how it affects the characters.

You and I also have completely different understanding of friendship. We know that Lily has been making excuses for Snape for *years*. Let's be generous and assume it's just been 2 years. Conversation happened end of 5th year so since the beginning of 4th year, Snape has been throwing slurs and/or hanging out with future death eaters who want Lily dead.

As far as I'm concerned, the baseline behavior in this case for Lily would be to cut Snape out of her life and when the bully picks on the bigot, Lily should have just stayed out of it. From this point onwards, the relationship is completely uneven. Lily is a good friend to Snape while Snape is a shit friend to Lily. Not only did Lily remained friends with Snape despite the baseline being that she should end the friendship, she also stood up for him when nobody in the school would. That makes her a good friend. Almost smiling makes her a less good friend.

I don't see how you're going to hold the event with Petunia as evidence that Lily is a shit friend. All that showed is an 11 year old girl that's not an accomplished liar.

And let's be real Snape was being nosy. Snape suspected that Remus was a werewolf ("I know your theory"). Snape wanted to out that Remus was a werewolf as part of his vendetta against the marauders, which consequently would have completely destroyed Remus' already low career prospects and made him a social pariah. Snape willingly went anyways.

Sirius: You know that dude you hate? He is hanging out at this place behind this electric fence. I'll tell you how to get behind the fence.

Snape: I know that the dude is going to be on a bloodthirsty rampage tonight but I can't wait to expose him and all his friends.

And I agree Lily isn't the epitome of love and goodness etc. But we completely disagree on the why. Lily is a shitty person to other muggleborns that Snape hurled slurs at because she tacitly approved this behavior by remaining friends with him. Lily is shitty to James because she equated his behavior to Snape's. Lily is shitty to her muggle parents and family because she remained friends with Snape who she knew looked down on muggles. Lily is shitty to Mary Macdonald because Lily remained friends with a person who thought Mulciber using Dark Magic on Mary was just Mulciber having a laugh.

************ And wizards needed a term for people who didn't come from a long line of wizards. So they came up with the term "mudblood". It's always the intent that shows derogation.

And even by your own terms, all of the wizards are racist. Hagrid, McGonagall, Dumbledore, every one are racist, then why Snape alone becomes the greatest offender for calling Lily a mudblood?

Lily sure was also calling Snape immediately with her classist remark of him being smelly. Well, let's forget that. Because guess what, bullies and classists, racists who don't choose to kill are still good people in your dictionary.

Yes, I have a sincerely different understanding of friendship. Anyone who feels uncomfortable being a friend to a person, shows about their nature of friendship in the first place. Anyone who tries to compromise with words when their friend is being abused, mocked and belittled, before taking their wand to defend their friend, is no true friend.

And I can still accept Snape was an extremely wrong man, but by the way you defend James clearly tells you have one-sided judgements when it comes to James and Lily.

You thinking that this is the behavior of a shitty friend means you have completely unreasonable demands on what friendship is.

I have no problem admitting James is an arrogant bully. But not because he picked on snape. Because he hexed people for fun.

Also find me proof that Lily said Snape smelled. James and Sirius made fun of Snape for his bad hygiene. Snape being poor has nothing to do with his personal hygiene while at Hogwarts. Hogwarts doesn't charge students for showers.

** James Potter is a fucking bully. Ignoring all the shit he does to Snape for a moment, he bullies other students, harasses Lily repeatedly and even tries to blackmail her into going out with him, does the same kind of stuff the twins do except it's malicious, at one point murders two muggle cops to get away from some death eaters, and he gets to do all of it with impunity. Now let's bring Snape back in. What he does can be classified as relentless bullying. Even after Sirius almost gets Snape killed, he keeps doing it and even uses the incident to bolster his standing in Gryffindor despite Snape being nearly murdered by his werewolf buddy. And imo he only saved Snape to cover Lupin's ass. We are told he becomes a better person but the only evidence of that is that Lily agrees to date him and given that she found him charming and even found it amusing when James tortured Snape, that argument is not one I believe in the slightest. James is an arrogant asshole who does shitty things to people and gets away with it because [[https://youtu.be/FyqV9jOgeyE][he's a popular kid with a bright future in Quidditch.

Also, James is never portrayed as bullying anyone except Snape, and it's implied that it's because either he is jealous of the fact that Snape is close with Lily and/or can tell that he fancies her (not a good reason, but again - teenagers), or he bullies Snape because he is racist and into the dark arts (better reasons).

***** Pampered little Princes as you called James often do grow up to be shitbags. One must only look at the rich fuckers in America for proof. My opinion of James is colored by the fact that we are told by people who liked James that he was a good man. What we are shown tells a completely different story and what we are shown is a popular kid picking on and humiliating his classmate because he was friends with a pretty girl he liked and he had a fascination for the dark arts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Snape after all was never malicious in his use of the spells he created which cannot be said for James. It is also worth noting that James using dark magic despite bullying Snape for his fascination with it makes him a massive hypocrite. We never see James change. Maybe he did and I am completely wrong. But the cynic in me finds it hard to believe that he did mature. If he didn't see the error in his ways after his posse nearly got Snape killed because SWM happened after the Whomping Willow, I would need to actually see him change to actually believe it. For me it is a farther jump to think that the arrogant asshole changed into a good dude in two years than it is to think that the girl who was amused by her friend being dangled upside down decided to ignore James' bad behavior since she's no longer impacted by it. He clearly carries this reckless immaturity into adulthood, evidenced by the incident with the muggle police. So I don't believe he changed and that is why I dislike him

*** James Potter was a teenager with adoring older parents who babied him/gave him everything he wanted without a fuss.

Harassing Lily is a fanfiction thing. it isn't canon that he asked her out repeatedly.

Also with the cop Muggle thing, anything that wasn't written in the books isn't canon.

James saved Snape. I believe he didn't like Snape because of him being Slytherin and close to Lily, but I don't think he wanted him dead, especially not because of Remus, who was an innocent party in the mix. Also he might not have liked Snape, but I highly doubt he'd want him dead. He's a 15 year old jerk, not a killer or heartless bastard.

James ends up changing for the better, which in turn gets Lily interested to him.

I like Snape, even with all his flaws (and he has a lot). In a way I think Snape is worse than James, because James changed/grew up. Snape never grew up, he bullied kids, had Neville's Boggart be Snape himself, was rude/inconsiderate, etc. I like the abused Snape aspect with his family, the child Snape was, but if I met adult Snape, I'd want to punch him in the face, even with knowing everything that I know about him.

*** First off, I'm going to assume you're a snape lover because there's nothing else that can make you hate a character other than the blinded love of another.

James Potter is /not/ a bully, and if he was, it was when he was 15. And although that's no excuse, we know he grew up completely spoiled and did in fact /change/ by their seventh year, because the Lily from SWM would not go out with a bully. She stood up for anyone being picked on, muggle-borns or purebloods, so I'd say she's a pretty good judge of character. This is why her opinion of James changes so drastically, because he changes so drastically. He also joins the fight against Voldemort and gives his life for the cause, and specifically in the moment so his wife and child have a better chance of living.

And JKR has no idea who the marauders actually are, which is obvious in that little death eater thing you mentioned. They've taken on a life of their own, so the puny little backstory characters Jk imagined them as aren't what they are now. They're full-fledged characters who have millions of words written about them, and she can't change James's character years later to fuel her snape-loving narrative,

And he doesn't just save Snape for the sake of Remus, he saves him because it was the right thing to do. Even if he didn't do it for snape, sacrificing his life to save Remus is a very noble and brave thing to do, indicative of a good person.

And we know Snape fought back just as hard as James did, seeing as he fights back to them and hurls insults just like James and Sirius do. And Lily doesn't just 'agree to go on a date with him,' she marries and has children and risks her life just to live with the guy, so obviously she likes him more than you think.

But hey, if for some weird reason you do like snape, don't bother replying to this because there's no way we could ever see eye to eye about the marauder's era.

People change and grow. I don't know how old you are, but assuming you're an adult, I highly doubt you're exactly the same person you were at 15.

Snape bullied Harry, Neville, Hermione and anyone else who wasn't Slytherin. HE was the adult, the one in charge.

James and Snape had more of an equal footing because they were both hot headed teenagers, and from again the little we saw, it seemed like James and Sirius were the only ones who bullied him. Remus seemed to sit it out and Peter seemed to egg it on.

I highly doubt that James wanted Snape dead. He wasn't a heartless bastard. Who knows maybe he overheard what Sirius said, maybe Peter told him, or maybe even Sirius himself told him, his conscious getting the better of him. We don't know how James found out, after all what was going to happen.

Yes Snape is an asshole. This is an indisputable fact. The fact that he was abused, bullied, nearly murdered, and discarded by everyone around him goes a lot towards explaining it but it by no means it justifies or excuses it

If James had let Snape die, Remus would be hauled away for killing a student and being an unregistered werewolf.

****** Dude war heroes can still be shitbags. They are not mutually exclusive at all. They are both shitbags. Snape joined the death eaters because they were the only people who actually accepted him, similar to how a cult works. And again, we never actually see James be a better person. All we ever see of him is him being a jackass and there is evidence of him still being this way after Hogwarts ie after he supposedly changed. Maybe I am completely wrong and he really did turn things around. But it's a classic example of show don't tell. We are told all these good things about James and we are told he matures but all we ever see of him is him being a douche bag and an asshole

***** Snape did not care for anything apart from Lily and it was to the point of obsession and that is the only reason he turned from Voldemort not because he cared about a kid being murdered (I mean he was the one who informed Voldemort) no he cared about Lily not surviving and that is why he asked for her to be spared not Harry who is a kid.

James on the other hand hated Snape but so did Snape and he still saved him from Remus but if James was the way you said he was -who is the biggest bully, is a person who condemns dark magic but still uses it (though that was never in the books, if it is then I would like to know where) would have left Snape to die he wouldn't even care for his friend who would have turned into a murderer so yes James is definitely better then Snape.

If by saying that Snape is the way he is because he was from an abusive home then the same would apply to Harry as well though with Harry it went furthermore than just abusive home, having professor who bullied just because he resembled his father and having a murdering dark lord who wants him dead but still Harry did not turn out that way.

I think you are getting confused with what is actually in the books and the fan fictions. It is not the same thing I hate the canon Snape but I love the Snape that is depicted in FF he is one of my fav character after Harry but that doesn't change the fact that the actual Snape was biggest jerk and kind of evil.

****** Honestly the fact that Snape cares for nothing in this world besides Lily is really depressing and makes me sympathize with Snape more. How shitty must your life have been to make there be only one person in the entire world that you actually give a shit about

Hexes are dark magic I think. Also, he specifically saved Snape from Remus, an illegal werewolf who was his friend and was not supposed to be in the school. And he goes right back to bullying Snape. Because of this stuff I do not believe that James saved Snape for altruistic reasons. He saved him to cover for Remus

I am of the personal belief that abuse victims will become way better people or assholes themselves. Harry had a big support system and was regarded as a hero by everyone around him except Malfoy. Snape on the other hand was bullied by James and ignored by his teachers despite being a fantastic student, and even his best friend took a small amount of pleasure in watching Snape be tortured. Snape was completely alone, had no support system, and had nothing in the entire world he actually cared about except for Lily. It's no wonder Snape became an asshole while Harry did not

I am actually not. I know Snape is an asshole in the books. My argument is simply that James really isn't much better. The kind of person Snape is is really irrelevant to the kind of person James was. James was an asshole and we are not given anything more than super biased testimony and circumstantial evidence that he actually changed

******* Actually in canon Snape had friends in his house so Lily wasnt his only friend, she was his first yes but not the only one.

As for the incident what I was trying to say about James saving Snape for whatever reason James did save Snape (just to save his own ass) and when Snape was put in the same situation did he even for a second think of saving James from Voldemort just for the sake of life debt that Snape owed James no he didnt the only person he wanted was Lily.

The part where you said Lily was the only one who cared for him is not canon it is again FF as that part of relationship is not explained in detail.

Harry did not have any kind of support system before Hogwarts but he was still kind, timid and scared yes but not cruel. Snape was like that from the start the only reason he befriended Lily was because she had magic, would he have been friends with her if she was muggle of course not.

Again James bullying Snape has been only mentioned twice in the books once when Harry sees the memory and once when he gets it cleared Sirius and Remus and nowhere does it mention Snape was ignored by his teachers and Lily did not take any pleasure in Snape suffering she was the only who defended him but was called a mudblood in return, it hurts more when you get called racial slurs by a friend then by an enemy. So he wasn't a good friend also to his only 'support system'. So please tell me where does it mention James went onto bully Snape again and again or was ignored by his teachers. I would actually like to now if I have missed out on it in the books.

Snape was never scared of James and Sirius (expected of a victim of bullying) because it shows in his and Sirius's interaction in OOTP. They had the same kind of relationship like Harry and Draco no one inferior if at one time one person was pranked/shamed the other person did get their revenge though Harry and Drace never fought with that level of hate as James and Snape.

The only difference is James grew up and fought in a war, war changes people it makes you grow and face the reality. Bullies are usually cowards and they run when they have to take a stand for something James proved again and again that he had changed because he did take a stand he did defy Voldemort thrice. I am in no way saying that what James did to Snape was not wrong it was wrong but in the end he is human and humans are flawed but if we have to judge a person based on one incident is it fair and all the other good deeds not counted? there is something called redemption, accepting your mistakes and moving on and trying to whatever good you can and I think that is what James did. Snape was stuck in past reliving the same thing and that is why there is no growth in his character at all.

Yes hexes are dark but it was Snape who invented a dark curse whereas the marauders invented the Hogwarts map almost at the same age so which is better?

Edit: Remus was in school with Dumbledore's permission why do you say he was not supposed to be in school.
