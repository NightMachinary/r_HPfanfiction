Are there any stories out there about going back in time and they either end up in the wrong universe, end up in the wrong time, things go terribly out of control or any combination of the 3?

Also, if anyone knows any non-time travel stories where everything goes wrong that'd be cool too.

**** This one is absolutely amazing, relationship-wise. Admittedly, the plot was executed in a more mediocre manner (IMO), but the focus of the story is Harry's and Tom's relationship, so I didn't really care all that much. Anyways, I definitely think that this is one of my favorite fics relationship-wise (I almost cried at the end) and it is well worth the read.

  Their plans all worked, but the cost was too high. Voldemort might have died in the long run, but he takes so many people with him that it cannot possibly be considered a 'victory'. So a group of four decide to send themselves back in time to fix it... What could possibly go wrong? Alternate Reality; Time travel; Reincarnated Founders; Harry is Salazar; Canon pairs

There's a ton of time travel fics in the Tomione ship, but this one is pretty interesting because Harry, Ginny, Draco and Hermione go back in time together. Also this one got me into Tomione, its a little dark in places so may not be everyone's cup of tea.
