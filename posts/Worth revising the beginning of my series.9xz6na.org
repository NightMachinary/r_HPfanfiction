** Don't launch into it before you story is complete. Too many authors were halfway through fourth year and updating regularly, then got bogged down by suddenly deciding to stop updating and instead go back to rewrite first-year, and then abandoned the entire thing. I don't want it happening again.

Also, should you go through with it: if you are rewriting that heavily, I think you should repost the old version as a separate fic (with a note at the beginning explaining that it's an outdated version and one would be probably better off reading the other one). Some early readers who'se feeling nostalgic today might want to reread the story and then be extremely confused and displeased to find what they fondly remember is gone, even if the new version is technically better.

...not saying your rewrite would be bad on that level, but think fan reaction to the /Star Wars/ Special Editions.

**** In that case, an alternative might be to post the /new version/ as a separate fic while leaving the original story as-is, with a note at the beginning of the original saying "if you want a more lively take on the first halfish, go to [X]".

** As someone who revised/rewrote about 100k+ words, I somewhat regret it. It's tedious, you'll find yourself never truly satisfied, and it might honestly just kill the passion you might have for your story. But then again, my mediocrity seeped into the plot itself, so I found myself wanting to change basically everything. If you don't have that problem, maybe you'll be fine.

** Doing a bit of this right now in Wolf Lord because the world has grown from what I had in mind when I started and I need to go back and add foreshadowing for future events into it so the story is a bit more focused.

Also need to make things a bit harder for the MC

So I would say, does it need to be done to better tie the story together or you think you can tell a more compelling story. Recently read a book about writing and one think the author talked about as relentlessly editting because the story should fit together well and built tension until you reach a climax. Every word is auditioning to be a part of the story and you should consider how they affect the intended tone and the characterization of the characters.

** I would leave it as is, maybe going back and tweaking it when you need a break from other things. I devoured that series (and the "For Want of a Bazor" that you just completed) and loved both. You are very adept at keeping things in character, at presenting magic that conforms with what we see in the books, and just generally are able to tightly plot good stories.
