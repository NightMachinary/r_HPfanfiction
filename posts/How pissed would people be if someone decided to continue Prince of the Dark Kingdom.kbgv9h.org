** I'm assuming this is a fanfiction that's been abandoned? I'd imagine no one would be pissed if the continue-er? had permission from the author. Otherwise stealing someone's work isn't alright and I'd imagine people wouldn't be very happy at all

**** I'd best leave it alone then. Touchy subject. You don't wanna touch someone's work without their permission---more so I'd say if they're passed away as they have no way to say knock it off, or continue on.

Okay, if the only fanfiction you have written is non-smutty Harry Potter fanfiction, then you are free of sin. For everyone else, my point remains.

******** Wow, that was quick absolution! “Free of sin” just for not writing smutty Harry Potter fanfiction? What a bargain!

** Pick up where it left off, but call the new work a PoDK fanfic as opposed to a HP fanfic.

** Fanfiction is all about taking from other people's work without permission, so that's not a moral issue, as long as all you post is actual new content (no copy-pasting the previous parts). However, you should still make serious attempts to contact them and give them a long time to reply. And when you start posting, make sure that you signal what you're doing very clearly. People will still be pissed, of course, but bear in mind that fanfic readers get pissed at authors at the drop of a hat, so you may as well ignore them.

** Go for it. Just make sure you're as clear about what's OC and what's not as you are when you're writing standard fanfic.
