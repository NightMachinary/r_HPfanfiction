I always read fics where Harry and the people close to him are rude, wary, or dislike Dumbledore. I really don't understand why. Dumbledore in the books cares about every single student so much he'd attack Aurors over Marrietta Edgcombe and really isn't as biased as you'd think. He gave a shit ton of house point to Harry, Ron, and Hermoine for doing brave chivalrous acts that literally stopped Voldemort like wtf do you expect. Also if you count how many unfair points snape takes of the other houses and rewards his own he basically cheats his way to victory every year because he's petty enough to do what other teachers don't yet Snape is usually held in such high regard but Dumbledore who's canon self cares for everyone and who would sacarfice his favourite student and one of his closest friends so that everyone in the wizarding world can have peace but umm nah he's a controlling prick who thinks everyone's a chess piece.

I'm not saying Dumbledore's actions are good but you're kidding me if 2 lives > thousands of lives simply because you like and know the characters. It's like foot's trolley and clearly, Dumbledores's believes in utiltaiarnism since he wants the 'greatest good for the greatest number' or he wants to 'minimise suffering'


** The problem is that the series starts as a boarding school adventure series and then transforms into a more typical YA adventure series as the Harry and pals grow up.

Dumblodores roles in the two styles of book are completely contradictory. Because the type of story that the books are changed, Dumbledore also had to change. But that also makes it's difficult to reconcile book 1 Dumbledore with book 6 Dumbledore. Things Dumbledore in did in book 1 that makes sense for a boarding school novel make no sense for the Dumbledore in book 6 and the things Dumbledore did as a YA mentor in book six makes no sense for the Dumbledore in book 1.

So you get evil manipulative Dumbledore or incredibly incompetent (even if skilled at magic and powerful) Dumbledore, because both of those Dumbledores fit the actions of both book 1 and book 6.

*** Yeah. There ends up being a lot of contradictions, especially with things introduced in later books.

Severus Snape is cleared as a Death Eater on the word of Albus Dumbledore, while Sirius Black gets thrown into Azkaban without a trial.

Albus Dumbledore gets a fake summons to the Ministry of Magic and goes by broomstick, the slowest possible means of magical transportation, when you consider he could very easily have taken the Floo. or portkey, or apparated

And even if you take into account that those concepts not being introduced in the first book(at least not floos or portkeys, I think apparition appeard in the first book), it doesn't explain how Harry and his friends flew by thestral from the Sottish Highlands to the Ministry, but still managed to beat the Order of the Phoenix there, after the concept of portkeys, apparition, and floos have all been introduced

Then there was the total lack of preparation in the final books. Dumbledore played his cards way too close to the chest and it was only sheer dumb luck that Harry survived.
