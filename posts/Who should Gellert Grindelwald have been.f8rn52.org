** The best characterization I have seen (from a believable perspective) was in linkffn(The One He Feared). Here, Grindelwald was a brilliant student that had a fascination with magic like Dumbledore, but unlike Riddle it was less about narcissism and more about believing only he had the correct vision of the future.

The things that were needed to make Grindelwald work as a villain with the canon information prior to FB were:

1. Magical aptitude on par with Riddle and Dumbledore, if not necessarily as skilled
2. Highly charismatic and able to convince the lay-people of the "rightness" of his actions
3. Close and/or even intimate relationship with Dumbledore, broken mainly by where the line of "justified or not" was for each of them
4. Fascination with magic and perhaps dark magic in particular, including experimenting with taboos and violating wizarding norms (for lack of a better term)
5. Able to speak to a wider magical audience regarding the whole "Magic is Might" ideology that appeals to the more tepid members of society

There are others, but these cover the broad basis. So the question is, did the FB movies meet these general criteria?

1. Arguably showed magical aptitude in the movies, though this was unfortunately somewhat hamstrung by the ending of the first movie where Newt and Tina manage to kill-steal at the end (and possibly complicate the whole Elder Wand situation).
2. Not as much in the first movie, but his speech and presentation at the end /do/ show his ability to, like Voldemort, play theater for an audience.
3. Mixed, mostly because its still sort of a kid's story and likely because of film industry limitations and money-making decisions (ex. selling in China - why do you think Rowling introduced the Zouwu out of nowhere in the third act of the story?).
4. Not really a good show here. Its certainly implied and shown that G. is magically capable, but we don't really see an interest in magic. Its more like he sees magic as a means to an end, rather than the end itself (read: empowering his positions/status/authority). We don't really see him displaying much new in the way of magic, excluding the rather broken /protego diabolous/ at the end.
5. I think the propaganda he spews at the end, with the mystique of prophecy and imminent destruction, certainly meets this mark well. The downside is that its used more as a "the muggles will kill us all" rather than a more nuanced "the strongest should be on top, the weakest should be on bottom" a la social darwinism.

So a mixed bag mostly. The problems seem to really boil down to mostly telling instead of showing. Ironic in a film titled Crimes of Grindelwald that we don't actually see that much crime (random pedicide not withstanding).

The elements of his philosophy - that magic is superior but Muggles have their place - is easily twisted through history into the extremist positions he is known for.

** There are a number of interpretations that I think work well. All should start from the idea that he fights for The Greater Good though.

While Grindelwald is temporally attached to Hitler, its Voldemort that is his literary foil. I don't think Grindewald should have any interest in exterminating muggles at all. Grindelwald thinks that muggles are less than magicals, which has two sides, I imagine that he views the way they are easily controlled and manipulated by magic with pity and condescension, but at the same time thinks they should be protected and ruled over for their own good.

In my head, Grindewalds perfect world is one where wizards live in the open as a benevolent ruling class, using their magic to care for and help the muggles but never seeing them as equals. Almost seeing them like animals. In his head what he is doing is for the good of both Muggles, as they will receive magical protection and benefits, and for wizards as they will no longer have to hide.

That being said he is still a Dark Lord, and his utopia isn't real and neither are his actions. He manipulates world leaders to bring about WWII, highlighting the brutal nature of muggles that needs to be contained by magicals. The end goal is to subvert the statute of secrecy and end the war, saving countless lives and becoming the hero to magical and muggle alike.

His allies are those that fall to his charismatic descriptions of the new world. I'd imagine heavy support from the muggleborn who are tired of hiding from their friend and family and want to be able to help, as well as from the muggleborn that are tired of being second class citizens under the pureblood and want a chance to rule.

His enemies are the ICW who are trying to preserve the statute and those that morally oppose his methods and don't agree with his vision of ruling over muggles.

** Grindelwald's character is honestly one of the few things I like about Crimes of Grindelwald. It's inconsistent, he shows both loyalty to and brutal casual betrayal of adoring subordinates within the same sequence ffs, but that's not necessarily unrealistic.

** I generally imagine Grindelwald as a magi-supremacist anti-statutarian. He believed that magic made one inherently better, regardless of blood or heritage. Grindelwald caused World War II as a two-pronged approach of weakening the muggle world for easier conquering while demonstrating the "barbarity" of muggles. An excerpt from one of my fics...

#+begin_quote
  She's silent for another moment before she begins her explanation in earnest.

  “Grindelwald and I do share similar beliefs --- namely that we both believe in the superiority of magic over muggle. Grindelwald's methods, though...” She shudders. “Grindelwald wanted to collapse the Statute of Secrecy so magicals could openly rule over muggles. He had conquered most of Magical Europe with his own armies and had indirectly laid waste to most of the muggle side of the continent. He did this by using the imperius curse to instigate the conflict that became World War II.”

  “Lupin mentioned that.” I note. “That he caused World War II.”

  Tam nods. “Some of my hatred for him is personal. After all, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have had to live through the hell that was the Blitz. Beyond that, though...” She sighs. “He didn't cause World War II by imperiusing an entire country. At his trial after he was defeated by Dumbledore, he confirmed that he never imperiused more than five muggles throughout the course of the entire war. None of Hitler's lieutenants needed any magical influence to start wholesale slaughter of civilians, and Grindelwald admitted that even Hitler himself took ‘minimal effort' to become the monster the muggle world knows him as. He didn't imperius many people because he didn't need to! He barely had to do anything to incite the radical sentiments of racism and bigotry in the populace of an entire country. He imperiused one person to become a dictator and a few others to ease his rise to power. He started the Nazi movement, but the inherent bigotry of the muggle population is what gave it traction.”

  “That strikes me as the sort of strategy you'd appreciate.” I comment. “Laying waste to the muggle population by turning their hatred against each other seems like the sort of karmic punishment that you'd do for the sake of being melodramatic.”

I actually contrast this with diary!Riddle in one of my fics, where she is a magi-supremacist pro-statutarian who thinks that Grindelwald's act of causing World War II made the muggles into an even bigger threat by forcing them into alliances and making them develop ever greater weapons (including nukes)

** Probably gonna get downvoted, but I think Grindelwald was right and should have won. Wizardkind is obviously the next great step of human evolution, and them hiding themselves in absolute isolation in the outskirts of the Muggle world is against the behavior of essentially every type of hominid that ever existed. The more advanced species has always replaced the less advanced one. Weather through war, out-breeding them, or simply being better prepared to adapt to climate changes. What I don't agree with him however, is that Muggles should have been exterminated. The genetic diversity is quite important, and once you break the backs of their armies, let's be real, they would stand no chance against their new Wizard lords. They would be easy to control. Also, albeit an outdated species, they still have the ability of higher thinking, and as such should clearly not be considered as mere animals. I see him as as essentially an anti-villain, someone with good goals and intentions, but really shady ways of achieving them. One of the reasons I am wary of the Fantastic Beasts movie is that they so far set him up as a proto-Voldemort, and the little canon there was on him prior never even hinted at that. They are really taking the nuance out of him, sadly.

Also, I headcanon that a great deal of his support base were Half and Muggleborn.

​

As for Voldemort, well, the thing is, Grindelwald was a revolutionary. Voldemort is just a cult leader. I doubt he actually cares one wit about blood-purity, his only aim is being above everyone else. Blood-purity was just a cheap method of garnering support.

That's even leaving aside that there are no indications that wizards are the 'next great step of human evolution' in my view - they've been there for /centuries/ and seem to be, on the whole, not particularly more capable or smart than muggles (yes, wizards have magic - but the WW is not particularly sensible, and a lot of the normal/everyday wizards seem to not be particularly good with magic - with muggle technology likely being as impactful on everyday life as normal wizards.)

Take away the part about wizards taking over the world and that's a lot more palatable - after all, what's the real benefit to the WW to actually take over the muggle one?

**** Not hiding who they are, for starters. That alone would be enough for me to seriously consider joining Gellert if I was a wizard. Also, they would gain massive farming fields for any plant, tree, flower, really anything that is considered rare, or luxury item for them currently. Magical animals and beings could roam free and reproduce. It would spur a production boom of literally anything on the market. Not even gonna mention the impact on the climate and the toll on the planet itself, a wizard led Earth would flourish in that regard. Muggleborn children would immediately be able to interact and enjoy the company of their own kind from the start. Most diseases, shortages, natural disasters would go away. The dissolution of secrecy would also make possible inter-breeding, so the number of wizard births should rise sharply. Although, if we are talking in terms of 2020, not 1940s, wizards could just replace entire sperm banks with wizard sperm, and keep doing this until, after a couple of generations, they completely outbreed regular humans without even breaking the Statute. In addition, though this is more subjective, the simple of beauty of domineering an entire planet and species is quite the alluring thing.

As for Wizards not being sinsible, I think that's a tricky one. It's tricky because part of it is clearly a plot device to keep the intended story going. So that from the get-go poses a big problem. BUT, don't forget, for the most part, the WW is a post-scarcity society. Those, by definition, will make little sense to us. And in my opinion, the mere ability to use magic shows they are the next step of evolution. Though, I accept it all heavily depends on what school of thought you follow in the fandom. I believe their 'magic' is all in the DNA, and there is no spell or magical phenomenon that can't be explained by science (even if not science yet known by us). A great many others here follow the traditional 'magic is supposed to be magical, leave science out of it!' Different tastes.

The WW is clearly not post scarcity, as you mention a bunch of goods that this would end scarcity of - and it's not at all clear how well the poor and ostracized in the wizarding world get along in general, either. Magic makes a lot more efficient, yes, but it's got limits.

****** But without the Statute, would muggle govs continue the status quo of essentially two, sovereign nations overlapping over the same territory? I don't think so. Also, probably the vast majority of people in the Western world, especially today, as opposed to the 40s, would probably love the idea of a Magical world and support their coexistance but other parts of the world are... well, let's say more unsavory, and leave it at that. Once wizards retaliate, is it considered an act of war, by whom? Did the Magical nation attack, or the Muggle one it overlaps with? Does the attacked party go after both? Just one? No, I think wizards could indeed achieve an abolition of the Statute without enslaving the Muggles, but i don't think that would be possible in the current political system. So, we go back to the needing a take over of some kind, which will obviously need to be by force. And ironically, the more advanced Muggles get, the easier such a take over by wizards becomes.

As for enslaving the muggles, I did say initially that even though they are an outdated version of humanity, they still have the ability of higher thinking, and laws should reflect that. Still, from the wizard perspective, slowly out-breeding them would probably be the desirable end goal.

******* You're arguing that the wizards are powerful enough to outright conquer everyone else - if that's the case, the muggle governments would have no choice but to accept that status quo or agreement. If it's not the case, then they wouldn't be able to conquer or enslave everyone in the first place.

As for co-habitation, I disagree that it's as big a pipe dream as you seem to say - and distinguishing between magical and non-magical nations ought to be pretty simple (eg, if Magical Britain is distinct from the UK, then it'd be like the difference between Ireland and the UK - different nations). You're fixated on the need for strength/domination and dictating it to the muggles as the only path forward.

Really, the idea there for Grindelwald and his ideology/goal is interesting mostly in being a dystopia - but that's what it would be, a disaster/horrible way forward for most of humanity, which you've reduced to being seen as 'outdated' and inferior and enslaved.
