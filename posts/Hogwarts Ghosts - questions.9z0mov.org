Do we every find out why they're stuck at Hogwarts? Do they choose to stay there?

What is their capacity for emotion? I know they can be angry, but what about lustful? Vengeful? Depressed?

What are some insights you can give me on the ghosts of Hogwarts? I want to write a story but stay within Canon as much as possible.

*** I mean, I would argue that canon suggests that Moaning Myrtle is at least... curious.

**** I once read a fic where Myrtle possessed a cat Hermione and Harry fucked her in a tub. Don't ask, I don't know why.

** Not super relevant - but you know how Hermione says about the shrieking shack "It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain"

Well thats pretty stupid seeing as they live in Hogwarts that has literally dozens of ghosts.

** Ghosts (at Hogwarts and elsewhere) stay behind because they're too afraid of the unknown to properly cross into the Afterlife. For some it was a choice (though most come to regret it), for others it was involuntary --- "flinching" at the last moment. Canon doesn't explore any ways for ghosts to change their mind and move on, though I have the theory that that's the Veil's original purpose: allowing repentant ghosts to cross over "manually" if they choose to do so.

As far as we know, ghosts can choose their place of haunting, but they spontaneously manifest within the area of their death, and it's possible to magically prevent them from leaving it (which is what was eventually done to Myrtle because she was harassing one of her living bullies). She seems to be a special case, though --- the House Ghosts clearly stay at Hogwarts because they like the Castle and/or because they want to be helpful to the living as much as they still can.

They can definitely have all kinds of emotions --- Moaning Myrtle alone displays playfulness, depression (obviously), and, in the infamous Prefects' Bath scene, what does indeed seem to be lust, though it could just be inappropriate curiosity.

  To quote Headless Nick:\\
  /I was afraid of death/ [...] /I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... well, that is neither here nor there ... in fact/, I /am neither here nor there/ [...] /I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry, for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead/.

** You get the sense that the ghosts who stay at Hogwarts keep more of their interactive abilities over time; it's unlikely that Helena Ravenclaw or the Bloody Baron spoke anything resembling modern English since they died before 1000 AD. Somehow, they continue to adapt to the times, and I think that's because of Hogwarts.

*** Eh, Rowling also decided to make Ravenclaw's Diadem literally have modern English etched into it, I generally ignore anything she says about language. Or history, frankly. I do tend to believe that ghosts can absorb information just as portraits can, but I don't consider brief conversations with ghosts who are portrayed as mostly silent evidence for that fact (do we even hear the Baron speak? genuinely can't remember). I think Helena remembering her interactions with Riddle is far more compelling evidence for their ability to change over time, and I'm not convinced that's due to any unique property of Hogwarts beyond lots of forced interaction.
