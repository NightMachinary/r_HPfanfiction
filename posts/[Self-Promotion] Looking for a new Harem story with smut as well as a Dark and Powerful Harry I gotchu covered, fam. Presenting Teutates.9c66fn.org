Starts year 5. One major alteration to canon has been made for sake of plottt.

Critiques are more than welcome.

Also up on AO3, if you prefer that.


** I'll still read it but I think that's possibly the one kind of fic that we really don't need any more of

*** I can understand the sentiment, and I will be happy if you give it a shot regardless. I'm also quite open to feedback. Don't hesitate to tell me what you think about the fic. Thanks!

** Harem fics are a cancer on the hpfanfic community. Also, you've given your post the wrong flair.

*** My apologies on the flair; honestly, I have no idea why it's that way: I certainly didn't type [Request] anywhere.

Regarding the first half of your statement: you can kindly fuck off. What you said is unkind and unwanted. Good day, sir.

#+begin_quote
  The walls of Hogwarts hold many secrets, some of them benign and some rooted in a deep, dark past. When Harry stumbles upon the latter, his life and soul are shattered, leading him down a path of power, destruction, and sex. A Dark!Harry, Possessed!Harry, Harry/Harem story. Rated M.
