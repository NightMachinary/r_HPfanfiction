In Half-Blood Prince Snape mentions that one of the rumors about Harry's surviving the Killing Curse was that he was himself a incredibly potent Dark Wizard and somehow managed to overcome Voldemort that way.

I'm currently looking for some good fics that run with that idea, that Harry really /was/ somehow born such a Dark Wizard that the Killing Curse bounced off him, or however it is that he survived through Dark Magic.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
