I am looking for stories where Harry builds a TARDIS-like device (ie. Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap (it even has the vworp vworp noise)), a Star Gate (I think there was one of these), or an epic badass spaceship. Points for the spaceship if he develops (with or without friends) all the technology for it (incl. a ftl drive).


** I know I read one where normal school-aged Harry built a magic FTL drive, but I don't recall the name.

You might enjoy Harry Johnson and the Headmaster's Socks though!
