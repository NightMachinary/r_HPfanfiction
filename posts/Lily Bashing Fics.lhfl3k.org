Hi! I'm looking for some good lily bashing fics... I always hated Lily. She's so stuck up and arrogant. So, if you know any, please share the links.


** The 2 cases I've seen it the most:

- WBWL where Lily isn't just a token trophy wife and basically a non-entity.
- Slytherin-positive Marauder-era fics that don't ship Lily with a Slytherin (mostly Severus, but I've also seen the occasional Regulus).

But I can't help you with a fic directly, because I generally dislike bash fics as a rule. Sorry!

** They're not any /good/ ones. Believe me I've looked but there are some mediocre ones.

There are stories in which Lily isn't painted out to be the queen of all Mary-Sues. She's an actual person with flaws and gets called out on her bullshit.

Examples are linkffn(The Mysterious Traveler; If Someone Cared Enough; Severus Snape and the Art of War; The Peace Not Promised; Ananke)

The fics that show her in this light tend to be Snily.

By the way you're going to get down-voted because you don't like Lily.

  After an 'incident' during his sixth year, Severus Snape is sent to another world and is forced into a war that isn't his own. While searching for a way back, Severus journeys down a path of 'self-discovery', forcing him to reflect on his life and question everything he's ever known - 2nd installment to my Severus Snape Series!

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** Linkffn(Invisible)

Hope the link works. It's slash. Came across it without going over the pairings. Its popular amongst many but I don't particularly care for it. Maybe cause of the pairings. Idk.

Either way, it's WBWL with Lily getting the brunt of the bashing, more than James.

  Harry has a twin, and everyone thinks it was Nick who survived. What will happen when Harry is pushed aside? Will he fight for a world that didn't want or care about him? Will Dumbledore or the Potter's grovel at his feet? What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that fateful Halloween night? Fourth year summer fling HP/VK! Primarily Snarry SS/HP! SLASH

** Any WBWL fic will have Lily bashing. I'd recommend one, but honestly, they're all the same, so any will do.
