Hi, I'm pretty new here so I don't know if there's already a thread about this (or if JKR gave an explanation on this) but I was wondering about the Hallows...

So, the tale says that Death gave the Peverell brothers one object each for escaping her/his clutch : One unbeatable wand, a stone capable of resurrecting the dead and a cloak that can hide someone even from death.

And yet, from what I remember, Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, who was the master of the Elder Wand at the time, in a duel, the stone could only bring back a shade of the deceased, which is not resurrection (and even then, the shade would be in pain if I remember correctly), and the Cloak was seen through by Dumbledore (in Philosopher's Stone) and Moody (in The Goblet of Fire).

So I was wondering, is this just JKR being a bad writer? Is this a curse put on those object by their creator (Death or the Peverell)? Maybe their owners hadn't explored/unlocked their full potential?

Anyway, I'd like to know what you think about this.

PS : I apologise for any mistake I made, English is not my first language.


** The point is, they're powerful objects but their stories have been changed and exaggerated a little throughout history - The Tale of The Three Brothers is a legendary retelling of them, and is not meant to be taken 100% literally.

** Ok, so this is my interpretation of it

The story of the three brothers is a legend, most likely originating from when the Peverell's made the hallows. At that time, it was the ultimate cloak and the powerful wand

Now the history tells that the cloak stayed in the line of Ignotus, and the stone stayed in the line of cadmus. So no one outside these families should know exactly how these things actually behave.

Only the wand was visible to the public. And it was the most powerful wand. Jkr just used that fact to show how powerful Albus was as he defeated Grindelwald. Its meant to reinforce his nearly godlike aura

As for moody seeing through the cloak, moody's eye is most likely a recent invention. The creater of the cloak didn't take it into account

One bit of Fanon I actually like is that Dumbledore himself made the eye for Moody, and because it was made /with/ the Elder Wand, it's that much more powerful.

Of course, Crouch Jr. may have been bluffing.

*** But by the time the HP story begin they are still the most powerful artefacts of their kind. I think it's said in the story (sometimes I don't remember if my facts are Canon or if I read about it so much in various FF, that I started considering it as Canon) that invisibility cloaks in general last just for a few years before fading.

Even the Elder Wand (and now that I think about it, I find it interesting that Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort AND Harry held it at one point or another). Still in the end, while Voldemort may not have believed the entire tale, Grindelwald and Dumbledore did.

Dumbledore even based his plan for Harry on them once he found the ring and he realised he was diying. That is after all one of the reason he had Snape kill him instead of Draco IMO (I think he would have found a way to give it to Harry like he did with the sword), and also the reason he gave Harry the stone and Hermione the Tales of Beedle the Bard.

PS : now that I think about it, the Marauders' Map in Prisoner of Azkaban and the Death Eater's Homenum Revelio in Deathly Hallows also worked on the Cloak.

**** This was Dumbledore's plan; he never meant for Harry to use the elder wand. His plan depended on Snape helping him commit suicide so that the power of the wand disappears.

But Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore and nearly foiled the plan. It was sheer luck that Harry disarms Draco.

My interpretation of the stone is this: it doesn't really bring back the dead, but rather makes you hallucinate so that you commit suicide. The shades that harry sees are his parents who urge him to go and sacrifice himself. I think Dumbledore knew this fact and therefore gave it to harry to help him accept his fate

​

Thanks a lot! I also explore how the original hallows were created (like what makes them special), and the main character is Antioch Peverell's descendent

***** Yeah I read something like that in a fic once about the Hallows being cursed, about how the wand would make you reckless, the stone would make you suicidal and the Cloak would make you unlucky. All three would attract dangerous and deadly situation for their owner.

Still I think the power of the Hallows is real, if only for the fact that they were a way for JK to have Harry win without any kind of training whatsoever. I mean common! The guy ended up in deadly situation at least 3 times a year for seven years, and he never once decided that he should train or learn anything in order to survive, and yet he was constantly whining or crying if he wasn't told everything! The only times he did something was because Hermione forced him to. So yeah, without the Hallows, I don't see any other way Harry could have won in Canon.

****** The Hallows are an interesting point of division in the fandom. A good chunk believe that Harry returned to life /because/ he was Master of Death, but just as many (inc myself) don't really see it that way. Imo, Harry returned to life because of complex interactions between the magic of his mother's protection and Voldemort's Horcrux:

#+begin_quote
  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

That's a quote from Deathly Hallows. So according to Dumbledore, the reason Harry returned to life was because of the blood protection. It did not have anything to do with the Hallows. You could choose to interpret it differently; after all, Dumbledore might be wrong, as he is shown to be a fallible figure in regards to his knowledge and his judgement in the later books. However, as this is one of the culminating points of the story, I'm more inclined to believe that this is Rowling's final explanation for why Harry survived the Killing Curse for a second time, told to us through Dumbledore.

The Hallows' role in Harry's survival is really non-existent, imo. Rowling used them as tools to explore Harry's relationship with the concept of death. I doubt that gathering the Hallows and becoming Master of Death made Harry immortal or granted him a special +1 life power, but only served to tell us readers that to be Master of Death is to accept that Death is inevitable and, when the time comes, greet it as an old friend. In essence, the Hallows' role is more thematic than plot-related.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't know whether Dumbledore meant for Harry to gather the Deathly Hallows. That part is never made explicitly clear in canon. As Dumbledore gifted Harry the Resurrection Stone, an argument can certainly be made that he intended for Harry to gather all three Hallows. My interpretation, however, is that Dumbledore gave Harry the Stone for the same reason that he gave Ron his Deluminator. Because he knew that Harry would need it when he walked to his death, to give Harry the final closure so that he could accept, wholeheartedly, that he needed to give his life for Voldemort to die. The flaw in this interpretation is that I can't quite come up with a reason for why he would give Hermione his copy of /The Tales of Beedle the Bard./

#+begin_quote
  Still in the end, while Voldemort may not have believed the entire tale, Grindelwald and Dumbledore did.
#+end_quote

Here's a quote from /Deathly Hallows/:

#+begin_quote
  “--- were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them being Death's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore believed in the power of the Hallows, but I doubt he believed that they were truly objects created by Death. He craved the Stone, not because he wanted to resurrect his sister, but I think he only wanted to ask for her forgiveness, to apologise for his mistakes as he never had the chance to.

#+begin_quote
  I find it interesting that Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Voldemort AND Harry held it at one point or another
#+end_quote

I made an argument maybe two years or so ago about this. I also thought it was an interesting incidence, and particularly, that of all the four to have chased after the Hallows at one point or another, it was Harry that managed to unite the Hallows and Harry who managed to let them go. Grindelwald exploited the Elder Wand freely for power and greed; Dumbledore craved the Stone to atone for his mistakes; Voldemort feared death more than any other. In the end, it was Harry who, capable of both letting go of power and life, capable of accepting his and others' mortality, who united the Hallows, which I found a profoundly symbolic act.

Now, returning to your original question, no, I don't think the discrepancy is because JK Rowling is a bad writer. The Hallows were, in all likelihood, made by wizards and not the entity of Death, and therefore, as fallible as the mortal magics that crafted them. Over time, the facts became distorted as the retelling of stories is likely to do, especially if we consider that the tale of the Deathly Hallows may have originated from a time before Beedle the Bard lived. It's possible that the story was passed down through oral tradition before Beedle the Bard came along and wrote the myth down. The tale is not accurate simply because it was a highly fictionalised, distorted version of an event that occurred centuries ago, of which Beedle the Bard more than likely never witnessed.

It is rather interesting then, that the Hallow most suited for Voldemort's goal according to the tale was Harry's (the Cloak that is supposed to hide one even from death), but that he went after the one most suited for his personality (The Wand) and completely disregarded the one he already had. Another interesting point is that except for Grindelwald, the three Big (Harry, Tom and Albus) each had more than one Hallow at one point or another (Albus even interacting with the 3 through his life).

I'm not quite sure what plot hole exactly you're trying to point out. Yes, Voldemort circumvented the blood protection by taking Harry's blood, but the protection was still very much active. It was this act of taking Harry's blood that anchored Harry to the living world, allowing him to survive the Killing Curse for a second time.

This is true; ownership of the Elder Wand undoubtedly gave Harry the edge he needed to kill Voldemort once and for all. I should have made myself clearer - by survival, I was referring to Harry's survival of the Killing Curse in the forest.

#+end_quote

Again, true. The reason Dumbledore died, however, was because, in a moment of weakness, he let his desire for the Stone overpower reason. He was power-hungry as a youth, but as an old man, the version we know, he'd more or less shunned overt power, though he obviously still had significant influence and magical power. Nevertheless, he refused the position of Minister of Magic and chose to remain a teacher instead. He had power in spades, but he refused to use it, and in the end, the one Hallow he really craved was the Stone.

I am referencing to the fact that the Blood wards at the Dursley's relied on Harry's (And Lily's) blood and yet Voldemort proved that it wasn't effective anymore, yet Harry was sent back to the Dursley's because he would be "safe" there. If Voldemort wasn't so obsessed by the prophecy, he might have decided to go after Harry...

********** The blood protection was still active though Voldemort managed to overcome one barrier and could physically touch Harry after the graveyard scene. Yet the Death Eaters and Voldemort still could not approach Privet Drive; for instance, they waited in ambush over Surrey when Harry was being evacuated on his seventeenth birthday instead of launching a direct assault, suggesting they had to wait for him to be a certain distance from Privet Drive before they could attack. Furthermore, there is this quote:

#+begin_quote
  “--- Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on remorselessly. “Once I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you.”
#+end_quote

So yes, the wards around Privet Drive continued to work, though why exactly Voldemort could touch Harry but still could not enter Privet Drive is somewhat murky. This may be lazy writing on Rowling's part, but either way, the mechanics of the blood protection are kept vague enough that it's difficult to argue that it's a plot hole, simply because we aren't given much concrete information about it at all.

** My take on it is that Dumbledore approached Grindelwald for reconcilliantion, seduced him, stole the Elder Wand, and then they dueled. Since Albus didn't intend at any point to kill Grindelwald the wand didn't stop him and thus the duel was the epic they say. It give a literary purpose to sharing Dumbledore's sexual orientation, and holds the wand as unbeatable.

What more, if you want to go another step and explain why D-man doesn't kill: He swore an oath to never take another life after his Sister died. This prevents him from killing anyone and has also colored his perceptions from then on.

** We're never meant to take the legend literally - the first time we hear it, we're told "it's a fairy tale," and Dumbledore later all but confirms that The Tale of the Three Brothers is just that, a legend. And even within the tale, the Hallows have limits on their power. The Elder Wand doesn't prevent its owner from being murdered, the Stone doesn't actually return the dead to life, and the Cloak can't literally hide someone from Death:

#+begin_quote
  “The Cloak wouldn't have helped them survive, though,” Harry said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn't have made them curse-proof.”

  “True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.” (DH, Chapter 35)
#+end_quote

Ultimately, the Hallows were simply objects created by wizards. Powerful and dangerous objects, yes, but never truly unbeatable. So Moody's eye being able to see through the Cloak is impressive, but not impossible.

(And a final nit-picky detail - we're not actually shown that Dumbledore could see through the Cloak. I think it's more likely he simply heard Harry, as the Cloak doesn't make someone sound-proof.)

***** But Voldemort wasn't it's master because he never took the Wand from it's owner, who was supposed to be Malfoy. Harry, however did.

But concerning Dumbledore, how would that work? That would mean that you could win the Elder Wand's allegiance just by holding it and defeating some random guy, even if the it's master isn't involved in the fight at all

****** Dumbledore beat the person using the Elder Wand, not necessarily its master. Usurp master.

Harry beat the master, not the person using it. Usurp master.

Both Voldemort and Grindewald /stole/ it. They didn't win it. Dumbledore and Harry both won it, but in different ways.

** My own headcanon is the total reverse of most people's.

I have it in my head that the three brothers were greedy bastards, and Death was someone who created the three Hallows. The brothers heard of these items and wanted them, so they pursued the inventor to a river, where the inventor managed to destroy the bridge across before the brothers could cross.

The brothers rebuilt the bridge and caught the inventor on the other side where he had stopped just off the bank, assuming he had held them up long enough to eat a meal quickly (as he had been running more or less nonstop for several days by that point). The brothers dueled the inventor and nearly killed him, and stole the three artifacts before splitting ways.

The inventor understandably took offense to having his stuff stolen and managed to curse the wand and stone before he lost the initial duel, but never managed the cloak.

Thus the wand and stone each have bloody histories as the curse upon them kills each owner in succession, whilst the cloak protects its owner, but some can still see through it as the inventor did not quite manage to complete its enchanting.

Just my headcanon, and I find it interesting to cast the three brothers as assholes and thieves instead of a group of noble wizards who defeated Death.

** It's open to interpretation.

You can think of them as artifacts whose power has been exaggerated over hundreds of years.

Or, you can think that they will only perform to their maximum ability if their wielder has mastered all the hallows as well.
