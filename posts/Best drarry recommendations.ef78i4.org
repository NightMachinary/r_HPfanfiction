Hey! So a friend of mine seems to really like it and suggested I read eclipse, and I enjoyed it. Id like to read some more. So any recommendations would be nice!

Also since I just started reading this one fanfiction and it got deleted maybe get some veela/random creature stuff that makes Litterly no sence at all because even though the fanfiction i read was cringy. It was almost cringy in a good way.


** Read anything by Saras_Girl. Literally anything. (She doesn't do creaturefics, but one of her verses has a giant China-patterned beetle if that sweetens the pot...

She's on AO3 and FFN.

** I've got a list of AO3 authors which I swear by. Of course Sara's Girl, the queen. Aideomai, femmequixotic, lettersbyelise, Astolat, faire_weather, dysonrules and aibidil!

** Check out Madriddler's stuff on FFN, if you like darker stuff check out Rise of the Dark Angel on FFN, and I was just reading Evitative on AO3 which is also pretty good. They also have a slash subreddit (HPSlashFic) if you don't get a lot of recs here.
