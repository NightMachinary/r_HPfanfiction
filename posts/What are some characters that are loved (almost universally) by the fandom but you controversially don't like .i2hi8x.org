*** Agreed. Just caught up on Harry Potter, Squatter, and in the last chapter a wild Luna appears. And i just... what? What the fucking fuck.

There isn't much more infuriating than a know-it-all Luna than an EIGHT year old know-it-all Luna with a goddamned death wish and a mother that stands around with her thumb up her ass while Luna tries to kill herself (and I was hoping that she'd get her ass kicked, tbh). But it's okay, because Luna is quirky or something.

I've seen Luna randomly knowing things done well, but it's rare and it needs to be done sparingly. Intuitive or obervant? Sure. Psychic and borderline omniscient? Bad.

** I can understand the pull of Luna, and I know why she's a good /character/, but she herself does nothing for me; she's rather static, I don't think I can ever try to even picture what her mental thought process is, and I don't think I can ever read about her as a main character. She's more of a stand-in for a stereotype rather than an actualised person. What are her motives? Well she ever grow up to be normal? I cannot imagine her ever doing normal stuff, imagining Luna studying for OWLs seems so haltingly normal that it's almost impossible for her to do anything remotely like that.

Speaking of static characters, I also don't like Lily, even though I've made a post solely trying to understand her. She doesn't seem to have any sort of pull or significant character arc, and I don't think an argument of 'only flashbacks' and 'dead' are good enough arguments for why she's so boring. Take Regulus Black as the prime example, we don't even hear him speak or do anything, but he is so gripping: a bigot who draws the line at cruelty to his house-elf, but doesn't mind muggleborn genocide. Compare that to the most common interpretation of 'Lily and her Lost Boys', and you get where I'm coming from. Regulus has less lines devoted to him than Lily and yet he's so intriguing. Maybe it's because Regulus is shrouded in mystery, and Lily is so regular, even for an above average person, she's the regular type of above average person, like James.

Lily (alongside James) are so haltingly normal when you compare them to Sirius, Snape, Remus and hell, even Peter, that it's a bit jarring. At least, it can be argued James Potter had a Steve Harrington-esque character arc, and for me, that's infinitely more interesting than a girl who discovers she's unwanted in a magical world she stumbles into (the same old character trope. Boring). I don't think a normal character is a bad character (Hermione and Ron, for one), and hell, Sirius/Remus/Snape /need/ normal people to befriend them for a change. But her having such a vocal fanbase was always so odd to me. As far as we know she's as normal as you can get: a popular girl (with both teachers and peers), has a decent academic standing, very pretty and a good catch, never has inner turmoil about the war since she's pretty set at fighting Voldemort since she was only 16. Others may find her interesting and I respect that, but she just doesn't do it for me. Even the Evans sisterhood is less interesting than the Black brothers (two people on opposite sides of a war, rather than a envy-infested 'friendship').

** Hagrid. I think McGonagall in the first book sums it up when she says 'I'm not saying his heart's not in the right place but he does tend to be a bit careless'.

He gets Harry and friends to unfairly take on huge responsibility for him (Norbert and Grawp), puts people at risk of injury (Aragog, Grawp and the skrewts), and he cannot be trusted with the smallest secret. He has a heart of gold and he did have some good lessons, but he's not a good teacher, has no concept of danger, easily spills highly classified secrets, and asks literal kids to take care of his problems. Some of it was done for plot but I can't deal with it regardless.

** Honestly, depending on how the author portrays them I can love almost any character. In terms of how they're usually shown though, probably perfect Hermione and Mcgonagall.

*** I think the shift of how younger Harry sees Remus when he's his teacher versus how adult Harry comes to realise his flaws and his self-loathing is so interesting to read. Remus also helps show Harry coming into his own morally; he grows past most of his previous mentors in his way of thinking, and in his sheer strength of character. I think that's a really nice theme of HP, how no one is infallible; the disillusionment.

** Lupin. I am not sure what his purpose is. The aids metaphor is questionable since lycanthropy is only spread through violent acts where the werewolf loses all control and goes on a murder spree. Saying aids is like this is... I'd be offended if I had aids.

He wasn't a father figure since he was never there for Harry and his one plot-relevant moment has him fuck everything up (together with Snape). Him being a shitty husband, well again, why do we need him for? He fails his diplomatic background task and isn't even the fun kind of werewolf Greyback is (a dangerous, worthy opponent). Greyback gives Voldemort a bunch or murderous monsters, Lupin feels sorry for himself and is apparently unaware that pregnancy is the result of sex or has not even considered children despite marrying.

*** Yes. In most fanfics, she is portrayed as an 'Ice queen' (already cringeworthy) who brings Harry out of his shell, and shows him 'Pureblood culture'. Normally a Gringotts visit later with RidiculouslyHelpful!Goblins Harry becomes Lord Potter-Black-and a whole bunch more of shitty titles. Then, he finds out a nefarious plot about the Weasleys trying to dose him with love potions to steal his fortune, and Dumbledore (usually referred to as 'Dumbles', 'Dumb-as-a-door', 'Dumblefuck', 'Manipulative old goat' and many other nicknames) is in the plot. He finds out that he is a Horcrux and in the same visit it is conveniently removed, as well as blocks on his magic. Out of a large building normally known as a bank, an Overpowered!GarySue!Harry comes out, glasses-free and with a ton more muscle for absolutely no reason. [Insert Weasley, Dumbledore and sometimes Granger bashing.] I could write a pretty long rant on why Fanon!Daphne is so horrible written but I won't. Marriage contracts are sometimes thrown in. Overall, she is effectively a MarySue OC in most fics.

** Based on all the bashing fics I've seen, I think the only characters who are actually universally loved by the fandom are probably Hedwig, Dobby, and...maybe Flitwick or Cedric? Pretty much everyone else frequently gets placed somewhere between "mindless Dumbledore flunky" and "worse than the actual genocidal racists" on the bashing scale of awfulness.

But I don't have any problems with any of those characters, so I guess the closest answer I have for you are Snape and Malfoy. I can appreciate them as good characters, but they're still awful people, so I can't stand a lot of stories that try to paint them in a good light.

He performs the role he needs to perform in the story for which he was created.

Outside of the canonish plot (i.e., yadda-yadda, Prophecy, yadda-yadda, Dursleys, yadda-yadda, Voldemort in bite-sized pieces), though? To function as anything but a background character, his whole character would need to be rewritten from scratch, largely because there isn't much of one in the first place. It doesn't help that he is surrounded by characters with far more interesting personalities, virtues, and flaws---including both of his best friends.

*** So, I probably phrased the parent post a bit more provocatively than I had to, so I'll try to explain my reasoning a bit more diplomatically here.

I think it's fair to say that Harry is near-universally loved. There is a pretty large segment of the fandom who won't even open a fanfic that's not Harry-centric. Harry may well be the only major canon character without a self-identifying anti-fandom. There probably exist some authors who actually set out to degrade or bash Harry in malice (pstibbons is the only one I can think of off the top of my head), but they are almost universally reviled.

And yet, look at the nominally Harry-centric fics that meaningfully deviate from the canon premise. Whether it's yet another badass/gentleman/scholar of Robst, or Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres of LessWrong, one of Taure's talented!fem!Harrys, or one of the other less famous (or infamous) writers' Harrys, Harry invariably gets a near-total personality rewrite and usually an upgrade on every intellectual, magical, and social aptitude metric.

Now, if this very diverse set of writers all implicitly agree that Harry as he is in canon is not fit for purpose as a lead protagonist outside of the canon plot, then is my claim in the parent post really that controversial?
