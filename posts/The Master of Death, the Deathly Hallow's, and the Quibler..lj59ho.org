** Because there are a number of folk takes that have a kernel of truth in them.

The big one in real life was the city of Troy. Everyone said it was made up, Trojan War never happened, and the few people who did look for it found nothing. Then a German amateur re-read the Iliad, considered details of the landscape mentioned, and dug in a different place. Where he found several layers of cities, at least two of which had been burned, and one of those was dated to about the right point in time. Pretty sure much of what the epic describes did not happen, but there was a Troy.

Or alternatively, stories are made up all the time to explain the existence of things. Did you know medieval belief held Merlin built Stonehenge, for example? He ferried all of those stones over from Ireland, IIRC.

So, the three brothers got their hands on powerful artifacts. Maybe a literal anthropomorphic version of Death didn't gift them; maybe they created them? And like how some people today insist early humans couldn't have built the pyramids so obviously aliens did it, those who knew of these powerful items claim no wizard could have made them, so some super powerful outside force did.

Lots of possibilities so long as you can accept that tiny kernel of truth buried among the embellishments. (Probably other stories would be out there in the Wizarding World; this is just the only one we know of.)

*** I would not say that Heinrich Schliemann is a particularly good example of this though. His achievement would have been great but he essentially ruined his career and his achievement in his zeal to identify Ilium. He didn't properly catalogue his findings so the evidence that it was the Ilium of Iliad fame is pretty sparse.

The Polynesian stories of Pele however have a fairly accurate awareness of Volcanic Glaciation dating back to the ice age.

I think the key difference as to why we presume that the Tale of the Three Brothers is in fact the truth, is because: 1) This is a world of magic, that is â€˜illogical' by our standards.

2) For our world, we have found alternative empirical explanations for things that were usually explained by folk tale.

3) In the Wizarding World, it is historical fact that Merlin and Arthur existed, who are still legendary figures and possible Brythonic Deities to us. This sets a precedent for folk tales being more truth than fiction. In a world where near anything is possible, it is a legitimate conclusion to draw, that those folk tales may actually oral accounts of history. This point kind of relies upon a specific definition of canon however. If you accept that in this world Merlin existed before Hogwarts, or was in fact a Hogwarts Student.

4) The specific artefacts in the story are all present and accounted for in canon.

** The segment where Xeno tells the story is just so interesting and captivating it's easy to forget the context

*** Limbo!Dumbledore stated he thought it was a great story, but most likely the three brothers were exceptionally talented wizards that created the Hallows.

*** Does he? Yeah, he recognized that those were unique and powerful artifacts (though let's be honest here for a second, in cannon the cloak comes across as rather underwhelming when compared to the other two) and when he was an edgy teen he thought having all three would be very neat, but he never seemed to buy the whole made by death theory and if I remember correctly he seemed to view the title of master of death as more of a philosophical and moral point of recognizing death as being an inevitable part of life and neither running from it or rushing it while the hallows would be more about culling character flaws as not being boastful, knowing when to let go and not letting your fears stop you from living while still keeping reasonable caution. As far as I remember he never thought there were magical ramifications to uniting all three of them.
