In the vein of my earlier post, there aren't many games and sports which are prevalent in Magical society in comparison to Muggle culture. What are the best ideas you've either seen in fics or come up with yourself that incorporate magic nicely into the rules or entertainment?

As an example, I'm currently trying to invent a board or card game for my fic based on actual medieval ones, but with magical pieces or spells as part of the game. A few fics I've read have used the theatre to great effect, with magical equivalents for lighting, sound and special effects. I'm also trying to come up with something less serious than duelling but making use of combat skills; JBern's Dodgespell comes to mind but I'm still exploring other ideas.


** Wooden warriors - each player animates a wood and cloth puppet and then make them fight until either the head or two limbs have been knocked off of their opponent's puppet. Basically rockem-sockem robots, using junkyard stuff.

*** Oooh there's a thought - like a development of wizard chess where the pieces actually fight? There's actually some precedent of a medieval game with uneven pieces called The Philosopher's Game which could work well with this :3

** I remember reading a story where Quidditch and muggle tennis were combined. I don't remember the name, unfortunately.

*** That sounds a lot like Swivenhodge, which I think was one of JKR's ideas for sports which "died out" when Quidditch gained a following.

** Well if we round up everything from canon, you've got:

- Quidditch
- Duelling (All-England Competition)
- Broom racing
- Exploding Snap
- Gobstones
- Wizards' chess
- Collecting Chocolate Frog Cards(?)

On top of that, there's an argument to be made for some game or sport involving Hippogriffs (with all the "fancy" breeding), and possibly even Muggle-baiting when the Ministry was run under Death Eater control.

**** I'd think a magical version of dressage would be more up a hippogriff's alley than agility courses.

** I like to think Scottish wizards play a lot of golf with all sorts of magical course hazards and other novelties. Golf has been around for a long time (predating the Statute of Secrecy) and doesn't require much physical exertion, which wizards don't seem to be fans of.

I imagine Aurors might be into some form of magical skeet shooting.

Wizards probably have other card games besides Exploding Snap. Recall that Hagrid won Norbert's egg in a card game. I doubt Hagrid and Quirrelmort were playing Exploding Snap that evening. I'd be surprised if they didn't have some localized variant of poker. They probably use different decks than the modern standard though. Tarot games may be popular with wizards.

Since Western wizards have Chess and card games, it's probably safe to assume Eastern wizards play Go and Mahjong.

** In the story I'm fleshing out, there's mention of a traveling troupe of duelists that stop in major magical cities throughout the year.

These duelists are well known to be the very best at what they do, and have the ego, charisma, and flamboyancy that would give Gilderoy Lockhart self-esteem issues. They use spells no one has ever seen before. Spectacular to look upon, and every duelist has their own custom spell to finish off their opponent.

The crowds attending these events have their favorites, of course. They bring signs, buy hats and robes, and follow along closely with the rivalries that form between the competitors.

These events don't follow the rules one would find in a typical dueling championship tourney (like the one Flitwick won years ago), but their own special rules. Sure, bowing and saluting is customary, but there are a few duelists who cheat whenever that can, much to the chagrin of the audience.

Not much is known of these dueling prodigies, but speculation is rampant among those who know a thing or two about spellcraft. Some people are even convinced it's all an act. That these duels -- and even the spells themselves -- are fake. A staged performance with predetermined outcomes all for the sake of entertainment.

Of course, nobody listens to those cynics.
