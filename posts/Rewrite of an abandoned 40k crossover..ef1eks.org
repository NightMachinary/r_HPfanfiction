I am doing a rewrite of a 40k story in which Harry is the Emperor of Mankind. He is sent back at the end of the 40k universe, to the start of HP. My story will differ in several ways:

1. Harry is sent back not to the start of SS, but the beginning of DH, or rather Dumbledores funeral.
2. Harry is not the lone surviovr of the Dark millenium. Somehow, and I will not spoil how, others have survived and have been sent back in time.
3. Voldemort will be infected by chaos during the story.
4. Harry remembers his former friends fondly.
5. Harry is not the reincarnation of Shamans of old, rather he is simply an immortal wizard(because of the prophecy) who became the first psyker.

I need some advice for how to write this. Specifically, how will I write the character's interactions with such a powerful being? Harry is more powerful than every being on earth combined. How might they interact, knowing that their friend/enemy is this way?


** So...you're doing a rewrite of someone else's fic? Dude...either get the authors permission or present your work as "inspired by", not a rewrite of.

**** Because plagiarism is bad. We're all playing in JKR's sandbox, and that should be acknowledged in a disclaimer. Which is why I said he should acknowledge he's being inspired by someone elses writing, rather than saying he's just redoing it.

***** How is rewriting a dead fic plagiarism and rewriting the books isn't ? As long as credit is given in both cases of course.

****** Technically, writing fanfiction is a copyright violation (it is a derivative work), but Rowling expressly permits it. No sandbox disclaimer required. But that doesn't give you any rights to create derivative works of another author's original contributions--that author's characters are his/her own.

******* This is a crossover tho, I doubt 40k creators publicly stated any stance about derivative of their work, so it goes back to square one.

** Binge watch this series :) [[https://youtu.be/pcYrTCGKyrU]]

A few things to note.

-Big E had been stucked on the Golden Toilet for like forever. I'd imagine he'd be pretty frustrated and maybe little crazy now.

-I read it somewhere that Big E now don't give a shit about his sons anymore. I think we learn this after Rawbutt Girlyman speak with him face to face after Girlyman woke up from his slumbering. So the emperor might be a bit indifferent to his peers now.

-He has that for-the-greater-good vibe since it's rumoured that he know about Horus's betrayal and still let it happended, despite the damage they caused.

-And make sure he's a big atheist. Dude literally purge everything remotely religious.

Reminder, this fact makes the Imperium being a Theocratic state that worships Big E as a God all the more tragically ironic.
