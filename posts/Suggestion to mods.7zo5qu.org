Given our recent influx of trolls lately, could we maybe introduce a minimum karma to post in the sub rule? Obviously it wouldn't stop it, but it may help discourage people from creating multiple sock puppets to flood the sub.


** Automod is currently set up to auto filter posts/comments from accounts less than a day old and under 10 karma. I can increase those if necessary. The problem was this person was using a bunch of older accounts before. I think I've banned all of those accounts now.

I think increasing it would be helpful, at least in the short term.

*** Hmm...question, what if you set up a bot to notify you whenever someone new posts in HPfanfiction?

Like, whenever a post is made, the bot checks a list; if whoever posted it isn't on said list, they're added to the list, and the bot PMs you to let you know about the newcomer. It could have a 'warmup' period so you aren't spammed with PMs about all the usual posters here already.

The idea being, you quickly get notified whenever any new accounts post on the subreddit, and you can give them the boot if they're being obviously negative and hostile.

Would it work, or are there enough one-time posters here that you'd get spammed with PMs?

** I dunno, I'm not sure it'd work for me. As I recall (though I'm too lazy to find it at the moment), I made my account on Reddit to ask for a fic that I was having trouble finding, after searching around as an anonymous lurker failed to find it.

(It was Potter Ever After, by the way.)

The problem with having a minimum karma requirement, or a minimum posts requirement, or a minimum account duration requirement, or whatever, it's a hassle to people who have been lurking but just-now want to ask a question. Which would, say, include me.

...Besides, if someone was REALLY insistent on trolling, couldn't they just set up multiple accounts (with VPNs or otherwise IP masking), wait a little while, then go on a spree of upvoting each other, downvoting others, sockpuppeting for each other, et-cetera?
