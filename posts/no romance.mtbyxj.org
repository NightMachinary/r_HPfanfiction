is there any fanfic that has little to no romance? or at least don't have Harry be romantically interested in anyone. no character bashing either


** Maybe try linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim)? It's complete and super awesome - action/adventure. Another good one by the same author is linkffn(Sitra Ahra by Voice of the Nephilim).

My ongoing fic is strictly no romance as well linkffn(Boy Who Lived by Gatalicious) - mystery/friendship.

  What if when Voldemort heard the prophecy, he decided that not only would he go after Neville and Harry, but every child born in that year? What if he decided to kill all children born the year before and the year after as well, just to be on the safe side? Harry Potter is the only boy who lived through the Purge, no one knows why. How will a young Harry Potter now cope? No romance

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** These are usually referred to as gen fics.

Here are some recentish ones that haven't been mentioned yet. They are all only on year two or three, so there could be romance eventually in later years, but haven't had any so far. All update kind of slowly though, but do update on occasion.

Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting - Sorting is very different than canon for a lot of the students, which changes a lot of dynamics. One of my favorite Dumbledore depictions though we've only seen him a bit. linkffn(13256350)

Harry Potter, et al, and the Keystone Council - Basically five different versions of Harry that could each be their own fics can talk to each other mentally, and help each other out as they all experience the canon plot events. linkffn(12979337)

What's Her Name in Hufflepuff - An SI fic (this means someone from the real world ends up in HP world by some means). The SI gets sorted into Hufflepuff, and becomes friends with Hermione, but not Harry or Ron. Really interesting depiction of Daphne (I think she's autistic). linkffn(13041698)

The Devil You Know - Harry befriends the scarcrux. However it's a more humorous/lighter take on this than is typical. For example Harry is convinced that Marvolo (what the horcrux calls himself since it's pretending to not be Voldemort) was a failed dark lord that never became famous and whose plans were always way over complicated and usually blew up in his face, and who is terrible at architecture since his evil layer was a dilapidated shack. linkao3(19312162)

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** The Pureblood Pretense is almost entirely non-romantic, there are two characters (not the main characters) who have some romantic feelings, but the person doesn't return those feelings and it's maybe a scene or two in the entire series so far.

*** The category gen is supposed to mean no romance, though some people use it to just mean romance isn't the main focus so it gets a bit muddy. But if the only category tag is gen, rather than multiple category tags, then odds are there will be very little if any romance.

**** Agreed yeah. The gen category is useful but can get very grey in terms of if there is actually romance in the story. Def have to read through the tags to see what you're in for.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
