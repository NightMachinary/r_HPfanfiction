recommendations for all things harmony are welcome, except for AUs. i really prefer the story to be more or less stays the same, i don't mind a few changes here and there as long as it stays relatively similar to the canon story. with that said, what do you think are the best harmony stories? any staples out there that every harmony fan should read? and of course what are your favorite stories of the pairing...

....and if its not too much to ask, i'd like the stories to have smut,don't really care how much smut there is as long as its present.


** You should check out portkey.org it's a themed site for h/hr fics. Plenty of smut there too.

** If you love Harmony, then portkey is the website for you. It doesn't fit with your criteria of being really close to cannon but I always recommend Forever Knight to any Harmony shippers, especially if you want smut. Fantastic sex scenes and a truly engaging plot. The very beginning is all fluff but as the prologue indicates, it doesnt stay sunshine (haha, see what I did there) and rainbows forever. Seriously, my favorite Harmony story of all time and I have been shipping them for about 9 years now. [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=5185&chapterid=&agree=1]]

** Check out Robst. Almost all of his stuff is H/Hermione, fluff but worth the read.

** Not necessarily smutty, but these are some of my favorite H/Hr stories: linkffn(Vox Corporis) linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof) linkffn(Came out of the darkness) Sunset Over Britain and Sunrise Over Britain by bobmin at fanficauthors Smuttier stories linkffn(A Boon for Bill) Definitely recommend portkey.org for smutty stories. There I liked Forever Knight, the stories by madscientist, lorien829, and tons of others. Browse around there if you haven't. It's a treasure trove.

** To speak of "quintessential" H/Hr, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element) was a favourite of mine back in the day. Pun totally intended.
