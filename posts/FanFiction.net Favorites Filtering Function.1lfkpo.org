So I mainly get my fix of HP fanfiction through browsing Fanfiction.net. I'll find an author who's stuff I like and pick and choose from their favorites list to find other authors I enjoy. With so much material out there, I get picky about what I want and so my main issue is having to sifting all the stories for the ones that fit my criteria. I went searching and found a javascript that would sort out incomplete stories and what not but it wasn't quiet what I wanted. I ended up altering it to fit my needs and I just wanted to share it in case anyone else was interested.

The script will allow you to filter the favorite stories of a fanfaction user based on each story's word count, number of reviews, status, and category. These stories can be further filtered based on last update and original publish date.

You can get the script [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/176917][here]]

To run it you will need an script running addon such as [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/][Greasemonkey]] for firefox (a quick Google turned up the equivalent [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en][Tampermonkey]] for chrome users)

Let me know what you think or if you have any idea for things to change. I think the next thing to tackle would be to add an settings panel for users change variables in rather than forcing them to edit the source code.

Edit: I made a sight change to the code so that completed stories that have not been updated since your set date do not get filtered out.


** This is going to make my life easier. Thank you so much!

** Doesn't appear to work, in Tampermonkey at least.

Edit: ReferenceError: unsafeWindow is not defined

Fixed it by changing the references to unsafeWindow to window.

*** +I looked online a bit, apparently Chrome does not like unsafeWindow. I tried switching out them out to just window and running it on Firefox with Greasemonkey but that breaks it. I'll be honest, this was my first time touching javascript so I don't have a quick fix to make it universally compatible.+

ok changing to window does work, I must have missed one of the commands the first time when I was just editing it through Greasemonkey and not notepad++. updating code now.

Thank you for discovering this and a solution for it. I'll keep my eye out for ways to improve it.
