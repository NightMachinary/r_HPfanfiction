As the name would suggest I'm once more looking for some help from you lovely people, this time I'm seeking out some decent Post-War fics.

I am fine with 7th year no Voldy, or simply after Hogwarts. My preference for this little search would be a humorous or entertaining fic. Not looking specifically for a lot of drama or heartache, just looking for something very fun to read. Slash is completely fine, as is non-slash. I'm not looking for next gen character involvement where possible.

Thank you for reading and a preemptive Thank you for any suggestions offered.
