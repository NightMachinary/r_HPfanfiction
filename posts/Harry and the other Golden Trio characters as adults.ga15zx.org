What are some of your favorite Harry and other Golden Trio characters as adults, stories?

They can be 17 or older.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

Anyone can be the main character, can have any warnings, can be on any site.

NO Weasley bashing.

No Lord Potter, Harem Harry or OP Harry. Harry slightly more powerful or slightly smarter then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be relatively believable.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine.

Can be canon or AU.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524866/1/Flowers-for-Hermione][Flowers-for-Hermione]] I have never been this excited over a fic. It is a slice of life Harmony WIP and is full of fluff. I initially hesitated to read it due to the angst tag but once I decided to give it a try I could not stop. I was up till 4 am reading it.

*** Mhm, I'm often iffy on the ship because of how the author tends to write the Weasley's, how are they in this?

**** No bashing at all. Ginny actually gets the measurements of Hermione's fingers discreetly for Harry. Ron is still their best friend and with Luna though the story focuses on Harry and Hermione. The other characters make an appearance when they are required.

** Linkffn(sum of their parts; Midnight Blues by Zeitgeist84) those are the two trio fics that i personally like. The first one is ymmv. The next one is a noir telling of life after the books.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.

** Most Starfox5 fics are about competent Trio slightly more powerful than canon, often as adults. For example Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died) is entirely AU with the main characters all young adults. My favorite, Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has the first chapter in second year with the main canon divergence, then covers the Hogwarts years relatively quickly just mentioning what's different and then most of it is with the Trio as adults, Harry and Ron's adventures as aurors, Hermione's heists, and politics.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
