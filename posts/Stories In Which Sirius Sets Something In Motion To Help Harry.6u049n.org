** "A Marauder's Plan" and "Heart and Soul" have Sirius doing this. I can't recall if there was any bashing, though.

** When I saw the title, I got a mental image of Sirius pushing a pebble down a hill, whereupon it hits a rock and sends it rolling, which hits a bigger rock, which hits a boulder, which hits a big boulder...like in Wide Open Spaces 1947.

You know, setting things in motion.
