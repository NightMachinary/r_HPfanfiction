Y'all know any fanfics where young Harry(like either before Hogwarts if possible) becomes a kitsune or kyuubi animagus? Like I'm not talking him going to naruto verse but he somehow at a young age learned to turn into a kitsune. If you can't find one where hes an animagus then could you find one where he is actually part kitsune. Like he looks human but(hopefully before his first year at Hogwarts) he manages to change into one and then learns hes part kitsune.

It would also be nice if the fanfic could have above 15 chapters?

Sorry if this is too much trouble but ive been running out of reading material and need help...


** Synkardias on AO3 does this really well IMO.

***** I just randomly decided to search Kitsune Harry Potter, and read whatever caught my interest. I do this fairly often with different tags so I always have a variety

** The only story I've read had Harry with two animagus forms of a wolf and a kitsune. The story is called Harry Potter and the Tails of Change by KarouWS9

  It's the end of the third year and Harry's home for the holidays. The Dursley's are on holiday and Harry is studying over the summer, doing research on Animagus transformations. In this story, Tonks is two years younger than Canon. Rated M for Caution. This story is AU, and will include F/F relations, so be warned.

** Here is one I found, the original is not to bad but the rewrite definitely has more content and filler. Just remember to read the tags, just incase you do not like some things. It is Albus/Molly/Ron/Hermione/Ginny bashing fiction so be warned. I will keep my eye out for any others.
