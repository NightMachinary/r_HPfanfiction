** /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is one of the best Luna-fics of all.

It's Luna's perspective of the events of /Order of the Phoenix./

*** The one thing that really shocked me in this was that the author correctly predicted Pandora Lovegood's name, before even Xenophilius' name was revealed.

** It's a very small part of a very small fic, but it's Luna who is quirky but still a teenage girl.

linkffn(7971405) - I so wish this story had continued or that it had anything else similar to it in the fandom. Luna is a normal girl who has strange parents.

There are others I would recommend for Luna who is not the same as common fanon:

linkffn(8629685) - Because Firebird's Son deserves to be mentioned. But it's so dark and depressing, that people usually read just the first book (Yes, it gets worse).

linkffn(3894793) - This should earn an honourable mention. Clell is an author you either find amusing or hate.

It's super difficult to make Luna an actual person. The fanon character of her has been so well established that the canon portrayal of her is basically lost. Which is a shame. In canon she was a lost, quirky girl, that didn't have any friends before the DA. In fanon she is an all-powerful seer who can destroy realities with her predictions.

  Magic is everywhere. It is the energy that makes up all life and controls the very elements themselves. Magic is alive, a creature untamed, a savage beast. Well, we know what they say about beasts and music.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6862426/1/The-Quidditch-World-Cup]])

Really good fic.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2424442/1/Sitting-on-a-tree]])

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487457/1/A-Boy-a-Girl-an-Owl-and-a-Train-Compartment]])

Are the firsts of two series of one-shots which are truly outstanding.
