Could be "harry finds out all sorts of things have been hidden from him for evil reasons" to "people realise potter doesn't know basic shit and helps him become better"

Whatever the reason as long as Harry is upset everyone had this information but it was denied him, and then gets info that helps his life become better.


** Innocent explanation: Harry did get it, the pamphlet was inside the first letter that Vernon burned. Nobody knows he never read it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?
