Books 1-3 were written towards a much younger demographic, particularly PS and CoS. As the main villain, Voldemort is the antithesis of Harry Potter, while also having similarities -- as a great villain should. However, as the books started to aim towards older audiences, Voldemort went from a great villain, to a two-dimensional stereotypical evil, as did the Death Eaters. It is clear from OoTP, with the introduction of characters like Umbridge, that Rowling is capable of writing villainous antagonists with some depth. Yet, there is still a lack of 'moral greyness' that could have been further explored.

As a character, Voldemort was simply pure evil. Nothing wrong with that, per se, as Emperor Palpatine (or simply, The Senate) illustrates. Even so, Palpatine showed many facets beyond cackling evil ham, while proving to be an immensely powerful individual. Star Wars showed how Palpatine pulled the strings and killed (or worse) those who got in his way.

For a much more recent villain, look no further than MCU Thanos. In the mainstream comics, Thanos' main motivation for killing half the Universe is to literally court Death (who is female). No matter what he does, though, Mistress Death is disinterested in his advances. Beyond his obsession with Death, you learn Thanos' backstory of being a mutant Eternal and being ostracised because of it.

Meanwhile, MCU!Thanos views culling half of the Universe as a necessary task, that requires herculean will. Does he torture the heroes? Laugh at their pain? Does he think nothing but evil thoughts? MCU!Thanos is a incredibly well-written character, let alone villain. [[/spoiler][After kidnapping Gamora, what is one of the first things he does? He offers her food, as one would expect an estranged father to do. When he has to kill Gamora, the only person he has ever truly cared about, the tears falling down his face are genuine. He goes through with it, and it weighs heavily down on him throughout the rest of the movie.]]

The Fantastic Beasts movies seem to be going in the right direction with Grindelwald. He isn't simply "Cruio this! Crucio that!" Instead, the man is charismatic and his views are understandable, to an extent. Did you ever once agree with Voldemort or the Death Eaters, even to some degree? Even though they were horrible individuals, beyond the Malfoy family, we never saw them be like regular people -- because the bottom line: a lot of people who follow facist movements tend to be regular people, for the most part. Real-world history tends to dehumanise the evils of the past, for good reason when we are young. However, as we grow older (and hopefully wiser), it becomes more apparent there is more to even the foulest of individuals.

So, here is what I would suggest as a main antagonist for books 5-7. It would have to be someone close to Harry and co, with semi-understandable goals and motivations. Someone whom it would kill us to read facing our heroes, as well as causing conflict amongst them. This might be unpopular, but I've always found Hermione would have been the perfect main antagonist for the latter two/three books -- a muggleborn witch tired of the prejudice and discrimination, sick of the ineffective ways to combat a unfair system; someone who has shown to be ruthless, (self-)righteous, and a nice foil to Voldemort. With a more mature demographic, Hermione as the main antagonist would highlight the shift from whimsical, child-like storytelling to young adult.


** While I agree that Voldemort was a boring monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain, I disagree that Hermione would make a good antagonist in latter books. She was simply too young and low powered for that. Keeping Voldemort as the main villain is of course the right choice, but he could be written very differently, for example like Emily Price.

Hermione might very well become Frank Underwood Squared by the time of Epilogue. But then, Harry could be fully complicit with her.

**** I don't know. Frank Underwood grew up in a quite abusive household, but wasn't really evil and power hungry until much later. Compared to Hermione's long rap sheet she had compiled while in the school, Frank's achievements paled utterly. I can safely claim that Hermione definitely trumped Frank in the ruthlessness department when they were still teens.

By the time the War ended, Hermione was already a hardened child soldier. Love for your family and friends was all good, until you always gave them the best deals and posts. Protectiveness sounded noble, until you exacted excessive retributions when your friends got hurt or only slighted. It was only normal for traumatized people to become paranoid, and I totally expect Hermione, Harry, and co to resort to preemptive strikes against perceived enemies.

Hermione was at core a very dangerous person. Fortunately for the world, she befriended Harry and Ron.

***** I think you either have forgotten just how evil Frank Underwood was or have a distorted/wishful view of canon Hermione.

Frank's treatment of Peter Russo; rehabilitating him from alcoholic to potential state governor just to turn around and kill the man because he serves a purpose takes a ruthlessness few posses, least of all Hermione. Hermione is loyal, she won't turn around and kill someone she called friend just to serve her needs.

Hermione's actions don't even come close to what Underwood did. His treatment of Zoe Barnes shows us this. He [fucks](/spoiler) her not for pleasure or out of any emotional desire, but to have a form of power of her. Do you see Hermione doing that? He then uses her for a length of time and then when she becomes a liability he disposes of her.

What rap sheet? Marietta? Her treatment of Edgecomb has zero comparison to Underwood. Zero. Underwood was intentional, he was direct. He was emotionless in what he did. Hermione's intention behind the jinx was not to maim, whereas Underwood is a sword that strikes to kill.

I really can't see a scenario where Hermione does any of these things; she does not have the capacity to be so emotionally detached from people such that they are only instruments playing to her tune. Her interactions with Ron and Harry certainly suggest otherwise. Hermione has friends, Frank has tools. Canon Hermione is a "good" person. Frank Underwood is most certainly not.

You can't possibly compare Underwood's actions after decades of political power struggles vs Hermione's transgressions as a high school student.

Hermione would be Underwood's age by the time of the Epilogue. My comment was to show that Frank Underwood's actions are something that Hermione would never do; she does not have the emotional detachment necessary. Canon Hermione's ruthlessness (if you can call it that) always had some moral standing. Underwood's do not; they are purely for his own gain.

No. Hermione did not kill anyone, nor did she try to.

Hermione's school years just don't point to her to becoming that kind of person, if anything they point towards the opposite. Hermione does not become a Frank Underwood unless something very significant happens in those 19 years before the Epilogue. She is loyal, she has a strong moral compass, she is brave, and she does not view people as pawns.

***** I disagree with your assesment. She's fundamentally very compassionate and kind (my favourite aspect of her character) and as we leave her in Deathly Hallows there's no indication she's changed in character-irrespective of the horrors she went through. She doesn't want to kill the Death Eaters (in fact she's genuinely appalled at the idea) and she never hates Draco or Snape (or Dumbledore), she's not filled with hate against the wider wizarding world. She's even the moral compass for the series.

Hermione is very black and white in her morality, particularly in the early books. Her acts of ruthlessness are impassioned-not cold and calculating, done out of simple frustration and an impassioned belief against the wrongness of the perpetrator's actions. I can't see her ever genuinely stooping to that level.

****** As I wrote in my other comment, Frank wasn't that evil and power hungry in his teenage and college years either. His abusive and mentally deranged father even asked Frank to kill him one time, but Frank didn't oblige.

What the Trio went through could put anyone over the edge. Let's just say they would be “toughened up” decades beyond their actual age. Even the most compassionate person could turn ruthless and paranoid against their (perceived) enemies.

Having strong morals and belief system could actually make her worse, or more radical and ruthless against her enemies. (Potential) Threats against her friends and families would be dealt with harshly. If you think only the cold and calculating are capable of atrocities, then you are very very wrong.

That being said, I agree with you that she would not stoop to wonton murder and torture like the Death Eaters, but she could easily use judicial tools to utterly expose, humiliate, and destroy (economically and politically) her enemies. 50+ years solitary confinement in prison is even acceptable in liberal Muggle democracies.

Speaking of economically destroying her enemies, the mass torture of Hogwarts students would give them ample justifications to do so. Hermione would be completely outraged at what happened. I could see her and Harry going totally activist, riling up the populace, organizing the masses, and demanding severe retributions against Death Eaters and other Voldemort sympathizers.

Hermione, IMHO, can be the perfect model of a radical revolutionary.

I don't think she would be filled with hate and anger at the end of the day. I see someone like Hermione arguing for the opposite approach in most circumstances, less severe retribution for the Death Eaters/sympathisers, particularly considering she has real (Muggle) war awareness of how severe punishments against the defeated only lead to more problems and future wars.

Harry on the other hand would be furious and more then anyone he could go down that path.

If they had done as Dumbledore asked and removed the Dementors, they wouldn't have nearly as much issues. I wouldn't say they were even kind to the Death Eaters at all. The ones they were less harsh to were Snape and Karkoroff, both of whom were bad in their everyday life, but neither did anything egregious outside of that.

What they should have done, is start to get rid of the attitude towards Muggle Borns, by making Muggle Studies compulsory.

** I'd be pretty dissapointed if all the build-up in the first few books towards a final showdown with Voldemort was thrown away.

Voldemort was always a simple villain, he's evil and cruel purely for the sake of it-people like that do exist unfortunately. His childhood adds a bit of layers, but he's definitely never potrayed as anything other then straight up evil.

I think Pettigrew, Draco and even Lucius add humanity to the Death Eaters side but you're absolutetly not meant to sympathise with their ideals-with the connections to the Nazis and everything.

Grindelwald was always the villain that's movement had a less straight evil purpose 'for the Greater Good'.

Side Note: Voldemort's a fine villain. Villains don't have to have 'good motives' and 'complexity' all the time. He was pretty terrifying until you realised how ultimatetly weak he truely was (because of his arrogance).

***** Yet Voldemort /is/ a very different person from Tom Riddle. It wasn't just a name that he changed, but his soul. By the time the events of canon occur, Voldemort is only a shadow of what Tom Riddle was. Tom Riddle was human; even if he lacked empathy, he was still very sane. He was a deceiver, a villain that was subtle and complex. He was a person that the audience could even, to a certain extent, relate to - afraid of his own mortality, a hatred for those who abused him, a love for Hogwarts, his first home. He had /depth./

But Voldemort is a caricature. He is ruled by his hatred, fear and arrogance. His methods are shallow, his mind is imbalanced and his soul is so diminished he is little more than a creature playing at a macabre version of humanity. His own drives are unclear - he wanted to rule the world, but /why/? Was it simply a mindless desire for power? Was it a hatred for Muggles? Was it for the pureblood cause? Voldemort's motives are murky and muddled. I get the feeling that even he has forgotten what they were.

Put simply, Voldemort's background is infinitely more fascinating than the man himself as he was portrayed in canon.

It drove him to kill his father, it drove him to create Horcruxes. We can, somewhat, understand why Tom is driven to commit those early atrocities. But Voldemort has already achieved immortality (or at least, he believes he has) by the time of his resurrection, which is when he really starts to come into play. He has already killed his father, and is no longer angry, really, more disdainful. So what else is left to drive him? That's what I mean by his motivations being unclear. Why is he trying to take over the Wizarding World? What does he hope to achieve when he does? It's never specified, and it seems more like Voldemort is trying to gain power for the sake of having power. And that is a shallow reasoning that makes for a boring antagonist.

I'll try rephrasing then. Striving for power is a clear motivation, but it's also a shallow one. Where it gets murky is his goals. What does he intend to do with this power once he has achieved it? He's aimless, and what few defined goals he has (kill all Muggleborns) is one-dimensional and boring.

********** Thinking about it, they are kind of similar. Professors seem to turn a blind eye to their hijinx. Tom comes across as more naturally charismatic and more naturally manipulative. But Harry has his moments (think Whomping Willow “it was before term” argument. Both gather their supporters (DA and DE) around them. And seem to have an inner circle of their own. One teaches his followers the dark arts and the other to combat those arts.

*********** I don't think any of those are similarities in /character/ though. Maybe the only actual similarity is that they are both good leaders, but using that to argue that they are similar is quite the stretch.

Here are all the similarities I can think of right now:

- Parselmouth
- Muggle background (not very uncommon)
- Followers for Tom, friends and some followers for Harry; Tom gets his followers with his natural charisma and manipulation, Harry gets his mostly because of Umbridge and because he's the boy-who-lived

I don't think we can really count the "teachers turn a blind eye" thing since it's not really anything Harry actively does (unlike Tom, who manipulates all teachers except Dumbledore into liking him), and it's not even really happening with Harry, except for Dumbledore who does it for his own reasons.

  Like an estranged father. An abusive asshole, indeed. I am not saying Thanos is right nor am I agreeing with his goal. His motivations are understandable -- he isn't just a guy looking for power and craving destruction.
#+end_quote

Except that's literally exactly what he is. He's searching the galaxy looking for magical rocks that grant him power to commit the single most destructive act in the universe.

The only real difference is charisma and the fact that the viewer spends time with Thanos. in fact, the viewer probably spends more time with Thanos during Infinity War, a two and a half hour movie, than it would take to read all of Voldemort's focused chapters in the entirety of Harry Potter. That's an artistic choice and one often not served well for a series of children's books.

** This goes from a kind of obvious point (Voldemort isn't a great villain) to an obviously stupid one. Hermione wouldn't make a good villain by any stretch. Like... what? That's like saying someone should write a story where Anne Frank becomes a villain during WWII. Hermione was vicious in a very limited way, not to attain her broader goals.of equal rights for muggleborns and elves.

** Voldemort was not pure evil, that just shows you don't understand his character.

Voldemort was not written very well throughout books 4-7 I will agree with you there. But what do you do with him? All of the setup in the earlier books points to a confrontation of sorts. There is too much ground work not to have him as a villain.

I dislike Hermione but even I can see that she would not become a Dark Lord. Having her become like Voldemort is something Hermione bashing doesn't even do.

*** Beyond acting how you would expect from a villain, Voldemort didn't really have humanising moments.

I am not saying become like Voldemort -- in fact, quite the opposite. If Hermione (or any other character close to Harry) became the antagonist, they would serve as a foil.

**** His childhood gave us some moments of depth, but I agree Voldemort is somewhat difficult to relate to. Most of us don't have the thirst for power that he did. What we see in canon is something we see often in fictional works. Writers don't usually want the villains to be someone we can relate to.

  "would have undermined one of the themes of the books: that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves. We are the monsters. (And the heroes too). Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil," - George R R Martin
#+end_quote

JK did a good job of making villains somewhat relatable but Voldemort falls flat being just another Dark Lord. However villains like Draco, Umbridge, Lucius, and Cornelius Fudge are all very relatable and hit much closer to home.
