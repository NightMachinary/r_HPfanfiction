Lily is some kind of super Auror who got sent to Maygarland (Hungary) to kill some upstarty Dark Lord. James has fertility problems. Petunia has two daughters, both witches. And I'm pretty sure Tom Riddle wasn't a total wacko and more of a respected leader of a conservative political party.


** Ah, The Long Game by inwardtransience, good story. Also similar themes in To Reach Without by the same author. linkffn(11762909)

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

*** Sometimes I have to skip what may well be awesome stories because I refuse to read a terrible name over and over and over. This is one of those times.

**** The Long Game is interesting, but I prefer the author's other big story. To Reach Without. But, there are some name changes in their that may annoy you as well. linkffn(11862560)

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)
