I'm looking for Hermione Triad Fics, with a dark twist. Preferably m/m/f. I really liked Devilish by Slytherindoll linkffn(12250770) I prefer Remus/Sirius, Snape/Lucius, Draco/Blaise, but am open to others. Thank you ☺️


** This is a long one, but I loooved it. There's also a second part that's a WIP! Love triangle with some triad action. Not super dark in the traditional sense, but it's got angst and is BDSM-heavy (might want to pass if that isn't your cup of tea). Snape/Lucius with a bit of Draco sprinkled in

** I think linkffn(Lady of the Lake by Columbrina) that fits the bill, but I could never get into it.

I tried /Devilish/... Couldn't stand the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification][chickification]] of Hermone. Canon Draco wouldn't /dare/ to try to do what he does in the fic to canon Hermione, and if he did, he'd never get away with it.

  Hermione and Draco team up after the war to overthrow the Order and take over wizarding Britain. "I don't even especially mind belonging to you most of the time," he closes his eyes and just breathes for a bit, savoring not being in pain. Finally he adds, "Just... try to take better care of your toys." Dark Dramione. COMPLETE

*** I agree with you, but found it an exciting setting nonetheless. I agree that he shouldn't be able to get away with it, and it's far from canon. Thanks for the tip

** No Greater Love is a triad (Draco/Blaise/Hermione) and it starts with torture, so I guess it's dark, but the relationships aren't abusive.
