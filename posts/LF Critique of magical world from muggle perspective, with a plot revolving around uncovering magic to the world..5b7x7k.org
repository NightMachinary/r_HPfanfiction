Title.

And no, I don't mean magic-muggle war.


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623]["Disillusion, by Hermione Granger" by Esama]] sounds like it fits the bill.

*** Good and really interesting story. Although I would prefer normal one, with dialog and stuff, not written like a scientific paper, I'll take what I can get.

** The HPMoR + Following the Phoenix combo. linkffn(5782108;10636246). It actually have wizard-muggle war, but its probably the least bad option for what you look for. Probably some other HpMOR fansequels also feature tearing ISOS down.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
