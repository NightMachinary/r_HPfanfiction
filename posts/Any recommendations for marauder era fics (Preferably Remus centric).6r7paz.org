** I highly recommend Bitten in The Moonlight, it may have quite a few errors but it kept me interested and I was genuinely sad when it was over.

  What if during one of their full moon adventures a horrible mistake was made and James Potter was bitten? What if he became a werewolf too? Non-canon Seventh Year of the Marauders. James/Lily.
