I would not blame you for not having one, double negative.


** Harry/Fleur/Gabrielle ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Well, theoretically, anyway. I haven't found any real stories featuring this pairing. But Harry with two hot French sisters could be all sorts of awesome.

It would have to start with Harry in his twenties for obvious reasons.

  What would happen if a certain pink hair Auror was introduced to Harry a little sooner? What if Voldemort was less concerned about secrecy and had built up his forces while he was without a body? A storm would gather and like always Harry will find himself in the middle. Takes place during Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts. HarryxTonksxFleur.

**** I do, but only a couple. Despite how popular the pairing combinations are that make up that trio (Drarry, Dramione, Harmony), there is not much for content outside of oneshots when it comes to the three together. I have only found a couple that I liked.

I really liked linkffn(9596920) The Soul of the Wolves. It was based off a writing challenge and the original story for that challenge is linkffn(9237863) Paw Prints in the Sand. I thought Soul was better than Paw Prints by quite a bit but I put it in here in case you wanted to check both out.

Also a much shorter, but good series is [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/37166][Raging Sensations]].

There's a pretty good one with the three of them plus Ron as well, of all people (so 4 instead of 3). Here's the link to that one too if you're curious. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/959572/chapters/4051674][Bound by Duty]] by SoftObsidian74
