I As you can all probably gather I am here for nothing more or less than the purpose of shameless self promotion in the name of better future for my first work.

That is to say, beta readers are welcome to pick it apart, give suggestions and offer (constructive) criticism.

English is not my first language so corrections, tips and explanations on the finer details of language and the British culture are especially welcome.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time and consideration to help. This, for me, is a new and exciting endeavor.


** Hi pardon typos I'm on my phone.

First, cut the first chapter. It's unnecessary and will turn people away immediately since its nothing new. You can move it to the very beginning of your first chapter and just use italics.

The story could be interesting but its too soon to tell. I do feel like you've conveyed the kind of chaotic precision that is dance though. That part is done very well.

Ending of chapter 2 is a bit much for a character that is supposed to be 9. I specifically take issue with the word sanity. I would change it to something more childlike even if she is mature. Something like "where she could just be her."

The rest of the chapter is written believably with a confusing bug interesting narrative. You'll have to fix some technical things with quotes, you're adding way too many breaks. For example.

"There is some improvement since the November showing," Renaud observed, "your parents will want to see progress but it seems you've hit a plateau." "You're consistently lagging behind." she gave them a critical look, " It's Viennese," her voice lightened, "it's brisk, it's exciting," she pleaded, "take smaller strides if it helps you! You should be flying!"

You have two separate dialogs from the same person, no problem. But then you have a second set of quotes even though the same person is talking and nothing has happened in between nor is there a paragraph break. After that you have 4 statements separated by 3 descriptors. Its too much, condense it in the future down. Here is an example using two options for how to do that.

"There is some improvement since the November showing," Renaud observed with a critical look, "your parents will want to see progress but it seems you've hit a plateau. You're consistently lagging behind."

The teacher spun away throwing her hands up in frustration, her voice rising lightly." It's Viennese! It's brisk, it's exciting, take smaller strides if it helps you! You should be flying!"

** A but late but:

check for spelling mistakes, *angrly * Lotter * grumled

The sentences feel kind of short and abrupt, so try and expand on your ideas. yknow, show don't tell.

/She glared with such venom the girl convulsed/

maybe you mean that she shrunk backwards or something? convulsed means that she threw a fit, like is squirming around on the floor

Other than that, the story is pretty good and is really interesting. great job!
