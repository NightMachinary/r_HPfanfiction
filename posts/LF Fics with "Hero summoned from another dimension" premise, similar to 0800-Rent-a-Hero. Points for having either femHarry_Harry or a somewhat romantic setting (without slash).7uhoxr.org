I've read a few, but none that i did were complete, except one where its a 2-chapter (i think its one from Colt01). Also liked this one linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl-who-lived), which isn't actually complete, its just part 1.


** linkffn(Intersecting Realities by rightous malestrom) - It's from the perspective of a fem!Harry. She gets trained by a powerful Slytherin!Harry.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
