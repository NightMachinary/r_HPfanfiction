I'm looking for stories in which Harry is extremely sassy, sarcastic, and clever.

An example of one would be the Harry in moshpit's Echoes of Power. linkffn(3322666)


** linkffn(So sue me by Lunakatrina) fits your request the most. There's also linkffn(Trolling the toad) in which Harry is more of a prankster but it's good.

** Linkffn(So Sue Me by lunakatrina)

#+begin_quote
  "So let me get this straight, you want me to come to this school of yours and learn witchcraft."

  "Wizardry," The older woman, called McGonagall corrected without a thought.

  "And then you want me to," Here Harry's brow furrowed, "bang this fellow Voldemort?"

  The woman and the younger man flinched, and the woman corrected him with, "You-know-who!'

  "No, I don't know who," Harry replied.

  "She means Voldemort," Dumbledore replied, smiling gently. The woman and man flinched.

  "Yeah," Harry said blinking in confusion, "that's what I said."

  "The name Voldemort," they flinched, Harry decided he was going to have to see if that worked on everyone, "frightens many people," Dumbledore explained. "They prefer to refer to him as you-know-who."

  "But if you were planning a surprise party," Harry asked, "would everyone think you were throwing a party for Voldemort? Like: what are you getting you-know-who for the you-know-what'?"

  Dumbledore tugged on his beard, and replied thoughtfully, "Well..."

  "Or what if you were talking to someone about their crush," Harry asked, "would everyone think you wanted to go with Voldemort? Like: 'You know who will definitely like that dress on you.'"

  "I don't---"

  "Or what if your friends were talking to you about someone you didn't like," Harry proposed, "would you think they were talking about Voldemort? Like: 'you won't believe what---"

  "In those cases!" Dumbledore interrupted loudly, "he is referred to as he-who-must-not-be-named."

  "Oh, yes," Harry muttered, "that's definitely better; you have no idea how much that cuts down on confusion."
