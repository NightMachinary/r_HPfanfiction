I just read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], by Bennybear, and kind of fell in love with its depiction of Draco and his gradual redemption. The author mentions that more works might be forthcoming, and of course I will read other works already there, but I'd love to get some recommendations.

I really liked the slice of life aspects, the interaction between Draco and the muggle world was very well done. I'd love to find more fics which might hit similar notes. I'd very much enjoy a similar fic with more romance, truth be told.

Long reads are preferred, if possible. I don't usually read almost 200K words in nearly one sitting, but did in this case. :)

Thanks for any thoughts, as always.


** The Man Who Lived follows a Draco that went muggle several years prior, and is currently living as such. And is working with troubled inner city teens in the US (I don't recall what city). It shows how he's changed, and touches on how those changes came about. Very much a character study rather than a plot driven story.

However, it's Drarry which isn't everyone's cup of tea. I'm also not a fan of Harry's characterization (which isn't to say that it's a /bad/ or even unrealistic characterization, I simply didn't like it), but it ticks some of those boxes for you.

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

** Unfortunately, Bennybear promised that sequel in 2010, and so far nothing showed up ...
