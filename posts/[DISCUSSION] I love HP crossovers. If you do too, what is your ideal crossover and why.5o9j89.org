I really love stories where HP gets transferred to a different fictional universe. LoTR, GoT and star wars are pretty common, and they're great, but there is so much potential with this type of crossover that it's a shame not seeing it more with other fandoms as well. What is the crossover that you've always wanted to see and why? Do you have an idea for a plot or for how HP's introduction to that world would go? What sort of changes would Harry cause?


** *Harry Potter+ Game of Thrones*

Harry accidentally creates ice inferi known as white walkers, he decides to travel south to escape the cold and the abominations he created not realising that they are following him. As time moves on and his creations continue to wreak havoc, though his identity is shrouded in mystery, he becomes known as The Great Other. It would be a short story of how Harry accidentally destroyed Westeros.

** I personally quite like /some/ Tolkien crossovers, where the Golden Trio (ideally, the Ministry Six actually, but just plus Ginny would work) end up in Middle Earth. I'd like a fic where it turns out the Elves still exist, they're just even more reclusive than the centaurs, as in, extremely little is known about them.

Could turn out goblins are all descended from Gollum. Now there's a thought.

I also really like Avengers crossovers. You cannot convince me that Fury & co don't have ties to Department of Mysteries around the world, or a couple of Muggleborns or even purebloods working for them. As well as contacts everywhere.

*** I'd really like to read some more Tolkien crossovers. Shadow of Angmar has been a of fun. The problem I have is looking through the list, it's just Harry/Legolas slash as far as the eye can see. I suppose part of the problem is that if you like pairings, you don't have many choices, because there is a supreme lack of female characters in the Hobbit/LotR era.

Bit of the same issue with Avengers. Many male characters favors slash. I have read a few Harry/Black Widow pairing stories that I rather enjoyed though. linkffn(The Spider's Web by Merrick Mayfair) and linkffn(Harry Potter: The Avenger by kb0) come to mind.

** I'd love a long Dresden Files crossover where Dresden helps train Harry to fight Voldemort. The crossovers I've read of them are mostly short fics or barely had Dresden in it. The couple that are complete and star Dresden tend to be slash and I'm not a fan of that.

Another that I think would work well is a crossover with Piers Anthony's Xanth series. I'd like it to be more like the first few books, as in more grown up and less cookie cutter Mad Libs like the last 30 or so books. Harry would really be able to do some crazy stuff there but the puns would be a bitch to include.

I could see a crossover with The Crow having James or Lily coming back to wreck some serious wizard ass.

**** Dresden files is great. read the first 3 at least before you make a decision on things. the first couple books are very old, and were meant to 'mass appeal' and hopefully sell the series. The world is established in the first two, then book three has some serious "OH!" moments. Honestly probably one of my fave series.

**** The Crow is a comic series as well as a movie series (but the first movie is all you really need to watch. The sequels aren't nearly as good). They also made a meh TV show and some novels. Basically someone dies and comes back later to avenge them and anyone else who died with him.

Xanth is a 30 some odd book series where everyone has a single magic "talent". Some are very strong, others are weak. It's rather random. The first few books were more adult in situations but it quickly became aimed at a younger group and is infested with word puns. The plot is quite literally the same each book too, with only the characters modifying the plot somewhat.

****** The Crow is on everyones "should watch once" list, I think. It's a bit older these days (1994), but it's very classic. (also, it is listed on wikipedia as a 'dark fantasy action' film

They're actually working on a remake, so, I'd recommend watching the old one before the new one comes out -- that's the one everyone loves and thew new one.. well. It might be amazing, it might be awful.

As for xanth. <deep breath> The first xanth book was published in 1977 and they have generally being published at a rate of one or two a year since then. (the 40th will be published in a couple months) .... I love the idea of the story world. .... but the books were written a long time ago by someone who is even older. Nothing wrong with older people, but it is to say, the stories when our world was a bit different. It's not to say that every woman's a blushing maiden barefoot in the kitchen... actually even in the first book there are examples of intelligent women, and proactive problemsolvers etc. Probably very progressive at the time. However, progressive for 1980 is still a bit behind these days. That said, Xanth is totally worth the read--just bear in mind that there's some "older dust' to brush off. :)

** I don't really have a favorite crossover, most thing can be done well much fewer /are/ done well.

I follow more HPxGoT than anything, but that is because there are more of them written. linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is my favorite, but that's because it is incredibly well written, not because its LotR. Dresden crossovers have a lot of potential, but I hate them as a meld.

The fic I can't write but would love to read is a Harry Potter / X-Men crossover melding the two worlds. At some point in the past, around the time the Statute of Secrecy, some wizards attempted to turn muggles into wizards; Thus creating mutants. The pureblood cause would be anti mutant as well as anti muggle. With squibs being born as mutants and tainting families. I have the idea that Voldemort, and Harry, will be mutants that can also use magic which is thought impossible. Voldemort would possess an ability that isn't obvious and people wouldn't know about it. Dumbledore will because Tom would've told him in his excitement when he was 11.

I'm rambling, but the fic would be largely AU for both X-Men and HP with strong influence from them. Harry fights Voldemort, gets involved with the mutant cause in the muggle world. Could be a lot of fun.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I feel HP/LOTR works best. Sauron's Ring was pretty much another implementation of Horcrux, there was powerful magic in LOTR universe, and the line between good and evil was clear cut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][Steelbadger]] writes beautiful HP/LOTR crossovers, such as *The Power He Knows Not* and *The Shadow of Angmar*, linkffn(11027086;11115934). Unfortunately, his stories only have Harry going to there alone.

I much prefer multiple HP characters going to other universes, because if it was just Harry alone, the other universe basically assimilates Harry, and stories become Harry Potter in Another World. *Forging A King*, linkffn(8250381), is not bad, but introduces an AU element in LOTR universe that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. *Failsafe*, linkffn(11281891), is very nice, but seems to be abandoned. So, I'm still waiting for my first perfect HP/LOTR crossover.

** So full disclaimer I feel like you're talking about universe travel AU where Harry and co randomly appear in some other story, but I personally don't like those because they bore me and tend to be too meta.

Ever since I saw [[http://imgur.com/milJS4G.jpg][this]] piece of fanart ([[http://shorelle.deviantart.com/art/harry-potter-and-the-attack-on-titan-397830915][source]]) I have been interested in a Shingeki no Kyojin x Harry Potter crossover. The main trios aren't too alike, but I still think it would be awesome. However, I have never looked for one because it would basically be impossible to be done properly and in the way I would like (no universe travel), for many reasons.

- SnK isn't over and we are only just finding out about the world.

- The characters of SnK and the world are so deeply intertwined that the story would end up completely different and the new characters wouldn't make much sense.

- The magic of their two worlds are too different to merge together.

- I get the sense that Eren and the main characters are like, literally the only people who have interesting lives. Whereas the same problem doesn't arise if you were putting characters into Hogwarts/the magical world in general. Anything can happen at Hogwarts and it always feels like something interesting is going on behind the scenes. That's why I generally tend to like stories more that are X to HP rather than HP to X.

As a plot, I feel like Harry being Eren and James being a more sympathetic and less fucked up Grisha would work well. Draco would definitely fit the role and upbringing of Reiner. I definitely think the world of SnK is much sadder than HP, so it would be cool to see a lighthearted spin on it somehow.

Then Keira Marcos has [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/the-alpha-chronicles/][the Alpha chronicles]], which despite being listed as a series is all standalone stories - it's possible a later part might bring them all together, but for now they can be read completely independently.

  Ellie Potter's introduction to the magical world is a little more complicated than intended. No one, not even Dumbledore, expected the Girl-Who-Lived to Awaken as a sentinel. Which just goes to show you how little wizards understand Sentinels -- nothing like being thrust into a new world, filled with dangers and enemies to Awaken a sentinel's instincts.Goblins have little use for wizards, but sentinels and guides are another matter entirely. Sentinels are warriors; ruthless, fierce, and without mercy on the battlefield. The kind of being a Goblin can respect. So when the Girl-Who-Lived comes into the bank, Awakening...well. There's little they could do to aid an underaged witch without a magical guardian. A Sentinel? Anyone who tries to interfere in affairs between Sentinels and Guides and the Horde courts war.Ellie leaves Gringotts with far more than she might have. The goblins send send her off, already plotting. Change is coming. A storm is building. There will be profit and battle in the coming days.

A story where doctor doom is harry's blood relative and he raises him. He and franklin would be bffs and constantly yelling at their families to stop fighting because it interrupts their playdates.

Harry's chosen as the villain in rolling bomber. Harry and hermione are pulled into the world of the black crystal. They're gone for a year for our side but a decade plus there and have two children. When they're returned, they magically deage and are preteens with a toddler and a newborn.

Harry potter is the number one anchor in the wizarding world. When Hermione granger is brought back to run his newsroom sparks, chairs, and entire sets fly as anger spills over as they attempt to work together.

Alice in wonderland/hp crossover. Hermione falls into the mirror of erised. Harry has to go in and find her. She solves all the problems on her own and he just has to get her home. "This is why i'm marrying you, you are capable!"

Dumbledore is visited by the spirits of christmas past, present, and future.

** HP Crossovers are a mixed bag for me. Sometimes they are great, and sometimes terrible, even within the same universe. Most of the worst HP crossovers I have read seem to involve the superhero worlds, although I have also not come across any HP and GoT or LoTR or similar style ones I have enjoyed either.

The best ones that I have enjoyed have seemed to be exclusively Star Wars crossovers, perhaps because its easy to look at something like "the force" and compare it to magic, or maybe because it being a world beyond earth out in space allows it to flow better together.

As for crossovers I would like to see more of, I can really only think of 1 main one that I have not read. HP/Twilight. Now I may get some flack for Twilight, but I always thought it would be an intriguing crossover since Vampires are a known entity in the HP world, and the ages could be made to be similar between the lead players in each story. While Twilight is not exactly award wining writing, the WORLD behind it combined with the HP world intrigues me, as does the possible pairing combinations between the HP characters and the Cullens.

The only other possible crossover I had considered that I had not read yet was a HP / Shannara chronicles one.

Oh and something for "fun".... how about a HP / Zombie Apocalypse survival story?

A zombie apocalypse would be interesting. The possibilities are endless. Can wizards get infected or does their magic protect them? Are zombies deterred by notice me not charms or not? Is this all an accident because Voldemort lost control of his inferi? And so on.

** Hogwarts, her surroundings land (farms, forbidden forest), residents (teachers, students, animals from forest, elf etc) transport to empty peninsula (or some land) of somewhere Westeros.

Headmistress McGonagall is nothing if not defensive of Hogwarts, and send people (read adults) to spy on world outside, and prepare to inevitability.

(Every year they find new children on their doorstep and news is world is somehow being destroyed. Hogwarts's disappearing act is magic saving their children- or find another cause, author's choice)

They do small business of cloth, colored glasses etc to outside world (7 kingdom), but stay discreet.

Few years later little by little people find about Hogwarts's people (give some awesome name), and story begins.

Game of Thrones/Harry Potter crossover, BAMF!McGonagall, Lady of House Hogwarts. Sneaky use of magic. Discreet magic people.

This plotbunny was eating me alive. Someone please make it happen.

** It's literally just fanservice, the ideas are interesting but the execution tends to be poor. There are a couple that are good/entertaining, but none that I'd name as my favorite of all time.

I liked one Fate crossover, Crosswinds of Fate linkffn(9340220) , which is basically the reverse: bog-standard Zelretch setup, characters from the Fate/stay night franchise stick around in the HPVerse with plans to leave after a couple years.

  "You should think of this as an opportunity to learn about a completely different method of applied thaumaturgy," Zelretch explained. He then sighed and lamented, "For shame, to be cursed with such an ungrateful apprentice..."

** I dislike most Crossovers, because they confuse Witches and Wizards with super-heroes (So everything DC or Marvel is right out). I've enjoyed a few Star Wars crossovers, because there's some thematical overlap.

The Firefly crossover by nonjon is also pretty great as far as crossovers go.

As far as potential goes: IMHO crossovers are literally the oposite of potential. They are popcorn entertainment and throw for the most part caricatures of known characters in other universes. There's usually no room for anything too in depth, and so no real potential.
