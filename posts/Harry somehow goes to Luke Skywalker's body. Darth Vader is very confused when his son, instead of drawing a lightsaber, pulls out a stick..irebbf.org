** Harry points his want at Vader's forehead and casts an engorgio spell.

That's how Dark Helmet from Spaceballs came to life.

** Harry got up with a wince and a throbbing head, which is strange since he didn't remember hitting his head on anything at all or laying anywhere. But gods above and bellow, his head was killing him, which is in no way helped by the fact that he seems to be the target of a strange dark metal thingy very noisy audio message, at least the room was dark, thanks Merlin for small mercies.

/'Hn, must be one of those muggle makinies that Dudley always went on about when we were kids, a... Fellyphony! Yes, it must be it! Man, those things sure got bigger'/ mused Harry while rubbing his temples with one hand and carelessly bringing the other up to silence the damn thing. It didn't even talk in a language he understands for Merlin's sake -though admittedly, beyond English and a bit of French he mostly only knew dead languages, but that's life as a curse-breaker for you.

However when he was sending magic to his hand to prepare the spell he saw something smocking. “Huh?” He said intelligently while the prosthetic hand he hadn't noticed sparked and then exploded. He absentmindedly cast wandlessly a spell that made his body impervious to either the heat or kinetic energy of the blast (his capacity of doing so coming more from hard earned experience rather than outstanding skill at magic) while trying to understand what was going on through his headache. At least the odd felyphony thing had stopped talking for the moment -not that it made much difference with the ‘snore hit by an overpowered amplifying charm' noise it seems to make even in it's repouse settings.

Harry looked to the stump in the place of his hand slightly annoyed, this is the third time this week that he leaves his hand someplace and forgets about it, and this time he doesn't even remember /why/ he felt the need to cut it to know if he should start looking for it or just declare it a lost cause and have a healer regenerate a new one for him -on one side it takes three hours to grow another instead of the 5 seconds it takes to reattach the damn thing and he doesn't feel any curse remains on the stump, so it is possible that it is still useable, on the other though it's nails were starting to get a bit big and he just plainly was feeling too lazy to bother looking for it.

Mentally shrugging and deciding to decide another time he silently summoned a random piece of metal laying around -which caused the whole room to start making an annoying beeping sound with a somewhat warm red light turning on and a guy who appeared to be Umbridge's long-lost grandfather/brother to start shouting angrily and somewhat panicking, but who cares about it- and, concentrating in fueling his magic through the metal, he worked to saturate it and make it's shape change to the familiar one of a hand. Managing it he nodded to himself in satisfaction, admittedly, it is much below the quality of an actual hand, but it will suffice for the moment.

Having finished acquiring himself a new hand he looked up again, the strange Fellyphony thingie was again shouting some message in an strange language while the small dark robbed being -who he suspects of being at the same time Umbridge's brother, grandfather and probably also boyfriend- was shouting abuse in some dozens of languages while (with an insulting lack of skill) attempting to breach his mental defenses in some parody of legilimency. Then the little being seemingly lost it's remaining cool and sent some weak lightning at him. Harry, deciding to exercise caution and not finding his wand or the holster it was supposed to be in, dodged the attack while -with a bolt of /‘accidental'/ magic- blowing the ugly maybe-person in reminiscence of what he did to Marge after his second year.

Seeing his maybe-owner floating to the ceiling the Makynie advanced on Harry while holding a tube of red light. Harry for his part accioed the tube to him while absentmindedly sticking the giant Fellyphony to the floor with a spell.

Checking the tube while ignoring the screaming (probably profanities) coming from the two other occupants of the glowing red and beeping room Harry decided to take it with him /'it will make a nice birthday gift for Teddy'/ he mused /'maybe it will stop him from sulking about still having to wait a year for his Hogwarts' letter'/ he thought with some hope.

Nodding to himself in confirmation of the idea Harry Potter (currently in the body of Luke Skywalker though he didn't notice) apparated away to his home on Earth leaving behind Lords Darth Vader (who he thought was a telephone) and Darth Insidious (who he thought was at the same time Umbridge's brother, grandfather and boyfriend) to scream in a mix of anger and alarm as the ship continued to transmit a message of error at the circuit failure caused by having a piece of it's control painel clumsy summoned with magic until the whole thing exploded.

When Harry got back home his new visual did raise some eyebrows, but since such a change was not that unusual in the wizarding world and as Harry grew the habit of avoiding mirrors after one too many insults on his hair it took him close to two months to even notice that there was anything different at all. When he /did/ notice he simply shrugged unconcerned and changed his appearance back before continuing his life without thinking much about it. At the galaxy at large Luke Skywalker was regarded as the hero who gave his life to put an end to the empire and the whole Jedi/Sith legacy died with him.
