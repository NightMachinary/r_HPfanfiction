Happy New Year Everyone!

So in part because I've been out of the scene for a while, but also because I'm genuinely curious, post the fics that you think are the best of the year. To be as inclusive as possible, put down any fic that was either started, updated, or completed in 2020 (in other words, the fics can have started before 2020, but had to have some activity in 2020). If you're not going to give a direct link, list the author in addition to the title of the work.

Thanks in advance! :)


** My favorite of the year: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13566959/1/If-not-for-Umbridge]]

Harry/Daphne if you are into that sort of thing. I like the cascade effect the major change has. Want for a nail done well.

What Souls Are Made Of by Emeralds_and_Lillies

Started last year but has been updating regularly all year. Love it. It's a time travel Tomarry with Ron and Hermione. Great characterisation. It was a tough choice because I've read a lot of great fics this year but this one made it into my #1 spot.

Looking forward to another year of reading way too much fanfiction.

** Little Glass Houses

Summary: Post DH. 15-year-old Percy was in an emotionally abusive relationship with girlfriend, Penelope. 24-year-old Percy is in an emotionally, physically and sexually abusive relationship with fiancée, Penelope, but doesn't know how to escape. Everyone is oblivious. His mother is the one that pressured him to marry her! Is there any way out? TW. Dark

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13682652/1/Little-Glass-Houses]]

This is SO good. it's so descriptive and the writer does a super good job of writing out what every character is feeling. I also love the fact that the author wrote about a male abuse victim because a lot of times it's usually the girl that's the victim

Edit: I fixed the title now lol

** Steelbadgers two DC crossovers, Kicking Gotham linkffn(13521865) and its sequel Toppling Heroes (just finished today!) linkffn(13694861), both came out this past year, and are amazing. They've both shot up to the top of my favorite crossovers list, and I can't wait for the mentioned third story to begin. Very good depictions of Auror Harry working a case that intersects with the DC world.

Then there is The Removal of Masks linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24335107/chapters/58675660]]), which starts off with an initiation ceremony for Gryffindor!Riddle's death eaters (it's part 7 of a larger series, but imo it can stand alone).

This is a marauder story from 5th year onwards. First book completed this year. It's brilliant! Lily has a lot more initiative and stakes in the war than I'm used to seeing. I have a feeling she might end up dragging james into it. The Prank and the aftermath were horrifying. Just really really good writing

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part IX - The Serpent in the Grass by Flamethrower)

And once again I'm hyping OaCL because I love it! Part VII finished this year and Part IX started and holy shit am I loving IX. We follow Saul all through WW2 and he meets the Potters and sets up the Underground and it's just brilliant and I love it so so much!!!

  It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world...but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth.Lily Evans wants a fresh start.James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him.Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story.Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon.Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered. The Howling Nights is the first book of The Last Enemy series, which follows the lives of the heroes and villains of the First Wizarding War from 1975-1981. Watch the trailer! (New chapters posted on Mondays and Thursdays)

The Secret War

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

At the same time, Hermione hatches a plan to get close to Draco and learn of Voldemort's plans to help the Order.

** I've been really liking this one, Death is Buffy's Next Adventure where Buffy after dieing wakes up in London the same age as Tom Riddle the summer before his 6th year. I normally avoid fics that seen like they will have prominent pairings, which this fic seems like it might from the premise, though it doesn't list romance as a genre so maybe not, but the interactions between Buffy and Tom are pretty funny so far more than anything.

Also pretty clearly a 2019 fic, but I just want to mention that Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting got to the post third floor corridor hospital scene in a chapter this year and it had one of my favorite depictions of Dumbledore I've seen in some time. It does a good job explaining a lot of the weird stuff from the first book and has Dumbledore actually be really helpful towards Harry regarding the Dursleys.

Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos is a wrong boy who lived story. Harry goes to Slytherin. He's a bit more damaged and has an edge to him but it steers clear of the angst for the most part which I liked. I give it a 9/10.

Serpentine Advice - Slytherin takes Harry under his wing and teaches him how to think. As you might expect, it brings out a more ambitious and clever Harry. I quite enjoyed the character interactions although I'm not sure the philosophy mixed in always works. I'd give this one a 7/10.

***** I read the first ten chapters and it did not seem like it was going in that direction.

I stopped reading there though, since the main focus of the fic, despite him not even really appearing till the last chapter I read, seemed to be how misguided Dumbledore was and setting him up as a strawman for indy!Harry to overcome which isn't to my taste.

Like if you made a bechdel test but had a conversation fail it if it talked about Dumbledore instead of about men, then most of the conversations in the fic up to the point I read would fail it. If the fic had just not portrayed Dumbledore in the best light, but also not really focused on him them I probably would have kept reading as the premise is quite interesting.

  Expelled from Charmbridge Academy, wandless, and fated to die, Alexandra Quick is still bringing trouble wherever she goes. Before she's done, her Solemn Quest will shake the Ozarks, her feud with old rivals and new enemies will shake New Amsterdam, and discovering the World Away will shake the Confederation.
