From what I remember, Wizard in Harry Potter are supposed to live longer than Muggle (with an "average" around 110 or 120 years old). Yet, we do not see this difference in the books.

With some rare exceptions such as the Dumbledore's siblings, Bathilda Bagshot or Grindelwald, or most wizard seem to age, and die like Muggle. For exemple :\\
- The Potters parents died in the 70's at aroung 80.

-Malfoy grandfather was around the same age than Voldemort and die before Harry 6th year. Most of the 1st generation Death Eaters also seem to not have reached the 2nd War (even if I like the Fanon than Theodore Nott father is one of them).

-The whole Black Family.

And even for other family we never hear about the grandparents (like where are Arthur and Molly Weasley parents).

​

Finally, the strangest thing seem to be Amors Diggory in the Cursed Child (for those who consider this thing canon). The man should not be a lot older than Arthur Weasley and so be in his 60's or 70's, yet the man is already stuck in a wheelchair and lives in a retirement home. Is he a special case or most wizard spend 40 or 50 years in those.

​

So yeah I wonder where are all the old people in Harry Potter.


** Wars tend to kill off large portions of generations, and if 60/70 year olds are still "middle aged" then they would be fighting.

** I like the theory in linkffn(wind shear by chilord) where a lot of the old - Grindelwald War era - warhorses had been quietly assassinated before they could band together and kick the Death Eaters' hoops in. And wizarding age could easily be a function of their magic, slower or faster depending on an assortment of factors such as emotional and mental health. So a man hit by tragedy like Amos Diggory could well be more infirm than a muggle of the same age (I know one 72-year-old personally who's still working full time and does carpentry as a weekend hobby). While a self-confident old battleaxe whose scholarship grants her great magical power like Griselda Marchbanks is near the end of her second century and still going strong.

The result is a mean lifespan that's a lot higher than the modal average age at death, because the likes of Bagshot, Marchbanks, Dippet and Dumbledore are making the statistics look very strange compared with the muggle distribution.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

#+begin_quote
  As a writer, it was more interesting, plot-wise, if Harry was completely alone. So I rather ruthlessly disposed of his entire family apart from Aunt Petunia. James's parents were elderly, were getting on a little when he was born... They were old in wizarding terms, and they died. They succumbed to a wizarding illness... I just needed them out of the way *so I killed them.*
#+end_quote

In Cursed Child, Petunia is dead by ~2020 and Harry gets his baby blanket back. Considering that Lily was born in 1960, Petunia must have died in her very early 60's, which is crazy since Britain has socialized public healthcare, and the Dursleys are middle class enough to afford modern medicine.

Ultimately, there's no big, overarching reason explaining why these people died so young except for author fiat. If you look at the Black Family Tree and notice how so many people died in their fifties, you'd also see how Cygnus Black had a Bellatrix at age 13.

JKR is bad at numbers and dates.

*** Eh, people die in their early 60s all the time, no matter how good healthcare is. Heart attacks, cancer, aneurysms, getting hit by a bus.

But yes broadly I agree that Rowling isn't great at maths/timelines (which I sympathise with, it's my biggest flaw too).

** I have a headcanon that as well as the war killing off various people, there was a dragon pox epidemic in the late 70s. That would effect the very young and very old so would account for the small class sizes as well as the general lack of grandparents.

I've not read the novel version nor seen the stage play, so I'm unsure when within the narrative that happens, but maybe it's because he just gives up on life after Cedric gets murdered?

Ok, so this may come off rude but honestly? What do you think happens when there is a world war (with wizarding involvement), led by a dark lord, followed by a 2nd dark lord who liked to murder people and also get his own followers killed.

There WERE old people in Harry Potter. We see some but also hear about ones in the Wizamgamot. But the amount is less than it would be due to the violence of the recent past.

Throw in the fact that there was a "plague" of sorts (or at least a wizarding illness according to JKR) around the same time (perhaps Dragon Pox), and suddenly there are even less old people.

I feel like it should be BLATENTLY obvious to anyone "where all the old people are". They are mostly dead.

This doesnt change the fact that Wizards and Witches can live to be much older. We already see this through the few examples still left, and the power they have even at their advanced ages.

*Edit: Also let me address your points individually:*

#+begin_quote

  - The Potters parents died in the 70's at aroung 80.
#+end_quote

They died of Dragon Pox. Had they not contracted it, they may have been killed by Voldemort. Either way.. it was not a natural death so this is an invalid point.

#+begin_quote
  -Malfoy grandfather was around the same age than Voldemort and die before Harry 6th year. Most of the 1st generation Death Eaters also seem to not have reached the 2nd War (even if I like the Fanon than Theodore Nott father is one of them).
#+end_quote

Source? We never know Abraxas birth date. Also, being a death eater is naturally a dangerous occupation (if you want to call it that). Again, the deaths are, in large part, NOT FROM NATURAL CAUSES.

#+begin_quote
  -The whole Black Family.
#+end_quote

Again, most of the Black Family deaths are NOT NATURAL.

#+begin_quote
  Arthur and Molly Weasley parents
#+end_quote

It was always implied that the Prewett family was basically wiped out (apart from Molly and her Brothers) in the "great war", and then her brothers died in the first "war" against Voldemort. As for Arthur, remember his mother was a Black, and the family was considered blood traitors. Its highly likely they were killed fairly early on by Voldemort. Also, remember Aunt Muriel. We don't know if she was related to Molly or Arther (folks lean Molly), but we do know that she was born around 1880 which would put her at least at 100 years of age by the time Harry comes around. And she was still allowing her house to be used as a safe house towards the end of the 2nd Voldemort War, so she was still alive and kicking and helping in the war effort.

None of your points seem to apply. Of course, folks won't reach old age if they are murdered, or die from a disease. That's true in real life too.

** You use the cursed child as an example? Why not mix all kinds of fanon while you're at it?

Regarding actual canon we don't know shit, we know the ages and appearances of some characters and how the movies messed most of them up, but we certainly don't know enough to talk about the ages of the wizarding population. There may be thousands older than Dumbledore still alive or they may have been all killed during the wars, either magical or muggle. We simply don't know because JKR did a shitty job building her world.

** Well I think it is pretty obvious. First there was a war against Grindelwald. and it's a World War. People die in something like that. Then there was a "war" against Voldemort. People died there too, also Voldemort was a menace in wiping out families. And then there are still illnesses about that kill people. Dragon Pox?

And lastly. The setting is mostly in a school. Apart from some teachers old people aren't often seen in schools.

** You have to take PoV into account too. Harry is young and at school most of the time. His family has been killed off for the plot purposes, so he has no occasion to see many adults/old people. Beside the teachers and OotP members.

** My headcanon says that it's because once you reach a certain age you begin to lose control of your mind and your magic, and you become a threat to everyone around you. The DoM has a retirement foundation set up that takes people away once they start to show signs of themselves losing it. It's protected by a magical oath or six that are conveniently not mentioned in canon.
