Years ago I read a fic about a grey Hermione it was a one shot she discovered her magic after a squirrel? ran in front of her parents car. She got sorted into Slytherin but didn't make any friends just focused on her work eventually Umbridge tried to crucio her and she developed a shield against it. Does anyone know this fic or any morally grey, apathetic Hermione fics.


** To me, an apathetic Hermione won't really be Hermione anymore. That said...

I don't know any fics that matches your description exactly, but there's a mediocre one-shot linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3615864]]) that matches some elements of the description.

Some decent fics that feature a Grey!Hermione:

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU in which Hogwarts is a school for superspies; everybody is pretty ruthless, though.
- /Dangerous/ by Black Lotus takes place a decade or so after canon and has Hermione leading a terrorist organisation against a backsliding Ministry. It went down with the original Granger Enchanted site, but there are copies of it floating around.
- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels have Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang (It's a long story.) with many of the attendant consequences.
- linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai), ruthless!Hermione.
- linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar by BolshevikMuppet99), Harry and Hermione go on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge after Ron is killed.
- linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) has Hermione leading a paramilitary group.
- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still the best Slytherin!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) takes a bit too much fanon onboard, and I feel that prophecies about Hermione undermine her ethos, but it's still worth reading.
- linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady): a fun read.
- linkffn(Purple Like Violets by Flye Autumne), an up-and-coming fic, though I don't know how much Hermione will be left by the end.
- linkffn(Requiem by Flye Autumne), a heavy AU.
- linkffn(Agent Double O Hex by KafkaExMachina): Harry is raised by James Bond; Hermione by recurring Bond villains. (A few episodes up.)
- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution by Starfox5): Harry and Hermione go a bit Veil-crazy in their efforts to reform the wizarding Britain.
- linkffn(Spectrum by Consume): Hermione goes back in time to stop Riddle and, for once, doesn't get sidetracked. The problem is that she doesn't stop there.

  Change one aspect of Hermione Granger's character: instead of blindly accepting authority prior to Hogwarts, she questions everything. How could knowledge for knowledge's sake be wrong?

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)Year 1: Ron Weasley is not as alone as you might expect.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
