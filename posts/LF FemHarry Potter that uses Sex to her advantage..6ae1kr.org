Basically I want Fem!Harry Potter that uses Sex to her advantage. For example she wants something and she has a few choices. Steal, buy, sex4item. Basically I want a fic in which she acknowledge that there is the third option to get something(sex4...), and she uses said option. Thanks


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11602420/1/][Call Me Moriarty]], linkffn(11602420): She set up a whorehouse using her alter ego James Moriarty. Apparently, polyjuiced Girl-Who-Lived was in high demand, so she just gave her own hairs for that purpose.

*** Sorry, I very much dislike Harry x Hermione pairing. To be completely honest I dislike Hermione as a character. However if the fic is really worth reading, tell me so, and I'll give it a go.

#+begin_quote
  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.

** linkffn(Princess of the Blacks)

She does this a good bit, was raised in a whorehouse or something and is a dark witch. I honestly only got like a fourth of the way through before I gave up, did not enjoy it. The writing itself was decent, but it was just so preachy and all about the author making her do things trying to shock the audience. It just got boring after a while and her character was insufferable IMO.

***** I agree. Especially with Sirius, it is unbelievable that he does not care. His whole character is completely warped in this story. It was one of the things that bothered me, but I could forgive it, the whole point was that it's an alternate reality. Mainly it was the awkward and heavy handed writing that turned me off, but a bunch of people seemed to like it so I figured it was worth suggesting.

**** No problem though i haven't read it in a while i remember the ghost was godric gryffindor himself, and it leaned more towards humor also i don't believe he got all that more powerful at least not quickly, but i do remember it being very comedic at times. I always say read the first chapter if you don't like it after read no further, if you have some interest keep going.
