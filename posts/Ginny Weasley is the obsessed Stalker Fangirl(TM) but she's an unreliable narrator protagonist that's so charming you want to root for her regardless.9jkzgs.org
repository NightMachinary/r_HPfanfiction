I have no idea if this exists, but I was hoping for something that has a similar tone to Tim Burton's Ed Wood? Where the protagonist despite being this complete hack of a film-maker has this charming sunny optimism about what he does that you want to root for him anyways but occasionally the reality of the situation sneaks in.


** "Seventh Horcrux" from Ginny's POV would work:

- She's little deranged from Diary's influence
- She's obsessed about Harrymort
- She does possess significant powers
- She does not resort to nefarious means to win Harrymort
- She does contribute to Harrymort's cause in a meaningful way
- She won Harrymort in the end

*** I've already read Seventh Horcrux unfortunately. And it's still not quite the idea I'm going for, the main difference being this version of Ginny would use 'nefarious' means (to a point) to win Harry because in her head it would be completely justified and approached with a child-like enthusiasm. Also I'm not particularly phased on whether she succeeds or not, depending on the context I think you could do either as long as the core elements are preserved. Hell she could even have a character arc involving her being less stalkery over-time (even if it's begrudgingly) or even have her double down on the crazy. I'm not super picky on where you take the characterization as long as it's funny.

*** Yeah, it's not exactly what I'm looking for but the premise itself looks like it could be good for a laugh at least, thanks for the recommendation!

Also if you haven't already, watch Ed Wood. Its a damn fine movie in it's own right.

There are many, many fanfiction stories that this already applies to. Well written fanfiction is something that confuses me-- because there's a surprisingly large amount of novel-length fanfiction that's actually good, and the author would be better off just writing their own books since usually they diverged completely from canon anyways.

This especially applies to AUs, where literally the only hint of the characters being who they are are the names and personalities, with maybe some minor references.

Yet, good fanfiction clearly exists, otherwise people wouldn't bother to come to communities like this one, or even read fanfiction in the first place once they get past a certain age and develop standards for quality writing.

I do agree though, this takes the sort of skill that even most authors that are good enough to publish probably don't possess. It's really, really hard to write a character like that as likable yet still follow the obsessed stalker route.

**** Yeah, to be fair, I have gotten a little over excited because I don't even think this type of character is commonly well-written in fiction in general, never mind just fan-fiction. The only other example I can think of is from James Gunn's Super, a movie about a guy who has a seizure induced vision from God featuring a hentai tentacle monster performing brain surgery on him (It's sounds less insane in context) and decides to become a 'Super-hero' and he meets this girl who seems to have some form of Borderline Personality Disorder who becomes his side-kick and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwNn-3Esb8][she revels in violence with a child-like glee]].

Yes, this is a real movie. It's fucking awesome.

** Wouldn't work, it would just come across as creepy and disturbing. It would be obvious quickly that she's an obsessive stalker and not charming at all.

The comparison to Ed Wood I don't understand at all, he was charming and passionate about film, it's not like he was just pretending. His products just didn't turn out to be very good

*** Well, firstly the thing I'm imagining is more being played for laughs and isn't supposed to be serious. The reason I bring up the Ed Wood comparison (Specifically the movie) is more along the lines of writing a character that is perfectly sincere in her love (as I can even imagine a literal stalker being) but taking that to a comedic extreme due to lack of self-awareness and being a bit mad, but as in the movie Ed Wood, occasionally you get peaks at the darker reality.

I was kind of thinking of the ending of Ed Wood where they're all watching Plan 9 in the theatre and he's like "THIS IS THE MOVIE I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR" and he proposes to his lady friend and drive away in the rain and then the title card pops up with "HE DIED ALONE AND AS A PENNILESS ALCOHOLIC". Hence the unreliable narrator bit. The story would be told from her perspective of complete lack of self-aware sincerity and because you're in her head you get the rosy view of everything that's happening because despite her pathological behavior she approaches it with a sunny optimism.

This is a retrospective review on Ed Wood that actually kind of lays out the type of story I'm imagining in my head but rather than Film Maker Hack Ed Wood tries to make it in Hollywood (And kind of does after his death for none of the reasons he was hoping for) you have Obsessive Stalker Ginny who tries to woo Harry Potter (And kind of does but for none of the reasons she's imagining in her head)
