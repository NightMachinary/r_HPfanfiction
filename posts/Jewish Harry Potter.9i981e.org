Just curious if it exists: a fic where Harry is raised Jewish? Or any other religion not Christian/Catholic? Thanks!


** I've not come across one, but if you haven't read it you would probably enjoy [[https://fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][Goldstein]] linkffn(Goldstein).

If you're looking for accuracy, it is clearly not written from a British perspective and the occasional Christian students Yehuda interacts with don't seem to consistently belong to any real Christianity (they each seem to represent weird mishmashes of different denominations), but I think of you take that as being from his POV with his suspicion and lack of knowledge of Christians, it makes sense.

But if you want an exploration of what it would mean to try to remain an observant Jew at Hogwarts, and something of what it means to try not to lose your culture and sense of self while spending most of the year at a boarding school for a more dominant culture, this is the fic for you.

  What's a nice Jewish boy like Anthony doing at Hogwarts? Well, for starters, his name isn't really Anthony. Winner of the Fanfiction Booker's Prize 2014. Year One complete.
