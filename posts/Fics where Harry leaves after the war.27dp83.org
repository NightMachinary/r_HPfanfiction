I have had an idea for this kind of story but really want to read the others that are out there first to insure that mine isn't just following the tropes of the genre and such.

*** I guess I did leave that slightly open ended. I was more thinking along the lines of him leaving maybe experiencing a new world but eventually returning for whatever reason. With the story mostly referencing canon, to be more specific.

Also him leaving and then the story focusing on wizarding britain without him sounds interesting so if you more of those it wold be appreciative.
