Came across [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/5917.html#comments][these]] [[https://pstibbons.livejournal.com/7444.html#comments][posts]] on LiveJournal and seriously thought I was reading an insane person's ramblings. I mean, no one seriously thinks like this, right?


** It's tragic, that's what it is.

Hermione in that fic is knowledgeable, powerful, and confident, and that's a good thing. But, look at how petty and small the author makes her.

All that power used to what end? To torture and rape (and yes, that is the correct word to use here) a teenage boy for the crime of throwing a jealous temper tantrum. All that knowledge? Used to come up with a way to use the law to avoid the full consequences of her gratuitous brutality.

Writers like pstibbons bash Hermione worse than most Hermione-haters.

*** I am not going to read the fic but I am curious about a few things.

Who did she kill and rape and why? What duel were they talking about in which she used illegal means to win and why did it even take place? Why did Dumbledore expel her? No need to avoid spoilers since I will never read it.

**** She raped Ron with magic (and his own phallus) because he called her a slut, apparently. Major overreaction. If she slapped him, spread rumours about him or pranked him I could get on board, but the 'duel' was cruel and unusual punishment.

**** I skimmed it because I didn't /want/ to read the details and want to forget what I /did/ read, but I think she used some "Witchcraft" (as opposed to "Wizardcraft"---because only witches can practice the former) to grow his penis like a tentacle, which she then used to penetrate his mouth. She may have hurt him in other ways as well.

It was technically not illegal because it was some pureblood law duel or some such, but Dumbledore expelled her for this brutality. There was some whining by Hermione about how The Law made it easier to expel a muggleborn than a pureblood, or some such. But then, Madame Maxine admitted her to Beauxbatons on the spot, so there were no real consequences.

I think she ended up leading some kind of a righteous magical creature revolution, and then Harry stabbed her in the back and killed her.

*** For real. This isn't regular Hermione stanning. This is the advanced-tier stuff.

**** You merely adopted the Hermione stanning; pstibbons was born into it, molded by it.
