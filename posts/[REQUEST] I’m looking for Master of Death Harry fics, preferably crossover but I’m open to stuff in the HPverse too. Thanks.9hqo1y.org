As a above, I love MoD!Harry fics right now and I prefer it as a crossover, but am not opposed to stuff in the HPverse. On that note, it doesn't matter what it's crossed over with.

I don't care if it's Fem Harry, reborn / reincarnation, BAMF Harry, or what have you - I just want it to be completed or recently updated.

And it doesn't matter what website it's on either.

Thank you all so much! ðŸ˜Š


** Lots of master of death fics, though many of them are mixed quality. I'll give you some of my favorites:

- linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar): probably my favorite, a crossover with Harry Potter and the Tolkeinverse where Harry is in Arda 1000 years before the main trilogy.
- linkffn(
- linkffn(Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is): a repeat reincarnation time-traveler Harry who is reborn as the older brother of Sirius and Regulus. One of the most Gary Stu Harry's out there, though in the context I can certainly understand how that came about.
- linkffn(Hallows and Pathos): this one is short and grim, but one of the most unique takes on the Hallows I have come across. And one of the only fics that takes the trio's characteristics to their ultimate conclusions.
- linkffn(On a Pale Horse): absolute crack, Harry became Death in another dimension and is summoned by Dumbledore. Though incomplete, the author periodically updates, and what is there is absolutely hilarious. The Gringotts part is sort of a gem too.
- linkffn(The Difference One Man Can Make): possibly the best HP/ASOFAI fic out there, though sadly incomplete and possibly abandoned. There are several other interesting Game of Throne Master of Death crossovers as well that you should look into (ex. linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal; The Black Prince)
- linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus): a fem!Harry fic that is part crack, but with a substantial amount of content (and a spinoff). Not my personal favorite, but many people like it.

*** I second The Shadow of Angmar, it's amazing! I'm looking forward to how Steelbadger deals with the fact that a true Harry Potter style wizard would be ridiculously overpowered in Middle Earth now that he has his OP worm wand. I also love how he weaves the Silmarillion lore into the story.

I need to read The Difference One Man Can Make though. I read his other ASOIAF last week and I've been looking for time to start it.

**** Give it a few chapters before you decide to drop it because of the writing. The first few have quite poor writing, with lots of tell instead of show and just general early writer mistakes. Past about 3~5 though the writing gets DRASTICALLY better.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** You also have Finding Home by cywsaphyre on Archive of Our Own, a crossover with Avengers. The first part is finished. I think the rest was abandoned, though. It's a great fic and did actually get me to enjoy MoD!Harry so it's still worth a look, imo.

** Linkffn(Death doesn't give chase she waits)

While not complete, it is a series of connected one shots, so completion wouldn't really matter (IMO)
