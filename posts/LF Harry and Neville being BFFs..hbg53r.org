Kind of a silly request but I just really want to read some good fics with Harry and Neville having a good, strong friendship. Fine with anything else in the story. Thanks in advance!

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

***** Ah, okay! I just got my heartbroken reading through a story that turned out to be abandoned (forgot to check) and now I'm just empty inside. I'll probably read it anyway as I'm just suuper bored right now.

Thanks for the tip!

** linkffn(5835213) - I like them being bros in this. They joke around with each other nicely which makes for fun.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

** A second Chance. Great WIP fiction, and Neville and Harry are very close friends from the beginning.

*** Was enjoying it until Sirius starting hounding Castellanos. That kind of behavior grinds on my nerves and is why I can't read pre-marriage James/Lily. Also, Remus blushing because a 13 year old Tonks had a crush on him was...not good. And the whole scene where Harry and Ginny meet on the playground was like I was reading something written by someone that has never seen actual children playing together.

I very much enjoyed Sirius' and Remus' interactions with Harry. It was very sweet. And Sirius' friendship with Minerva made me smile.

Over all, I appreciate the recommendation but its just had too many things that irked me to keep me reading.
