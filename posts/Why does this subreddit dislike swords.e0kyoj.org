I've been searching for a sword wielding Harry Potter fanfic for a while now. Usually i find edgy japanese harry fics but once in a while i've seen a fic where it's used well.

Anyway, I was just wondering why the people on this sub seems to hate sword fighting/martial arts in Harry potter fanfiction? It seems weird since harry uses an actual sword to kill a snake in the books, and keep in mind it's the sword of gryffindor. Wich seems to suggest that Godryc knew how to use a sword and with that i assume Martial arts? It's cannon so i don't get all the fuss about it.

​

Discussion and a rec post! Please link to any swordfighting/martial arts Harry potter fanfiction you want.

**** /Counter/-counterpoint:

- lightsabers work in SW because that's what the SW fans find appealing: swordfight chareography and [[http://theconversation.com/science-fact-vs-fiction-in-star-wars-and-other-sci-fi-movies-relax-and-enjoy-the-entertainment-52977][WWII-era technology featuring against the backdrop of space fantasy props.]] You could modify the HP setting to include whatever you fancied, but you have to consider at what point it would stop feeling as a HP fanfic.[1]

- Wizards aren't jedi. For successfully using a sword like a Jedi they lack the necessary quick reflexes and physical conditioning. And for successfully /failing/ to come victorious against a sword-wielder they'd have to /only/ be using laserbeam-type spells.

Let's look at some possible scenarios:

- Harry's sword can't deflect spellfire --- by the time he reaches his enemies they've spammed him to death with AKs.

  - If he's duel-wielding (wand / sword), then the bulky and heavy sword makes his maneuvering more difficult /and/ requires significant amount of training time to become good at both disciplines. Time that could've been used to improve his magical casting and knowledge instead. And there's still the problem of openly approaching a group of enemies while having to defend against all the spells cast at him.

- Harry's sword can deflect spellfire, but can't pierce magical shields --- he gets close to stab his enemies, they cast a shield and then AK him.

  - To deflect spellfire from multiple opponents he'd also needs some speed and reaction-enhancing rituals. And if he does that, then 1) his enemies could've done the same thing too; 2) these "ritual slots" on his character sheet could've been used for other, better enhancements.[3]

- Harry's sword can deflect spellfire and pierce magical shields but can't OHK --- he gets close to stab his enemies, pierces their shield, and even inflicts a non-lethal wound, but by that point eats an AK at point blank range. The wounded DE then just drinks some potions to recover from the wound.
- Harry's sword can deflect spellfire, pierce magical shields, and inflict cursed or mortal wounds --- by the time he gets close and kills one enemy, the others AK him at near-point bank range.

  - Other problematic reactions from enemies: transfigure the ground into mud, transfigure and animate objects into animated beasts; cast destructive AoE spells near Harry's position; fall back when he gets too close; control magical beasts; enlarge, summon, and banish objects; use potions to alter the battleground.
  - same as above, but Harry also constantly teleports --- his enemies activate an anti-teleportation field and Harry's main technique becomes useless.
  - same as above, but Harry overpowers an entire group's anti-TP field --- by this point the writer has made Harry himself into a superwizard. Harry may've as well just used a wand to spam the enemies with heavy spellfire.

So I guess as a general rule blades /could/ work, but only if they were used as as a backup weapon or one for unexpected close quarter confrontations (e.g. dagger attached to one arm). But again, if you end up in an unexpected deadly melee range fight with a wizard, the first thing you want to do is create some distance as quickly as possible due to the risk of short-range AKs.

--------------

[1] This isn't a criticism by itself. It more depends on the goals and preferences of the writer and their intended audience.

[2] One thing I see speaking in favour of a supersword is the aesthetics. Both would have the same amount of bullshit gifts to MC, but using the supersword would at least be a more interesting challenge.

[3] A sword-focused story like this could maybe work if the writer was good at designing battle scenes. But if the writer's good, then almost anything can be made to work.

** Wands are basically guns that can also manipulate the entire battlefield. Guns made swords obsolete a few centuries ago. As such, other than something entirely contrived (like the Chamber), what scenario would swordplay prove practical weapons when wands exist? You could do something with honor duels or something, but that's about it. And at that point you're in pretty decent AU territory, since nothing remotely like any part of that is in canon.

The world just isn't all that compatible with swords.

*** Swords could be used! Come on, have some creativity!

Swords with enchantments on them similar or different to minecraft (For example, knockback 3 like minecraft) that are a lot more efficient and useful than a wand to knock your enemy on the floor (If you are quicker to draw it than your enemy). If you knock your enemy on the floor while slashing them to bits, it'll be hard for them to get up while all sliced up, or even reach for their wand very well, and aiming with a wand would be impossible.

When you are in a magical dead zone (Not cannon) and need to conserve magical energy for your body.

To surprise others in close combat (A dagger would be better though). You might be in close combat more often than you expect, but use your wand if you are not close)

Some spieces are magically resistant. As a result, all magical explorers, resource gatherers, and magicals visiting dangerous areas should carry specially tailored muggle swords (Yes, muggle. Enchantments won't work) to defeat some animals, such as trolls. A sword can be used to kill a troll in a life or death situation by piercing it through their eye into their brain. If the troll is far away, you can easily trap them, but in close combat fumbling around with your wand is hard. Some big animals run faster than humans, so you would not be able to escape an encounter without a sword. (This one would be useful for an explorer harry fic)

#+end_quote

This doesn't work. It implies getting in a good enough position to stab a troll in the eye is less dangerous and difficult than spamming it with transfigured chains, banished objects, fiendfire, and AKs from a distance. And if you carry a heavy-ass sword with you for the unlikely event of ever encountering a troll, you may have as well just transfigured a sharp metal stick from the nearby objects and used that.

#+begin_quote
  but in close combat fumbling around with your wand is hard

How did a troll manage to sneak up on you? If it did, why isn't your first move to teleport away, cast an AK at it, or banish yourself away or into the ceiling?

Defensive AoE spells would work better than a sword unless the animal can negate magic. If it /can/ negate magic, you'd be better off teleporting away. If it can negate magic and block teleportation / portkeys / brooms, you'd be better off using potions (poison clouds, explosions). If it negates even that, you should've Imperio'd some muggles to fight with a sword instead of you, or at least mind-controlled some other magical animals.

There were maybe 100 defenders, if you are generous. Basically the adult members of the DA, the Order and a few family members and Hogsmeade residents.

In point of fact, that sort of magic actually /was/ used during the final battle: McGonnagal used a spell to animate all of the suits of armor in the castle. Both Dumbledore and Voldemort used large-scale offensive transfiguration and animation in the DoM battle. You could also look to the /Fantastic Beasts/ movies for other examples of wide-area battle magic in canon.

As for why Voldemort didn't do something similarly impressive during the final battle: JKR's plot required that the bad guy be defeated by a teenager with less magical prowess, so it didn't suit her story for the final battle to show Voldemort actually /using/ his superior spell repertoire.

You get all the fun of being cut down at range, with the added fun of people transfiguring your weapon into some (probably not very friendly) animal unless it happens to be made of the super rare magic goblin silver.

Anyone not using a wand is mad, if someone desperately wants some sort of dual wielding thing and double wands isn't a thing then the smart move is a nice shield, it's mostly inferior to just conjuring one, but conjuration is presumably fairly tricky.

The only reason melee weapons were popular at the same time as even bows or crossbows is that shields and armour actually could protect you from those.

**** Who mentioned guns? Melee weapons are obsolete against rapid ranged attacks, i.e. spells.

If we /were/ talking about guns, then melee attacks would sometimes have an advantage when forced to engage in close quarters combat (for example, when clearing a building where attackers could get into grapple distance easily by using the element of surprise). However, spells in the Harry Potter universe are varied and versatile enough that even in close-quarters combat the offensive and defensive solutions a wand provides are more effective than a melee weapon.

** This sub dislikes it because it's often done badly. (TBF, damn near everything is often done badly.)

In order to add swords to the setting, you need to make them at least as useful as wands, which is a tall order. Not impossible (Star Wars pulled it off), but swords' inherent awesomeness won't do it alone.

** I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Third Key, it's got some swords in:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5269970/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Key-Reloaded]]

Written before the fifth book came out and somewhat more recently re-edited (hence the “Reloaded” appendation) it's a very weird but fun romp.

**** Yea, thats very true. I have made that connection too. Those of us that were reading HP fanfiction in the early 2000s hold those authors that practically created these tropes in much higher regard than the newer readers. After all, what is considered a trope now, has once been a totally new and never heard of idea for a story.

And it is understandable, but I have heard nothing but praise whenever I got a newer reader into Jeconais, nonjon, Ruskbyte and similar old authors. So despite the "tropes", newer readers are enjoying them.

And as to the different website, well that was created when ffnet made one too many moves against the freedom of the authors. Jeconais created fanficauthors and many other big names followed him, some even removing their fics from everywhere else. But yea, it is of course a small complication having to use a different website from normal.

** It is quite difficult to justify melee weapon use once ranged weapons become common. This is a fact universally grappled with by fantasy and scifi writers, not just by HP fanfic writers.

For example, in Star Wars, the Jedi use the Force to be able to deflect blaster shots by giving them superhuman reflexes and mild precognition so they know where the bolts are going to go.

I think that could work in the Potterverse, and it's partly the direction I'm planning to go with my fic. Spells travel slower than blaster bolts, but even dodging arrows is difficult, so enchantments that speed oneself up makes sense even if you're just wanting to dodge instead of counter. There are tons of tactical enchantments you can cast on yourself to optimize your strategic options during combat, but you also have to weigh them against time spent actually attacking (like in a MtG game, honestly).

Countering or shielding against a spell occupies casting time that could be spent casting an offensive spell and gaining tempo against your opponent. Also, spells are constantly being developed which close up the loopholes common counterspells exploit, meaning you might not know the proper counterspell for a particular opponent's favored attack.

A sword, on the other hand, can be enchanted to be able to resist magic and deflect (or disperse by cutting) incoming spells. So if you have a sword in one hand and a wand in the other you would be able to defend yourself with the sword, freeing up your casting for offensive or further tactical spells. We already know that physical objects can impede spells (even the Unforgivables, as mentioned by others in this thread), so you just need to make sure your sword is resilient enough to survive the interposition.

Of course, training in fencing is required to take advantage of this strategy. So not everyone will be toting swords. But enough will to make it something you expect to encounter.

If you're using your sword purely defensively, and if you can enchant it to do all these things, then why not use an enchanted shield instead?

**** Depends on how you set up your mechanics. In my interpretation, cutting a spell can 'kill' it, but if you just block it, it can enchant what it hits (a missed spell hitting the ground can actually be a trap that activates when the target steps on it). Collecting an opponent's spells on one's shield could become hazardous. It would be too easy to take advantage of and overcome its magical resistance. A sword could deflect lesser spells and sever more dangerous ones as needed.

The goal was to have a reason for swords, and thus I had to have a reason for shields not serving as well. Thankfully I already had set up my magic in a way that made sense with that. It might not work as well for other AUs.

** I've no idea, in my own fic I mention by name different Japanese swords, due to my background of college classes 18th century East Asian culture just for a fun thing and I had a reader try to rip me a new one because they were so very upset they were mentioned. Not once in my fic in that chapter did I state my character would use it. Lol just that there were there on DISPLAY! Lol

I know a few good ones and hopefully I can find it and send it your way

** Because when Harry learns to use a sword he uses Gryffindors sword and then he is the heir of gryffindor and fifty other houses or he builds himself/finds an extremely over powered sword that cuts through everything and is filled with infinite wisdom that makes Harry a god. There is never just a Harry that sticks a sword in his left, wand in his right and uses it to cut down transfigured animals and close combat fighting. It's no sword or only a rediculous six foot long sword, never inbetween.
