  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** I'm not really sure, to be honest! I think summer of 2000, neighbor kids printed out a fanfiction and shared it with me. Titled Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix of course. Turns out Dumbledore was evil too. Everyone had Animagus forms-I'm thinking phoenix and black griffon might have been two of them. Dumbledore and Voldemort had a huge fight and everyone's eyes were red. I never got to read the end.

It was really weird and I'm not sure why it didn't put me off fanfiction forever. Evil!Dumbledore was traumatizing

** I grew up in a small town without any book stores when OoTP came out and since I had very little patience to wait until the next time we went into town, I decided to download it. I was sooo happy to have found it and after I finished it I went to some message boards on Neopets to chat with people about it and that is when I learned that sometimes people on the internet lie,

The story I had downloaded was called Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but that was the only similarity between the two. In the fanfic version Harry's paternal side of the family had saved some phoenixes back in the day and so each one was granted a wish, well Harry wanted to try and bring his mom back to life. I only remember a few other details such as the one dying in the book ended up being one of the Creevey's so when discussing the book I totally had Sirius dying spoiled for me which kind of sucked.

I've spend the last 16 years of my life reading Harry Potter fanfiction. I wonder where I would be right now if maybe I had studied a bit more instead? Oh well, time to re-read joe6991's Hero trilogy for the 4th time. I wonder if Rosswrock or Naia will ever complete their stories...
