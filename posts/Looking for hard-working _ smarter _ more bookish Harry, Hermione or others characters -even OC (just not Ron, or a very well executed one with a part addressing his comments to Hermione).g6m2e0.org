I can be heavily influenced by what I read or watch : when binging Jessica Jones I feel a huge need of whiskey and self-loathing, when I read the Princess of the Black series I was a sarcastic overly proud of myself bitch.

Currently, I really need to go back to my studies, after a too long fuck** bedridden covid illness.

I remember having good work ethics when reading “the well groomed mind”, could you recommend some good similar fanfic ?

Finished or not, slash or het, any generation, I don't care. Just no harem, and no badly executed female character (if there are women, at least one of them must exist outside of being a love interest)

Thanks !


** Hardworking Ron, actually so hardworking it takes a toll on his health - Fate

Don't misunderstand this as a seer fic, it is not. It's an outstanding fic with a amazing story and slytherin ron,. His character is completely different due to different experiences (Starts at age 8), so you won't hate him, you'll love him. It's pretty dark. Although he is a slytherin he doesn't really delve into dark magic much. Many unique ideas I have not seen explored before in the HP universe.

Smarter Hermione who works even harder, and more importantly, INNOVATES - The Arithmancer. An interesting fic filled with creative ideas.

A Hermione who is a demonologist - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist]], she is actually pretty childish but she does study demons. A LOT. It's a bit cracky.

​

BTW, none of these fics are harem/boring/tootropey/badly executed.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

*** Great, thank you very much ! Never heard of the Ron one, and you are right about me disliking him - I was a Hermione growing up, he is too close to my personal experiences.

The other two, I already know of them, although I don't know why I stopped or never read The arithmancer series ? I will go back to it.

**** Yeah that one isn't often clicked on due to it's ron centricness. Even I was hesitant to click it, but when I did I was glad because Ron grew into a completely different character and the story was so interesting, it had me hooked. Even though it was ron centric it was like a breath of fresh air because it introduced ideas that no other fanfiction that i'd read before had - and I've been reading fanfics for years.

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.
