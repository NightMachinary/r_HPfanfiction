I read a fanfic a few years ago on fanfiction.net and I can't remember for the life of me what it was called/who it was by.

It was an AU fic in which Harry grew up with Snape. I think he may have taken him from the Durseleys. Bellatrix was involved somehow, possibly she was tasked by Voldie to take Harry from the Dursleys. I remember that Snape and Bellatrix ended up faking a marriage and passing off Harry as their own son.

Thank you in advance! (I know that this is a really weird request)
