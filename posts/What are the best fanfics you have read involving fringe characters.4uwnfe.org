  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

  "People change, you know, and then you find you have less in common with old friends and more in common with the strangest people." Percy had built a tall wall around himself - a stronghold - and the only way it was going to come down was by crashing into someone else's soaring fortress. Perhaps, a collision was exactly what they both needed. Percy/Audrey.

*** Just read ruthless. It's more a character study than a story. Indeed the plot is rather undercooked and Harry's perpetual silence does not make for and approachable lead. But the relentless dedication two conveying Harry's Mania is deeply fascinating. I really want to see a character like that in a more conventional story. they would make a fantastic side character or part of a larger ensemble.

This is one of the wonderful things about fanfiction that someone can try something so odd. I often come out of them not quite enjoying them but feeling like I've learned something
