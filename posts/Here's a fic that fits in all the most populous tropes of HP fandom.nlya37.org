The story is called [[https://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/the-legacy/][The Legacy]]

Here's a rundown of the tropes I've found so far:

Dumbledore Bashing

Weasley Bashing

Potter Wealth

Heir to all the goddamn houses

Giving Lily magical heritage

8 year old Harry has the vocabulary of an AP English student

Neville is being set up as the friend to replace Ron

Malfoys are not bad people

8 year old Harry also has the moral and political knowledge to despise a bill banning the marriage of LGBTQ+. I despise this law, but Harry is 8, and has been sheltered up to this point. Somehow though, this is a quote of his:

#+begin_quote
  “As always, Mr. Fudge, I appreciate your knowledge regarding the social backwardness of Britain as well as your legal knowledge as a solicitor.” He returned this gaze to his father. “This is nonsense. What if I want to marry a wizard and have babies with him?”
#+end_quote

What?

"Arch-Magus" Harry. WTF does this even mean?

8 year old Harry has been declared a sovereign leader

James takes Harry's advice on legislation.

​

Somehow, it's still not too bad. The writing isn't terrible, and the premise of Alive!Potters who leave Britain before Voldemort attacks is nice. I doubt everyone can stomach it, but it isn't horrible.

​

Edit: Read some more, and here's another one. Of f***ing course Hermione is Harry's "soulmate" and an Uber-powerful elemental


** You've just described every single one of that author's fics. Overwhelmingly trope-tastic, but somehow not too bad.

He was a high level wizard who met the appropriate feats for the prestige class. Then selected it on his next level up.
