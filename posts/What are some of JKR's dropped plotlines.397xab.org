Dropped Plotlines = Stories that Never Happened

We all know that Book 5 is full of dropped plotlines. For example, why is there a room in the Department of Mysteries devoted to love? Why are there brains in a tank? And, of course, for the love of god, what is with that Archway that killed Sirius?

I suppose it's not really JKR's fault. She had to create an entire world and fill it with information. Naturally, we can't know everything because it's THAT huge. So, and I'm speaking in terms of canon, what are some other plotlines that she just dropped?


** Anyone using time turners ever again. The only time anyone ever used a time turner, in the entire series, was Hermione's that she was given so she could take more classes. After that, gone. Nobody ever mentioned them again. Maybe they knocked over a shelf of them in the DoM in book 5, I can't quite remember. Apart from that, nobody ever mentioned time turners again.

That said, it /is/ incredibly poor planning on their part, BUT: remember that these are wizards we're talking about. On average they seem to have a great deal of difficulty with cause and effect related concepts. I read an explanation once where wizarding children are never subjected to the "if I break it, it's broken and I can't use it anymore" lesson because of the existance of /repairo/

  "And if someone bumps into me the Time-Turner will not break and will /not/ trap the whole castle of Hogwarts in an endlessly repeating loop of Thursdays."

  "Well, they /can/ be fragile..." said McGonagall. "And I do think I've heard about strange things happening if they're broken. But nothing like /that/!â€¯"

  "Perhaps," Harry said when he could speak again, "you ought to provide your time machines with some sort of /protective shell/, rather than /leaving the glass exposed/, so as to /prevent that from happening/."

  McGonagall looked quite struck. "That's an excellent idea, Mr. Potter. I shall inform the Ministry of it."

***** I just looked it up, and pretty much [[http://www.today.com/popculture/rowling-i-wanted-kill-parents-2D80555846][we're both right]]. She killed off Lupin and Tonks because she wanted to kill parents, and killed off Fred because the Weasley clan couldn't survive intact. So she killed three in place of one.

But I've also seen her quoted giving other justifications, such as explicitly saying exactly what I said above.

**** This is accurate. And I think JKR always liked the idea of Teddy being an orphan like Harry (as I do myself), so don't be too hard on yourself. It's a fictional book, so I don't think we're bound by the same morality as in real life.

***** They do and they don't. How you treat your characters is not the same fictional morality that applies to irl morality. How they treat each other does though. Good characters treat each other well, bad characters treat each other poorly etc. That applies to real life. Wanting a character to be an orphan is not the same as wanting a child to be an orphan.

Hermione's mom is fairly emotionally distant and robotic, and Hermione's academic views are her way of trying to earn her approval. Her dad by contrast is the one who makes jokes and helps her try to have fun on occasion. Ron being something of the trio's comic relief / morale officer in a lot of cases might pattern match similarly to her father for her.
