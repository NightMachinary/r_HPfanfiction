I'm looking for Fics where Arthur Weasley forbids Harry and Ginny dating.

It could be because of age, or even because the Potters aren't part of the Sacred 28 Family, or something else.

Thanks in advance

** linkffn(6160345) does this because Harry is in Slytherin and also for other reasons --- although, as with most of these stories, Molly is the true driving force, but Arthur is definitely in on it too.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] has a whole bunch of Harry/Ginny stories (that actually give Ginny decent characterization) and in most of them the whole Weasley family disapproves of their relationship. My favorite is linkffn(10645463).

*** I actually counted, and it's in only about one-half that the Weasleys disapprove.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.
