** Most of the fem!harry stories tend to be rather plain rehashes of canon or atrocious mary-sue fictions, and finding any that are actually worth reading is an exercise in patience and tolerance. Nevertheless, there are a few that are good and one that, in my opinion, is excellent.

1. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long Journey Home - Rakeesh]] This is one of my top ten favorite, but it might not fit your criteria. 'Harry' is certainly powerful, but it isn't really the important part of the character.

2. And here's a decent community list. The first few are /alright/. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fem-Harry/93136/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][Community List]]

Good luck finding anything that's *not* Mary Sue.

** Only two I've read and liked are pureblood pretense and holly Potter and the spiral path. I'd encourage you to give both of them a try. Sorry on mobile so not going to link now.

The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things./

** Need a little more info. There are different /kinds/ of fem!Harry, so it really depends on why you're interested. What aspects of powerful were you hoping to see? Are there stories you've read which can be used for comparison? Which crossovers would you find interesting?

*** I meant stories like "A Long Journey Home" which is already mentioned and is an excellent example for what I'm looking for. Or there is the E're series I think is called which is an Avengers crossover, or the Observer Effect, stuff like this :)

**** Ah, can't believe I forgot that one. /The Observer Effect/ is probably one of my favorite crossovers with Avengers, next to 'Wand and Shield.' I didn't list it there because 'Harry' is only exceptionally powerful because of her uniqueness in the Marvelverse. It remains one of the best romances I've read recently, though it looks like it's been abandoned.

***** Well, I didn't read Looking Beyond so I can't make any opinions, but greatness needs time :) And I happily wait a few weeks for a great chapter

****** Yup. Thats why I stopped reading Looking Beyond - it was too much 'filler' fluff and not enough quality

** Ooh Ooh. I can link my 'guilty pleasure' fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]] is a Harry Potter/Hobbit crossover featuring Harry reborn as a female Hobbit. She's pretty powerful within the setting without sticking out too much like a sore thumb. It's also really nicely written.
