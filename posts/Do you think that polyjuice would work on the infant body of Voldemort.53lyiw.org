** I think it might have had bad consequences. That body had to drink a special potion just to stay alive, I think it contained Nagini's snake venom and possibly unicorn blood, I don't think it was strong enough or fully human enough for Polyjuice, and if it wa consumed too close to the other potion maybe they would have had a bad reaction together?

That's my headcanon answer, but it still might be interesting to see it in a fic.

*** The unicorn blood was first year. The potion he drank was nagini venom and human blood based, I believe.

** When I first read the title, I thought you meant adding a bit of Voldemort's infant body to polyjuice to make a Voldemort polyjuice (which I don't think will work). But as for what you're asking, I don't think it would work. I don't think the infant body thing is actually human, and it seems implied to me that polyjuice is for humans only.

** One of my fave stories has a quidditch player accused of using polyjuice on a dog to make it human for squick. I'd like to think it could but Pettigrew, even with Riddle backseat potioneering, probably isn't competent enough to brew it.

** Well, either the body is a body of a real child that is being possessed, in which case the potion it had to drink to stay alive was due to how weak it was so the strain from using polyjuice could be too high for it, or the body is a homunculus-like thing that needs said potion to function in which case it's not human enough benefit from using polyjuice.

So no, I doubt it would work.
