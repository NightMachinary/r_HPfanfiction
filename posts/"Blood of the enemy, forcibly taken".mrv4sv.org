Has anyone ever wondered what would happen if this part went down different?

Prompt: instead of glaring and struggling, ya boi gets a clever idea...

"Oh, you want some blood? No problemo, amigo! Go ahead, take what you need!"


** It's been discussed a few times. The general resolution I've seen is that it doesn't matter because pretending that they aren't forcibly taking it isn't the same thing as actually being willing.

The one time I've seen an interesting take on this was in an Manipulative!Dumbledore story where Harry only considered him an enemy and barely cared about Voldemort, meaning his blood was no longer valid for that particular ritual.

*** Eh I feel it could be argued/written either way - for example, if you say that "enemy" is a qualifier based on some higher metaphysical quality of who you consciously consider to be the ultimate threat, so much so that literally kidnapping you still doesn't qualify you... why can't "forcibly taken" be the opposite? Like a Yin/Yang kind of deal

**** I think once Harry is captured against his will it's too late. But that's me. Deciding after the fact "oh, just have it" won't work.

If he went to touch the cup knowing it'd happen and still did it? Then it'd trigger, IMO.

** Harry smiled slyly, “oh you want my blood Peter? Here you go, I'm giving it to you of my own free will!” ‘Take that' Harry thought, ‘now whatever ritual he's doing won't work!' The homunculus body of Voldemort let out a chilling laugh. “Continue wormtail, only a fool forgets that the only thing more powerful than blood taken is blood given”.

*** I mean that's cute and all, but then it just completely throws out the hole framework of the ritual, it makes it meaningless. If random willing blood is so much better, why would he not just do that? Why do the three specific components of the ritual even matter then, that bone is unknowingly taken, that flesh is willingly given, or that blood is unwillingy taken then, if that can just be substituted at will?

******* So the will or disposition of the subject doesn't matter, in your construct of this ritual it all hinges on the mechanical aspects of taking it? It's not enough that he's consenting, he needs to go through the motions to make it count?

I'm not sure if that's consistent with the other aspects, certainly the other parts of the ritual, like unknowing bone, hinge entirely on the consciousness of that person (or lack of thereof). Would bone of father work as well if a small part was harvested while he was alive and asleep, instead of dead?

***** Isn't it obvious what the difference is? In your scenario, it is forced "consent", in my scenario, it is actual consent because Harry is quick on the uptake and /wants/ them to take his blood so that it will fuck up the ritual.

The difference is that he's not verbalizing agreement because he's forced to do so, he's verbalizing agreement because he chose to do so.

******* Disagree. You're trying to play a semantic game, but even if we use the words "forcibly taken", the word "forcibly" implies lack of consent, which would not be the case.

You can't "forcibly take" something from someone who is consenting.

I don't think that's right, because you don't /need/ to use force to get something from someone who is already willing to give you that thing. You could, but if they'd just as well give it to you, it's closer to BDSM play than anything...

Quite the opposite, I think the question of consent is very relevant and substantive, I think that it's the critical question here. Contrast with your entire point, which hinges on the mechanics of how you take the blood and a semantic interpretation of the word "force" which somehow doesn't take into account the subject's will.

Like I joked before, in your interpretation the deciding factor seems to be that Harry is in bondage gear, which is a rather ridiculous criteria for a ritual like this.

** I disagree with a lot of these comments. I do think consent is a massive factor, as are the factors of ‘friend', ‘enemy', and yes, how roughly it was taken. Needles can be traumatic too though, so even if he used a syringe and all the proper gear it would still qualify.

I think if he'd like ‘here, take it' it would definitely change a factor. I don't know how much of it though. And like, one thing I've wondered and haven't gotten around to writing yet is like, does Fawkes have to give their blessing for their tears to transfer as well or will he just get basilisk venom and blood?

It all depends on how you write your rituals and potion making though. In mine consent is always a massive part of the type and strength of magic that's being performed

**** Yeah, that's one of my theories as well. I think you see it a bit in fantasy writing, the whole, if a unicorn gives you their tears or blood it's like the greatest most powerful substance ever, but if you take it it's cursed.

But I do think that if a ritual says that you need to take something the power is in the act of taking it, it instilled a certain level of dark power, but that shit always has a cost, and people get addicted to just taking power for themselves and get tangled in gross stuff

Like my theory is that some rituals call for rape of a virgin and stuff instead of consensual sex and that's the kind of thing the death eaters would be super into, but I feel like once you did even one of those rituals your magic and yourself will never be the same

And then they're wondering how they ended up with a dry and horrible rock instead of a desirable outcome. Baking is science! so are rituals in my brain. It's just got to do with ingredients picked at a particular time of the lunar cycle or whether something was freely gifted or else wise

** For my take I had my oc make a ghoul double of Harry (ghouls in my story you give them a couple drops of blood and they take the shape of the donor) and Cedric. And ghoul blood corrupts Wizards to madness so over time Harry's few droplets mingled in with the ghoul blood breaks down and Riddle begins to become unhinged and unhealthily attached and obsessed with oc who is his second in command soon enough and can guide Voldy to more tolerable actions until they can carry out the final battle.

Diesel has more energy than gasoline, but you wouldn't fill your sedan with diesel, because it was built around gasoline, not diesel. And that analogy ignores that willing blood is literally the opposite, so by your logic, it would be like trying to shove activated plutonium down the hatch.
