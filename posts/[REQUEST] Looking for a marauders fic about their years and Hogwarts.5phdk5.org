Looking for a fic that mostly focuses on their friendship at Hogwarts and not just the war and their love interests. I've already read The Story of Four Friends, Against the Moon, Do you want to make a memory?, Forever Alive, New Beginnings, and Year of the Wolf. NO SLASH PLEASE.


** I hope you liked Against The Moon! I actually have a new rec for you since you last posted this question :D

I'm currently loving the WIP linkffn(Not Fade Away by Slide). It focuses on people in the Marauders' class starting with their 6th year, and how the war affects everyone at hogwarts. The only POV characters we know are Lily and Sirius, there are about three OC POVs, but don't let that deter you. The OCs are really well done and the story is interesting, though the Marauders friendship is not the center focus. Dialogue is really great, too.

  She fights for a world she hates as much as it hates her. It never stops; not until the world of magic burns to ashes to be reborn, or destroys Lily Evans and all caught in her wake.

***** Yep, it's on ffn. I'm not really sure how to link stuff on here, but it's by The Magnificent Kiwi. It's about the marauders 5th year.

** What about Haggis from Algernon, linkffn(3687255)? Admittedly, it might be a bit focused on romance for your request, but it's quite focused on their friendships too. It switches between the perspectives of Lily and James.
