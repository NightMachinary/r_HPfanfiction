For me it was a ‚ÄúHarry stands up for himself during his trial‚Äù fic. (Keep in mind this was when I was transitioning from the edge Lord Harry trope. I still liked Dumbledore and to an extent Ron bashing but hated the Lord thing) Umbridge and fudge were screaming and Amelia just tells them they cannot harass Lord Gryffindor. Like what? It came out of no where


** I don't have an exact story. But when people use fandom words in a fic it becomes immediately unreadable to me. For example: Quirrellmort, or Werewolf!Harry. The later is fine in the description of the story but not in the actual story itself. Thankfully this isn't something that tends to happen in well written or thought out fics, it's more of a, ‚ÄúI really want to read about a Harry who has a harem of elf vampires and shoots lightning bolts from his left eye and fire from his right eye...‚Äù kind of fic that this tends to happen in.

**** There are some cases where it's acceptable.

I can't remember the situ unfortunately but in context any and all diminutives for Voldemort work perfectly. It's an edge case though.

**** If I remember right (and I went back and checked the last time I mentioned this fic in a 'what random changes in a fic turn you off it' post just to confirm), the 'rationale' was something along the lines of 'the more homosexual acts people do, the less magic there is in the world' and that lowered level of magic was responsible for squibs being born. And yes, the phrase 'homosexual acts' was actually used in the fic (and repeatedly so, too).

It was more than likely just author soapboxing rather than any particularly thought-out worldbuilding - the author notes regularly talked about how the writer was a 'good christian woman living in a small american town and teaching morals to young girls', so I'd be more than willing to bet those were her beliefs leaking through into her work.

Hi, also Christian (although I'm Australian and male), and gay people are /fine/ as far as I was taught. Love is love, and that's all that really matters in the end.

And if you were going to go with this idea (which is stupid anyway), then the "logical" explanation would be that "more gay people = smaller dating pool", like [[/u/twelveplusone][u/twelveplusone]] suggested. It'd still be dumb, because we see no measurable differences between Halfbloods, Purebloods, and Muggleborn, but it'd at least be a /little/ less irrationally preachy.

EDIT: okay, to explain something. I evidently phrased this a bit poorly. When I said "Actual Christian" I don't mean to imply that they weren't one, I meant to say that I am /also/ a Christian. A different denomination by the looks of it, but I am one.

But unfortunately, there are Christians out there who believe things like this and who believe things like this make sense. Not all Christians do, you're right, but some do. There's no real uniting generalisation in Beliefs for Christians anyway, positive or negative - there's even a denomination that doesn't believe in anything Divine, only that Jesus had some good lessons to teach and ideas to share, so even basic theism isn't even a universal factor.

Do you believe that you should follow the laws laid down in the old testament while also accepting that Christ existed and is a messiah? "christian"

When I was taught of God I was taught to love everyone, just as Jesus Christ did. And that means /everyone/. Gay? Bi? Trans? All the same to me, all just people that need love.

I was taught that a "Good Christian", to use the term, was a "Good Person". And I can't call myself a "Good Person" while saying that one type of love is wrong just because I don't experience it myself.

  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!

Lily dates Sirius then Lily hooks up with James. Then Peter and Remus both kissed Lily while she was with James. I was done. I think in total there were about 8 or 9 guys that were romantically interested in Lily or kissed her in this fic. Sirius and James are both described to be fairly attractive and Sirius had 2 romantic interests. James had 2.5. I don't mind characters fooling around in romance fics but I want gender equality in promiscuity.

At this point it feels like Lily is the only attractive witch in Hogwarts and reads like a Lily/multi story that didn't go all the way.

It wasn't a great story imho, but I kept reading since the grammar wasn't terrible and I didn't have anything else better to do. I noped out at the part where second-year (?) Harry (who was simply annoying and unlikable) had this weird kinda-toxic sexual relationship with a girl at a "Dark" bookstore.

It's been some time, not exactly sure) it really is one of the few stories that I've read which actually do have a dark!Harry done well, his motivation and backstory are sound and do correspond with his actions, he isn't right all the time and makes mistakes, while considerably stronger than his year-mates the growth actually is somewhat believable and pass the image of how much effort he actually had to put into it to get there and contrary to many others of the genre Harry is undeniably evil instead of only being viewed as such by other characters who manage to be far worse, plus the characterization of his twin is actually quite good, he is a brat in the beginning, but grows and change as a character (mostly off-screen since his story is vastly removed from Harry's) and at certain point I actually liked him more than the tragic antihero Harry started as to say nothing of the monster he was shaping up to be. I would put it on the same class as ‚ÄúA Cadmedian Victory‚Äù: not something to read if you want to relax or have a laugh but a well-written chaotic-neutral/evil-centric story where actions actually have consequences.

** Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos. Harry goes around saying, 'there is no good or evil, only power', while he positions himself on a moral high ground. It's like, 'Oh, you're a villain now, cause no one besides the villain has to say that'. It drove me insane, I couldn't tell whether I was meant to take it seriously, or whether it was a misunderstanding of the quote.

** Oof, I have one that actually inspired me to make a similar question post awhile back.

So, The Boys of Crowhill has a great premise - Harry grows up at a Boy's Home because the Dursleys drove across country one night and dumped him off at a police station 'cause they weren't interested in taking care of Lily's weird magical kid and, when Harry's like 7 or 8, Remus finds him and finagles himself into a job as a math teacher there so he can keep an eye on Harry. It's got some very good supportive adults action and some plot changes that make it avoid the whole "stations of canon" thing, but until a certain point it was serious toned, with some concerning developments but nothing dark or sad - more tense/wistful/faded-but-still-present-hope tone. And then, in the space of one scene, [[/s%22Pomphrey%20is%20murdered%20offscreen%20after%20having%20been%20an%20active%20supporting%20character%20the%20whole%20time%20and%20there's%20a%20battle%20where%20Pettigrew%20has%20Remus%20collered%20with%20some%20kind%20of%20werewolf-imperious%20collar%20and%20Percy%20held%20hostage%20and%20Snape%20and%20Lucius%20Malfoy%20are%20suddenly%20being%20controlled%20by%20diary!Riddle%20via%20the%20dark%20mark%20and%20turn%20on%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20team%20who'd%20gone%20to%20kill%20the%20basilisk,%20ending%20with%20multiple%20named%20character%20deaths,%20Percy%20and%20Remus%20kidnapped%20and%20possibly%20dead,%20and%20multiple%20people%20permanently%20injured.%22][Spoiler]] I was shocked by the sudden spate of deaths in a story that had previously not been that dark and I just couldn't deal with the tone shift. It's a story with great potential, excellent writing, and really unique plot points, but the hard shift right there just absolutely killed it for me.

The only thing I hugely disliked about that one is how they handled the whole Whomping Willow incident. They turned the whole thing into being something Snape himself planned, even going so far as drugging Sirius basically, and the whole time I read anything on that I was just like "wtf????" but it was good enough otherwise that I just skipped past any other parts like that.

There were other things I disliked about the fic, but I'm a right fool for Harry actually getting a family and honestly a lot of the ideas in the fic, like the advanced mind healing place, were interesting enough for me to finish it anyway.

I mean, just. Do the words "Mind control" and "Rape" mean nothing? Getting the hell out of there was the Objectively Correct Decision, that isn't really up for argument.

It was like a thirty word tidbit in what I think was a several thousand word chapter, just a sort of "yeah, that guy, screw that guy" but it completely turned me off of the story. The comment section for that chapter seemed to agree.

** Harry being /inexplicably/ gay in the story, or introducing slash out of nowhere (such as suddenly making Hermione a lesbian or bi from nowhere so they can ship her and Ginny or Luna or even goddamn Pansy, which again has its faults because there's no indication that the latter three are at least bisexual). I mean, it's fine if it's an AU, but I'm talking about a canon divergence story, like Harry walking down the left corridor instead of going right like in the books. Two scenes later? "Oh yeah, I've always been gay, and I've always had suppressed sexual urges for Draco Malfoy". Facepalm.
