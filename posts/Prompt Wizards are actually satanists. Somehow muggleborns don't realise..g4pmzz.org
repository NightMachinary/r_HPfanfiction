In real life, people accussed of being witches or warlocks were oftenthought to have made pacts with demons. So what if it turns out that this is actually true and the entire wizarding world is filled with satanists?

Usually current satanists are pretty chill, but what I want is more of the stereotypical satanist with virgin sacrifices, blood orgies and possesions. even better if muggle raised students find this so outlandish that they don't realise whats going on.

Basically, what if the wizarding world was the satanic society from Crusader Kings II


** I always find that part of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina quite amusing, my family, not so much.

I find hard to imagine how muggleborns would be fooled for long, British are not know to be overly religious as say, Italians, but on average they still receive the basic notions of it.

*** Perhaps that could be why Voldemort's followers are so anti Muggleborn. Maybe muggle Briton is not overly religious but followers of the old way are and having to hide their spiritual culture in their own world is the last straw.

** Linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

Dark magic is satanism. Hermione invites a demon over for tea. Harry has no idea.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.
