LF long fics where either both of or one of the Potters live and raise Harry. Can be WBWL or BWL or can even not have Voldemort at all. Prefer complete stories because getting 40 chapters into a story only to find out it isn't complete even though it is marked complete really irks me. Can be any pairing, just not any main character slash. Thank you!


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Non magical AU and Potters (and Hermione) are even Americans. Sounds like a recipe for disaster? No, it's a wonderful Harry/Ginny romance, James and Lily also have an interesting background. Written by the author of “The Changeling”.

  Wherein Harry never could help himself from trying to save the day, and Ginny was just trying to survive her shift without killing any of her customers.

  The Dark Lord was at the peak of his power, so close to controlling wizarding Britain. When his most loyal brings him news of a prophecy, he acts in a demented manner. Before he can leave his study, a seer that had presumed deceased appear and recited a new prophecy regarding a future Death Eater that would change the world. His careless actions regarding the two prophecies have dire consequences for anyone caught in the middle. One such person being Harry James Potter.A more in-depth, less generic, Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fic.Part 1 -- 7.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone rewriteRewritten: 29/March/2016---revised: In Progress (18/12/2016).

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

** I don't know how to link fics in here but Stepping Back by TheBLacksResurgence is a very good story. It is a time traveling story though but one of the best I've ever read. It has a Harry/Bellatrix pairing though, but again, in my opinion, it was very well done

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
