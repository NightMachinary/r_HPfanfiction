** "Your scar, Harry, is far more than that. It is an accursed mark: the Darksign."

Dumbledore's words, uttered so gravely, sank over Harry like a smothering veil. Fawkes crooned from his perch by the grand fireplace, and Harry met the creature's shining black eyes for a moment; he read sadness there. Mourning.

Harry looked to the Headmaster again, and spoke with a throat gone dry. "Darksign, sir? I don't . . ."

"No, no . . . of course you don't." Dumbledore looked hunched against invisible weight, the same oppressive force that seemed to drag speech from his gentle frame against his will. "It is a curse---an abominable act of hatred born from a festering mind." For a moment his expression tautened into iron, the change subtle, yet chilling. "While the Darksign marks your flesh, your soul may never traverse beyond our plane of existence; you are bound here."

Again Fawkes cried out, soft and musical. A momentous, dreadful feeling wormed through Harry's heart as he struggled to grasp the implications put before him. "I'm 'bound here'? So I, what---I can't die?"

"Quite the contrary, I'm afraid," Dumbledore said. His brilliant blue eyes were like sunlit chips of ice. "For your remaining lucid years, death will be your most steadfast companion. You may die---you /will,/ again and again, and you will return . . . but not unscathed."

The silence rang, and the Headmaster studied Harry's face with a maddening look of piteous sorrow. Hogwarts' great bell reverberating through the stones forestalled a reply for a moment. Harry thought of Ron and Hermione, likely heading to lunch together, the two of them idly speculating what new piece of Voldemort's history might he and Dumbledore be unearthing.

Dumbledore continued to watch him, loathe to elaborate, perhaps. But they both knew he must.

The quiet stretched until Harry forced himself to speak around the lump in his throat. "I-I die, and I come back, and then . . . what happens?" The Headmaster closed his eyes as if against a blinding light, and every second he withheld, Harry's dread heightened. "Professor?" he added with urgency.

"Your soul, Harry," Dumbledore said, voice gentle as down and wracked with pain. "It will . . . shed. Fall apart. With every death, a loss---a fragment, not more, but each sliver worth everything dear to you, over again, until nothing remains; not a thought for your deepest desires, not a memory of your most cherished experiences, not a notion of feeling for those you now love."

Horror spiraled down Harry, cold and stark, and the hair on his neck stood up as he thought suddenly of Barty Crouch's son, blank-eyed and huddled against a wall, the slight rise and fall of his chest a solitary sign of life.

"Yes," Dumbledore said, his voice wavering a little. "That . . . that is your fate. Death and death again, until you are but a hollow shell, utterly numb and ever-enduring. I am so very sorry, my boy."

*** ~claps and awards cookies~

What would the plot of a fic with such a concept be, though? Harry trying to find a way to die but keep his soul intact? Will he try to replace lost happy memories with new ones? Will he seek to find out what happened to the last wizard who suffered under a Darksign, only to find that said wizard, Ekrizdis, degenerated into the first Dementor?

**** Those plots sound quite good! From my end, it would be a tragedy, I think. Brainstorming, I imagine Harry would eventually accept the fate Dumbledore laid out as inevitable, but Ron and Hermione certainly wouldn't. They'd search for answers as they hunt the horcruxes, chase fruitless leads.

Maybe Harry finds he can supplement his flagging soul with Voldemort's sundered pieces at the cost of his identity, which he is slowly shedding anyway. (What he doesn't know is that death isn't all that degrades the soul of the cursed; acts of murder, which go from abhorrent to necessary as his soul mingles with Tom's castoffs; also, despair/hopelessness eats away at the soul, the catalyst for this downfall.)

Perhaps the curse would lift on the caster's death (Voldemort, ofc). But by then, Harry is gone, something much more chilling in his place.

**** All is thought lost, Voldemort takes over Hogwarts. The captive students wait for any sign of resistance, and find it one day, in the form of a figure emerging from the Forbidden Forest, zweihander-holding arms held aloft in a "well, what is it?" gesture. Removing the best looking mask in the world, Harry storms the castle with infinite poise, staggerlocks Voldemort to death, calls his corpse a casul and reminds everyone that INT is just blue Dex.

Especially since the change is low effort, I wouldn't want to see this subreddit devolve into everyone and their brother posting;
