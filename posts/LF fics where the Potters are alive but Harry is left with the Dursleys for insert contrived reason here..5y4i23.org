I'd prefer it not to be a fem-Harry. Here are some examples of what I'm asking for are:

- Too much annoying politics driven crap for me in this one. Really nice how characters all have agency but it moves /way/ too slowly for my tastes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]]

- I love how hilariously stupid the realization scene in this one is. Also a big fan of light and dark meaning something.


** linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) has a Fem!Harry placed with the Dursleys as part of the backstory.

Needless to say, Jen isn't at all fond of the Potters.

***** It's been a very long time since I've read it but I recall something about a girl whose father whored her out before he was caught and she want to an orphanage or something and it was made to sound all wonderful that the girl had found somewhere where she "belonged." There were a few other issues I had with the story but the glossing over of any negatives surrounding child prostitution disgusted me more than Fridgebro.

****** That's an interesting take on it. I thought that the author was trying to give a sort of realistic take on how a person might deal with being raised in that situation. Like how Jen pretty much rationalized everything that happened to her and it didn't seem to bother her. But at the same time it really did bother her because she has some sort of vendetta against the Potters for giving her up.

Regardless it was a shit story. Really it made no sense, that's partly why I gave it up. I didn't like the straight up evil/insane protagonist and I couldn't really follow her motives at all; it was like the author was writing her into doing things purely for shock value. It just got tedious to me.

Now that I've written that out, I agree with you. It started out where the author was trying to make a statement about it or an analysis of what would happen to a person like that, but devolved into writing fucked up shit for the sake of it.

It's a horrific thing but because the protagonist did it we sympathise with them, even if the things they're doing aren't exactly sympathetic.

****** Hmm no... "Breaking Bad" is about the descent of Walter White and the dramatic arc IMHO is pretty clear about that. In the beginning you are actually supposed to sympathize with him and a lot of the stuff he does kinda makes sense or at least is justifiable.

Princess of the Blacks immediately starts out with the brothel shit and there's *literally* not one likeable (or even redeemable) character to be seen. If I remember correctly Narcissa is a pedophile who raped a bunch of children (among them fem!Harry) and Sirius just totally accepts that and her presence.

I agree that the author doesn't portray them as likeable (just neutral... factual), but there's also no counter-weight to all of the badness. Who wants to read a story solely about a bunch of assholes? To come back to Breaking Bad: The more of an asshole Walter becomes, the more we - as the audience - sympathize with the other characters.

But I could be wrong, I tried multiple times to read that story but never got very far into it because I hate everyone.

It's just a prop, really, with little thought to how such a place would actually function, and what would be its honest effect upon the psyche of the people working there. Which is why I find the story kind of dumb. It takes that stupid trope that dark equals sexy and alluring and dials it to 11, and adds a garnishing of pedo stuff.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
