I am going into the hospital soon for surgery with an extended recovery period and due to being bedridden will need plenty to read so I am loading up my kindle with fanfiction.

The problem is, I have read so much already I need new ones and not the same old same old.

So... give me your best recommendations of HP fan fics that are either rarely recommended, under-recommended, or simply unusual and ones that rarely fit requests or are not requested.

I am not looking for complete trash fan fics, and obviously would vastly prefer completed ones. But I am sure there are some out there that are well worth the read that simply get forgotten about or don't tend to fit the usual requests.

Note: I would prefer no main character slash fics please. I would also prefer fics WITH romance/pairings but its not required. I also prefer more mature writing (as in M rated over T rated).

Thanks all!


** The linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter) series is the best that I haven't seen on here much. It's long, and complete AU, but I've enjoyed the first two and a half books I have read. (Currently on a [[/u/TE7]] kick though, so the read through is on hiatus)

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.

** If you don't mind going old-school (like, 2002), I absolutely love [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=188&chapno=1][Midnight Musings]] and its sequel, [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=189&chapno=1][The Test of Time.]] Post-war, H/G, R/H, Draco's a shit, Ron is actively trying to better himself, and introduced a spunky young female auror before Tonks was written, but because it was written pre-OotP Ginny is still on the shy-and-sweet side, if that's a deal breaker for you.

It may not be high literature, but I consider it comfort food.

** Into the Fold- linkao3(147439) is an amazing first war Snape fic. It covers pretty much everything, from Hogwarts to when he becomes a Death Eater and when he finally defects. It treats Snape as the morally grey personality that he is: equally vile and heartbreaking.

Romance of the Age- linkao3(638325)- Another first war fic. Amazing, clever satire of the Marauders' generation.

[[https://gilpins-tales.livejournal.com/9875.html][The Measure Of A Man]]- A very good James Potter character fic. It shows how he changed from a bully to the man Lily fell in love with.

The Lions of Gryffindor- linkffn(7421306)- 7th year at Hogwarts from Neville's point of view. It also has flashbacks to Frank and Alice. Much better than DAYD in my opinion.

Hogwarts, to welcome you home- linkao3(8125531)- You'll like this if you enjoy a bit of fluff and the idea of Harry being a professor.

Carry That Weight (A Long Time)- linkao3(14673145)- A very different kind of Severitus. It's post-war with Snape surviving. Since Harry's an adult and Voldemort's out of the picture, there's no power imbalance and it's a more mature take on the trope.

St Mungo's Grim Reaper- linkffn(8910296)- Haunting first war character portrait of Snape. It's before his defection so you get to see Snape in all his repulsive Death Eater glory, but it still elicits some sympathy.

you'll go the same way- linkao3(7811107)- The only Draco redemption fic I've liked. Draco goes back in time and destroys Horcruxes with Narcissa's help.

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

Between everything I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.”“Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said dryly.Or, three years after the war, Harry Potter becomes Hogwarts' newest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.

** Definitely linkffn(Daphne Greengrass, Side Character). It's ongoing and updates slowly, but even if the topic isn't your cup of tea, the writing style imo is really, really good. It's subtle and doesn't tell you everything (so it's essentially the opposite of most ff), and does a great job of character building. Currently my favourite ongoing fic.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is also well written and I remember that I greatly enjoyed it, but can't remember why :S

linkffn(8287773) is a very cute one shot with very cute Daphne. When people ask for a 'non-Ice-Queen' Daphne, this is the story I always think of (unfortunately they usually want a Harry/Daphne pairing and this is Theo/Daphne).

***** Out of curiosity, do have any more to recommend like FILFY teacher? I am familiar with High School DxD, and a guilty pleasure of mine as it pertains to fan fiction is teacher/student oriented relationships but with HP its hard to satisfy since like 99% of them are Hermione/Snape and not Harry Potter character based.

Edit: Read the opening 2 chapters. Enjoyed them for the most part.

I also love HP fanfics that have a powerful but mysterious Harry whom those around him struggle to figure out. The opening of this seems to fit that perfectly.

** The best (and longest) fic I ever read was Bullseye by Ohyeah100, it's an ongoing rewrite of the series from Astoria Greengrass's point of view. The timeline and events are the same, but Harry and the gang take a backseat and only pop in here and there, while Astoria deals with interhouse politics, family drama, societal expectations, gamblings with goblins, and now that Astoria is getting a bit older we're starting to see romance. It is amazingly written and even though it's enormous (almost 600k last I checked), the plot never gets slow and is excellent for long days with nothing to do

There is some crack, and it does drag a little at places, and GODDAMN Harry is a clueless teen when it comes to romance, but it's wonderful. I'd recommend reading the first chapter - it's all in mostly the same style, apart from a truly hilarious chapter told from the horse's POV, so if you like the first chap then definitely keep reading! There is the old 'first chapter is actually from way later in the story' thing - but do feel free to skip it if you dislike those; it gets retold in due time.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

*** A couple good ones, a couple ones I hated in that mix. Sadly I have read almost every single one. The only one I have not read is The Mind Arts (which appears to be fairly new).
