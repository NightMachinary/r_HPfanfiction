I don't mind Dumbledore bashing being thrown in, either, so long as it's well-written.

Edit: This has gotten out of control. I'm just looking for some good ol' Snape bashing XD


** "I don't get it. Why are you selling little models of Snape and Umbridge?" Ron asked.

With a wide grin, Fred just pointed past Ron's shoulder.

Ron turned around; there, next to the display of Figurines Most Foul, were...

"Whack'em Bash'em Mallets...pulverise the pest that's giving you stress." Ron slowly read aloud.

Fred's grin somehow widened, "The two combined are making more than our entire fireworks selection put together."

**** "He can't get rid of me that easily!" Harry hissed, pacing around the Chamber of Secrets, "Who does that arrogant slimy snake think he is?"

Turning around, drawing his wand, "Does he-...a little to the left."

Obligingly, Hermione Granger shifted the small Severus-Snape-shaped-statuette an inch to the left on its pedestal-

"/Reducto!/"

-where it was promptly disintegrated.

"-have any idea of who he's dealing with?!" Harry continued, "How could he do this to me, why, I saved wizarding Britain! /Reducto!/"

Another SSSS was atomised.

******* The book didn't romanticize it other than naming Harry's son after him, but when JKR tried to excuse the name, she was definitely romanticizing it.

Control is usually counted as abuse. Signs that you're in a controlling relationship: Partner isolates you from friends/family (ex: Snape does this to Lily with Petunia). Veiled threats (ex: I won't let you). Using guilt as a tool (ex: We're supposed to be friends. Best friends). Spying (ex: All that time I was watching you). Jealousy/accusations (ex: He fancies you!). Inability or unwillingness to ever hear your point of view (ex: It was just a laugh).

I'll admit that I might be reading too deeply into things, but while Snape is a fascinating character, he disgusts me as a human being. That's what Harry honored (along with Snape being a Nazi) by naming his son Severus.

******** Which is why I called Snape an "Internet Nice Guy." He wasn't a nice person, but that came forth very clearly in the chapter. I disagree that said chapter romanticised abuse, nor do I agree that Harry honoured abuse or Nazism by naming his son for Snape.

Ultimately, as I see it, the entire thing was an act of forgiveness and acceptance, a sign that he's made peace with the memory of Snape and realised that he wasn't a monster, he was just a man. A man who did many bad things, but who also went through many bad things, who in the end tried his best to minimise the damage of Voldemort and without whose efforts the war would have been lost.

Eh, this is pretty romanticized:

#+begin_quote
  “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”
#+end_quote

This is one of the most disgusting lines in the entire series.

Harry is tacitly dishonoring all the brave people who died without being pieces of shit along the way by comparing them to Snape. He's godfather to Teddy, whose parents sacrificed their life and happiness in order to create a better world without expecting anything in return.

But whatever, lets instead name my child after the manipulator and the Nazi, these are clearly the best chioces! "Sirius Remus Potter" sounds ridiculous!

*********** Oh the romanticization there is obvious, I said that above. I meant that JKR obviously didn't intend to endorse Naziism/obsessive love/abuse, but that's what happened. Some things can't be forgiven. I don't think she really thoroughly read what she wrote, and just wanted a saccharine ending with A.S.P. Now she can't take it back, though, because her mistake occurred on a global scale, so she has to somehow defend it.

Also I'm rather partial to the name Arnold Rubeus myself XD

Harry's poor first son who is ignored in favor of his sociopathic younger brother is named James Sirius, and Remus should be kept for Teddy. But Arnold honors Arthur, and Rubeus honors Hagrid
