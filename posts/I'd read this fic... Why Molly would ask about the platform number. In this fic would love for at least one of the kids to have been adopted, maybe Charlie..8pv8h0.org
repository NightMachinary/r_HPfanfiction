*** Oh, you silly muggles are always trying to explain the world around you with unreliable things such as “reason” or “common sense”. It's cute, really.

Anyways, you're probably right; it's what I've always thought. This is a cute head canon, though.

***** You ever notice how the people who shout that the loudest are the ones who know the least? Like those who complain about this clearly have never had to be responsible for kids before, or half the people who complain about stuff Dumbledore does (the other half have very reasonable complaints about the dangerous way his school is run, but that's more of an issue with the writing than with Dumbledore).

******** It depends on the narrator's POV. This small story has an omniscient narrator, so they have the ability to get inside Molly's head and make this claim. An unreliable narrator wouldn't be able to, or could even lie to you. Some do that.

Since the books is told from Harry's POV mainly, there's things he just plain misses, or may get wrong.

****** You're supposed to read between the lines. There's probably a ton of stuff like that throughout the series. This particular one was dead obvious to me when I was a teenager reading it for the first time. Maybe because I had a much younger brother and people were doing that with him all the time.

I mean for future reference the next time someone asks their kid what the dog says or what color fire engines are, it's not because they've forgotten. They're trying to keep their kids involved and learning so they don't scream in the middle of target and grow up to be morons.

****** Why would Harry indicate such? He is a child himself. He wouldn't know. It is left to the reader to understand the scene. A reader at that age would be familiar with such behaviour from their own life, even if they do not understand the reason behind it. An adult reader would have the understanding to know what's going on. It is only the teenage readers, their memories of similar events faded already but not yet able to grasp what is involved in raising a child, who will miss the forest for the trees.

******** Stow your persecution complex. What I suggest is perfectly in line with the book, with general human behaviour and with the person of Molly Weasley. It doesn't even require extending the claim of wizarding incompetence as far as you are trying to do.\\
Maybe you should try reading one of these days.
