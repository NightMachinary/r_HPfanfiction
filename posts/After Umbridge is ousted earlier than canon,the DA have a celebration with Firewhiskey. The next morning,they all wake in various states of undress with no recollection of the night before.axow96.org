*** With all that happened in the books? The DA existing, Sirius Black entering the castle/being on grounds, nobody knowing quirell went after the stone, the basilisk, etc. I'd say it's pretty likely there isn't any or it's not used.

I don't think the word "ward" ever appears in the books, it's just fanon. There are spells and charms that behave like wards, like apparition restrictions in Hogwarts, etc. But again, not sure about that "I can feel everything" bit.
