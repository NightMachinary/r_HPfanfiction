For those that don't know Draco with leather pants is where a fanfic writer takes a character who is normally either an asshole or evil (IE Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Voldemrot) and writes them as "Misunderstood" even though they aren't.

** One can generally assume that any question on the Reddit that begins with, "Am I the only one who...?" will

a) make everyone roll their eyes b) return a lot of "No, same"s.

Obviously many people dislike that trope. While I wish more people would literally write "Voldemrot" wearing leather pants, we can safely assume that you are not alone in disliking the slimming down of negative character traits.

** Short answer:

No.

Long answer:

No, you're not the only one who dislikes that trope, and I can say why I dislike it -- it renders a story spineless and ruins what could be a truly great character.

That probably sounds crazy, but it's true. Draco Malfoy could be great (not necessarily Good^{^{TM}} ) character to read about ... as long as he isn't OOC.

In theory, Malfoy could work as a love interest. Yes, he could be a lead in a romance story, the genre that I despise the most in this fandom. And I despise it because to make people like Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape or Voldemort/Tom Riddle or whoever palatable, they are always turned into whitewashed Heathcliffs where their defects are quirks to brood over or unhealthily romanticize.

That's the coward's way out.

Draco Malfoy is a stuck-up bully and a bigot. He wants a sizable portion of the magical population, Muggle-borns, to die. The only reason he turned his back on the Dark Lord was because Malfoy and his family were personally endangered by Voldemort.

He never changed his mind. He never saw the light. He just wanted to save his own ass.

Even his mellowed attitude in the epilogue comes off as one of middle-aged "let's tolerate the lesser people," at best, especially if you ignore all the (often contradictory) interview and Pottermore George Lucas-ing.

Now take that Malfoy, the real one, the spoiled, bigoted, cruel, bullying asshole and make him into someone that could be understood instead of misunderstood; make him change himself instead of changing canon; make him raw and human and flawed, and /then/ you will have a story where he's worth reading about.

Redemption can work if you don't flinch at the ugly stuff.

You do realize that he was 16-17 during all of this, and at one point his /parents/ were being held hostage? Despite what you, the reader feels about Lucius and Narcissa, remember that Draco, the character obviously loved them. Also remember that he knew damned well who Harry and Hermione were when they were brought to Malfoy Manor. He did what he could and waffled on identifying them which is what bought them the time they needed to escape. I always felt that his portrayal in those last two books was quite a bit of character development. As far as "saving his own ass" goes, that's what most people would do, let's be honest. Harry's rush in to save the day mentality is really the abnormal one here.

And yeah, in the epilogue he and Harry share a polite nod. I really don't see how you read so much into that. He didn't speak, he didn't even emote. There was nothing implied about his current attitude towards anything whatsoever in that nod.

**** JK wasn't the best at tending to all the characters development in the way that a great author should. A lot happened in the last book and you don't really get any good amount of mouth time from Draco, and the epilogue tells us nothing beyond that a lot of people had a good amount of sex and had kids because of it.

For me, Draco was just a scared kid who's family got taken for a ride by a loony, but his parents drank the cool aid because it was similar to something they had in the wine cellar in bulk, this was just a new vintage.

At no point do we see him do anything of note that could be considered helping them bring down voldy, hell, he gets berated by one of his former underlings for being incompetent. He's floundering because he's been taught all his beliefs in a marble room with fine silver on the table and silk to cover his morning wood, but no substantial exposure to anything close to the reality of the things he keeps saying. 'You'll be next mudbloods!' Is a perfect example of this. The cat that everybody hates is dead (frozen petrified, not dead), and the guy who wants to make him miserable is sad because of it. There is no blood, no screams, no open wounds with bruises around them for him to see, just 2 things that he hates, hurting or gone, and he proclaims that all shall be next that are like them, unclean, impure, and time goes on.

Years pass and he rides the coattails of his father's power, which exists because of voldemort. He lords it over people, badgering them, calling them names, might get in one or 2 fights, but nothing happens serious. Then he gets handed a badge and told to do it more like a good boy and go further than he has been, so he does.

Still no blood or actual consequence beyond his toys and privileges taken away.

Oh his father is in jail? He'll be out soon, the dark lord is back, the one who gave his father the power that Draco grew up with, and now that he's back, it's sure to grow more when people see he's back in the open.

Then he's given an immposible task, kill a god, or the closest in his mind. What else could defy his Lord? And he's scared and trying all these things to do it, but ends up failing, someone else does it and gets credit, and suddenly life starts to lose it's luster.

He failed as his father did, and no one wants to hear about it this time.

People actually start dying, families ripped apart, damaged, there's actual blood this time.

Shit.

Parents locked in their own house.

No.

No glory for their efforts for their Lord.

Stop.

Left on a shelf with other broken things.

Wasn't supposed to be like this!

And then Potter comes and knocks down the proverbial door and kicks a few hornet nests, Draco gets called to fight again, doesn't do very well, and in the midst of the final battle he gets walked out of the conflict with his mother holding him. Taking him away, while the monster who lied to them with honeyed words is still banished.

They recover, and keep their wealth.

Time goes on, and as always, we are British, appearances must be kept, we are the Malfoys, Draco, walk tall.

You are better than the others, don't let them forget it.

They bring the old vintage up from the wine cellar and pour a fresh glass.

Well that got a little away from me, but yeah, Draco didn't really learn anything on screen or page on focus, and saying he did after the writing is over, is just really bad and lazy form. To me he got finally saw a lynching and was horrified when all the things he grew up with didn't match what he dreamt then to be and cried to his mom and dad who took him away from it.

***** I think we agree for the most part? haha Your assessment of his character is more or less what I gathered. He was raised in a very secluded social group, who felt a certain way. He was a snotty little brat of a kid and did what snotty little brats do best. Then he started to get older and there were expectations that he wasn't prepared for.

I never saw Draco as this great evil in Harry's life. They disliked each other and both of them were petty little assholes at times. The books are written from Harry's POV and therefore of course it seems like it's Draco's fault most of the time. I'll admit that Draco may have "started it" a bit more often in the interactions we see, but it's pretty obvious that Harry wasn't some innocent little lamb being preyed upon. Harry was also an obnoxious little snot in his own ways, it's just he's the protagonist of the story and so it was always portrayed differently than the antagonists.

In the end, I think Draco did learn some lessons. Maybe he didn't make a complete 180 on his world view, but in my private little head canon I like to imagine that he came out of the experience a little more mature and aware of the "bigger picture." I kind of like it that way, as well. Maybe he doesn't spend his free time cuddling small muggle children but he's at least got a bit more of a worldly view on things.

That's one reason I love Draco as a character. He, more than anyone else in the books has /potential/ in character development. He has this opportunity to be a wonderfully complex and intricate character. We don't know what kind of person he grew to be in those 19 years after he left Hogwarts with his parents. I never bought into the "redemption" nonsense because Draco doesn't need to be redeemed. He's not some mustache twirling villain who's burned villages and raped innocents. He was a kid who believed what he was taught without questioning, and then learned a hard lesson as a result. I don't think he'd ever become what a lot of people consider a "good guy." He'd always have that edge, that aloofness, that deep-seated desire to be better than others because when you're raised with a particular view on life it's really difficult to shake, even if you know it's wrong. In my imagination I see him softening his views on muggleborns and muggles in general, but still not jumping full in on the love-fest, so to speak. An "I can live alongside them, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be best friends with one" sort of attitude.

But yes, Draco is a much better character when the author isn't treating him as evil incarnate OR making him morph into some bleeding heart cuddle bunny because he 'saw the Light' or some nonsense.

***** Yup that's pretty much it, but at a certain age that just makes him quite pathetic.

At least intellectually he he should be able to make the connection to the real world at some point (even if he doesn't understand pain, suffering, etc on an emotional/instinctual level), but it never seems like he does. When innocent bystanders like Cedric Diggory (who could and should be a great asset to wizarding bloodlines - he's a champion after all) get murdered by that psychopath it should mean something... but he never catches on.

****** Oh he is very much pathetic by the end of the books, he hasn't really done anything to make him develop, he's just the spoiled kid who got kicked in the mouth and is confused by what the sensations that his body is sending him and reeling from the shock of it and not sure what to do as he doesn't seem to have the sense of self needed to make the decision as to how he should react to them.

I very much enjoy when an author takes the challenge of expanding on his development and actually makes him think about it all.

What I do not like is when someone gives him a long ass lecture about why all of his beliefs are wrong, mary sue style, and he does a 180 on his way of viewing things. It ruins the entire story and the author should stop writing that fic and realize they are writing trash when they do what is equivalent to pulling back the curtain and yelling at the audience. It is bad and lazy writing.

I don't disagree... What's even worse though is just not addressing it at all and making up some bullshit about him being misunderstood or hiding behind appearances and secretly always having been in love with Hermione.

Clearly if you want to write about Draco as a protagonist there needs to be some kind of course correction for his character (no-one wants to read about a racist dumbass protagonist... okay, almost no-one). I think you're on the right track that he needs to be confronted with realities and ripped out of his sheltered existence.

******** If you are going to bring him over to the 'light' sure, or you can give the reasons why and detail them out and make him actually not flinch at their applications, be competent and a little sadistic. He can be a wonderfully dark character depending on how you write him. It's mainly about the balance, if you have more than one competent person on each side with actual power and influence, then you have a story where things get an audience that will stick around to see who walks away alive and bloodied.

Making one side overly competent and the other cartoonishly dumb doesn't do anyone any favors Unless they like to read boring stories where they overcome things without any hardship.

** I don't mind it as long as the author does it well and explains it well. Just like any troupe, there are exceptions to the rule. I can tolerate Draco redeemed much more than Snape because Draco really was just a brainwashed kid, but Snape was an adult and an asshole and a terrible teacher. I've never read an LV pairing because the idea alone it's such a turn off I won't even try.

** Sadly, it's one of the main reasons I avoid a lot of slash fics. I have nothing against slash, although I do find it easier to relate to het fics. But I hate how so many slash fics would twist characters completely on their head and make it so that they were completely misunderstood in canon and are actually really nice people instead of the assholes that they are (and hey many teens are assholes at that age). It would be much better to read about an arrogant, entitled Draco who slowly transforms his attitude to be less of a prick but still retains his core disposition

** What I've never understood about the need to make Draco OOC in order to shoehorn him into a romance (seriously, he's a piece of shit) is that people could literally just use Theodore Nott and not have to write him out of character. Most of what we know about him is also true of Draco:

- Son of a Death Eater

- Slytherin

- Pureblood

The only other things he doesn't have in common with Draco is his mum is dead and he wasn't played by Tom Felton. He's otherwise a blank slate.

Any story that puts Leather Pants on Draco could just substitute Nott with minimal extra work.

As for the trope itself...no, not really. In the hands of an excellent author that trope could certainly be spun the right way. I do get what you're saying, though, but in the end it really depends on the talent of the author writing the trope.
