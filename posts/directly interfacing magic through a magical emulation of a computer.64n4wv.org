There was this fic where the mc(might have been hermione or an oc but was basically a female si) basically "programs" magic and makes a spell to bring up a "terminal" to execute functions. The mc also used the spell to get a better understanding of magics "source code" and i think she becomes a metamorphmagus/animagus by making an "add-on". There was also a subplot about the killing curse and the veil being related I think. Does anyone know the name of this fic?


** Wow... Wish I knew, but I definitely want to read this now!

** Was this fic related to HPMOR? Because there's one where Fawkes takes Harry to the "Source of Magic", he reprograms stuff to bring his parents back, and there's a huge plot twist when he tries to bring back Hermione.

**** True, I got to around chapter 8 before giving up, because of this reason. But I'm glad I revisited it a few months later, because it gets way better - I think the author took this critique seriously and toned it way down because right after the Sorting, Harry is actually an okay character to read.

I would recc you give it another try and skip past the first chapters, because they're basically throwing shit at Rowling, and you won't really miss much except for an interesting take on Draco's personality and a bunch of foreshadowing. But the rest of it is pretty dang amazing, tbh.
