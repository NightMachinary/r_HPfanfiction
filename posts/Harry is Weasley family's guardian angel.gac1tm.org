Just in canon, Harry has saved Ginny, Arthur and Ron from certain death. He gave away money when the twins were in desperate need of it.

What if all of these things aren't simply co-incidents? What if Harry really is meant to protect the Weasley family from all kinds of trouble? What if he is, in an almost or complete literal sense, their guardian angel?


** It was that feeling again. That feeling that had pulled him to impulsively run to Lockhart's office and the feeling that prodded him to fight the basilisk. It was the feeling that made him wake up, covered in sweat, shivering, only days before Christmas and it was the feeling that convinced him that the dream wasn't just a dream. It was the feeling that prompted him to remember that a bezoar acts as an antidote and it was the feeling that helped him ignore the panic as he shoved it down his best mate's throat. It was the feeling that his family, those crazy, loud redheads whom he adored, were in trouble. It was the feeling of the world being pulled out from under you while adrenaline pushes you to act. Harry Potter would go to any length to save the Weasley's, not because he had to - although that directive from whatever god runs the universe certainly helps - no, it was because he loved them.

Needless to say, the build-up to that battle was riddled with those feelings. He felt it when a Snatcher grabbed Ron a little too hard and pointed a wand at his throat. He felt it when Bill dodged a curse that was headed straight to his heart. That day the feelings became almost constant. A pull that he needed to run to someone's side and make sure that they were okay. He didn't only because he wanted to end it forever. If only Voldemort were gone, dead forever, then maybe these feelings and the dread that accompanies them, would just go away.

It was during that thought that he felt it again. The feeling which happened at the same time as Fred's voice, full of laughter, appeared near him. This time was different. The feeling stopped almost as soon as it started. It was over. Harry didn't have time to make a decision about whether he should help Fred because there wasn't time.

A different feeling swept over him as he heard Percy's scream and saw Ron's shoulders shake. This was grief, a familar friend to Harry, but it felt different, heavier somehow. That grief mixed with responsibility multiplied tenfold when he heard Molly's scream, saw Arthur cover his face, and watched Bill hold a sobbing Fleur. The worst of it came seconds later and it was so much worse than anything he had felt before. Because as George yelled and screamed and fell over his brother, Harry knew that he was no longer the guardian of the Weasley family. He had failed.
