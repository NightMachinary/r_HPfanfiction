A bit cracky, but here we go:

In the magical world, there is one thing that you never, /ever/ should do: even if joking on your end, you never should propose without meaning it because it will always be taken as a serious question. Always. With the cultural expectations from friends and family surrounding it.

Luckily enough, when a lot of unknowing muggleborns and muggle-raised half-bloods do this faux pas, their unintended, would-be fiances/fiancees often turn them down, even after seriously considering the question.

(Amusingly enough, it was Lily who accidentally popped the question to James in their final year, which surprised him. He accepted, surprising her, and she rolled with it because she wanted to marry and have a life with him anyway).

Harry, after an argument with a friend, sarcastically/exasperatingly says, "Well, I'll just go bloody ask (Daphne Greengrass)/(Lavender Brown)/(that French Champion, Fleur) to marry me, then!"

Unfortunately, the witch was nearby and overheard, and she's genuinely surprised: she had no idea Potter felt that way about her!

So, she wanders off, carefully considering the offer.

Despite his friends' stern admonishments for saying that and relieved no-one but them apparently heard it, he pretty much forgets about it within ten minutes (late to potions, and all).

Yeah, it bites him in the ass when, a week later, said girl walks up to him, and before she could be asked what the hell she was doing, snogs him and agrees to marry him.

Yeah, his friends are practically ghost white at this stage at Harry's new engagement.

The girl's motives are pretty much transparent: cute, presumably rich celebrity, THE celebrity, wants to marry them. It's a jackpot, and she's happy her future is set where she can be a devoted housewife or mother or whatever they want to be in life (let's face it, most teen girls think shallowly like this).

Yeah, Harry's in trouble, especially when wizard-raised people are taking it seriously.

It could be a nice subversion if Fleur thought like this, and instead of the usual marriage/love stuff that occurs in Harry/Fleur, she sees it as an opportunity for the both of them. Or if Daphne Greengrass' ambitions are to be a doting mother and housewife instead of some political juggernaut.

** "How did you and mum meet?"

And there it was, the question he had dreaded answering for years now, he knew it would come eventually, it was after all a natural thing for children to be curious about. Normally, it wasn't a question one would have any reason to dread, but Harry Potter had always been anything but normal.

Harry looked to his wife, but if he expected support he would be sorely disappointed, she was just sitting there with an amused smirk on her face, and Harry was suddenly reminded that despite his wife's many wonderful features, Daphne Potter-Greengrass had a cruel streak.

His brother in law was holding back laughter. Bastard. His sister in law however had no such restraint and was openly cackling (actually cackling, who even does that?)

There was nothing for it, he'd have to answer "We met at Hogwarts in our sixth year..."

Hogwarts Library 1996

"Incidentally, Harry, you'd really get a move on and ask someone to Slughorn's party, the sooner the better, I actually heard some girls including that Romilda Vane discussing the best methods of slipping you a love potion."

Harry stopped himself from rolling his eyes she made it sound so serious, it wasn't like he was getting married or anything. "Oh, right then, I guess I'll just go bloody ask Daphne Greengrass to marry me, then." Harry said, with as much sarcasm as he could muster.

Hermione rolled her eyes but Harry was sure she was at least a little amused, but Ron...Ron was giving him a faintly horrified look, he had even let go of Hermione's hand, something which to Harry's amusement and slight embarrassment had been an increasing uncommon occurrence over the last few weeks his two best friends had been dating. Honestly, Harry was happy for them but they could be sickeningly happy sometimes. Now though, Ron's face had gone deathly pale, like more pale than Malfoy, that couldn't be healthy.

"Are. You. Bloodly. Insane!?" Ron hissed through his teeth "What if she had heard you?"

Harry blinked "Ron I know Slytherins haven't exactly been nice to, well, any of us, but she's not the devil, an eldridch abomination, or, like some sort of malevolent fae creature or anything. I'm pretty sure it's okay to use her name."

"I think she'd know that was a joke." Hermione reasoned, ignoring Harry

Ron if anything only got more agitated "This isn't a joke!" Madam Pince glared at him and he continued. more quietly this time "Don't ever joke about marriage in the wizarding world, everyone knows that. Marriage proposals are serious business. Best case scenario, she didn't hear you, or she did, but she turns you down. Worst case is...well you're quite famous aren't you and you'rer comically rich, and what was it you said, Hermione 'Quite frankly, you've never been more fanciable.' so...all in all she might say yes."

Harry could just raise a skeptical eyebrow "Then I'll just explain that I was been sarcastic."

Ron winced "I'm not sure that'll work, Her family isn't like the Malfoys from what I know, but the Greengrasses are an old family and fairly powerful, granted you can get away with a lot more than most people just by being you, but I wouldn't be surprised if her family made a real fuss about you joking about marring their daughter."

One of these days, Ron would remember that he and Hermione grew up in the Muggle world, hopefully before it bit him on the arse.

"That's completely absurd, honestly, the wizarding world is so backwards sometimes."

20 minutes later outside the potions classroom "Bugger, she's coming your way, mate!" And sure enough Daphne Greengrass was marching directly toward him with a determined expression on her face, and despite himself, Harry couldn't help but find her look of intense concentration to be a bit adorable.

...And then suddenly Daphne Greengrass was snogging him...in front of the mixed class of Gryffindor and Slytherin.

"Yes, I will marry you!" Daphne said the moment they broke apart "I had no idea you felt that way, but I'm oh so thrilled to hear it!" She grined brightly and with that the immediately began planning their wedding with the assistance of her friends Tracey Davis (who gave him a thumbs up) and a rather bored looking Pansy Parkinson.

Once again Harry found himself thinking Daphne's obvious excitement and general bubbly personality to be unfairly adorable, and he didn't have the heart to tell her he'd been being sarcastic.

He turned to Hermione "Well, that settles one thing. I won't have to worry about asking anyone to Slughorn's party after all." Hermione just buried her face in her hands.

Present day, Grimmauld Place

"...And that, is how I met your mother."

NOTE: I did not proofread this and I wrote it in one sitting, so there are likely typos, but I had fun. Love this prompt.

*** Mate, most of my friends in high-school were teenaged girls. Most of them were obsessed with cash, booze, boys, and popularity. Oh, and just having fun.

It's a stereotype for a reason.

Also, it's not as good as it sounded: the cat-fights and snarky behavior often were a minefield for the few blokes in the group.

That's reality, for ya.

**** Mate, teenage girls are humans just like everyone else. Sure, lots of humans - teenage and otherwise - care a lot about cash, boys (and/or girls), and popularity - and having fun - whether they're teenagers in high school or 40 year olds in manufacturing.

Everyone fights, everyone gets snarky or rude or passive aggressive or just aggressive or yells or...

It sounds like you really didn't like your friends or at least were really frustrated by some of their bullshit? That's fair, you get to feel however you do about how other people act and treat you. But generalizing nasty traits about teenage girls because you had some shitty friends is hurtful.

If I had mostly male friends in high school -which I did - and most of them did drugs, shoplifted, and sexually harassed girls - which they did - would it be alright for me to say most teenage boys are sexually predatory and obsessed with drugs and theft? No, it would be really shitty of me to say that - and I don't think that. I understand that that behaviour isn't the norm for teenage boys, regardless of how my high school friends in particular acted.

There's also a huge difference between caring about the things MidgardWyrm considers and listed as shallow and a teenager who isn't looking to escape abuse or poverty being excited to marry a stranger. That would be seriously not normal at all for a teenager, and it's the part I actually commented on.

** Almost 50 years ago, I was driving cross-country and stopped to visit friends in Tempe, Arizona. The first night, we were having a small get-together, and Charlie (the girl I was visiting) and several of her friends tried to get me to propose to her roommate, who had received two proposals earlier that day. They wanted to try for three.

I declined, on the grounds that I didn't know her at all, and didn't want to get married. They tried to assure me that she'd turn me down, too, but I told them I was afraid that she might consider that "third time's the charm," or the stars were in alignment, or something.

I hadn't thought of that in many years.

So, I presume Charlie's friend was attractive to get multiple proposals per day?

...Huh. Makes me wonder if there's a fic where a character gets multiple proposals like this per day, and she just brushes them off. Harry jokingly does it and she accepts.

Whoops!
