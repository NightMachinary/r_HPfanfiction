Yes Chapter 4 is done and out and advances the plot a lot and Harry also gets to meet classmates and stuff. :) I love writing this story it's just super happy and wholesome. :) :) It's meant to be like "Greatest Gift" and "Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay". Just a good nice story. :) There is going to be like action and stuff later, but it's going to stay close enough to like the tone of the first three Harry Potter books. :) I love also getting to integrate Fantastic Beasts canon, but also headcanon a bunch because the rest of the movies aren't out yet and we don't know anything about the missing gap of like 15 years in between 1927 and 1945. :)
