** The Fat Friar could cure the pox with a spell, I'm pretty sure they could come up with something. Also students at hogwarts barely have any contact with the outside world so I doubt they'd have many cases.

** For themselves, not a big deal. But since they can catch the common cold (hence the need for pepper up potion), they should catch COVID too because at least 30% of the common cold is also caused by corona viruses. COVID can be considered a "super cold".

Wizards need to modify their pepper up potion accordingly.

In 2020, Wizarding Britain is run by Hermione Granger and Harry Potter, and they are neither ignorant nor negligent about the Muggle world. But the shear scale of the COVID spread means that they can offer only limited help. Production of magical potions is not automated or industrialized, and duplication spells do NOT work on magical items.

The best they can do is provide the cure to families of Muggleborns and some Half-Bloods, and Muggles they work with, including the Prime Minister. Remember Boris Johnson's near death experience in April? He was actually saved by wizards.

**** Cure for the common cold, not a cure-all for every virus. Though they'd probably get a cure for Covid pretty quickly.

***** Magic in Harry Potter is versatile and conceptual. The freezing charm can stop pixies and freeze a burglar alarm. Episkey can heal a cut and heal a broken nose, the differing anatomy of the injuries don't matter. The pepper-up potion cures the common cold and helps warm someone up. I'd say that the pepper-up potion probably would work, the concept of the diseases are similar enough.

To an extent, yes. But not entirely. You can't use Alohomora to unlock your untapped potential, for example, only regular locks.

#+end_quote

Yeah, because it freezes things in place. An alarm works via the laws of physics and requires electrical signals to be able to move through the wiring. Freezing it would prevent those signals from travelling through the wire, the same way it would prevent the pixies from flying/moving around.

Really depends on how the potion works. Does it specifically target the cold or does it eliminate all viruses? If the former, then it's doubtful, though could probably be used as a base for a Covid cure. If the latter, then sure, it'd work for any virus. We don't really know how it works, however since it's specifically called the cure for the common cold and not a virus cure, and potions seem to be more rigorous than other forms of magic, I'd lean towards the former.

  Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it;
#+end_quote

It's not called the cure for the common cold (unless you're really citing the video games); you take it to warm-up as well. There's a consistent theme in JKR's writing, directly confirmed by her, that mundane illnesses are curable by wizards. It's the magical illnesses that require research to cure and treat (werewolf curse for example).

#+begin_quote
  None of them realised that Linfred's wonderful cures for pox and ague were magical;
#+end_quote

The pepper-up evolved from the remedies that cured these diseases as well. In any event, even if it isn't pepperup, wizards can definitely cure COVID.

I would note that there a serious differences between freezing an alarm and freezing pixies.
