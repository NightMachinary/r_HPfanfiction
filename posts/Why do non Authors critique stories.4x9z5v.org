** You don't have to write stories to be able to critique them. If you did, most professional literature critics would be out of a job. Poor grammer/spelling/etc in a review certainly diminishes its reliability if they're criticising those same things, but just because someone doesn't have the creativity to come up with a plot and story doesn't mean they can't recognise one that's good and well written. I say this as an author (who rarely leaves reviews for other people). It's a lot a easier to recognise good (or bad) literature than to write it.

*** I totally agree. But I am talking about what is not*** helpful. Like I read a review before reading a decent story and someone wrote a review that was stating the story was not good solely on the characters used. I guess I am trying to figure out why they feel a need to say something and not go over what their posting. Like do they honestly think the author will change the story? Especially if it is coming from someone who doesn't write. People who can tell if something is good or not should at least be able to comment with help suggestions, right?

That's simple human nature -- we want to share our opinions. Maybe some of them do think it'll change the author's plan, or maybe they don't; the main point is just to express themselves, regardless of what that expression will do (if it does anything at all).

*** I don't write. (Well write and post) and I agree with good helpful reviews. But I am talking about like a non author who says ummm "Hermione is too brainy and this story will nver be goo" on chapter 1 of 30. Why would someone take the time to leave a reply that can in no way help an author out? Better yet, why not just pm them?

Many people review to leave an opinion, to let the author know they appreciate (or not) the piece of writing. We call them "reviews", but it would be more accurate to refer to them as comments much of the time. You have to keep in mind that fanfiction is primarily an amateur hobby. We get stunningly well written pieces and people with the skill to go pro, but primarily this is a hobby of the inexperienced. That goes for writers and readers, so it's no wonder that there will be reviews of little or no help to the author. You'll also find that there are plenty of authors who don't actually /want/ help, either because they're confident in their skills or they see this as an unimportant past-time that they're not hugely interested in improving.

Because that's a degree of interaction that's more personal than leaving a review and not everyone is comfortable with that... giving or receiving.

**** I started to type "you must be new to the Internet", but I realized that "you must be new to life" is more appropriate.

** This post is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while. The argument that an opinion is invalid unless it can be backed up by first-hand experience is just stupid. Imagine that if that was the law, for example, then you couldn't, oh I dunno, vote in elections because you have never held a public office yourself. Exaggeration, sure, but I thought the magnitude of stupidity of your post deserved one.

*** That is not it at all. Did you read my questions? My point was why do they make useless reviews if it does nothing?
