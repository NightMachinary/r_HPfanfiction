Hi! I've been trying to find good fics lately, but it's very hard! I tried to read the most popular dramione fics (like The Fallout, Isolation...and all the "must read" fics) but I didn't like them at all. The only dramione fic that I really loved was How To Win Friends and Influence People. It's well written and super interesting. I fell in love with each character and I'm so sad that it's over. Oh and if you happen to know a good marauders era fic (as good as The Life and Times aka the best fic I've ever read) please tell me! I guess that I'm just looking for underrated/unknown fics that you may have read. They just need to be long, complete and well written. Tell me why I should read them and why you love them. Thank you!

** It's still a WIP but have you tried Fall Through Time by Indieblue on [[https://FanFiction.Net][FanFiction.Net]]? (not sure how to tag stories)

It is Dramione in the Marauders era.

It is long and still going. If I remember it was slow to start but hooked me in soon enough. Not Dramione straight away either, they develop characters, relationships and a story.

** I'm not a huge Marauders Era fan, but I read this huge (complete!) fic that was amaaaaaazing. I truly loved how everyone was written - even Peter! It was hilarious, and heartwarming, and just gut wrenching in parts. I would love to do a reread, but I can't invest the time in it right now. linkffn(11129273)

** Did you read Chrono Historia? Dramione 8th year and thrown into founders era.

If you like How To Win Friends, you might like Unhinged.

  Running, hiding, secrets, and war. It's only natural to go a little crazy.
