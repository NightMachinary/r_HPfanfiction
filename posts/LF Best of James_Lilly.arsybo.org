  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

** linkffn(Common Stories by cupid-painted-blind) is the first in a series of drabbles spanning Lily's time in the Maurader era. There's around five of them, I think

  A lull in the chaos, preparing for sixth-year exams; a late-night trip to the kitchens and a run-in with a boy she's supposed to hate. Lily's most honest and most deceitful moment, James's most honorable and most terrible memory. ---- Pre-Lily/James. Second of a series; bridges the gap between "Common Stories" and "i await a guardian."

This has children that act like children, something that you rarely see in fanfiction. Excellent characters that behave realistically. No-one is given idiot ball. There is no overpowered geniuses creating obscure magic left, right and center when plot demands it.

  Mr. and Mrs. Evans are killed when Lily's only a girl, and she's supposed to go to a home with her sister. Instead, a relative they didn't know they had comes to collect them, and introduces Lily to manners, magic, and a life that's just the slightest bit different from the life she was supposed to live.Or, an AU in which Minerva McGonagall raises Lily.
