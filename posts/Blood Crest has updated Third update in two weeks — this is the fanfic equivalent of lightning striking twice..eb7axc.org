** Blood Crest is a wonderful fic, I'm greatly enjoying it! And it does an excellent job with little tidbits that fit right into canon, like the snippet you posted. My personal favorite like that for it is earlier, when Harry is reading through his potions reference book in the train.

#+begin_quote
  Unfortunately, the book was less of a textbook than a reference. It reminded him of the /Complete Compendium of Charms/, only for Herbology. He wasn't sure if reading about magical plants in alphabetical order was the most efficient way of learning about them. All the same, he was too lazy to go through his trunk again, so he resigned himself to reading about aconite.

  He had hardly gotten through the first sentence and discovered that it was also called monkshood and wolfsbane when the door to the compartment burst open...

The reason I really like this one is that it puts Snape's little quiz on the opening day of Potions into a completely new perspective. He asks questions involving Asphodel, Bezoars, and Aconite - all three of which would basically be right at the start of the book if organized like this. So instead of being a random assortment of trick questions, it's basically like checking if the student even read the first page or two of the compendium.

In general though, the fic does a great job of fleshing out magic in a way that still feels like Harry Potter. There were some aspects that I enjoyed a little less, or that feel like they're dragging on a bit - but it's a very good one overall.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

I hope they're still alive at least, I don't think anyone's heard a peep since early 2017.

**** Can you share your thought why you think Basilisk-Born is terrible ? I honestly thought it is one of the better time travel fics mixed with outlandish Lore about Basilisks, Phoenixes etc. But last 10 chapters are terrible for me.

**** It is pretty bad, I liked the idea but I only stuck with it for a short while. BB felt too long winded and drawn out
