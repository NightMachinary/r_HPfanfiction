Hello everyone!\\
I'm working on a fic atm that centers around an OC in Slytherin. My only other HP fanfic was a Gryffindor OC and I find myself always leaning towards that aesthetic

If you walked into the Slytherin dormitory what do you think you'd see?

What would the 'cultural' atmosphere be like?

Thanks for any thoughts!


** i often describe the slytherin common room as being silent yet welcoming; everybody here is odd but together they're empowering.

id love to check it out! c:

** It naturally depends on what your Slytherin is like. Is it 11 year old kids? Or do you go the /Pureblood Heirs, mini-adults/ route?

My first and most important take is and and always will be that it's /not loud/, but that goes into the latter direction. I see the Gryffindor Commom room as loud and boisterous. Children are having fun. Somewhere, there's something exploding. Shouts. Laughter. Someone hexes someone. Basically, chaos.

Slytherin is the exact opposite. I put it thusly in my story:

.

/The best word he could find for the common room was ... tranquil. It was low, hardly higher than the tallest student, with rough walls and ceiling, filled with a green-tinted light from many lampoons suspended over the tables by chains; shut off from the world outside by thick stone all around, removed even from the castle by being partly beneath the lake, and time measured in the flow of the water, in the gentle sway of sea weeds at the bottom of the lake far below, stretching on and on, before it was lost to the dark./

/A few students other than the first years were present, seated in the sofas around the large fireplace or at the tables near the various tapestries covering the walls, variations of the snake theme of Slytherin's crest, all minding their own business. A pair was negotiating something, their back and forth softly drifted over. Someone was writing a letter. A group had a Gobstone tournament in one corner. The voices were muted and calm./

/And perhaps the lake was a good simile, still on the surface, with currents and eddies, secrets and dangers below, and the common room thus here; tranquillity of atmosphere needed for where there was anything but tranquillity offered in every other aspect, and the momentary peace ready to be disturbed by any wrong step, any misspoken word; a dangerous and thrilling prospect./

/He took a deep breath, tasting the cool, dry air. This was his lake. Here, he would make waves./

/He could live here./

.

And check out the Pottermore stills, which I think do a good job of portraying it.

*** well the common room would be a mix of 11 to 17, and the Oc will be 11 and then will follow the books til 17

** Honestly I kinda see it as kinda a networking event. The low actual hangout spots aren't the main common room which has more of a formal vibe.

** I am not a fan of Slytherin as a concept: deceitfulness (euphemistically called "cunning") and selfishness (a.k.a. "ambition") as virtues can make for interesting fictional characters, but they don't make for good people to work and socialise with. A society built around such "virtues" (with some fantasy racism on the side) won't be a healthy or a pleasant one---unless one is at the top, and even then one always has to look out for backstabbing unless one has powerful backing. Here's how I see the Slytherin social dynamics and culture:

- Very hierarchical and status-conscious, less in the aristocratic "lords and ladies" bowing and curtsying sense and more in the "mean girls" sense. Everyone is constantly working to reinforce and improve their status, sucking up to those above them and grinding under those below them.
- Low general degree of trust: students don't like to leave themselves vulnerable. Bullying, sabotage, and betrayal are common.
- Students don't generally help each other unless coerced, trading, or trying to ingratiate themselves with someone of higher status or with more resources.
- Those with a lot of privilege or powerful backing (e.g., Draco) can get away with anything short of murder---and they are the only ones who can actually relax.
- Those who don't fit into the hierarchy get ground down and bullied until they do. Those of extreme talent (e.g., Riddle) might be able to claw their way to the top.
- There may be rival gangs within Slytherin, mainly (but not always) bound by ties of blood or family relations outside of Hogwarts. The culture within each gang generally recapitulates the overall Slytherin culture: hierarchical and low-trust.
- In this type of environment, high-functioning psychopaths prosper the most---and the better one can emulate a high-functioning psychopath, the more one prospers.

If all this reminds you of prison culture, that's not coincidental.
