*** I've seen a couple where Harry thinks his name is "Freak" until Hagrid shows up, eating a normal Hogwarts meal makes his shrunken, malnourished stomach ache, and he doesn't feel safe unless he's locked into a dark, enclosed space.

It's a surefire sign you've got yourself a whump fic.

***** Similar to the Hurt/Comfort genre, but mostly Hurt and very little Comfort. Also known as "suffering porn". Some authors apparently believe that writing deep and multidimensional characters comes from sending them to rock bottom and keeping them there.

** I don't doubt thats what he thought his name was up until he had to go to elementary school. The Dursley's probably had to drill it into him before they sent him to school, otherwise the abuse would be pretty obvious. I'd like to believe no teacher of children would call him 'Boy'.

Fics with child abuse also give me creeps, and like Liristorm said, make me far to sad and angry to enjoy.
