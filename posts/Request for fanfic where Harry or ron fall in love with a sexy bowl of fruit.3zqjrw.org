--------------

Most are just born that way

"Well mister Malfoy," said Madame Pomfrey, "What did you get yourself in to tonight? And I'm sure I don't need to remind you, but I am under both my healers oath and a supplemental oath directly to your father to not reveal any information on your medical history to anyone other than yourself, including him. I can not act on anything I learn in this room, other than to heal my patients."

Draco was in the fetal position, whimpering and ignoring the healer.

"Mister Malfoy, I already know you're a marked Death Eater, I already know you're trying to kill Professor Dumbledore, and I already know about the cabinets, and I've already treated you a dozen times for the cruciatus and other injuries. I can not help you if you do not tell me what is wrong, and I can not cast any spells on you unless you give me verbal permission."

Draco only shuddered a bit. Madame Pomfrey sighed and lowered herself until she was at eye-level with the blond boy. "I can't help fix what he is doing to you unless you tell me what it is. What did Voldemort do?"

Draco lurched violently at the forbidden name of his Lord and then cried out as the painful movement registered throughout his body. "No, no don't say His name. It wasn't him." Draco gasped out through his tears.

Poppy put her hand on his shoulder. "Tell me what happened son." She said softly. "I... I can't.. can't say it. Just do your spell. I can't say it." Draco looked up at her pleadingly.

As he'd finally relented, the resident Healer stood up and began casting diagnostic spells. She got negative after negative, and was confused. She was expecting signs of Cruciatus or splinching as a result of the broken teleportation cabinet. After a minute, she noticed he was holding his back and legs extremely rigidly. On a whim, she cast a spell to test for foreign bodies.

The result surprised her, and confused her even more. About 8 inches into his colon rested what appeared to be most of an apple. She was speechless. "Draco, I uh... I see the problem. I'm sure you don't want to talk about it, but please tell me, was this an accident, or did someone do this to you?"

"Can you fix it?" Draco whimpered. "Of course I can Draco, I'll make you right as rain, and I can help you so it never happens again." Madam Pomfrey assured the teenager. "Just tell me a little bit more about it. How long ago did this happen?"

"Just this morning. And... And it w-was an accident." He looked up at her. "You can't tell anyone. Nobody can know! You can't!" Malfoy begged the woman standing over him. "Of course I won't Draco." She began prepping to remove the apple that was lodged in the 17 year old's anal cavity. "Okay Draco, we have some potions you need to take for the pain and to start on healing your bowels. Then in a bit you're going to take this blue one which will loosen your bowels so it's not up there so tight. Normally for projectile injuries or wounds where there is an object still involved, we'd switch it with a wound sealing potion, but there's no wound in this case. I do have a surgical wand, which are normally placed in open wounds to better place spells."

"In this case, I would like your permission to use your rectum as the insertion point, where I will then carefully shrink and pull the object out. This is the primary treatment method, but most patients are not comfortable with it until the initial round of potions are complete, so lets wait an hour or so and come back to it, okay?" Draco nodded. "Okay. So, tell me about how this came about. Think you can do that for me?" Draco nodded again, but took a moment to speak.

"Well it started about fourth year. You know how us purebloods operate, regardless of how you or I feel about it. Pansy was given to me in first year." "Miss Parkinson?" Pomfrey asked. "Yeah. Lord Parkinson wanted to start a business and sold his only daughter, the sick bastard." Pomfrey shook her head sadly.

"I've never liked women. Lucius forced me on Narcissa from a young age to prove my manliness and all that shite. I didn't even really like girls to begin with and it put me off of them completely. Can't even look at a vagina without vomiting. She was my mother for Merlin's sake! She's supposed to hug me and care for my scraped knees not suck my dick and force me to touch her!" Draco was bawling again. Poppy place her hand on the boy's shoulder and let him cry for a minute. As terrible as it was, he wasn't the first pureblood Scion that broke down and turned to homosexuality after incestuous rape. Then again, perhaps he had no interest in girls to begin with. Either way, it helped explain how he wound up penetrated. After he calmed down a bit, Draco started again.

"Anyway, Pansy wasn't never good for brains and didn't have to. I kept telling her and telling her she wasn't good enough for me she should go practice. She fucked her way through school, still is. Fourth year, when Beaubatons was here, I knew I am gay and I know I'm going to have to have a kid someday, ya know, for the Malfoy name to live. But when Beaubatons was here, I wanted to, ya know, find someone for a short bit. I was attracted, physically to these older guys. You could tell which ones were gay, because they didn't need those amulets to keep from pouncing on the veela, yet they never talked about girlfriends or love interests."

Poppy remembered that year. More than one of her boys were brought in with black eyes and crushed testicles over the veela. Not that she blamed the girls who, like everyone, were a circumstance of birth not choice, but she just wished she had some warning and a chance to get all of them acclimated to resisting the allure. Still, she learned a lot about the kids that year, watching who reacted to who and over what. Particularly about a certain Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, both of whom refused to admit that they could be partners instead of siblings. It also pointed out the glaring difference in maturity between Harry and every other boy in the school, especially Ron Weasley. The disruptions gave her a lot to gossip with Minerva about. Draco was still talking though.

"So one night, me and Francois had snuck out, or rather I snuck out to meet him and I guess I didn't realize it at the time, but Millie, Tracey, and Daphne were up still. Daphne still hates me of course, 'cause her dad tried to sell her to me. I told him that Daphne was worth way more than I could ever afford. She was just as offended that her dad would sell her as she was that I wouldn't buy her. She took it to mean that she wasn't good enough for me. That's patently false and you can tell her that if you ever see her, she's a beautiful woman but I could never love her and as smart as she is, one of us would be dead and the other in prison inside of a year."

"That was very brave and mature of you, you know. That will have led to many problems for both you I'm sure but you still made the right decision despite that." Madam Pomfrey said, surprised that the real boy under the two-faced pureblood was actually not an evil bastard. "I know. Bet you're wondering how I can be a marked Death Eater and mudblood hater and not actually be an evil immature bastard, huh?" Draco chuckled sadly. "As much talk as I am, I've never physically hurt another person. Never even had to kill or rape to get this damn brand. It was actually a punishment. Shame my father that he was forced to give up his only son to another man. Put him in a right state, too. But I never killed. Hell, I'm only even half assing this 'kill Dumbledore' hogwash to stop the cruciatus from coming through this brand. Fucking half-blood wanna be certainly has the power to back up his words, even if they're untrue."

"Anyway, so Millie follows me while Daph and Trace go and send Pansy off after her, but by then I had met up Francois. Millie saw the room I went in, and directed Pansy to me. Took her dumb ass forty-five minutes to find me." He chuckled at that. Pomfrey smiled at him. She could tell this was something positive for him in his incredibly negative life, and that he was physically feeling better after the potions. "So it was Francois's turn to do what he wanted. We made out a bit, the usual stuff. Then he told me he wanted to try something new. He tied me up and went over what he was going to do to me. It was so hot. I damn near came just from him talking about it, rubbing me a bit, not even actually touching my penis." Draco shivered and barely resisted playing with himself again, remembering that he was in the Hospital Wing.

"Here's where the apple thing comes in though. He wanted to gag me, told me to try and scream, but he didn't trust himself to maintain a transfiguration during orgasm-something that I should have remembered-so he pulls out this apple, and stuffs it in my mouth. So we were going at it for about twenty minutes when he flips me over and bores a hole in the apple, and just sticks himself right through. That was my third orgasm of the night. Just the sweetness and saltiness and well, right after we both came again, him in my mouth, and me on the floor, we heard Pansy coming down the hall. Francois, even though he never had to hide at Beaubatons, he took charge again. Whipped his wand out, hehe his magic wand," Draco broke in to laughter. Madam Pomfrey, despite her normally stern self, giggled a bit herself.

*** "So hehe... so he just starts cleaning everything up, and in about thirty seconds, I'm fully dressed, untied, the floor's clean, the desks are all straight, and he's just flat out disappeared. I assume he disillusioned himself. So I'm just standing there looking like a tornado just went through, leaning against the desk and Pansy comes through the door all 'Drakey-poo, where are youuuu' and I look at her and she's looking at me, and I'm looking at her, and finally she's like, 'What's up with the apple?'"

Draco's eyes went wide, and slowly moved up to his mouth showing Poppy what he had done. "I didn't even realize we had forgot about it. I had no idea what to do, so I just take a close my mouth and bite off this huge hunk of apple and now I've got a mouthful of apple and jizz I can't even swallow for fear of choking. I'm sitting there with her staring at me chewing for like three minutes and I finally get it all down and just say to her 'Eh, I like apples.'" Draco's Healer and only confidant broke out laughing.

Poppy was doubled over, with tears coming out of her eyes, trying to get herself under control. She kept repeating his line and laughing again. Draco was laughing, too, amused to see that she wasn't as strict as she often played. Eventually, she calmed enough to ask "What did she say?" "That's the best part, Madam Pomfrey, she... she asked for a bite!" Both burst into laughter again. Draco sputtered out: "She ate the whole damn thing!" and they laughed and laughed some more.

After a while, they had finally petered out and stopped setting each other off again. "So," Draco began, "After that, the rest of the year Francois and I used apples like that a lot of times, and I just started carrying them on me all the time. Not the used ones of course, but fresh ones from the kitchen. People found out obviously, so occasionally for the people like Crabbe and Goyle, and occasionally Pansy they'd ask for an apple and I'd have one. I'm surprised the Gryffs never picked up on it, but whatever. Sometimes, the rare minutes I left my room open, I told Pansy she could just come in and grab one and I wouldn't care."

"When Francois left, I was sad and all, but we met up again this summer, and I'd been using them to gag myself and masturbate without him, so when we met up, he showed me this really cool transfiguration. It's a ready made spell by some wizards in the West Coast of the United States, just cast it on whatever you want and it doesn't take too much concentration or power to maintain. Little enough that you can keep it going during orgasm. I'm sure it's obvious what it does. Took an image of his massive cock and with one spell I could turn whatever I want to into it and not worry about the magic failing. We used it a lot that week."

"So what happened this morning, well now that I think about it, it's actually kind of humorous. It was just a series of unfortunate events really, entirely my fault. I had used the apple that morning and was just done and was about to pull it out, when Pansy sticks her dumb ass head in and is just like 'Accio Apple'. 'Woosh' just like that, the dumb bitch summoned it right up to where it is now, and of course it scared me so much, and pulled me out from under the covers and I flopped naked right onto the floor in front of her. I lost control of the transfiguration, and all of a sudden I have a whole damn round apple shoved up my bumhole staring up at my betrothed. She had no idea how she possibly could have done any of that, so I just yelled up at her "You dumb bitch what did you do?!" and she ran away. And that's how you found me."

Poppy was shaking with silent laughter, barely was able to speak. "I'm so sorry this happened to you Draco, but will you be offended at all if I retell that anonymously to some people."

Draco shook his head yes. "Yeah, as I said, it's pretty funny now that I think back on it. A bit painful, but if it happened to someone else, I certainly would laugh, so go ahead. I think I'm ready for you to get it out, by the way."

Pomfrey smiled widely and held up a gloved hand, in which a shrunken, gross looking apple sat. "Got out a bit ago, Hon, but you just looked so happy talking about everything, I couldn't interrupt you. I said I thought I'd have a solution for you and I do. I have a book of similar spells to that which your friend used, and I think they'll do you wonders. I also want you to know that not only am I here for you, but truthfully you are not a bad kid, and if you want to stop playing the bad guy, we're here for you. Hell, Harry himself is quite an understanding guy, I think if you told him exactly what you told me tonight, and allowed me to confirm it, you two might be friends. As far as I'm aware he only has eyes for Hermione, so you probably wouldn't be that kind of friend, but he really is an understanding guy, just like you, and certainly no homophobe."

Draco rolled up to a sitting position, still getting feeling to his tender nether regions. "Thank you, Madam Pomfrey. You've been such a help tonight, I truly will consider doing exactly that."
