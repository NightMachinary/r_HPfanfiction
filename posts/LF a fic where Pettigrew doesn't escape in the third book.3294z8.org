It doesn't have to be exactly that, but anything where Sirius would be free after the third book would be nice.

#+begin_quote
  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  If he's lucky, the freak will be killed in a back alley somewhere. Vernon signs Harry's permission slip for Hogsmeade trips in exchange for Harry leaving Privet Drive for the rest of the summer. Understandably, stuff happens. oneshot, complete, don't own.

*** I loved Rune Master, but am I the only one who found Getting Away really confusing towards the end?

**** I went and read it again, but I didn't find it confusing. Or if I haven't properly understood it, I haven't noticed. How confusing is it for you?

***** mostly the end where Sirius is at the train station changing from dog to human and no one notices a person changing, and then Harry curling up with Remus after knowing who he is for a minute, and Remus pretending to be asleep while Siriud is there, who he thinks is a killer, and then presumably just accepting that he's not without waking up to confront him or hug him or anything.... Either that or he completely missed sirius too and then just accepts a boy who should have no idea who he is cuddling him.

  Sirius was in his disguise when he went with Harry to the station, helped him load his trunk
#+end_quote

A dog wouldn't be able to help load a trunk, so I assumed this meant he was in a normal human disguise with wigs and beards.

Remus' lack of action is confusing, now that you point it out. He could be half-asleep? But that won't work with him answering to Harry and calling him "pup"... yes it has become confusing for me too. Thank you for opening my eyes!

******* Oh, I must have missed that line! I know Sirius disguised himself with hair dye, but I thought he came to the station as a dog and then came back. And I don't know what was up with Remus, but I'm glad I'm not the only one!

** This is a difficult request simply because of the logistics involved. Pettigrew is crucial to the return of Voldemort, so most fics that are canon enough to include Pettigrew at all are going to leave him free to resurrect Voldemort.

*** Well it's an interesting what-if- it might lead to several more years before Voldermort rises again, meaning Harry faces him more powerful and experienced as an adult auror.

*** You would need to think about how Voldemort returns if Peter is caught, but it isn't impossible. Even if you need to stick to canon events, anyone that would willingly give a limb for their Lord and fool Bertha Jorkins could do exactly what Pettigrew did.
