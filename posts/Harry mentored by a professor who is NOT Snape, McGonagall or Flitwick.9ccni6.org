There are plenty of stories where a professor like Snape, McGonagall or Flitwick decided to mentor Harry and most follow the same plotlines from there on (Slytherin Harry, Goblin friend and so on).

But how do you think would the plot be changed if any of the other Professors (eg. Sprout, Sinistra, Babbling) took Harry under their wing? I am well aware that most stations of canon would happen either way since Harry having an adult friend wouldn't make the Ministry cancel the TWT or lead to a second year Horcrux hunt, but there ought to be changes, right?

Rune Stone path was an interesting story in that regard. Shiva (Babbling) was a good character because she was far from omnipotent and yet an interesting stand-in mother character who was sometimes overwhelmed by the situation (like when she had to gave Harry the talk), but the story had issues.

Of course, if anyone actually knows stories with that premise feel free to share them below.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!

linkffn(Unspeakable Things; Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly; When in Doubt Obliviate; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): two words: Gilderoy Lockhart.

*** I'm a third of the way through amalgam - lockharts folly, I have to say wow! The Ron bashing and the Dumbledore bashing is just so over the top awful and painful to read. I don't think theres a chapter where the author doesn't mention how stupid Ron apparently is, or how the fic "subtlety" points out Dumbledore's /evil/ plots and manipulations. Now I'm reading about this whole thing about Dumbledore's need for "a plan to separate the Potter heir from the mud-blood Granger Witch" not to mention how the author keeps calling Voldemort 'Voldewhore'. Some of the plot points were interesting but the characters have been dumbed down immensely like how lockhart swindled malfoys money with a scam. And that almost everytime lockhart introduced himself in almost every scene he *has* to say "I, Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award, Hogwarts' beloved Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor, and adventurer extraordinaire"

Though I have to say, no other story has quite resonated with me in such a spiritual and philosophical manner like the quote "Harry wondered at times who was the greater Dark Lord, Voldewhore or Dumbledore?"

This can't be crack, its just a blatant character assassination of the people the author doesn't like.

  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.
