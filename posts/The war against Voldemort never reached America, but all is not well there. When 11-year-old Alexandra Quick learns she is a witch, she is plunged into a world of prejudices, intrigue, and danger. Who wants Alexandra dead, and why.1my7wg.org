** This really is one of my favorite fic series - it's complete through Alexandra's fourth year. Inverarity, the author, completes the whole book and edits it thoroughly before posting, so we're in a hiatus before book 5, but it's coming.

Also, Inverarity's other fanwork, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]], may be the best continuation fic I've read in a while.

**** On his way to his first year at Hogwarts, Teddy Lupin meets three other firsties on the express: Cedric Diggory's +replacement sibling+ little brother, Cho Chang's smothered little brother, and Pansy Parkinson's very proud, illegitimate daughter. They make a pact to stay friends regardless of what houses they end up in. But house rivalries didn't die with Voldemort, and this proves harder than they expect -- especially with the threat of a new Goblin war flaring up.

** Whenever someone asks for...

- professional writing\\
- something better than canon\\
- magic in America\\
- a non-Mary Sue girl main character\\
- adults who aren't all carrying the 'Idiot-ball (tm)'\\

...this is the series that comes to mind.

**** When otherwise competent and effective leaders of your local government, premier school or police force make decisions that make the audience wonder why they're paid, they're being cursed by [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][the idiot ball]].

Many fanfiction stories operate on the assumption that if Harry were to 'wake up' (possibly due to having his chakras unblocked by introducing him to the merits of sex with a hot witch or wizard), he should be able to outsmart Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Voldemort and any of their allies. The writer then makes certain to prove it, by having said authority figures fall for any half-assed demonstration of Harry's newfound cunning.

To be fair, some authority figures actually appear to be that dumb- Minister Fudge, Sybill Trelawney and Gilderoy Lockhart come to mind. However, for these canon instances, JKR is careful to show how they had stumbled or schemed into their positions of power.

***** Inverarity writes a bit about how he approached that issue [[http://inverarity.livejournal.com/216821.html][in this post]]

#+begin_quote
  ...while the Freeze-Frame Spell was a solution to a plot difficulty, plain and simple: how do all these kids (and Alexandra in particular) sneak around Charmbridge at all hours when I have established that there are magic portraits all over the place reporting on errant students? This problem is one that plagued me throughout the first four books --- I've made surveillance at Charmbridge much heavier than at Hogwarts, befitting a more surveillance-heavy American culture. Every story with kids running around having adventures has to address the problem of grown-ups: where are they and why aren't they interfering? I'm not sure I have made all of the things Alexandra's gotten away with believable, since the more she gets away with, the more inept the supposedly-competent Dean Grimm looks, but that Pictogel spell was certainly damn useful for plot purposes.

** Just finished the first one, and agree, these are amazing. This is my first foray into non-canon characters (other than the occasional OC/MS thrown in other fanfic) and the writer is incredibly talented. The main character is sometimes almost too obnoxious...but I have a feeling that she's making a point to counter how annoying Harry was in his passivity with what is actually a pretty accurate portrayal of a gifted pre-teen.
