  What sense does it have except to increase the pity-level by 100%?
#+end_quote

While I generally agree, I think the main idea is pretty simple.

1. Writing a fic where Harry's abuse plays a larger role.
2. Canon Harry has some issues, but generally turned out fine, despite his abuse.
3. The "natural" solution is to increase the abuse level, so that Harry develops more issues.
4. These additional issues allow for more character development with Harry and more angst between characters (supposedly).

I don't really agree with any of that, but that's probably the logic.

***** And not even that, the amount of abuse depicted in canon is more than enough to write chapters upon chapters of angst if Harry's reaction to said abuse was more realistic. While there might be reasoning behind increasing the abuse, it isn't actually necessary.

******* There's some stuff out there */way/* more disturbing than the abuse fests. There's one fic (can't remember the name) that used to be slightly infamous since it was about Harry and Luna practicing their love of pedophilia together (yes, you read that correctly).

********* The fics themselves may not be legal, but it may be a matter of enforcement. If the server where the fic is hosted is in another country (let's assume one where the fic would be legal, for whatever reason) then there isn't much your country can do. It may also be difficult to track down the owner of an anonymous account, if the author isn't an idiot. Finally, it may just be a matter of resources. All the anti-pedo officers, so to speak, are busy with more important/prominent things. This is all speculation, though.

** The two worst I can remember offhand as far as what was done to Harry by the Dursleys are linkffn(Catechism) and linkffn(Hundred Acre Wood). Both of them were pretty fucked up.

** If you venture into the whump category of HPfanfic (Like Hurt/Comfort, but all Hurt and zero Comfort), you'll see fics where Vernon and Dudley perform sexual crimes against Harry, while Petunia turns a blind eye.

One of the most infuriating portrayal of the Dursleys outside of a H/C fic was "Hit the Ground Running" by Tozette. 11 year old Harry comes home from Hogwarts, and the Dursleys expect him to make a 5-course dinner with a roast and fixings in less than an hour. Then they beat him and shove him in the cupboard when he obviously can't perform the task. I'm kind of toughened against exaggerated child abuse in HPfanfic, but that fic was well-written enough to stick a knife in me and make it stay.

** I think the worst is where one author had Vernon as a pedophile and raped HP in a cellar instead of throwing him in the cupboard like canon.

Then, I've read one where the Dursleys try to exorcise HP when he's 5 and brand him with a cross. They hire a priest from a church to do this one.

Also, the standard ones where HP performs magic and gets the stuffing beaten out of him with a cricket bat and frying pans. These ones are more common.

** I once read a fic where Vernon started selling Harry's organs on the black market and by the time the magical world got to him magic was the only thing keeping him alive and he had to spend time in St Mungo's getting his organs regrown.

In another, Vernon used a hot poker from the fire to burn/poke out Harry's eyes.

I don't remember which fics, it has been about 5 or 6 years since I read them and I don't care to go looking for them again.

** these are both dark fem!Harry

In linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/1/The-Silent-World-of-Cassandra-Evans]]) they have her vocal cords removed.

In Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path]]) they attach a car battery to her and drop her into a tub full of ice water. (the reason we know this is she describes the crutasis this way)

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
