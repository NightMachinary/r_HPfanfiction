Looking for fics where the battle in the Department of Mysteries differs in some way. Such as Harry bringing more DA members to the fight, Voldemort and Harry have a duel similar to the one in GOF, a student (s) gets killed in the battle, the crew figure out about Voldemort' s use of Sirius to lure Harry and come up with a different strategy, etc.


** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the spygirl) Hermione becomes badass and kills everyone in the Department of Mysteries battle.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

***** I think this fic is better than Spygirl'. Although very satisfying to read, Voldemort and Death Eaters were kind too weak in that one.

Voldemort in this one is truly a force to be reckoned with.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Future's Past)

Shit ton of bashing for Ginny, Ron, and maybe Dumbledore (haven't read it in a long time). Harry & Hermione travel back in time, and when the moment comes for the battle, they kill all of the Death Eaters in a trap, I believe.

  Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
