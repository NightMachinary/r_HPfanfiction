Lyrics:

All embrace me\\
It's my time to rule at last\\
Fifteen years have I been waiting\\
To sit upon my throne\\
No allegiance\\
I will swear no oath\\
Crowned by god not by the church\\
As my power is divine\\
They thought I was too young to rule the land\\
Just as they failed to understand\\
Born to rule\\
My time has come\\
I was chosen by heaven\\
Say my name when you pray\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
With the lord my protector\\
Make them bow to my will\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
Proved in battle\\
Led my men to victory\\
No man alive or dead commands me\\
I answer to the lord\\
Hear my orders\\
Question me and die\\
What I say was said in heaven\\
And so it shall be done\\
I know I was destined to rule alone\\
All for myself I have claimed the throne\\
Born to rule\\
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven\\
Say my name when you pray\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
With the lord my protector\\
Make them bow to my will\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
Fram책t Karoliner\\
Fiendens dom 채r h채r\\
L책t oss krossa dom\\
Kasta in dom genom helvetets portar\\
All that's thine\\
Shall be mine\\
There's no stopping me\\
All over Europe my rule shall be questioned by none\\
All I see\\
Give to me\\
That is my decree\\
My will be done\\
They thought I was too young to rule the land\\
Just as they failed to understand\\
Born to rule\\
My time is now\\
I was chosen by heaven\\
Say my name when you pray\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
To the skies\\
With the lord my protector\\
Make them bow to my will\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise\\
To the skies\\
See Carolus rise


** The assault happened not long after Harry was appointed. It was a heavy attack coordinated by France, Bulgaria and Greece. It was all a chess game on a large scale. Lord Voldemort had set it up since his attack upon the Elder Potters. His death would lull the magical world into a false sense of security, and he would build forces upon other country's for a larger war. His plans were written over months and covered nearly every outcome except one, a prophecy. He was not one to believe in magics such as fate, but it had been proven a mistake to write off branches of magic, so he had to act quickly.

At the age of fifteen, Harry Potter was appointed the ruler of Britain, their savior role was much smaller than his current role. People didn't just believe he was powerful, but in this role, he could raise taxes, deal with national disputes, and organize the army. It was one of the toughest things, but he knew how. Being the leader of Dumbledore's Army had helped but he was not ready for the assault upon them from the Triple alliance from the nations. His thoughts wondered on what would happen if he had armed the with firearms as he stared at the massive wave of spells slamming into their forces. Their groups had consisted of low ranking wizards to assault, believing that he was a weak king simply because he was you, to young to rule his lands, but they failed to understand that he was trained to rule, and his time had come. He lead the Battalion of British wizards against the forces, showing the power of Britain, why their school was the best. The spells slammed into their tightly packed ranks, blowing them away in swaths as they thought that he would not know basics of strategy. It was one of the strongest displays of Wizardry might, of tactics.

Harry had led his men to victory. No man Alive could best Britain, whilst under his rule, he thought as he had already led assaults upon Bulgaria and Greece, easily taking the countries. Others had joined in upon the effort to crush Britain, but all had failed, all that was theirs became Britain's, as nothing could stop them. All over Europe, King Harry Potter's rule was excepted and questioned by None. His march upon France was the most successful he had ever enacted upon. He had led a force himself upon France, the largest combatant within the war, the place where he knew that Voldemort had fled to. A place that he Publicly allied with, for they had grown desperate for help against Britain. Harry had grown to Confident with his power, especially since he had bested a force larger that his. His confidence was soon shattered after he had marched far into France, where he was confronted with a force Thrice his size. It was chock full of veterans from other conflicts and wars, not to mention the Death Eaters used for reinforcements. It was the bloodiest conflict he had ever faced as well as the worst loss he had ever had. It had forced him into a hasty retreat, and was like the catalyst for his end. They had forced him back, and without supervision, other British forces were forced into a crushing defeat by opposing forces and within a month, had reduced Britain's Army to one tenth of it's size. He had tried a simple act of desperation, a single hope of power, a siege of a key location, but all British forces scattered when their king fell from an unseen spell. Weather it had been by Friend or Foe, that was unknown, but what was known, was that Britain had fallen soon after their king Had. They were not prepared for forces to swarm their empire, much less their kings unexpected death.

** There are many Sabaton Songs which would be great for the Death Eater PoV: Poltava, We burn, Rise of Evil, The Final Solution and so on

But not that many which would make a decent theme for Harry, unless you make him the White Death or similar.

** I use a lot of song inspiration in my fics, though the only Sabaton one I've used as a backdrop is Attero Dominatus to set up the Dumbledore vs Grindelwald duel
