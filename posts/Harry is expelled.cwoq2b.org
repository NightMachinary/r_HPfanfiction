*** Just want to point out to OP that the Arithmancerverse is Hermione-centric and she's by far the most important character, though Harry does feature quite a bit. It's quite slow burn intially and has over 1.3 million words over its 3 parts, so getting into it can be quite a commitment.

Also just want to say that this my favourite fic ever. Nothing else comes close.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

** Cold Blood linkffn(5786099)

Umbridge becomes Minister and gets rid of Harry.

Overall fairly minor though. Harry had become good friends with Viktor Krum and spent a good portion of the summer with him. With Britain going through a 'Hate on Harry' phase, the Bulargian Ministry was eager to scoop up Harry and his unique talents.

*** What are his "unique talents?" I'll give you that he's probably more powerful on average(his use of the Patronus in POA showing as such), and maybe his Parseltongue abilities might be unique(although I doubt that only the Slytherin line had such magic), but aside from a minor magical language, what possible unique talents could he have?

**** Through a combination of basilisk venom, pheonix tears and Hungarian Horntail bone - Harry is transformed into a dragon creature. The Bulgarians have seen this before and call them Draculae, they used to be an elite nobilty that formed their branch of Aurors until the line died out. They want them back.
