Harry tells McGonagall about the stone? McGonagall believes him, and tells Dumbledore and they do something about it.

Dumbledore fights against the corrupt Ministry, Or Dumbledore destroys the Horcruxes in the background, or tells Harry about the prophecy sooner then in canon or a number of other things. (They can be different things then I listed).

Just anything. Harry can do things and be the main character, but I'd like competent adults doing stuff behind scenes or in front of scenes or whatever.

No OP Harry or Super Intelligent Harry. Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be a pairing).

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine, can have any warnings and can be on any site.

No Weasley bashing.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** While perhaps not this fic's precise intention when starting out, it very much becomes this. For Snape as well as for other professors and adults. Also has a sequel currently in Harry's 2nd year.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

** There is Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

There is also another one where serious breaks a compulsion spell for him to go away to an island. He instead stays and takes care of Harry, but I can't remember which one that is.

Edit: Ah that would be linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool)

Also I can't garuntee anything about Weasley bashing. I don't screen for that and don't particularly remember
