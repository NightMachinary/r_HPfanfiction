Golden Trio, Tom Riddle, Death Eaters,...

Thank you!


** Linkffn(Lesser Evils): Harry, among others, are noticeably more jaded and brittle. The author took quite a bit of inspiration from PotDK.

Linkffn(The Sum of their Parts): arguably the protagonists are better than the government, but like everything its just a bunch of shades of gray here. But nobody is really "good" per se.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): you ever watch the old James Bond films? Harry is kind of like one of the villains from there being whacko and immoral but also extremely intelligent. You learn how as you go. Technically Hermione is the protagonist, but the story is really about what happened to Harry in the past.

Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): Harry time-travels into the past, with the intent to speedrun and slaughter/maim/destroy his way to victory.

Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): Harry, as a result of his life-style at the new Hogwarts, really only cares about being the best and victory.

Linkffn(The Lies That Bind): the beginning of this fic start out canon-ish, and is sweet and sacharine, but takes a massive heel turn pretty quickly, and can get downright brutal by the end. Enjoy for revenge junkies.

Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): pretty hard not to say make that judgement about Harry in here too, though one can somewhat understand the why of him being so vicious and arrogant. Has two sequels.

** linkffn(Circular Reasoning) it features a fairly dark/immoral/apathetic Harry. Very well written.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) my personal favorite OP!Harry fic, though he has /slightly/ more morals than the other works I'm recommending. After dying at the Battle of Hogwarts, he makes a bargain with demons to bring him back in time more powerful than in the past. In exchange he has voices in his head that encourage wanton violence and destruction. Sadly unfinished, but totally worth it.

linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) Features the most Evil!Harry I've ever come across. Canon!Harry and Grey!Harry, with friends, find themselves in an alternate world ruled by Voldemort, with Evil!Harry has his second in command. Grey!Harry comes from the author's brilliant short fic linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) and Evil!Harry comes from the author's Downward Spiral Saga, which I never read so I didn't link here, though perhaps you'd like that as well. Echoes in the Fog is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it.
