** R/Hr just strikes me as an immature relationship, primarily because of poor writing. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of passion behind it: there's a lot of vitriol and sexual tension behind their interactions, but JKR never once came close to selling me on this being anything but a temporary fling for the two. To me, they screamed "summer romance" over "one true love" and I thought they'd have eventually settled with other people but remained strong friends. And no, "other people" does /not/ mean Hermione would have shacked up with Harry: I still hold that the canon trio would have all been better off as just friends.

Much of this opinion has to do with my /other/ opinion that Jo is to romance writing as Uwe Boll is to directing; she can spin a great detective yarn but the second romance enters the picture, the writing gets proper sluggish like. Perhaps, had someone more adept at writing romance been writing the series, I would be able to buy the relationship a little bit more than I do now (though I also probably wouldn't like the series as much as I do if it were the case). A lot of people probably disagree, but that's my two cents.

I definitely agree with this, it would have been better if they stayed platonic and had Ron and Hermione find someone else.

Off topic: I also would have had Harry in a relationship with someone other than Ginny mainly because I don't like the whole 'one big happy weasley family' vibe the epilogue gives.

*** Your opinion is closest to my own- there was certainly something to the pairing, intense feelings and an equal amount of pigheadedness, but they just never seemed a long haul kind of couple. And as far as Harry and Hermione goes, that i just never saw. The three just work so well and balanced ad just friends and a relationship thrown in there would completely change that. In fact I think the three of them would have a hard time staying friends if they weren't all three friends, if that makes any sense at all!

**** Sure, it exists, but the reason you don't see it much in real life is because it's all flash and fireworks, and not really the basis for a long-term romance. In real-life, it usually serves as the basis for a passionate but short-term affair that generally lasts between a couple of weeks and a couple of months once the honeymoon period is over. There are exceptions, of course, but JKR never sold me on Ron and Hermione being one of those exceptions.

** Short answer: They balance each other out and act like Harry's parents.

Long answer: What I like about their relationship is that their personalities work together well in several ways, but at the same time, it has enough flaws to make it feel like a real relationship. Instead of the average, perfect together in every way fictional relationship that is nothing like the real world.

I see more and more people say that they don't work because Ron doesn't match her intelligence, but I'd argue that they work better because they have different kinds of intelligence. Hermione's academically intelligent, while Ron knows people better. It makes for a good combination to me.

Also, Ron would sooner stick his hand inside the arse of a rhino made out of buzzsaws than use it to beat Hermione, so stop that crap.

** What I really love in Cursed Child, it convinced me for Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny. They have this balanced, loving relationship for each other. (But I really need to re-read books, I wonder how my oppinion will change through my years and experience). For the both pairings, it's marriage goal for me.

At first, Ron needed to be Something Special, to be at least as good as his brothers, and often envied Harry for his 'fame'. But he grows, is more mature. I love that he stopped to be an Auror prefering family (help his brother, and this way he was rasing kids, leaving Hermione more time and strength for her own carriere). They're different, and that's what makes them good. I think also it's Ron who is more open and 'warm' which made Hermione (and Harry) stick to him (and to each other).

Ron might be not perfect, but neither is Hermione. I mean, people always say 'he's not good for her', but... I-know-the-best attitude didn't gain her friends at Hogwarts (and I think in her old school she was also lonely). She is brilliant, yes, but if you don't know her good, it comes as arrogance and noone wants to be friends with such person.

** Personally I think that Ron and Harry had the clearest chance at romance, but since JKR wants to make sure that all the MC's breed a next generation, she put Harry with Ginny as though we wouldn't notice.

Hermione I see as being the cool single aunt who travels the world as a scholar for her own needs. She didn't need to have babies to be an interesting character and I am personally offended in the whole "if Ron and Hermione hadn't married, she would have turned into Snape 2.0 and been a bitter old crone" thing from Cursed Child.

**** I'm merely talking about how utterly devoted Ron is to Harry. Even if they fight, the way they relate to one another is far more like how I'd see someone in a longterm relationship act. Ron will always protect Harry and vice versa.

Also, there are several parts in the HP stories where it's pretty obvious that Harry (at least) is probably bisexual, he just doesn't necessarily act on his interests (he goes into pretty good detail in noticing how attractive several of the male characters are, which is good enough for me). I don't know about Ron, (as far as the sexuality part/attraction part) but he literally tried to jump in front of Harry and told Sirius Black that he would have to KILL HIM to get to Harry...and that's after his leg got seriously mangled.

There are a number of things that Ron does that set off the "OMFG HE LOVES HARRY LIKE A SOULMATE" bells in my head. Now, I'm not a big fan of slash and reading about dudes fucking each other, but I think that they would have been good for each other, regardless.

** I hate when people say they that they can't be together because they have nothing in common, or that they in general wouldn't work.

When I read the Harry Potter books the first thing I thought about Hermione and Ron's characters was that they act exactly like my parents. Not in the way their relationship works but individually, personality-wise. It's actually made reading a bit odd at times cause I could predict sometimes how Ron or Hermione were going to behave. (Obviously my parents are much more mature and everything, but you get the idea). My mum and dad have been happily married for over twenty years.

On a different note I would like to point out that Ron and Hermione just fit together. The way they interact with each other just make them seem like each other's love interest from the very beginning. It was always obvious to me from the start that they would be a couple, I didn't even consider it ending differently.

Also, many people are no doubt going to be commenting that Harry should have been with Hermione. Harry was miserable with Hermione when he was arguing with Ron.

Ultimately, `shipping has nothing to do with the characters and everything to do with the readers' trope preferences. If you like Will They Or Won't They, then R/Hr probably appeals to you.

While he was capable of being a very good friend at times, I think Ron had far too many unresolved issues with jealousy and feelings of inadequacy to work out before he'd be able to be romantically involved with anyone. Hermione certainly wasn't perfect either, with her occasionally ruthless nature and outright hypocrisy potentially gumming up the works of a relationship.

JKR is wonderful thriller/mystery writer. Book 2 is perfect example. But can't say the same about her romance. I'd say she failed to give the pair as a 'couple' less screen time which sometimes lead us to think they are destined to doom.

*** But the troll incident /did/ happen, so that's what we have to go with, instead of speculating about what ifs. Harry wouldn't have been friends with Hermione without the troll incident either; I think he disliked her almost as much as Ron did at that point. The troll incident is supposed to show how adversity can change people's attitude towards each other and even cause very different people to form close friendships.

*** I think that's a major part of what hangs me up about Ron/hermione- she seems the type to have wanted to go on studying for years. I don't know what the wizarding world equivalent would be, bit someone who would want to go on to be a PhD and be very academically involved, while i can perfectly see Ron where he ends up- helping George out in the joke shop.

** There's nothing inherently wrong with the pairing in itself. Some people see this great romance building up through the series. I see two immature teenagers that don't know how to communicate, and fight more than get along. Nothing in the series speaks to me past jealousy, and wish fulfillment personally. I like Hermione, and I'm not very fond of Ron. He has his moments, but he's not someone I would get along with in real life, so reading about him is annoying to me. And if I was to be sold on them being a romance to last, Ron would have learned from his past mistakes and not been such a bloody prat in the last book.

TL;DR Ron is annoying and I don't think they would be able to communicate properly. They might have some fun screwing but I imagine it being a big blowout with hurt feelings in real life.

** Ron did/does not deserve Hermione. Time and time again he has proven to be an emotionally shallow and selfish idividual, poking fun at Hermione and reusing to acknowledge her as a woman until all other options to him have been removed(literally living in the woods with her and Harry). Everything in the last book pointed towards Harry and Hermione falling for each other but because they needed that happy ever after for everybody we got Harry with Ginny and Ron with Hermione.

“They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder's Map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's name in the girls' dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was all right.”

Excerpt From: J.K. Rowling. “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” iBooks. [[https://itun.es/us/70L09.l]] .....

“They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by Ron's departure.”

--------------

If we are only going by the Books, I absolutely don't see Harry and Hermione falling for each other. After Ron left, Harry was drooling over his Ginny's dot on the Marauder Map for hours, while Hermione was using Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait for company. How more awkward could things get between the two?

Despite the fact that Ron and Hermione spend a lot of time together we've almost nothing to go by how they interact without Harry or how happy they are. Because you know the books are almost exclusively told from Harry's PoV. A limitation of the book series and the pairing IMO.

Having said that:

*** Not sure why your honest opinion is getting downvotes, but I agree that Hermione at least wouldn't last in a relationship with Ron past the war.

One kiss in the heat of battle doesn't make a relationship - and we learned that when things get tough, Ron walks out. I don't care that he came back in the end - he abandoned his friends. I'm not a Harry/Hermione shipper, but that would make a tiny bit more sense to me. She and Ron are polar opposites that have completely different life goals and temperaments - fine for an "opposites attract" fling, but they are so deeply different that they wouldn't last long. I agree that Harry was the glue that kept Ron and Hermione as friends.

** I feel like Hermione needs someone who impresses her in some way. She could handle being more intelligent and generally more capable, but she wants the other person to be on her level or higher for at least some small part of their life.

Hermione/George can at least get off the ground because George has his entrepreneurial spirit and facility with potions.

Hermione/canon!Ron doesn't work because Ron doesn't stand out that way. He's intended to be the heart of the group, I think, but while that's a good foundation for a friendship, it's not so great for rousing that initial interest in dating.

Hermione/Neville works because Hermione left the school for half a year, came back, and suddenly Neville was hot and badass and in charge of the resistance. Plus he's the paragon of skill in Herbology.

The other thing about Ron is that it doesn't often look like he respects Hermione. Hermione should demand a partner who respects her. That's why I don't tend to like Luna/Hermione -- I don't think Hermione properly respects Luna.

In order to make Hermione/Ron work, you want to make Ron competent in something that Hermione might care about. Chess doesn't do it. Nor does Quidditch. You need to make him treat Hermione as well as you'd want a friend to treat you.
