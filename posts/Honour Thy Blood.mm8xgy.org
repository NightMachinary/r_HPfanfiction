is there any fics like honor thy blood? i want some more that are good quality and have a similar version of harry, one that trains to become voldemort's equal and takes a darker more realistic look on what war really is.


** Linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

I'll warn you though, that in this fic it takes Harry longer than a month or two to become OP!, and doesn't use any tropes like the Black library or goblin inheritances.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him. The sequel, Wrath and Remorse, is published on this site.

*** It's a nice story... A lot of things happening all over the place, gave me anxiety. But after reaching chapter 25-26, I don't think I can continue anymore. Don't wanna spoil for others but a lot of character death made me so sad. A good story but not for me.

As someone who liked Honor thy blood, I don't think this is like that. At least not to me but I stopped at ch 26.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12317784/1/Stepping-Back][Stepping Back]] which is coincidentally by the same author is something along the lines of Honor Thy Blood. An amazing Time Travel fic with a Bellatrix/Harry pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/11649002/JustBored21][JustBored21]] is an amazing author when it comes to OP/God-like Harry fictions where Harry trains /before/ he comes to Hogwarts. Usually based on a Haphne pairing or Hinny and comes with a lot of Dumbledore, Hermione, and Selective Weasley Bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13319565/1/Harry-Black-Book-1-The-Hero-s-Return][Harry Black: Book 1]] is a raised by Sirius fanfiction where Harry trains and joins Hogwarts late. It has a Haphne pairing as well and features the amazing minor character of Michael Corner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11002763/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Magic-of-Life][Harry Potter and the Magic of Life]] also falls under these lines, though Harry is less trained and instead is taken on a curse-breaking expedition with Bill Weasley. This again has a Haphne pairing. It is complete and has a sequel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix][Blood of the Phoenix]] is an amazing book featuring Harry paired with an OC. Happens after Goblet of Fire over the summer, where Harry meets a 'phoenix' and finds more about his life than he ever could. There is teen pregnancy and a slight older/younger relationship but don't discount that.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  A remastered version of the original. Literary and Grammar errors fixed, making the story much more palatable. Rated M for a reason. No slash, HP/DG pairing with an independent Harry. See original for description.
