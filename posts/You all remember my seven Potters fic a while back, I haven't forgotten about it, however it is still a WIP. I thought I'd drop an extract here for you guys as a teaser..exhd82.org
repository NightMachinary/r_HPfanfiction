#+TITLE: You all remember my seven Potters fic a while back, I haven't forgotten about it, however it is still a WIP. I thought I'd drop an extract here for you guys as a teaser.

** I saw this, and had to go find your original post and read that then come back to say I love this idea!! I'm certain that if you're writing stays similar to this piece, it'll be great. Very much looking forward to when you release it!

** This may come as a shock to you, but not everybody is intimately familiar with everything you post. You may want to consider including a link to your fic.

**** Some scrolling and Ctrl+Fing did not reveal it, and I frankly do not care enough to keep looking. If you want people to be able to find things, it's on /you/ to provide that resource to them- you can't just say "Oh it's in my post history somewhere" and expect them to comb through hundreds of posts and comments.
