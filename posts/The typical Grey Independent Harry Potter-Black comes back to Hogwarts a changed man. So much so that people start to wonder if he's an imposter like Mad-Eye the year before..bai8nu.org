** Dumbledore stood anxiously at his desk, awaiting Harry's arrival. He was gazing at his dead hand, while lost in thought. Ever since the boy came back to Hogwarts this September, he has been different. At first, Albus thought the boy was simply depressed because of his godfather's death. It was a relief to him seeing Miss Granger and Mister Weasley being so supportive of their friend. He knew all to well how easy it was to fall into the well of sorrow and regrets after the death of a loved one. Especially when it was all too easy to blame yourself for that death occurring in the first place. But as weeks passed, it became clear that Harry Potter was not depressed. He was angry, cold, even arrogant at certain times, but he showed no sign of a young man in danger of falling into depression. That was when Albus asked Severus to take a peek into the boy's mind during their DADA class. He expected to see some kind of contrived teenager logic in which he considered himself responsible for Sirius's death and now tried to improve himself as much as he could. Albus thought that he will hear these things, even more so, he hoped he will hear these things. Merlin knew the boy needed to start preparing for his inevitable showdown with Voldemort. What Albus Dumbledore surely did not expect to hear however, was a frantic Miss Granger barging into his office, screaming that Professor Snape needs help. Apparently, Severus simply collapsed in the middle of the class, with no prior warning! In his haste towards the DADA classroom, Albus expected to find many things. Finding Severus Snape turned into a vegetable, however, was not one of those things. A few hours later, the healers from St Mungo's said the man might as well have been kissed by a Dementor, as he was now in the same situation as the Longbottoms were. His mind has been torn to shreds and there was nothing that could be done.

A treacherous part of Albus' mind kept telling him that Harry was responsible for this, but he always banished that thought as quickly as he could. Voldemort must have discovered that Severus was a spy and destroyed him through the Dark Mark. Yes, that was it. As October neared its end, Albus summoned Harry to his office, intending to start the boy's lessons. He kept the small bottle between his fingers, eyeing it with great concern. It depicted the Gaunts, and Voldemort's mother. It was imperative that Harry view the memories he selected, as they would serve him as a trail in his future search of the Horcruxes. He sensed his heart clench when he thought about those foul things. Much as he searched for rituals and spells to remove the Horcrux from Harry, he found nothing. The boy had to die. A knock on his door pulled him from his thoughts, and he muttered an /enter/ in a much more resigned tone than he had intended. The boy entered without saying a word, and just stood there looking at him with obvious curiosity. But perhaps, young man was a much better description for the one who stood before him now. The once shy, thin boy with unruly hair that once was Harry Potter appeared to be a different person than the one who stood there today. Harry was a bit taller, slightly more muscular, and his hair was now cut much shorter, in a modern Muggle haircut.

"Harry, my boy! Glad you could be here tonight!"

Dumbledore rose from his desk, nearing his Pensieve and detailing his plan to show Harry Tom Riddle's memories. He poured the first one into the memory viewing device, and once he finished, he turned his gaze on Harry, which suddenly took a much more tense position. From his eyes, Albus could clearly tell he was angry and disappointed.

"Is that all we will be doing?" Harry asked, his ire sleeping into his speech. "Look at Voldemort's diaper days? How long will we be doing this?"

Albus was puzzled.

"Throughout the remained of the year, we will..."

Harry snorted and looked increasingly annoyed.

"Tom Marvolo Riddle, son of Merope Gaunt, daughter of a fallen Pureblood House, descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Daddy was a rich Muggle that got drugged and cast away the mad bitch the moment she stopped pouring love potion in his evening tea. She dies shortly after giving birth to Voldemort, and he ends up in an orphanage where he is bullied on a daily basis."

Albus stood there in absolute shock, not even knowing how to reply. After a few minutes of tense silence, he started whispering.

"Harry, there is more to this than..."

"The cup, the locket and the diary are Horcruxes, he cant die until those are destroyed. There are more however, he wanted to make six."

Dumbledore felt his knees abandoning him, and he collapsed on the floor, suddenly feeling his old age in every bone of his body. So many questions flew in his mind that he did not even know what to ask. He simply stood there, holding Harry's cold gaze.

"How..." he finally managed before Harry cut him off again.

"You know, Saint Brian, all this crap was pretty easy to uncover once I hired a competent detective. I just gave him Riddle's name, and lo and behold, I had a thick file on the little bugger a couple months later. I also know I was a Horcrux myself."

Albus suddenly stood up, his hand slightly shaking.

"Was?!"

"Apparently, the soul shard did a pretty bad job at attaching itself to me that night in Godric's Hollow, so when Goblins detected it this Summer, they were kind enough to point me towards a Magical clinic in America. Had to pay half my vault for all this operation, but I cant say I regret it."

"Harry..."

"Cut it out, Saint Brian. If you plan on teaching me useful spells, I'll try to play the good student, if not, please dont bother me ever again!"

And with that, he stormed out, leaving an absolutely shocked Albus Dumbledore behind. The boy had his horcrux removed! And what business did he have with the Goblins in the first place?! Even more, how did he manage to evade the Order and slip to America? Worst of all, there was now some random detective in Diagon Alley that knew Voldemort's secret! Albus had to do something!

In the following months, as he tried to uncover Harry's detective and dealings with the Goblins, the enigma called Harry Potter started to really take over Hogwarts. His grades improved dramatically, and he was found often in the library, researching new spells and rituals. After quitting Quidditch - much to Mister Weasley's dismay - he took on a keen interest in dueling, Professor Flitwick taking him under his personal tutelage in the matter. He also brought forth an ever increasing level of sarcasm and self-confidence, increasing his circle of friends more and more, even among Slytherins. However, it was after openly openly celebrating the mysterious death of Lucius Malfoy - and consequently mopping the floor in a duel with Draco - that alarm bells started to ring. At Miss Granger's insistence, Ronald stood awake almost a whole night, watching to see if Harry Potter was not actually an impostor using Polyjuice. Then Minerva summoned him in the guise of speaking of his parents, yet putting a few drops of Veritaserum in his tea. The boy took a sip and laughed! He asked Minerva to ask him if he supports Voldemort, and the shocked Professor did so. After answering /no/, the boy pulled an antidote from his pocket, drank it, and left. Professor Moody, the new DADA teacher, tested the boy for signs of Imperius, yet he found none. As weeks passed, the Prophet reported daily new deaths of known Death Eaters, each time Harry celebrating the headlines in a rather obnoxious manner, in the middle of the Great Hall. Eventually, one of the students confronted him about it, to which he laughed and simply left. The next edition of the Prophet revealed it all. Apparently, the boy assembled a rag tag team of mercenaries and other types of miscreants he hired from various parts of the world, and unleashed them upon known Death Eaters, with promise of plunder. What was even more incredible was that the boy had full support from Minister Scrimgeour in this! But that was not the only surprise! The boy also gave a detailed account of the abuse he suffered with the Dursleys, account which made Albus Dumbledore seem responsible for every ill that befell the boy.

*** That evening, he summoned Harry to his office. He would not have another Tom Riddle, and he had to hope that it was still possible to turn the boy from the path of death and vengeance he embarked upon. The Headmaster stood stiffly on his chair, watching the absolutely blase young man - now emancipated adult by special Minsiterial decree - sit down in front of him.

"Killing, Harry? Hiring thieves and murderers to do your bidding? Really? The boy I once knew would have never stooped as low as you are, and you know this."

Harry simply looked at him with a mixture of annoyance and disdain.

"He would have just died in whatever foolish quest you would have engineered him to jump in, I am sure. After all, you cant even deny your final plan was for me to die. Cant you, Saint Brian?"

Albus winced at the accusation.

"For the Greater Good, right?" the boy continued "Old habits never truly die, I guess."

The Headmaster paled considerably, and decided he had to take control of the conversation.

"This is not about the past, Harry! Cant you see what you are becoming?! You leave widows in your wake! Orphans, dead..."

That was as far as he got before the boy slammed his fist into the desk and stood up.

"You must have a lot of nerve to speak to me of orphans, Dumbledore! Save your hollow preaching to whoever believes you! Tell me, what would you have had me do?! Isolate myself from the Ministry and leave on a fool's errand across UK, searching for Horcruxes? Then lie down like a good and noble boy, and let Voldemort kill me?! Even if I did all that, how long would it take to find those foul things?! Months?! Years?! The DoM only has one left to uncover! One!"

Albus decided to remain silent, in the hope that the boy would calm down once he said his piece, yet Harry seemed to grow even more annoyed.

"Tell me, what about the orphans and widows which the Death Eaters would have caused?! Have caused! Or do those not matter to you?!"

The boy did not wait for answer, he simply stormed away, leaving a silent Albus behind. The old man expected him to slam the door behind him, yet Harry suddenly stopped, and spoke in a harsh tone, slightly above a whisper.

"You know, I came into a lot of money this Summer. And names. More than I want, truth be told." he turned around, looking at Albus with evident disdain. "At the next Wizengamot meeting, I will officially assume headship of my families. Yes, plural." he said seeing the Headmaster's puzzled expression. "Potter, obviously. Then Black, as Sirius named me his heir. And then there is Slytherin and Gaunt, which I took over through right of conquest when Riddle got himself killed 16 years ago."

Albus wondered what exactly was the point of this.

"Harry Potter-Black-Gaunt-Slytherin sounds even more ridiculous than the Boy-Who-Lived, and that is saying something." He paused a bit, appearing to be deep in thought. "No, that wont work. It's better to stick to just one main title, dont you think, /sir/?"

Dumbledore was now sure that the boy wanted to get to something, something which he will probably dislike.

"Potter is the obvious choice. Honoring my parents, and their sacrifice. They loved me, and if it wasnt for incompetent leaders such as yourself, we would have been happy as a family. Black is another obvious one, for largely the same reasons as Potter."

Harry was now pacing through the office. Dumbledore was more and more sure that whatever the boy tried to say, it wasnt going to be good.

"I dont really care about being Lord Slytherin, even if its the most prestigious title I have. Maybe its House loyalty, I honestly dont know. But I feel no connection to that name. And as for Gaunt..." he chuckled "There is quite the poetic justice in that, dont you think? Harry Gaunt, a Half-blood Gryffindor, vanquisher of Voldemort, taking over that name and reforming the family in the exact opposite direction its ancestors would have wanted. Sirius would have said its a prank worthy of a Marauder, I'm sure."

He sighed and turned to Dumbledore, looking absolutely euphoric. The boy was enjoying this way too much for Albus' liking.

"Many choices, but I think I havent listed my favorite yet." He reached the desk and leaned in towards the Headmaster. "You have something of mine, Headmaster."

He spoke in a chilling whisper, making Dumbledore's blood freeze. Suddenly, the boy opened his palm, and the old man felt a violent yanking on his injured arm and on his waist. Before even registering what was happening, both the Gaunt Ring and the Elder Wand flew into the boy's hand. Albus blanched, his heart beating faster and his hands shaking. He stood up and tried to summon the objects wandlessly back to him. It was of no avail, as they did not even move. His panic increasing, he reached out like a common Muggle, trying to grab them back, but Harry simply took a few steps back and began to laugh.

"Harry!" shouted Dumbedore. "Harry, you dont know what those are! You /must/ give them back to me! /NOW/!

"The Resurrection Stone and the Elder Wand." He spoke gently, putting the ring on his right hand and now looking at the terrified Dumbledore. "It is good to finally have all three back in the family."

He smiled, and started caressing the Wand as if it was a lover. After a few moments, he nodded and looked up at the Headmaster.

"Yes. Harry Peverell is the best choice. A fresh start. Thanks for taking care of the Hallows for me, Saint Brian!"

And with that, he left the office, gently placing the Elder Wand in his pocket. The Ancient and Most Noble House of Peverell rose once more. 2/2
