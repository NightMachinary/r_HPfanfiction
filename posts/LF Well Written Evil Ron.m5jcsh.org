I'd like him to be manipulative and evil if possible, not simply gluttonous and jealous of Harry like most Ron-bashing fics. He should NOT be a patsy to the real mastermind Molly/ Ginny/ Hermione though it's OK if they are scheming together.

Only fanfic I've read like that was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]])

  Usually it is someone highly intelligent that travels back in time -- even Harry is only suppressing his brilliance. But Ron? Hard-working, quick, open-minded... He is not. But with years of advantage over his peers even he can become something more than a tired Auror with a wife that hates him. Amoral!Sly!Ron.
