If the pairing is with Bellatrix or Narcissa id prefer them to be around the same age. I've already read Delenda Est and loved it

**** Hm I may be mixing that part up with another story where his brother was a total asshole and his sister died in a magical accident.

***** Definitely a different story. In this one his brother mostly just kinda hangs out with his friends (Hermione/Ron/Neville) without paying much attention to Harry.

**** Thanks, I forgot to mention that. This was actually one of the better HP FF's I've read, despite the somewhat cliche'd premise.

** The two best Harry/Bella fics I know are

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est]]

and

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2896398/1/Only-Enemies]]

Both are good, not great. Delenda Est could have been great, but it petered off towards the end.
