** one i would count would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1500944]] (The Long, Harsh Road) but Harry isn't exactly Harry, and /technically/ Lily Potter is still his mother. Harry Potter is Loki, and Lily Potter is Freya. I did really like it, though I'm not sure if its the exact criteria.

It is not complete, but there are updates fairly regularly.
