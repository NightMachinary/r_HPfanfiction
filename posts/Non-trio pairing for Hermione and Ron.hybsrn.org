Outside of Harry and Ron, who do you see as the best pairing for Hermione? Do you think she could make it work with someone like Viktor Krum, who she already had a fling with? Or do you think she would gravitate towards someone more like herself, like Percy? Would she be a case of opposites attract, and rather go for a fun, playful person, or would she be too rule-abiding and narrowminded to accept someone like, for instance, Fred or George? I can't really think of anyone that we know of in the series that are particularly well suited for her, just like with Ron.

I'd imagine he'd be great with someone who can pull him out of his insecurity, instead of someone who criticises him. Maybe someone someone as unconcerned and accepting as Luna? Would he fit well with an equally laid-back partner, or would he need someone to keep him on the right track, so to speak?

What do you guys think?


** I think Ron and Lavender actually could have been happy together long term. They wouldn't be a power couple, but I could easily see them being content and still occasionally getting caught making out like teenagers into their 50s.

The only non-trio and non-crossover pairing I've seen with Hermione that I thought made perfect sense, when I read it, was her and Padma.

** As I'm writing thing, I realised I didn't really answer the "trio" question, but friendships as a whole. But take my rambles anyway, hope you enojoy. TL;DR included and the end.

It's stated in GoF that Hermione and Percy seemed to get along fairly well until the House Elves thing. And there are little mentions of Hermione talking to, about, or respecting Percy throughout the series. (Certain circumstances withheld) So it's safe to say that they could be friends or friendly. But since there is a about a 4 year difference between them, I don't think they would be very close while still at Hogwarts without the connection of Ron between them. So it would probably be more "older student helping younger student" until outside of Hogwarts and if they worked together. Which they probably would considering the fields they're interested in (ie: Ministry work)

Hermione is seen to be friends with Victor after GoF and they exchange letters often. But someone like him Hermione wouldn't go for as a friend on her own. Victor was the one who approached her. Before that, Hermione didn't seem to think much about him other than it was annoying that girls would giggle around him while she was trying to study in the library.

For people her age and in Gryffindor, I think she could have gotten along with her dorm mates as time went on. And she technically has other girls in her dorm, not just Lavender and Parvati. She is seen helping Neville a lot throughout the books so I think they would have become closer friends if she wasn't doing things with Ron and Harry. She also could have made friends with younger Gryffindor muggleborns but being a tutor or such. Since they would easily flock her to because of like-circumstances.

Also think she had potential to get along with Justin Finch-Fletchley since they're both muggleborns and he seemed to have a promising future in the muggle world since he was previously set to go to Eton. Can't say much for Ravenclaw since we really only know about Luna and Cho. And while Hermione eventually became friends with Luna without Harry, Ron, or Ginny around I don't think it would have gone as smoothly. But Hermione is smart so she could easily make friends with other education driven Ravenclaws. Doubt she'd be friends with any Slytherin in canon terms.

During GoF Ron is mentioned to be hanging out with Dean, Seamus, and Neville a lot when he's fighting with Harry. So it's safe to say he could easily get along with them all well. I think Neville would probably be the best contender since Semaus is seen to also be blunt and quick to snap (like Ron) so they would probably but heads a lot. And since they're both boys, it could end up more aggressive and physical than when he fought with Hermione. (since teen boys tend to get physical with each other in my own experience). Also Seamus and Dean are already best mates. Neville is timid and shy and feels overshadowed by his parents while Ron feels the same towards his siblings, but he's not as nervous about things. So they could help each other out and support each other.

Outside of Gryffindor, I don't think Ron would have too many friends. All his family is in Gryffindor and he could easily be introduced to their friends through them. Even though Fred and George tease him a lot, I don't think they would let himhang out to dry all alone and friendless in Hogwarts. And while Ron is dismissive of Percy and his pompous ways, I don't think he'd turn down time with his older brother and his friends if Ron hadn't had friends yet. Some people are in fact fine chilling with and becoming friends with other friend's younger siblings.

He could become closer to Luna because of Ginny, but we're shown that he also calls her Loony sometimes and thinks she's a little too odd. But I do think she would provide a good balance. Ron being friends with Slytherins is improbable. If he wasn't friends with Harry it's possible /some/ Slytherins might be civil-ish to him as he's a pureblood and part of the Sacred 28, but most likely not. (Draco+Co is really the only one in book seen making fun of the Weasley's financial status) He could get along with Cedric too since they live near each other, but not much since Cedric is older and in Hufflepuff. I always wished more was built up with Cedric since he does live so close to the Weasleys.

-

TL;DR: I think Hermione would do well with Neville, Justin, or some of the unnamed Gryffindor girls or Ravenclaws. And Ron would fit well with Neville, possibly Luna and Cedric, or any of his brothers and their friends.
