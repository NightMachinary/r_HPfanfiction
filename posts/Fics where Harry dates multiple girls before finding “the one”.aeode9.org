So I've been lurking for awhile and this is my first post ever. Lately I've been reading a ton of fan fiction and I've discovered my love for HP/DG fics. I just recently finished a HP/FD fic that hinted at a possible Harry & Daphne relationship, and although the fic ended up with the original pairing there was and extra chapter with an alternate ending of sorts with the aforementioned Harry & Daphne pairing.

So I ask are there any other fics that have similar plot line of Harry actually dating other girls before settling down? Not not necessarily cheating but actual relationships. All pairings are welcome but any HP/DG would be especially nice.


** What story is it you're reading? I'm a fan of both pairings and don't think I've read that one.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
