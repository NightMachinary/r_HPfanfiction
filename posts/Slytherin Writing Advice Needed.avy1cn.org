Hi, so I'm trying to make my Slytherin character face a boggart, preferably in class. The problem I keep encountering is that there's no way they would agree to let the whole class see their worst fear.

​

I mean, no self respecting Slytherin would allow such a disadvantage, not unless it benefitted them in some way. So my question is, can anyone suggest viable reasons for my character to face a boggart?

​

Thank you in advance!

​

P.S. I'm new and still not quite sure how this subreddit works. If I shouldn't ask for writing advice in this subreddit, please tell me.


** Thirteen year old kids are not that interested in politics. Ambition and cunning do not equate to being a mastermind. They do it because it's the assignment. They do it because not doing it means that their fear /is/ something exploitable and puts a target on their back.

How exactly would that be a disadvantage? I am pretty sure that "death", "death of a family member" or "random magical creature you will never come across" would be the answer 9 times out of ten. It's not like they will be revealing nuclear launch codes or the master key to their bank account.

Again, most of those fears are not something which can really damage you. I mean, McGonagall with a 10-inch strap-on and a leather mask would ruin your social life, but "Look at that loser, he is afraid of (insert creature which can easily kill a room full of people)" doesn't really cut it.

Also, all students go through it, so everyone knows and no one is at a disadvantage.

Lastly, how would knowing someone's fear put them at a political disadvantage? Unless you are deadly afraid of your mother as a domina or a garden gnome, the revelation will not have a lasting impact.

** Perhaps you can engineer a situation in which the Slytherin is trying to get out of the situation but it backfires. Basically, as soon as you are faced with the boggart, it assumes the shape of your fear, so there just needs to be some ruckus or foiled plotting that leads to the boggart being suddenly unleashed in front of the character. Perhaps even as simple as, Lupin noticed the Slytherins all slinking towards the back of the line and just sends the boggart right at them instead of the next people in line.

** I feel like the way you're framing the question automatically puts you at a disadvantage. You're basically positing that all slytherins must be these sneaky, ambitious masterminds that constantly scheme and would never allow an opponent see their weaknesses!\\
And this might make sense for some of the upperclassmen...but the 11-15-year olds are not scheming masterminds. They're just kids. They're not worried about politics; they're worried about pranks and homework and maybe the occasional kiss.

Just write kids.

*** I don't know, dude. 13 year olds definitely care about politics, at least social politics. If they didn't you wouldn't get bullshit like popular guys "fake asking out" dorky girls for the sole purpose of humiliating them, or the alpha friend calling up a third friend and getting them to insult the beta friend while they are secretly listening on a party line (both things that happened in a weekly basis at my junior high). You don't need to have a cunning long-term agenda to not want people to see your weaknesses. You just have to be a somewhat shrewd kid at a boarding school where social currency is important. Pretty much every friend I had between the ages of 12-18 had something about themselves or their family that they painstakingly hid from everyone they were not close to because they did not want to be publicly eviscerated by assholes with more social standing. I agree that a lot of fic unrealistically paints kids as cold-hearted masterminds set on world domination at the age of 12, but I'm not convinced that's what OP was going for.

**** Well, that sounds a bit harsh, but I suppose life can be that way.\\
What you describe -- the social hierarchies, the cliques and cruel pranking -- if we were to apply it here, then it would have to apply equally to all houses.\\
But that's not the case here. OP is singling out Slytherin. The other houses are, presumably, ok with facing a boggart and displaying their worst fears; only Slytherin kids are the ones looking to avoid it, because of their heritage and the stereotypical "slytherin is cunning, ambition, etc."\\
And that's what I'm arguing against. Like, if the other houses display no concern, then it's obviously not such a big deal, and for Slytherin kids to make a big deal out of it would be playing into the stereotype.

** Which is better: 1) having others know your fears, but that you can work through them by casting /riddikulus/ and "dispelling" the boggart or 2) having everyone else believe that Slytherins are such big titty-babies that they're scared to face this otherwise harmless magical creature--and being susceptible to an enemy using a boggart in the future.

You could even use the killing curse free of punishment and reinforce your status as alpha bitch. I mean, why would you not kill a boggart in the wild? They are one of the worst magical creatures around and killing one does the world a great favour.

** You could also make Remus a bit sympathetic. Maybe he heard about someone toturing Ron by putting spiders all over his bed after they found out about his phobia and realized that showing 12/13 year olds their phobia's to everyone else is not a good thing espcially in a boarding school. I know that this is written about in several fics where Gryffindors get revenge on Ron by putting spiders on his bed ect, so maybe there is a few days between showing the Gryffindors and showing the Slytherins and someone did this. If you notice all the other phobia were not something that could easily be brought in, like banshee or a severed hand, but Ron's is easily obtainable.
