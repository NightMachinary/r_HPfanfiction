  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** What kinds do you enjoy most? What things do you not care about that much?

Specific pairings?

Action?

Romance?

Plot?

Character development?

Fluff?

Epic battles?

Any no goes?

More mystical magic or more sciencey stuff like magic laser beams?

Allmighty OP magic or a strictly constrained system?

I usually prefer fics with heavy focus on plot and action with a consistent magic system that is powerful but doesn't have random deus ex machinas and is restricted in some ways. Less focus on romance and character development.

So I like linkffn(The Arithmancer) and most Starfox5 stuff, like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief; Divided and Entwined), but it's not for everyone.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

*** Well no specific parings but I do enjoy one with hermione and Luna copious amounts of op magic with heavy plot battles don't need to be epic but funny mostly (like one punch man but not necessarily) and I enjoy a character that changes through the series BTW:thanks for the recommendations Note: no goes incomplete ones I just hate abandoned ones

**** Linkffn(Returned, Reformed and Really Trying)

Grindelwald is pretty OP and deals with Voldemort in a somewhat funny way, and Hermione is pretty interesting in this one.
