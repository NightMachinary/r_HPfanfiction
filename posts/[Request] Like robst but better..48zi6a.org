So Robst gets a lot of hate here. But what I do like about the fics is the way the story immediately diverts from canon, but doesn't use multiple points of departure.

They also toe the line between "canon rehash" and "not even Harry Potter any more" pretty well. And it's nice to see Harry driven, competent and with bigger goals than "get rid of Voldemort".

So, I'm looking for someone who writes similar stuff, but with less twaddle.

Any takers?


** Bexis, I think, might actually write robst better than robst. His major work has H/Hr, Harry- and Hermione-wank comes in spades, goblins (as well as more "exotic" creatures such as succubi) feature prominently and while Voldemort is still the Big Bad, the narrative carries an aura that suggests the world is far bigger than Britain and the prophecy. If you can get past the bloat (though I'm not one to talk lol) then this might just cover what you're looking for.

** AngelaStarCat tends to write stuff that is AU but doesn't diverge /too/ much from canon, at least in terms of wizarding history and the timeline. Her fic that's closest to that "the same but different" robst feel for me is probably linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat).

Admittedly, it's been months since I read it, but I remember it doing the "AU!Harry has special powers" trope pretty darn well. It could be what you're looking for.

**** Chapter 12 ends on an interesting note, but things start to pick up a bit more in Chapters 13-15. That said, the fic is a slow-burn, which can be a bit much sometimes, but I like to think that this particular author does it pretty well.

(Although I really would love it if she could break things into smaller chapters because yeesh.)

Her linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) is another story of hers that is smaller, but has a similar feel in terms of an AU Harry who grows into unique powers. The pacing is /much/ faster. (It's also got two more chapters to go before it's complete, apparently, so there's that.)

** They do use multiple points of departure and they are canon rehash with extra Harry Is Better Than Everyone Else In Every Way tropes.

If you want a fic that isn't canon rehash but is still Harry Potter and has few departure points (3) then I would recommend linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb).

*** I wouldn't say that. Robst's problem is quite well identified (lack of meaningful conflict due to the protagonists automatically succeeding in what are sue-ish ways), and as far as I know “like Robst but better” simply means stories where Harry is powerful enough that you'd think there would be no conflict but instead the conflict is about something that can't be solved by his increased power nor by any new weird stuff he has. And since some people generally don't write about overpowered Harry, this means that some don't really count for it.
