:END:
I think Harry wanted dementor bone for something. He gets his house elf army to participate in looking for one, whatever it takes. They report success and he's horrified to find that they took a dementor bone from a "living" dementor by force, and many elves died doing it.

I've no idea if the fic was any good, but this detail has been bugging me for some time.

Anybody know any fics where this happens?

** I think I've read that one, but I'm having trouble finding it. Does it have to do with Harry learning to be a cursebreaker, and he needs dementor bone for carving runes into, because it will work better than dragon bone?
