Is there a fic that has a cool, charming Harry that "misbehaves" (maybe he parties or engages in ~illicit activities) but is still a likeable, nice guy? Sort of like that one kid in high school that was popular and well-liked because he was a good guy. I don't want overtly arrogant or edgy characterizations of Harry where the author tries to make him seem cool, but only succeeds in making him a tool.


** Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): I admit I sort of wanted to strangle Harry over twenty times here, but most people pretty much adore him (including Voldemort) and he's generally an all around nice guy.

*** I wish more fics had this characterization of him. It feels like every fic I read he is either really nice and boring or a powerful wizard who is a complete jerk.

I love the sassy, not afraid to speak his mind, easy going but still kind at heart Harry. His sarcastic and sometimes a bit skeptical view on things combined with his empathy for others is refreshing to read. There is also so much great dialogue between him and Voldemort/Snape because of it.

**** I always go back to this scene when I think of that:

#+begin_quote
  He hadn't even realized what the boy was doing until the rock actually hit him in the face, smashing into the bridge of his nose and part of his right eye. He stum back from the blow, tripped over something, and fell backwards... into a ditch. And fuck, that hurt.

  "You son of a ­­argh! You broke my nose!"\\
  "Well, you cracked my ribs, you damn psycho," Harry called back.

  Snarling, he wiped at the blood pouring from his nose, but it was instantly replaced, making the effort futile. He crawled out of the trench, but by then Harry ha disappeared. Marvelous.

  "Expelliarmus!"

  "Protego!" Voldemort snapped out automatically, shielding himself. He glared over at the cluster of trees the spell originated from. "This isn't Hogwarts, Harry. Y going to have to do better than that."

  "I don't want to fight you. It's pointless."

  "On that we are agreed. You should remain still and take your punishment like a man."

  "How about I take it like a fourteen year old and sit in my room until I've learned my lesson."

  Voldemort let out a laugh. "I've missed you, Harry, I really have. No one else can survive being this cheeky with me." Then he had to spit, as the blood from his leaked into his mouth. Yuck.

  "I missed you too," and that sounded sadly sincere. "Do you think we could start over?"

  "This isn't a board game, Harry. We can never go back to what we were. You've made sure of that." He murmured a spell, static voca, under his breath, and mo of view, taking a circuitous route towards Harry's location.

  "... Could we at least stop trying to kill one another?"

  "I'm not trying to kill you. I just want to make you suffer," he said, and though he was moving closer, it sounded as if his voice were the same distance away.

  "How's that working out for you?"

  "I can honestly say, I've never had the novel experience of a broken nose. I feel obliged to share it with you."

  "I already broke my nose, remember? Moody and that damn potion."

  "... Oh... how about your fingers?"

  "...Yes?"

  "When?"

  "... Uh... at Durmstrang?"

  "If you don't sound convinced of your own answers how do expect to convince me..."

***** That is good to hear. I might read it! I do not understand so many people's obsession with romance. Romance is not even romantic, because romanticizing of romance is what people think of as "romance". Real life romance is just...yes, just hanging out and eating food and doing all the things you do with your sister or friend anyway, except you're allowed to kiss them and stuff too. I do not think that is a good bonus though.
