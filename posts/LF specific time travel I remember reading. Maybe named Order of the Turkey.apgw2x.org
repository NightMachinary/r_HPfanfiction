  Another one I remember there being an attack in Diagon and Luna Harry and Hermione stand in a store front casting protonus and Xeno dies while Harry kills Bellatrix with a fire whip. (Now that I'm thinking about it this could also be Heart and Soul)

This bit is from linkffn(Don't Look Back In Anger by Robst) but that's not a trime-travel fic.

*** I'd missed this was Robst. Pretty good read aside from the tired old MOB!Dumbledore elements that he fell into.

** I'm pretty sure the first and last quotes/plots are from the same fic. Doesn't he call it "The Order of the Flaming Turkey" in those? I remember reading it, not sure about the title.

*** Yeah that's the name he calls it! I was sure that was the title of it though. Reading another commenter claiming it's Three to Backstep however making me rethink that's actually it. Thank you.

**** Hm, it could very well be but my brain thinks something else, but not sure which one... I think this is the one where he has a home in Hogwarts where he sends his mails from using a different owl? Or am I confusing this with another fic now?

***** I don't remember a different owl in anything and there are so many where he gets private quarters in Hogwarts I can't properly separate the thoughts. In Three to Backstep however he get quarters with daphne and Hermione near the Ravenclaw tower.
