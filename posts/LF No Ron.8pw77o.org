Hey guys (and girls), (- Should have titled the thread "No (mo-)Ron!" (I simply don't like Ron and think he is weighing Harry down instead of being helpful in most situations! He's also not a good friend (note: Attributing his second betrayal to the horcrux is cheap because it neither affected Harry or Hermione that way...also: I still don't understand why they wore the damn thing in the first place!)...I am however not questioning Ron's bravery (he was injured and still stood up to Sirius for example!))...I didn't because Ron has too many easily offended fans!)

I am looking for fanfictions to read again (didn't have time to do so and really enjoy it in a while!) and thus my request for fanfiction without the (in my opinion!) most useless character in the franchise (I prefer Snape over him and I hate Snape!):

So, don't get me wrong, I don't care if Ron is in the story, but I don't want him to be friends with Harry or Hermione (because the exclusion of Ron would most likely lead to a more studious Harry who's interested in his education and not just there because he has to be and doesn't enjoy most classes and only puts in minimal effort into studying!)

As always: No main-character slash, no Harry/Ginny (unless it is super good and you truly have to read it!) and no Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape etc.

Thank you for your help! The stage is yours :)

A fair argument, but if memory serves right Ron was the one who actually /wore/ the Locket the longest. It may also simply be that Locketmort knew he could only successfully possess /one/ person with the limited interaction he could have, and so randomly chose /one/ person out of the trio (who happened to be Ron; possibly because Harry, with the Love Protection, "repelled" him somehow, and he'd rather be a boy than a girl).

Mostly just story contrivance. If you need a fanmade explanation, it has been theorized that putting an uber-powerful obejct like the Locket inside the already-enchanted Bottomless Pouch would have been magically risky for some vague theoretical reason.

*** Possible - still, I think Rowling wanted Ron to betray Harry again, but she also didn't want to make Ron look like a worse friend! So she kind of set him up, Ron was always the most weak minded of the trio IMHO!

** Well, your rant honestly sounds like Harry's opinion of Ron in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) in case you haven't read it.

On the Way to Greatness has a canon-ish Harry in Slytherin linkffn(On the Way to Greatness).

Magicks of the Arcane has Ron as basically irrelevant (though somewhat sympathetic later on) linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane).

The Prisoner's Cipher also sounds like something that fits your tantrum linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher). Harry literally snaps him like a twig at one point.

As an aside, you do realize the entire reason for Ron's betrayals was as a way for Rowling to engineer conflict during lulls in the story right (there isn't that much going on most of the time between the big events of the 4th and 7th books)?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.
