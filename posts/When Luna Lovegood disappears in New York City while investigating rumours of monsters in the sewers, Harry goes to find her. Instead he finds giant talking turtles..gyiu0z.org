************* You're amazing. Your style of writing of dialogue mixed with narration is so well done, I'm jealous. Also, this is so well done, that I don't even mind that it's crack fic.

Most of the time when I avoid crack fic, its because the writing is so "THIS. IS. FUNNY. LAUGH. AT. IT."

But you wrote that idea in such a way, that I've genuinely enjoyed something with a smile on my face.

If Luna's been captured by 1987!Shredder, she may drive him crazy enough for Shredder to try to return her.

******** And that's assuming she even wound up in 2003 TMNT. I watched bits and pieces of that series throughout its run, and greatly enjoyed it.

But if Luna landed in 1987, then that's a different story.

1987!Shredder isn't nearly as menacing. There was an episode where a version of him had taken over the world, and begged the Turtles to take him with them, because he hated his job.

And there was Rocksteady and Bebop--who are way weirder than anything in the Quibbler.

And Don Turtelli...who might be the strangest villain in the entire Turtles franchise.

When they tie Luna to a chair to keep her out of their hair, she offers advice--"You should take my wand away, if you don't want me to free myself" and "Don't forget to tie my ankles together" and "To prevent me from using magic entirely, a gag would probably be more--mmmph."

It ends with Shredder calling the Turtles and Harry and offering to pay them to take Luna back.
