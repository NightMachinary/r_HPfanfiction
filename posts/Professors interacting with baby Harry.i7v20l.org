I don't know why, but I'm really in the mood for some fluff between the teachers of Hogwarts and Harry as a baby/toddler. Doesn't matter whether it's a deaging fic or takes place during his actual childhood, as long as there are some cute scenes. Hope someone can help me out


** Linkao3 (Harry Potter's Second Chance)

Harry Potter's Second Chance has a deaged Harry raised by Snape and a huge amount of involvement from Dumbledore.

It's great, I recommend it to everyone!

  Rev. version 2014 PLEASE READ! This combines ALL of the stories in the original Second Chance series: Harry Potter's Second Chance, Second Chance Take Two, Second Chance The Death Eater & The Rat. This is AU. Many chapters have had additions to the text or re-written to fix problems such as plot gaps, grammar, and punctuation. Takes place after Goblet of Fire. Harry de-ages himself, and Snape adopts him.

** The Encounter With... series by Hestia is really cute. It's easier to read on [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=71][Potions and Snitches]] because FFN doesn't have a function for defining a series. linkffn(4459456)

Severus Snape and the Toddler-Who-Lived by Nicnac has Snape helping to find an appropriate foster home for Harry. linkao3(6581383)

  No, Dumbledore did not use a picture of Severus Snape to teach little two year old Harry to call the man 'Da.' That is a ridiculous accusation and it will not be stood for!

  Very AU! Harry as a 6 year old, Snape with a gooey center! Harry is caught foolishly trying to explore Hogwarts' lake, and Snape must bring himself to discipline the boy. Contains very mild corporal punishment. 1 prequel, 1 sequel now posted.
