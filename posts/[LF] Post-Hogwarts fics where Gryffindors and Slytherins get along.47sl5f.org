I've found I really like fics where everyone, or most everyone, can just get along after the war. Epilogue compliant or not, any pairings or maturity level. I prefer longer Hermione centered fics, but I'm not terribly picky on either point.


** linkao3(archiveofourown.org/works/392764) Harry and multiple Slytherins and Gryffindors meet at the pub. Drarry pairing, but mostly just implied until the very end.

  Harry, Draco, and Hermione go to a pub. Harry, Draco, and Pansy go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Pansy, and Hermione go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Hermione and Ron go to a pub. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Ron, and Pansy―you guessed it―go to a pub. I could go on. In fact, I did. Harry, Draco, Hermione, Pansy, Ron, Blaise, Luna, Goyle, Neville, and Theodore Nott go to a pub. In various combinations.
