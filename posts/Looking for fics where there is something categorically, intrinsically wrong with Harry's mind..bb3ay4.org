A good if limited example of this would be linkffn(Circular Reasoning) , with much inferior examples being the numerous "Psychopath" Harry fics.

Cheers.


** In The Art Of Self Fashioning, the abuse the Dursleys subject him to has caused serious psychological problems. linkao3(5103614)

For a more light hearted spin on this, On A Train, Switching Tracks has a Harry that simply approaches the world in a very different way. linkffn(4810036)

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
