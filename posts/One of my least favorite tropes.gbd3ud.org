"Oh no! it's some obscure law that is stopping us from getting married" the character audibly gasp "Wait! What about this other obscure marriage law that says we could get married" Then they went on to to have 69 children blah blah.


** I honestly feel like marriage tropes have a special place in hell. Especially those ones that are like, oh, since Harry comes from a dying House, we need to give him a harem to rebuild his family line.

*** especially considering wizards longivity and healing magics you would think one witch would be able to birth more than enough children. People can quite easily have upwards of five to six kids so surely a witch who is in their prime for far longer and has access to potions to help recover from child birth far quicker is more than capable of producing enough children for the line to survive and thrive.

**** You would think that, until you remember that outside of the Weasleys, everyone seems to have one or two children.

***** but they don't have one or two children and six wives to boost their family numbers. Maybe they are happy with that many children. If ya need kids they aren't too hard to make and hey, you might even enjoy it.

***** The downside is that everyone we see directly in canon seems to pair off quickly and get married/have kids at a young age - the backstory for his grandparents doesn't get a lot of airtime compared to the way that James + Lily got married immediately out of Hogwarts, or that the pairings in Hogwarts for the main characters immediately stick, etc.

It would certainly be interesting to see how that longevity would affect Wizarding society, but I think canon sticks too closely to our actual society's trajectory (age wise) that it doesn't really have any impact.

** The only times I've seen fics with laws regarding marriage, are the ones forcing them to marry. I didn't know people wrote fics where they try to find laws so they can get married early/poly. Didn't seem prevalent enough to really be a trope, I thought.

** Legalism in that vein doesn't strike me as a terrible trope - if it makes sense in universe. For instance, until the 60s, there were multiple states in the US where interracial marriage was illegal - a version of the WW that's far more dominated by purebloods could easily have a whole bunch of laws trying to regulate marriage in a way to retain their power.

For the obscure law angle, I kind of like the idea that they have a whole bunch of non-codified laws that have piled up over the centuries - feels very medieval/ancient to me (eg, look at Ancien Regime France (pre-Revolution) and how much of an absolute /mess/ the judicial system was - overlapping constituencies, different privileges for everyone depending on social position, location, etc). If portraying a pureblood dominated Wizarding World, I could see it being heavily anchored into the past like that - and thus, having a lot of things that were just codified and put in place for one reason or another and left there.

Obviously using it for cheap drama is... well, it's cheap. But using it for cheap drama /and/ across a bunch of other things to show needed reforms of an antiquated system? That'd be much more interesting!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]], to me is actually one that gets this right. There is a law, but the actual plot setup is believable-ish, for once.

It does have the Harry/Daphne she's the Ice Queen of Slytherin thing, but to be honest, the way it is written is /not bad./ Most tropes are awful because they are overused, with most ffn authors being inexperienced, so they just present it all wrong or basically make the same story as everyone else.

LPA is good because while it does have Ice Queen Daphne, it's written believably. For those wondering, yes Ron does get jealous, but he also has a redemption arc - /that makes actual sense!/ And the author doesn't bash him for it. Ron's quite hard to write, I feel, seeing as most people don't get him quite right.

*** This one is pretty decent, but I couldn't finish it. Daphne is just so unlikeable, unfortunately. I didn't see how the author would get past the whole “plan” bit.
