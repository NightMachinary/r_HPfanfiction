I'm looking for fics like Watch or... I think it was Hogwarts Dawn by Jeconais. Fics that have a more independent Harry that deals in business. Meetings with goblins, mixing with muggles and magicals, etc.

Dumbledore's Army uses Room of Requirement to create a spaceship. Also involves a lot of business and planning. Thorough detail into the behind the scenes in how it would be plausible for them to travel in space. Not science talk, just practical talk.
