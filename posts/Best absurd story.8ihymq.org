So I'm reading a story where Harry is obsessed with Pokémon and the only thing he does at Hogwarts is to work towards making his own Pikachu.

So what are the other, great, and absurd stories out there?

linkao3(7353028)


** Oh, now here we are. linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is one of my absolute favourite fics.

For someone who's read that, there is a spin off crossover with Pokemon, which is shaping up to be my favourite humor/crack fic, and yes I include Seventh Horcrux here, linkffn(Wearing the Faces of Men by The Carnivorous Muffin)

If you like those, their linkffn(October by The Carnivorous Muffin) is also great, and if you're into Naruto, there's linkffn(Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds), which is amazing.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun.

** Hmm I think these should count.

- Linkffn(4655545). Reunion.

Middle aged Harry, Hermione, Susan, and Luna go back in time. Seeing as they are each very skilled and they know everything about what was going on at the time, they have a real easy time of it.

Harry has spent his life after Hogwarts being the world's deadliest magical assassin/freelance bounty hunter. Dark Wizards only, of course.

- Linkffn(11120132). Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous

Grizzled Moody-esque "Master Auror" Harry is in his late twenties. He gets put into Middle Earth as an Elf. Turns out that Elves in their late twenties are still small children.

He's not happy, and there's very little in the setting that can challenge the direct style of magic HP has.

I may come back and update with some more.

  Draco Malfoy, like all his family before him, has looked forward to meeting the person behind the name that will eventually appear. Provided they are a Pureblood, of course. But for some absurd reason, she doesn't seem to like him. Even worse she appeared to be friends with Potter's group. This of course leads to hijinks. Not to mention, Potter's somewhat more annoying than usual with his constant retorts and somehow, someway, Ginny Weasley acquired a basilisk. (Draco honestly was not going to ask.)-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Harry Potter, for his part, was pulled headfirst into the confusing world of the Slytherins when Draco Malfoy decided (for whatever Malfoy-ish reason) that they were friends. It doesn't help that somehow, Malfoy wasn't actually the most insane of the Slytherins. How will Harry face the scion of Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange, Gellert Grindelwald, and whatever else the world (and author) throws at him this time around?
