** linkffn(Year Six by GringottsVault711) and it's sequel linkffn(Year Seven: Harry Potter & The Blood Debt by GringottsVault711)

They're Pre-HBP. And not the best written. But they're Harry/Katie and both complete. I read it years ago and it sparked my Harry/Katie interest. I go back every so often and reread it because I can never find any complete Harry/Katie fics either.
