What if Harry Potter was insane, and perhaps placed in either St. Mungo's or another hospital. Magical or Muggle?

Or perhaps he was perfectly normal as his aunt and uncle but kept getting visions or whatever from the so called magical world, or a number of ways to do this.

Any rating is fine. Would rather have the story be completed, but as long as the story has a lot of chapters I suppose it's fine if it's not completed.

****** I'll probably think of some more but here are a few.

#+begin_quote
  Adams family crossover. Manipulative (but good) Dumbledore has been fiddling with Harry's mind to make him not a murderous psychopath. Little weird in parts but definitely psycho Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry decides to take up Witch hunting the Death Eaters, lots of torture.

#+begin_quote
  Crossover with Warhammer 40k, no knowledge necessary. First of a series. Harry is an zealous member xenophobic cult dedicated to the eradication of religion in all it's forms and the annihilation of all non human races. Then he gets sent back to his third year at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Lovecrafty crossover.

  #+begin_quote
    Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.

  Harry makes a bargain for a bit more power. It goes pretty well all things considered.

#+begin_quote
  Crossover with /Looking For Group/ a webcomic. Harry's a murderous psychopath but it's played for laughs.
