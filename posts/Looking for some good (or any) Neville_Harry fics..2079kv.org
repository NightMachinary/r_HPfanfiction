I've already read (and love) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/36983/Acacia-Carter][Acacia Carter's fics]] and really want to read more of this ship, but can't find any!


** I also really love this pairing, and am disappointed by how little there is. These are the ones I have in my favorites (that aren't written by Acacia Carter).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2579530/1/In-His-League][In His League]] by Alexandri. "Harry has a crush, but won't do anything about it. Ron is determined to see his friend happy. Neville's in the crossfire and that's not such a bad thing. HarryNeville. COMPLETE."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5806672/1/Stuttering][Stuttering]] by SlipStich. "Neville wants to date Harry Potter but isn't so sure he has what it takes to date the Hufflepuff Savior! NL/HP SLASH. AU. Complete."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8259193/1/Assertion-of-Dominance][Assertion of Dominance]] by YaoiProfessorYuki. "No one knew that sweet mild-mannered Neville Longbottom could be so assertive."

And this one isn't slash, but it is one of my favorite humor fics and has some great Harry/Neville friendship bonding.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] by opalish. "After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic."
