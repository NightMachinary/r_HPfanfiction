Realistically, the concept of soul bonds is fucking horrifying.


** Hopefully someone else will remember what this is called - there's one where Gabrielle Delacour bonds with Harry while still too young to understand what that means, and Harry is not happy at all with the consequences. It's a great read!

** There is a really good, yet sadly abandoned fic where a soul bond is treated as... if not a terminal illness, a serious one. Something about being completely stripped of your privacy being bad for relationships and having someone peeping through your eyes as you attempt romance being... not helpful. (In the fic, they are literally becoming the same person. It is like a soul-merging fic o.o)

Error of Soul linkffn(8490518). I wish someone would take this concept and run with it for a full length fic, there is a ton of potential. (it is important to note that Harry/Hermione in this don't hate it, but it comes off as youthful invincibility. Literally everyone else in the world treats it as if they were to be pitied).

As for me, I'm sorry, but I do not subscribe to the romantic notion of it. The problem is, who or what decides this compatibility? There is lack of agency, lack of actual decision, lack of /choice/.

I see it no better than sanctioned rape. Harsh I know, but if you didn't consciously make a decision, did not come to conclusion that you like your partner, and didn't choose to be with them - if all of that is decided for you, forced on you, by some magic, then it is not okay in my book.

*** I would split this in two: Fated and non-fated.

Fated involves a 'soul bond on the tapestry of fate'. This is an equivalent of a hard prophecy. Your mileage on this one will vary depending on how you view things like predestination. Depending on your world view, this will range from low-level horrifying to just an extension of the idea of 'god has a plan for your life'.

That *usually* doesn't come into play with Soul Bond fics, as the entire point of a soul bond fic (or a marriage law fic, or whatever) is to have characters forced together in a non-natural way, and having to deal with that.

The second is that it isn't fate, just more of the magic of the world. This is straight up *Horrifying,* similar to the mind rape or torture or other spells in HP that you shouldn't think too much into if you want it to be fun.

A magic spell and two people are tied together. If they are incompatible? Too bad. The magic will force change their personality to work. What if one dies? Well, the other is basically hobbled for life. Oh, lets toss in forced fidelity and a lack of free will on top of it. Also, despite what you read in romance stories, most relationships are fluid and love isn't some overpowering, lifelong force. Which means that maintaining lifelong relationships requires work and commitment beyond fleeting emotions. Magically enforced relationship feelings is just... scary.

And then you have things like the cutesy "They have to sleep in the same bed". Hey look, an excuse to make my characters who are not comfortable with each other into an intimate situation. But then, if you think about it, that means you can essentially torture them by simply delaying one during travel. They could never go on separate adventures. Never have a day off. Never say 'hey you know, i'm not really into that hobby of yours, but you go enjoy it and i'll be waiting when you are done'.

And then there is the more extreme version of 'soul bond starts sharing feelings, memories whatever'. Which is basically [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergerOfSouls][body-horror levels]].
