Hermione ignored Malfoy and Ronald's posturing, thinking of the different conversations she'd had over the summer. After 37 hours of reflection, stuck in bed with only disgusting potions for company, she had finally realized what she had done wrong at The Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Fifth-year Hermione had thought this was a game, with points to win or lose, a big trophy and a pat on the head after. Both teams would shake hands and say 'Good Game'. That there wasn't a decades-long war going on, that positivity and a can-do attitude could overcome centuries of systemic discrimination. That a radical terrorist wouldn't do awful things to her, regardless of her blood-status. That they would hesitate to kill her once she no longer had a use.

        Fifth-year Hermione was a fool.

        Her sin, the most unforgivable thing about that girl, was her pride. Sure, she had saved Luna from being cursed, silencing Dolohov, but then what? Had she stunned the murderer? Oh no, that stupid bint actually lowered her wand and looked for praise. As if there was a bloody scoreboard she could reference!         Once she recovered, she had been so ashamed of her actions that she had sat down with her parents, and told them more about what had been happening in her world than ever before, leaving out little things like the troll, or that Voldemort wanted her best friend's head on a pike. After that harrowing discussion, they agreed to help her with some conditioning exercises, and they went running as a family every morning.         After Harry had called her the first time, she would call him (knowing he never would on his own, with those damn relatives of his) and grill him on the finer points of 'constant vigilance'. She had spent hours perfecting the ability to draw her wand normally, covertly, and from every possible position; her parents would stage mock discussions trying to catch her at it after dinner. Since that day, Hermione had done everything she could to kill the ineffective mudblood that she used to be.


** Wow this is good. I love fics where one or more characters train like they are an army. Post the fix here when you're finished!

And for those of you curious, the source fic is The Hero Trilogy Part 1: Sword of the Hero by Joe6991
