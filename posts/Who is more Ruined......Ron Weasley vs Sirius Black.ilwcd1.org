I recently saw a post here where someone was discussing how fanfic tend to ruin Sirius Black and I thought that who is more ruined Sirius or Ron in the fanon world.

I mean people tend to portray Sirius as a hot headed and Immature idiot or a smart yet childish ladies man and according to me both are very far from truth because Sirius was not a hot-headed in the book neither we see even a hint of ladies man in the book he tend to act before thinking when someone he care was in danger and he was not an idiot. He was smart, had a dark sense of humor and very caring person.

Now coming to Ron Weasley who according to me is more ruined then even Sirius is often just bashed and presented as a jealous and greedy bastard who will betray anyone for money or a immature fool who is a comedy character or is just there doing nothing except following Hermione. That is far from what Ron really is , In the book he is someone who can THINK even in the panic situations, will do anything for someone he consider a friend. He has his faults like everyone else like he has high self respect, suffers from identity crises and fears to be just another guy


** I think Ron is ruined more. Sirius, for all that he's flanderized in the way you describe, tends to enjoy generally positive portrayals. There aren't a whole lot of Sirius bashing fics out there.

Ron, on the other hand, is up there as one of the most frequently bashed characters.

*** i understand that but people tend to make him such a useless character who is always just being stupid. I mean they never portray him as a serious character no pun involved but as a stupid person who is always making bad jokes and I hate it. I mean that guy ate rat to be near to someone he cares about that does mean something

** Ron. At least Sirius is painted in a good light most of the time, Ron is just endlessly bashed.

Plus, Sirius haters don't usually make fun of people who like him.

** I think it really depends on how you define ruined. They both have issues. Sirius, the way I see him is well intentioned but not quite all there. Even after he escapes azkaban he's on the run or holed up in Grimmauld Place.

Ron on the other hand in my belief is likewise a good person. But in my opinion he doesn't learn. Yes, one could say he's relatable, but he doesn't necessarily take the leap forward that I would have expected.

In terms of results, Sirius is much older when we meet him, though even in in the epilogue Ron has perhaps not made the necessarry leaps forward, like in how he tells Harry about confounding the driving examiner in the epilogue.

Now in terms of fic, it really depends on where you diverge from and what you do with it.

** Ron and it's not even close.

It's amazing how JUST TWO horrendously OOC portrayals can completely change a character in fandom's eyes.

*** And those two are...? That's a good question, actually, I'd be interested to dig deeper and find out what started it all. Because I can tell for a fact that Ron-bashing (as well as Weasley-bashing in general, but it's a bit rarer) is quite prevalent in non-english fics, too. I honestly never got why that is.

***** Oh, yeah, makes sense. Thanks! For some reason I thought you were talking about some influential portrayals in fanfiction, but in the canon itself it's more logical for sure.

** Ron

If only because Sirius is can be saved by applying "pureblood culture" filter (in fact, a lot of things are made better when that filter is applied...)

**** Woah, there have been quite a few dislikes

I do not disagree that Sirius is often portreyed as a fool. Thing is, there tends to be a nore or less clear split between stories that portray Sirius as a fool, or Ron as a fool

It's usually one or other, at least in my experience. Smarter Sirius tends to trigger conflict with Molly Wesley, and that triggers bad relationship with Wesley clan - in quite a few stories. And not every author balances their dislike and keeping people in character. So in the end one one is shown to be smarter while the other's faults are blown out of proportion

I still think that Ron gets the bad end of the deal, because people tend to blow his jealousy, relative lazy bouts and quick temper out of proportions in many, many cases. Without that many positive qualities Ron does have, to out weight the inflated negatives. And! Without much else but "lack of attention from big family" to explain the negatives

Now, in my experience when same is applied to Sirius - quick temper inflation, rebeliousness etc, a lot if writers at least try and blame the perceived childishness on his stint in Azkaban. And prior that, on him trying to split from his family. Which gives the 'stupid' Sirius at least small grain of that lack of agency that makes the foolishness excuse able

Ron does not get that courtesy

Which, to return to my original post, why I mentioned that "pureblood culture" tag makes even stories that feature foolish! Ron and/or foolish! Sirius -when the writer has the patience to write in heaps of plbackground traditions and culture into their story, even if they go on to make fools out of characters, it does not come across as grotesque as many stories lacking that element do

PS: do Parton any typos, on phone here

***** I totally agree that Ron often get a bad hand that's why i posted it here but that doesn't mean it goes well for Sirius because both are very similar yet very different.

Both want to stand out from there family but there reason are very different and they both made some foolish decision and suffered the burnt. Sirius suffered more and tried harder to make up for it so authors try to make up for what he suffered tend to portray him as something he isn't and that's why they ruin him.

Now coming to Ron, In many peoples eyes he hasn't suffered enough for his mistakes so they try to make up for it and bash him that's why he is also ruined
