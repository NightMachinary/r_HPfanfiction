Be honest. It would be awesome to have the skill of Dumbledore or Voldemort, but would you really have the dedication, discipline, and raw talent necessary to get there?

The way I see it, most of us wouldn't reach that level. I feel like it's similar to real life. We all dream of being special, but a majority of us won't be remember by the history books.

Would it be better if you were a Muggleborn or if you were wizard-raised? As a muggleborn you'd find everything about magic special, and that should motivate you to experiment and study more. But, if wizard-raised, that would give an edge in terms of social, cultural, and general background on magic, making integration into society much easier (and safer).


** That's a very interesting question that I think is rather deeper than it first appears.

A point to consider before answering is what judges magical strength? In canon we're actually given very little that explains exactly why Dumbledore and Voldemort are on a different level to the rest of the population. Fanon has attempted to find solutions, be it magical cores or otherwise, but we don't know the reason. The most widely accepted reasoning is that knowledge is directly equal to power in the Wizarding World. If you read, memorize and, most crucially I think, understand every magical concept and spell then you should be the next Dumbledore. Right?

I'm not sure I fully agree with that theory. I think that magic by nature is a force that defies logic and can't be quantified. Sure knowledge helps, but how in touch you are with the magic coursing through your body, those kind of things are the most important in my mind. In canon a swish and a flick of a wand with a Latin incantation levitates a feather. However we know for a fact that isn't all that is happening, else why wouldn't muggles be able to do the same? No something is happening on another level, whether it's your intent directing a mystical force, or another reason entirely, something is happening beyond just applying the knowledge of what to do. There is something in the witch / wizard that causes reality to shift to their wishes.

To people like Dumbledore and Voldemort reality shifts on a whim. Magic is eager to fill every desire they have, to the point where they don't even need their wands and can achieve the impossible. What gives them that connection? Are they born that way or have they learnt it over their lives? We don't know.

So back to your question. If I woke up in a world of magic tomorrow with an owl giving my Hogwarts letter then I would throw everything I had into magic. Knowing that if I study for just an hour I could turn wood into metal, how could I not? That feeling would never end. I know myself well enough to say that.

The question was though would I ever reach Dumbledore's level? I'm not sure I can simply because I don't believe learning every fact in the Hogwarts library is what makes Dumbledore the wizard he is.

Thanks for this prompt, was a fun thought exercise, let me know your thoughts in return !

*** Yup, I agree with you. This prompt was mainly a response to all those "Harry should've spent 24/7 training so that he could fight Voldemort". Everytime I read those, it's pretty easy to put myself in Harry's place and think 'If I was Harry, I'd become Merlin by always studying!'.

A real word analog, would be somebody like Terence Tao. I could spend all day studying math but I doubt I could ever be better than him.

In the magical world, hard work and intellect helps, a lot. But, I think that some people developed faster (intellectually), or are better at thinking a certain way, which helps with magic. If Dumbledore and Voldemort were muggles, they would probably both be successful in their academic fields, or business.

**** The thing that defines Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort is a truly emotional makeup. Dumbledore and Voldemort are both extremely well educated, and have knowledge of spells most other wizards and witches do not, but they have real true beliefs about things. Dumbledore is incredibly strong willed about what he believes is right.

Harry while being very inexperienced is able to compete up to a point on the sheer magnitude of his ability to really feel. His Patronus being a good example, his failure at the Cruciatus is another as well.

Hermione who is very clever and can learn spells very quickly, but Harry is always shown to be able to perform at a higher level than her, largely because his practical work really touches the semantic and emotional makeup of magic. Not that Hermione is not a powerful witch, cause she is, she's clever and when she gets wound up, she's quite scary.

Ron is shown as powerful in the books as well, and we know that Ron is a pretty emotional dude. That ability to feel evocatively, to express that feeling into the world is shown in very high regard in the novels. Look how poorly Ravenclaws are panned to get an idea of this, even Hermione is bashed in canon for being too much books and cleverness.

Tonks is shown to be negatively effected by her emotional makeup after Sirius, Neville is shown to struggle a great deal, and not just because of a bad wand match, but his lack of confidence make his spellcasting pretty bad.

Ginny is implied to be powerful, and she's another person who has a strong emotional makeup. Draco is shown to be topsy turvy, largely probably because of his inability to know what he really wants. Crab and Goyle are shown to be pretty shit wizards, they are emotionally vacant and dumb to boot.

Basically emotional integrity grants power, Voldemort may be psycho, but his insanity fuels his magic for sure.

Then take a look at the Unforgiveable's. You really have to believe something horrible for them to work. It can't just be, you kind of want them to do something for the Imperio. You truly have to want to completely and utterly dominate them, you have to truly hate to cast the Avada, you have to truly desire the persons suffering for the Cruciatus.

This ability to feel, and express is tied pretty intrinsically to so much magic in the books.

TL;DR: Studying would absolutely help Harry. Probably a whole ton, but its not what makes Harry powerful, its his beliefs, his certainty, and his care.

I jump from thing to thing as soon as i finish it, but i also stay in a theme for awhile too.

I'd probably end up doing my best to master whatever interested me most, but if it became especially frustrating without any progress i'd give up on it and move on to the next thing.

Harry Potter magic has always been so fucking cool to me because of it's ability to create literally everything.

But wouldn't you /want/ to? And really, what would stop anyone from trying?

The easy-to-abuse magic in the /Potter/ verse is part of the reason why it's so hard to write (or find) a crossover that doesn't break the other canon setting or characters. It's part of the reason that indy!Harry stories are so widespread -- canon Harry is frustratingly incurious about magic, and fics like that fill the niche.

But there's literally nothing stopping anyone from becoming vastly powerful in life or even mildly impressive at cocktail parties -- at least not any magical laws of nature (though those of magical Ministries might be a different story). If you have the willpower, the knowledge, the inclination, and, perhaps, at least a thimbleful of raw talent, it seems that you can accomplish a lot ... if you /want/ to.

Most characters in the series don't want to or don't even bother thinking to try, (and, frankly, that's part of the setting because it'd be a very different series if they did). Magic is treated as a mundane tool, not the physics-changing game-breaker that it is. Which is fine, because the /Potter/ verse is based in wonder and whimsical absurdities, not strictly ordered magical systems.

It's also the exact reason that I'd end up getting labeled a Dark Something-or-Other for wanting to maximize the potential of magic. Of course, I'd probably deserve that for min-maxing instead of properly roleplaying, but at least I'd have claimed Mars for all things magical.

*** Exactly my kind of argument, you don't even have to study 24/7 (Hermione's approach to magic as a kind of science doesn't really work - it helps, but in the end that's not how it works for the most part! Your desire plays a huge role as does your confidence that your magic will obey your command - look at Neville, he's a true force of nature (well: Close to it, he's no Dumbledore but he's no slouch either!) after he overcomes his insecurities and confidence issues and he's not done a Hermione to study stuff all the time (except for herbology which is his passion and not strictly magic, it's a subject where knowledge really matters - just like potions, despite the fact that a persons confidence etc. also play a role here (otherwise muggles or squibs could be great at potions!)) in order to be great!

You have to have a passion for something - be it transfiguration (Dumbledore's main interest, we've not seen him use many impressive magics, but his animation charms (when fighting Voldemort at the ministry!) were great...hell, alchemy is a kind of transfiguration, too!), charms or in Harry's case: Defense against the dark arts!

If you have that then your practical spellwork will automatically be better than others (especially if your passion is supported by your need to know - Harry needs defense spells and stuff to survive so his desire/need and his passion (help others and defend himself!) line up here!)

So in the case of one of us:

Wouldn't our desire to learn magic (damned, the power to make even a tiny part of the universe bend to your will completely, even if it's just to break the rules of physics (like gravitation, to levitate a damn feather)? SIGN ME UP!), to show the purebloods (we'd all be muggleborns after all) and to be better than others make us at least better than average? I for one think so and going from there to something like Dumbledore (note: IMHO Dumbledore isn't that powerful, sure he knows a lot and has experience, but even he had to concede against multiple aurors when they tried to arrest him (Voldemort would have fought them and IMHO he is more powerful (maybe because he's insane?), but lacks experience - that's why Dumbledore can beat him, he knows Voldemort's tactics and knows how to fight someone more powerful and even then it's a close call, hell Fawkes the Phoenix has to intercept a killing curse if I remember correctly, otherwise Dumbledore would have been done for!))

**** I'm not sure though, because even though Hermione is much smarter than Harry, he does tend to be able to do the difficult spells easier than her. He can do a patronus in his third year, one strong enough to drive off a hundred dementors. It might be all a matter of will power, but it might not. There are a lot of old wizards and witches, but only one Dumbledore, and it can't be solely because he read and practiced more than other people. Just like there are people that are naturally more athletic - I can practice 10 hours a day but I'll never be a professional athlete - it stands to reason that magical power is also a "talent" of sort.

****** The gist I always got from the books (and I may be completely wrong) is that there is: 1. talent/power - which defines how powerful your spells would be and what's the maximum "cap" of the spells you can perform, and this is what makes Dumbledore and Voldemort and even Harry different. Then there's 2. understanding/intelligence - the ability to grasp complex spells, the nuances of wand movement, the right pronunciation, etc. This is what Hermione has in in spades. I guess reading a lot and accruing knowledge would also come into play here. Then there's 3. aptitude - different people are suited to different magic - Lily to charms, James to transfiguration, Harry to DADA, Neville to herbology, etc. This may be due to personality, to interest, or to an innate "form" of magic. Hermione could brew a polyjuice potion in her second year, but could she invent a whole new potion, like a potion master could? I don't know.

So I always thought how "good" a witch or wizard you were depended on all three (taking into account that you have a suited wand and so on). Not everyone can be as powerful as Dumbledore, since his "cap" is very high. But if he didn't study at all, and took no time to practice, and was generally very lax about his studies, then someone like Hermione might outpace him. Harry, for example, is generally a pretty lazy student. Hermione gets the spells right before him, and she knows a lot more spells. But when he does study and understand the spells, his spells are much more powerful then hers - he summoned his broom from the castle in the tournament, he repelled a hundred dementors with a patronus.

So yeah, that's my two cents.

What examples are there other than the Patronus?

#+end_quote

A number of people only a year or two older than Harry was in PoA were able to learn to cast a corporeal patronus in DA in two sessions (if my memory is correct). Of course, this was under ideal circumstances --- a comfortable room, surrounded by friends. They (Hermione in particular) had trouble casting a Patronus at a Dementor in the Ministry, though she eventually managed it. Since Dementors drain the very emotions needed to cast a Patronus, I think there's strong evidence that the magical ability to cast a Patronus is separate from the personality needed to cast and sustain a strong one in the face of a large number of Dementors. Harry, in particular, with his ability to keep his head under fire and characterized as wearing his his heart on his sleeve, is able to easily muster right feelings once he knows what they are; whereas a perpetual worrier like Hermione would falter, because how can she rejoice without reservation in a world where house-elves are enslaved, blood and money mean more than truth and hard work, and people always wait until the last minute to do their homework unless you nag them, and often not even then? ;)

Also worth noting is that when Harry cast his great Patronus in PoA, the Dementors were on the other side of the lake from him, focused on his past self, so he was outside their aura: he was casting on the "easy mode", and as long as they didn't spot him and he could sustain the right emotions (since wizards don't run out of magic), his Patronus could harass the Dementors as long as it took to chase them away.

I don't think there's particularly good evidence for magical power that's separate from general intelligence, personality, other non-magical traits, and even values. For those characters for whom we get to observe both, magical ability correlates very strongly with general intelligence mediated by personality: in short, we don't see any wizards or witches who are dumb or but powerful or smart but weak; and the overall magical ability of someone like Neville changes greatly over a fairly short period of time through practice and confidence. (Recall, Neville didn't get a new wand until the /end/ of OotP.) So, in the end, there's very little left for the "magical power" variable to explain.

***** How is she "smarter"?

More driven maybe, more used to learning and studying (she probably got praise from her parents for doing well in school - Harry didn't get that! The Dursleys probably didn't like him doing well) and more of a bookworm, but smarter over all?

No, I don't think so (otherwise she'd ended up doing something with all her smarts like going into research etc.)

In a fight I'd think Harry would wipe the floor with her (until she decides which spell to use Harry has nailed her already!)
