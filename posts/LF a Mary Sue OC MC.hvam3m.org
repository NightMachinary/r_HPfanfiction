*** Mary Sue is flawless. Gorgeous in body and mind and soul. She knows things no one else knows, and sees things in ways that no one else can. Mary Sue is every 14-year-old girl's perfect fantasy ideal.

Mary Sue is the original self-insert, and her middle name might be Peggy, but not necessarily. Peggy gives characters a chance at redemption, or straight up re-living the series. Mary can be ready for your admiration at any point in the timeline.
