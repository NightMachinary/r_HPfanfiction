Sad because theres no rant flare.

I would love there to be a story where lily and James realise they were both assholes to severus and pushed him to join voldomort. And so they decided severus should raise harry if anything happens. And so when they do die he adopts harry since he was there that night.

And refuses to allow dumbledor to turn harry into a Martyr, and actually trains harry in magic and teaches him mind magic properly. Also telling him about the proficy(I hate spelling) all before he goes to hogworts, all while still being an actuall father to harry and not constantly deciding to treat him like trash.

Like harry had nightmare or actuall insecuritys and insted of going. (Blah blah blah potter life sucks) he actually sits with his kid and says sometimes bad things happen but you've got me and your friend or somthing.

Like this shit is I'm possible to find half the time

Ah yes, my favourite part of the books: when James holds Snape at wandpoint and makes him call Lily a mudblood. And then Lily forces Snape to study dark magic and believe in pureblood supremacy :( If they weren't such meanies he'd never have joined Voldemort!!! Poor Sevvy. If only he had raised Harry, they could have defeated Voldemort with the power he knows not: poor personal hygiene.

*** Honestly I think people forget that Snape actually believes the shit Voldemort spouts he just feels bad for it. And he doesn't feel bad for it because he is reforming he feels bad because it cost him so much and now works for Dumbledore. Snape still rags on Muggleborns, he still attacks children who were born to the light side of the last war, he still abuses his power. He just at the end of the day reports his findings to Dumbledore rather than Riddle

**** I don't think it's improbable that he reformed at least a bit. When Harry's viewing Snape's memories in DH, Snape tells Phineas Nigellus not to use the word mudblood, for example.

But still, worth noting that he wouldn't have turned if he wasn't getting personally affected. It's a “I never thought leopards would eat MY face” /pikachu face/ kind of thing.

** Ah yes, nothing says “worthy godfather” like a blood supremacist who joined a genocidal terrorist cult of his own volition.

This shit is why Reddit should have laugh reacts.

Because it's utterly nonsensical and drags Snape utterly out of character.

"Hey, one of us was an asshole to you in school and the other one had a fairly understandable response to you insulting her and hanging around with people who wanted to murder her and people like her so you decided to go off and join a group of people who actually did murder people like her and were ultimately responsible for our deaths. Here, have our kid. You know, rather than our friends who know and care about him or an unrelated but loving family who were better prepared to raise him."

So a child soldier instead of a martyr. Is that better?

** There's an author I love who I think writes a very good Snape. She has /not/ written a plot like what you've described, where it's canon up to 1975 but then he reconciles with Lily and adopts Harry --- but she is working on a canon-compliant/ adjacent series that involves a Snape/OC pairing starting around OotP and beyond --- and from there she spun off into an AU fic where Snape was sorted into Gryffindor, and also a fluffy AU where he reconciles with Lily in 1980 and the Potters don't die and he becomes godfather to one of her kids.

Both of those AU's are new and only at 2 chapters each currently. But if you think you'd have any interest, I'd be happy to drop the links.

(Not super interested in getting into a Snape debate with anyone at the moment, btw, just seeing if I can give OP something like what they're looking for.)

  A Comedy of Errors about an Unstoppable Force meeting an Immovable Object  Miranda Rose had always enjoyed more than her share of good luck, which served her well in avoiding the consequences of her frequently impulsive behavior. But when her penchant for risk-taking leads her into the middle of a war---and an entanglement with the enigmatic Severus Snape---her luck may not be enough to save her.
