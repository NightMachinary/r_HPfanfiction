:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's fourth year and the part I remember is Barty crouch is mad eye and there is a seventh year who apparently loves scars and at one point he looks at her and she has “i love you “ written on her eye lids so that when she blinks he sees the words. I don't remember anything else about the fic but that one scene made me laugh when I thought of it so any help is appreciated.


** I believe the story is Triwizard Tales by Clell65619

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

** I remember the scene. Moody (Barty) was getting frantic having this girl chase him. I'll see if I can find it in one of my folders.
