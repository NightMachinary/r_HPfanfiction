**** He probably used his Hogwarts robes most of the time in the Magical World, simply because he didn't have any better choice. We don't really know though, it isn't really mentioned later on.

***** Makes sense. I am pretty sure that it is mentioned somewhere in the summer after third-year that he still wore Dudley's clothes.

****** Goblet of Fire, Chapter 3, while asking to go to the Quidditch World Cup.

#+begin_quote
  ‘How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?' he hissed, his face now a rich plum colour. ‘You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back -‘

  ‘Only after Dudley finished with them,' said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.

******* It never really made sense to me though. At least when he was living for two weeks in the Leaking Cauldron before the third year, why he couldn't go for the shopping spree, when he had money to do so?

******** 1) The minister asked him to stay out of muggle London so he couldn't buy muggle clothes.\\
2) He was probably worried if he had nice things the Dursleys would take them away again or something.

** Which is probably why so many fics have the obligatory massive shopping trip that includes wizarding and muggle shops. And it does make sense that as soon as you were able to get rid of a hated cousin's oversized castoffs you would do so. Plus any potential romantic partner once they realized you weren't trying to make a fashion statement with those castoffs would want to see Harry dressed better/fit for his station etc.

*** That's so common lol. I have seen fics where the authors have literally described all types of muggle clothing Harry bought.

** Well based on what little detail in canon existed until he hit Hogwarts he never received a gift, he never had new clothes, no birthday parties, etc. So it's quite easy to see how authors would go crazy detailing all "new stuff" Harry gets when he becomes aware of the (Potter fortune, potter status, freedom from the Dursleys, etc).

Basically the author in one shopping trip is trying to make up for the 10 years of Harry not being treated like a normal child would by buying him enough stuff so he didn't "miss" out on anything. If he goes on multiple shopping trips especially clothes than it means he has 1 or more female romantic interests who decided they want to "play" with a Harry dress up doll.

** Canonically, Harry never told the Dursleys about his inheritance, as he believed they would overcome their hated of all things magical in order to get to his wealth. I imagine buying new clothes might give it away, although that doesn't explain why he didn't have new clothes for his time in between the Dursley's and school.

** Knowing the style in the 90s was to dress in really tight or very loose fitting clothing. Harry could have been seen as super trendy in some cases.

** It is shown at PS, but I don't remember it being brought up again later, so could either be that he continued to do so (don't even need to be for the Dursley's, could be that he simply didn't see the point since he would spend 10 months of the year completely out of the muggle world and had no reason to interact with anyone beyond the Dursley's during the other two), or could be that he started using better clothes, but JKR didn't see the point In explicitly saying so (which, true enough, is not that big of a plot point).
