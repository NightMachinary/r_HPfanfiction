Any pairing, any content, there's nothing I won't read. I don't care if it's HagridxDumbledore, Misguided!Riddle, or Harry the Sex God Has a Harem. I want to read them all.

HMU!

Crossovers welcome too.

Edit: I've had some awesome recs, thank you all. I've got a list of twenty+ fics that I'll no doubt spend time reading instead of writing my dissertation.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I don't know if I can pick a single fave so here's the top three:

The Secret Language of Plants: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]]

It's funny, and heartbreaking, and so so sweet and incredibly original. This and the author's other piece are the only bits of Drarry that I like. Warning: a lot of characters feel more like they are loose interpretations of their cannon counterparts. Still super good though.

The Changeling: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling]]

God I love this fic. The prose is genuinely wonderful, and honestly it's the best characterisation of Ginny I've ever seen. That said there are a few plot elements that kinda get dropped out of know where much to my disappointment. (The follow called the Armistice Series, is decidely ..... okay. I read it and I enjoyed it but it lacks the stakes of the Changeling and the author isn't great at slice of life writing imo. Still want updates if you see this though!!!!)

Blackpool: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12948481/1/Blackpool]]

This is fic is an absolutely heartwrenching ghost story which might have you questioning your sanity at points. I legit bawled at parts on my first read through.

Honorary mention:

All the Young Dudes: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387]]

If slow burn angsty drama is your thing this is the fic for you. Clocking in at a mammoth half a million words, it's honestly worth the investment. The fic that made me fall in love with Sirius and Remus as a couple.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** The Second String by Eider_Down linkao3(15465966)

A really unique 'Harry time travels to the Marauder Hogwarts era' featuring mostly characters that are often overlooked in canon/fanon. He time travels after 4th year, as opposed to 5th year+ like in most other fics, so Harry doesn't know much of anything important at all yet (the Order, Black family, prophecy, horcruxes, etc.), which was a new setup. Poor kid struggles so much and comes across unique issues. Slash (Harry/Gideon Prewett) comes in MUCH later on.

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][TPP]]

Voldemort becomes a politician instead of a terrorist and basically won. Only purebloods are allowed at hogwarts. Sirius had a son and (fem!)Harry's parents are still alive. Being a half-blood, she has to attend school in America.

The problem is, Harry desperately wants to study potions under Snape (the greatest academic in the field), while her cousin (sirius' son) wants to go to America and study healing, so they switch places.

Harriett Potter ends up attending Hogwarts as Rigel Black, pretending to be a pureblood heir and a boy. Both of which comes with its own set of problems.

Taking sequels into account, the word count is about 1.2m. It's a pretty major AU and a crossover with The Song of the Lioness. It's mostly TSotL's plot adapted to the HP world, characters and setting, so you don't need to know much about TSotL to enjoy it. In my opinion, each year/sequel just keeps getting better.

Hmm...an interesting claim. It's on my follow list, I'm up to date and I do enjoy it, but there are some others I might put on the same pedestal. For example, there's excellent worldbuilding for the previous generation, albeit set in Harry's day, in MarauderLover7's books, starting with linkffn(9469064). Be warned, though, that one's half a million words and /then/ it's time for Harry to go to Hogwarts in book 2.

They're not exactly the same btw. HPBWL is more explicitly about the 'grind' and the magic, while VP so far has more world-building and boarding school elements.

** That's so difficult to say, I've read a lot of them. Here's a few of my completed favorites.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Great heist action, auror drama and plot. School romances don't always work out that well. Epic revenge. Competent characters and no bashing.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Great spellcrafting worldbuilding with tons of creative ideas. /Lux cohaerens!/

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

Scary competent Voldemort VS Harry with respawn ability.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Racist elite pureblood bigots, meet Semtex plastic explosives. What do you mean, your century old manor wards weren't designed for this kind of attack?

Linkffn(Realignment)

Dark Lord Harry VS young Tom mentored by Dumbledore.

*** I've long had mixed opinions of the Arithmancer series. I finally came back and finished it recently, and decided that despite the rather Mary Sue-ish protagonist, it works quite well if you focus on the worldbuilding aspects, and treat Hermione as mostly a storytelling device. She does have occasional character development, but you'll really only enjoy it if you're there to explore what magic can do, like a dragon being defeated with magnesium powder, a video industry based on omnioculars, macro-scale carbon nanotube assembly, sacrificial/exchange ritual magic, and a self-replicating killer robot swarm.

It's going to be the year everything works out for them, and if that means Scorpius keeping his huge crush on his best friend a secret, then that's just what he's going to have to do.It's just a crush. He can get over it well before fifth year is over, can't he?

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

** One of them is definitely [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/index/][Blue Steel by Jeconais]], I can practically see and hear the scenes they're so well written. I love Derek Greengrass, he's hilarious and Astoria and Romilda are just adorable, Krum's parents, the new sport Podska, a surprising take on Daphne, it all just makes for a fabulous, fun, feel great story.

** Most probably the Stygian Trilogy, or the Anguis Series, by Slide.

â€‹

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/438892]]

The Stygian Trilogy is a Post-Canon fic following Albus, Scorpius, Rose etc (but primarily Scorpius) as they deal with a new menace - a strange plague that affects almost everyone at Hogwarts - and it gets really inventive past that point while still retaining a solid feel of the original books.

Anguis is similar in that it feels closely related to the original works in its style, but it's a little more mature in outlook. It follows a group of non-Death Eater Slytherin students during the 1st War, and it's awesome to see the Slytherin tactics and personality but without the evil that JK always tacks on.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  A new year looms on the horizon. A ancient prestigious Tournament is being held at Hogwarts in new form. Harry will show the wizarding world that change can be a really good thing. And perhaps he can find a girlfriend? But what will Dumbledore do to retain his power? Sequel to Forging Destiny

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
