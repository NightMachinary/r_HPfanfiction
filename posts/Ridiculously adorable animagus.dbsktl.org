Harry or someone else tries to become an animagus and they succeed but they don't end up as something necessarily practical but as something only really suited for making girls squeal and coo and cuddle them. A tiny kitten or puppy or baby panda or something in that same category of 'aww adorable!'... maybe it has its uses and they can fly but mostly the only real effect the form has is making people go 'aww'... even people like Bellatrix.

It'd be equally amusing if they somehow found themselves trapped in that form and had to endure all the inevitable attention at while working on trying to find a way to change back but that's optional.


** What's surprising is that school-age Padfoot somehow managed to avoid over-exploiting this to the point where it was inevitable for everyone to find out that he was an animagus.

*** The only person in canon who compliments Snuffles is Dean Thomas, so maybe he looks too scary for most girls and it's usually guys who wind up petting him.

**** That's a much older Padfoot after 12 years Azkaban. Probably better at picking up girls with a bath and a trim and no PTSD from overexposure to soul-sucking demons.

Also probably more interested in picking up girls /when he's a student/ instead of when he's way too old for them, shell-shocked, and focused on getting to Peter while protecting Harry while not drawing too much suspicion or getting eaten by dementors.

** linkffn(The Thief of Hogwarts) Harry grows up to be a thief to Kleptomaniac levels. He later becomes a kitten animagus and Tonks and Fleur fight over him. Its a good fic, gave me some great laughs but unfortunately it is not completed and most likely abandoned. Still is a little over 100k words and you will enjoyed them

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Harry decides it would be a good idea to find out what his Animagus animal was, but when he transforms but can not transform back, things get complicated when he ends up in the hands of Voldemort who refuses to turn him back. How will Harry cope with being Voldemort's pet? Read to find out...

** My idea would be to have Ron turn into a cute small dog because I always figured his form would be a dog, Hermione as a small species of owl (specifically the northern saw whet owl) because I'm tired of fics where she's an otter, and for Harry I'd have him turn into the insanely tiny but deadly poisonous dart frog just to pair this prompt up with another that requested a version of Harry that was skilled at making poisons. I love dark/gray versions of Harry that sides with no one but himself for safety or survival.
