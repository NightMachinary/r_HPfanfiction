I'm not sure if this is even the right subreddit to post this in, but I have a question.\\
Ok so I'm trying to write a Harry Potter fanfic that is as close to cannon as possible (though I'm adding some characters, I want it to be realistic where it can be). I have two questions about my plot and was wondering if anyone could provide any feedback.

1. Is there any possible way that Salazar Slytherin had any remaining descendants besides Tom Riddle? I'd like to make my protagonist (who I'll just call “A” because I haven't fully decided on a name) related to Voldemort and Slytherin because I think that'd probably make it interesting. I can't see how that could work though, which is kind of frustrating. Does anyone have any ideas?
2. As part of my story I also need to have the main character initially placed in the wrong house. Here's what I've got so far:

-Somehow, before the protagonist gets to Hogwarts, Dumbledore is made aware of the fact that they are actually a direct descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Dumbledore (or maybe just the protagonist's grandmother) wants to prevent them from becoming evil or Voldemort finding out about A. Slytherin house is also filled with the children of important families who are loyal to Voldemort (making it far too risky to keep a secret like that), so instead of the sorting hat choosing A's house, they are just put in Hufflepuff (because common sense says Hufflepuff would be the last house someone directly related to Slytherin would belong).

Does this make sense and is it logical enough to work? I need the protagonist to be in the wrong house initially (for plot reasons) but I want there to be a valid reason why, not “just because”. Also, any ideas on how A should find out that they're related to Riddle and Slytherin?
