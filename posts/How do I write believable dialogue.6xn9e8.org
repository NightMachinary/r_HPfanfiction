I am in the process of finally taking care of a plot bunny that has been bugging me for a long time. I have the outline of general plot events, but find myself unable to write convincing and believable dialogue. Any advice would be appreciated!


** First, every character has their own speech cadence and vocabulary. You have to get this right otherwise it just wont ever sound like the character you're writing. For example, snape speaks with a rythm and melodramtic vocab while ron is quite like an ogre but not as bad as crab or goyle.

Then you have to make sure the content of what theyre saying is something they'd say. Dumbledore is a bit mysterious and kinda dances around the point especially around younger children while hermione is super straight forward.

Then you have to make sure what theyre saying is actually interesting to read and not drawn out and rambling unless it's part of the character.

Finally, you have to make sure every line (or most) of dialogue actually advances the scene and plot forward. lots of hellos and hows your day and you left your underwear in the microwave again is really boring to read. They can usually be skipped unless it's necessary.

*** The last paragraph is really important. I can't tell you how many fics I've dropped because a trip to a single shop lasts 10 long paragraphs because the author feels like they need to have:

"Hello, sir."

"Hi, how are you? And call me Harry."

"Okay, Harry, tell me, Harry, what can I do for you today, Harry?" (because you have to insert the name all the time)

"Your best trunk, sir."

"Please, none of that sir business here. My name's Voldemort."

"Voldemort? Any connection to -"

"No, no connection at all to the Dark Lord."

And it will end up being no connection too. I'm exaggerating, obviously, but most of a person's dialogue really needs to have a point. If it can be removed, remove it. If there's no point, foreshadowing, hint, etc etc, just don't have it.

And following from this, ideally your version of that character will change over the course of the story (or may have changed from canon due to changes to the history of the universe from before your story occurs) so you have to ask yourself, not just, "is this what canon Dumbledore would say?" but rather, "is this what my Dumbledore would say?"

** Read it out loud to yourself. It will immediately become apparent when it doesn't sound natural.

Make sure you use contractions unless there's a good reason for a character not to (not native speaker, formal situation). People also speak in sentence fragments and run-on sentences, though I wouldn't overdo that. They also do not use the names of the person they're speaking to very often.

Make sure you use dialog tags often enough that the reader doesn't lose track of which person is speaking. Despite what people are taught in school, the word "said" is virtually invisible to the reader and can't really be overused. Well, it can, but don't go nuts trying to replace it with other things.

** Lots of generic advice in here so far.

The one tip I'd give is that you should remember that people don't just communicate through dialogue. A lot of bad writers forget this and have people just stand around and spout dialogue. If you can incorporate nuanced body language into your characters dialogue then you'll be in the 1%.

** Definitely read it out loud. This will make awkward phrasing very apparent. Also, pay attention to how people actually speak when together in groups.

Think about your character--education level, social strata, general attitude about life. Are they happy-go-lucky? Anxious? Ambitious? All of these will have an effect on the way they speak. Do they have any vocal tics or habits? Do they curse?

When I write or I'm thinking about my current work, I have a lot of arguments in my head. Take notes on interesting words or phrases you hear out in the wild. And of course read, read, read.

Good luck in setting your plot bunny free!

** I recommend narrating a conversation between your characters aloud.

You'll catch mistakes and nuances you wouldn't detect by just writing the dialogue without verbalisation. You'll develop an "inner voice" for your characters that you slip into when you write them.

- Would /this/ character really say this like /that?/

- Wouldn't /this/ person respond like this, instead? No wait, that doesn't sound like him - he'd do /this/ instead of replying...

This inner voice change will become easier to fall into with practice. This is a very good tool in your toolkit for whatever you write in the future.

Perhaps also keep a list of dialogue snippets that your character would say or has said in canon or good fanon, that you can read through to immerse yourself in their way of speaking. This isn't just related to dialogue, you might keep descriptions of their mannerisms i.e. pinching the bridge of their nose and similar behaviours.

Note: also don't worry about crafting perfect dialogue during the first draft. That's silly. Your "internal critic" will be second guessing everything. I recommend completing the first draft as quickly and roughly as you can. By the end you will have a much better internal understanding of how your characters behave, using that understanding you'll be able to better edit/rewrite their dialogue to suit their character.

** Aside from getting the spoken bits right, this is critical: keep the description of the speaker in the same paragraph with their spoken words. If the reader has to constantly backfit who's talking, your dialog will be jarring and hard to read.

You typically start a new paragraph each time you change the speaker. That doesn't mean that you start a paragraph when you open a quote.

To illustrate, don't do this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry was a bit intimidated by the prospect of the Yule Ball.

  "Sounds like this dance is going to be too fancy for me." Hermione was quite excited.

  "I think my dress is gorgeous. I can't wait to surprise everyone." Harry laughed.

  "That sounds great, Hermione, you'll be the belle of the ball."
#+end_quote

I have ditched otherwise entertaining fiction because page after page of that kind of crap just got too tiring to deal with.

** Know your characters! How would they feel talking about this? Would they like it, do they hate it? Would they rather talk about something else? Are they nervous about it, will they try to steer the conversation away from that topic? Do they not quite know how to react? Would they stutter if they get surprised, or do the clam up and not say anything? Are they in a bad mood and this event caught them at a critical moment?

Really try to empathize with your characters and put yourself in their situation. It helps a lot. This is how people have characters who "write themselves".

** I'll chime in OP. The voice really don't matter in the first draft of your story. Don't get your knickers in a twist over that and let it hinder your story telling. You can always come back and polish, but you need to have a turd that needs polishing first. It's useless if you spend half an hour on a sentence because you want to get the dialogue /just right/.

** Remember to actually consider if the dialogue you're writing actually sounds like something someone would say. I've seen authors that write grammatically correct dialogue that's really out of place because it's just not the way people talk. The most common example I can think of is a lack of contractions. Almost everyone is almost always going to say "don't" over "do not" for example, so having a character say "do not" needs to be a decision based on context rather than the default.

** Make sure you know your character's motivations. This tells you what they might want to get out of each situation and so what they'd move the conversation towards. Voldemort wouldn't be helpful, Bellatrix wouldn't be kind and Malfoy wouldn't be polite, why because they aren't motivated to be.

Make sure you know what your characters know. Hindsight is super dangerous. A character bringing up an event or spell they have no right knowing about is immersion breaking. Be realistic about their knowledge and intelligence. This helps you check if your stimulus to move the plot forwards is clunky or if it fits.

Harder things to accomplish are regional dialects and speech patterns. I would recommend avoiding them unless you comfortable with the characters. Hagrid for example has a thick accent and getting it wrong might be worse than not including it.

** Use tag verbs creatively, to add to the context and mood of your dialog. Try to mix them up; don't just repeat "said", "asked" and "replied" endlessly. Sometimes you can skip tag verbs entirely if they don't add anything and it's obvious who's speaking.

*** This is terrible advice.

I just attempted to read A Cadmean Victory and that author is awful with tags. The first several chapters have 'said' in them a total of 1 time, and even then it is appended with an adjective. It made the dialogue incredibly clunky.

Using an extensive range of tags detracts from a story. Skipping tags, yes. Once a dialogues rhythm has been established that's fine to do, and in fact can help dialogue go smoothly, something which eschewing 'said' does the opposite of.
