i recently readed a Ron/Teddy fic. In that Hermione knew that Ron was attracted to men and even offered to invite Partners to their Bedroom so they could share them, but both havent realized it out of fear.

So now im looking for exactly that. Wether they have a Threesome or one is just watching doesnt matter.

Maybe one of the Partners catch them in the act and is shocked (because they didnt know about the bisex.) but than turned on by it.


** I'd also love to read something like this, there really isn't enough bisexual characters. It's so annoying how being bisexual often doesn't even seem to be an option in fanfics.
