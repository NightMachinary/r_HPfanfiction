I loved Harry and Hermiones dynamic in Daughter of a muggle and was wondering if there were any fics where they had a dynamic like that but it was H/Hr. All recs are appreciated.


** Try Elfish Welfare by tyrannicpuppy. It's a WIP that's over 78K words. Basic premise is that a Potter Elf takes little Harry from Godrics Hollow to the Potter Manor. Where Harry is raised and taught by the Elf and the portraits of family members. When he's old enough he attends muggle school where he meets Hermione. They start a friendship and Harry eventually introduces her to magic.

  Halloween 1981 and the Potter family has been attacked. But when Sirius arrives, the crib is empty. Harry is missing, presumed dead, but Mipsy knows the truth. She takes care of little master just as Lord Potter's portrait commands her to.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.
