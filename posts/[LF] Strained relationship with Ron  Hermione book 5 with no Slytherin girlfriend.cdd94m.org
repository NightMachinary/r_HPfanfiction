Let's find a Harry that after his awful time at the Dursley's and lack of communication has a strained relationship with Ron and Hermione.

That could go from not backing up Hermione in Umbridge's class, to outright refusing to do DA.


** Would like to see this, i swear harry let's Ron and sometimes hermoine get away with shit I wouldn't expect from acquaintances, let alone my 'supposed best friends',cadmean victory is close but harry is a tad too edgy.

*** That was my second biggest problem with cadmean victory. The first was how the author truly thought how magic works was super important. It felt like a third of every chapter was filled with it and I got bored quickly

**** Personally, I enjoyed the first half of it, but after that it kind of went downhill a bit. Harry became even more edgy than i thought possible for the fanfic, too many characters were inconsistent (Ron basically became Hermione for a few chapters but Ron went back to being Ron soon after) and too many characters were killed for no reason other than dramatic effect in the last part.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
