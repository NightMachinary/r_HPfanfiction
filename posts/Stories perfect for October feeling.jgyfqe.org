Maybe the setting is in October, maybe it's a scary story, maybe thrilling or anything else, similar.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length, can be old or new. Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes, et cetra. Doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

No Weasley Bashing. I do not like it, when authors have the Weasley's use Harry for his fame and fortune.

I'm fine with male pregnancy, as long as it's not detailed.


** Here is a fic that is entitled "October."

#+begin_quote
  It is not paradox to rewrite history, in the breath of a single moment a universe blooms into existence as another path fades from view, Tom Riddle meets an aberration on the train to Hogwarts and the rest is in flux. AU, time travel, Death!Harry, Tom/Lily and Tom/Harry, not threesome
