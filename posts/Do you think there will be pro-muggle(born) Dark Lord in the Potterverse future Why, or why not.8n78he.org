In the past century alone, there have been two powerful Dark Lords. While both are anti-muggle, Grindelwald is more aligned with subjugation, rather than extermination. So, given how the Wizarding World seems to becoming more and more open to muggle(born) ways, as well as the trials they have been through, do you see the rise of a muggle-born Dark Lord in the near future?

Will a Dark Lord who is pro-muggle and anti-pureblood rise as a byproduct of the prejudice and Wizarding Wars? A witch/wizard who believes that the Wizarding World needs to be dragged (kicking and screaming) into the modern era. Someone is a more nuanced than Grindelwald and significantly more so than Voldemort -- he/she having genuine loyalty from their followers (or even friends), compassion for what he/she deems as "innocent" etc.

If you believe that this will (inevitably) happen in the future of the Potterverse, how would the 'Golden Trio' (I know this is a fanon title) react to such a threat, especially Hermione? If not, could you explain why it wouldn't happen?


** linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts) is this premise exactly where Harry snaps at some Werewolf laws that are being proposed and becomes a Dark Lord that is fighting for equality.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** Just want to point out that while Voldemort and Grindelwald certainly did some bad things, its never stated that they were the only dark wizards/witches to rise to prominence, merely they were the most dangerous or "evil" (JKR word choice there) of all time.

The trouble with history is that when you already know the ending, everything looks obvious at the beginning. "How could people not try to stamp out these dark wizards? They were clearly up to no good before they became major political figures." This is shooting an arrow and painting a bulls-eye around it.

All of the canonical examples of dark wizards, from Voldemort down, do not start off with them enacting a plan to become emperor of the wizarding kind or overthrowing the status quo. Indeed, they appear to start from very small uses of dark magic or experimentation, mainly for some much narrower end. Pettigrew became a dark wizard mainly to preserve himself, and it spiraled from their. Grindelwald experimented with magic until he broke social taboos and/or laws and was ostracized. Riddle held a rather large problem with his thanophobia, so sought a way to make himself immortal.

Any story about a pro-muggle dark wizard rising to power would need to start them in a similar vein. Example, a muggle-born is disenchanted when he discovers he cannot affect any change in the wizarding government without either wealth or status (read: fame). In response, he makes liberal use of mind manipulation (Obliviation, Imperious, etc.) in the muggle world to accrue huge sums of money, which he exchanges for wizard currency. This would give him huge pull in the government, but now that he has already done all that, why stop there? In the immediate post-Deathly Hallows world, the most obvious would be a backlash against prominent members of the government who retained there jobs during the takeover by the Death Eaters. That being said, an idea somewhat similar was done in The Aurors linkffn(The Aurors).

Honestly though, of the trio Hermione has by far the most potential for this. People often mistake her as a by the book follow the rules character, which is not entirely untrue. What they miss is the nature of her personality. Harry has always held some mistrust of authority (Dumbledore aside), so he followed rules when based on his own morality and opinions. While this is problematic in the short term, it means he has personal rules he refuses to break. Hermione has almost the opposite perspective: she follows the rules because she was told it was right. But when her trust in authority wanes, she becomes incredibly vindictive or outright dangerous. When your idea of right and wrong is built on the word of authority figures and books? What happens when it all comes apart at the seams? What happens when you begin to doubt everything you believed? Is it wrong to use dark magic? Is it wrong to manipulate or bribe people?

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** To be honest, I think it's the only non-prequel story worth telling in HP at this point. In the face of the 21st century and all its surveillance and social networking, the magical world could never stay hidden. That inevitability, combined with some moral revulsion over how the magical world hoards possibly the most valuable resources and knowledge of mankind, would create an anti-Statute faction as reliably as the fall of the Statute itself.

** I have to say that Muggleborns are not necessarily pro Muggles, especially if they had bad experiences in the Muggle world. On the other hand, those growing up in the Muggle world tend to not have this pureblood arrogance and often look for solutions the Muggle way, such as Harry in the Books.

I have this plot idea for some time, in which a Muggleborn decided that enough persecution was enough, and that the existing magical establishment had to be destroyed, with the help of Muggles. Once the magical competition was gone, he could in turn rule over Muggles and push whatever agenda he had in mind.

This Dark Lord officially began this career on September 1st, 1998. Through the application of magic, mostly memory charms, he has built one of the world's most dominant corporation by 2018, with direct access to many world leaders. In addition, he had thousands of Muggleborns dissatisfied with Magical world under his command, bound to him by both magical contracts and Muggle legal means.

In 2022, he felt finally ready to make his opening move. His minions smuggled a thermonuclear device to the site of the Quidditch World Cup and detonated it during its final. Up to 20% of world's magical population were killed instantly. At same time, Muggle governments under his influence moved against all strategic magical sites in their countries, aided by Wizards under his direct command.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and most of their clan perished in that attack. Hermione and Albus Potter, who didn't like Quidditch, survived and had to carry on the fight. Many Wizards in his employ were appalled by this atrocity and planning to rebel, despite his restrictive magical contracts. Muggles also dawned upon what was happening, and resistance was forming. Meanwhile, surviving Wizards were now faced with difficult choices how to continue in this dangerous new world.

** In my stories, Grindelwald was like that - he pushed for an "All wizards are equal (and superiour to muggles)" agenda, which appealed to many muggleborns who were discriminated against. After his defeat, there was a backlash against muggleborns, though - since Grindelwald was a dark lord and used the dark arts and cruel, evil means to achieve his goals.

** I /think/ it's Harry Potter And The Prince Of Slytherin, but there's a throwaway line about how 'Dark Lord' is a political label, and shortly after the war Abraxas Malfoy declared a pro-muggleborn politician a Dark Lord and scraped up enough support for himself as Light Lord in opposition. Said politician, not having nearly enough minions to carry off the Dark Lord role, promptly scarpered and is now an official in the Australian Magical Government, causing embarrassment at international summits.
