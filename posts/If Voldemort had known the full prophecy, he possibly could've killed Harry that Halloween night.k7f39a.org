Throughout almost all of fiction, folklore, myth, and legend, trying to fight or control a prophecy is a Bad Idea(TM). You're generally much better off preparing for the prophecy's aftermath or rolling with it to soften the blow, or at least trying to ignore the whole thing. Many prophecies only seem to come about or hold any power over people because those people try to either break the prophecy or make it come out how they want it to.

My thought is this: When Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow, he was trying to repudiate the prophecy about his nemesis, but in so doing he tightened its grip on him and tilted the scales in Harry's favor. By contrast, if he'd known the full text of the prophecy he could have gone with the intent to /fulfill/ the prophecy, acknowledging Harry as having the potential to be his equal before killing him. It might still have ended the same way, but I figure his chances would have been better working with the prophecy rather than against it, though ignoring it entirely seems like it would've been the best plan.


** I actually think the best method for Voldemort to win would be to ignore the prophecy. Dumbledore says that prophecies are all self-fulfilling, so if Voldemort doesn't believe in it, it will never happen.

*** Exactly, they're all self-fulfilling. And the prophecy says that he /will/ mark someone as an equal. It will happen, regardless of what happens. Even if Snape didn't hear the prophecy it would end up making its way to Voldy, who would have to cause it to happen. He doesn't have a choice in the matter.

***** Alternately, self-fulfilling prophecies are only made if they will be fulfilled. If Voldemort had been the sort of person who would ignore the prophecy, then the prophecy would not have been told; and if Severus would have been able to overhear the entire thing, then again, the prophecy would not have been told.

******* More like, he asked a leading question. Dumbledore has big “I didn't /technically/ lie to you” vibes, and of course there are prophecies which may not have been fulfilled /yet/. I think there's grounds for readers to interpret things in either direction.

** So, if he never heard about the prophecy, he wouldn't have even tried to Kill James, Lilly, and Harry, and he would have gone on gathering follwerers, and a war would have come a lot sooner.

** If Riddle knows the whole thing, the smart thing to do is to ignore both kids. That way he can't mark them as equals, that's the defining feature. Or maybe he can figure out a way to kill them both at the same time, that might work.

** Reminder that prophecies in HP are not binding at all; the reason it was fulfilled is because Harry could never live in world with Voldemort around. If Voldemort had just ignored the prophecy, it would have gone unfulfilled. Prophecies are basically fancy predictions. It's why most of them are unfulfilled in the DoM.

  “No, it doesn't!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, *“You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”* “But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means ---” “*If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”\*

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! *Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”* Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. *“I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.*”

*** Could just be Dumbledore leading Harry on, and goading the child to find his own impetus rather than trusting in prophecy and becoming complacent. A little of 'Column A and column B' situation, really, especially coming from Dumbledore. It's a prophecy, and while it doesn't have to be fulfilled, it definitely indicates powerful magic at work, magic that has a sort of mind of its own and determines fates. It also distracts Harry from all the things Dumbledore has done to influence and redirect Harry's life, as if this is really Harry's decision to face Voldemort. It was never Harry's decision, that was thrust upon him like so many other things, whether he wanted it or not.

*** As I said, one of the best responses to a prophecy can be ignoring it. Acting on it, no matter the intent, only makes it more real.

** Ignoring should be the only solution. Prophecy tells him, he'd mark one of them as an equal. He could, of course, view that as a symbolic mark. Either way I think he avoids Harry/Neville like he did Dumbledore or sends a proxy. I can see him saying "if he's not marked as an equal, he can die by any hand."

** Or even if he'd known the first part, but went about acting on it in a different way - like levitating himself to baby Harry's bedroom window instead walking in the front door, so Lily never got the chance to sacrifice herself... like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13727538/1/The-Night-is-Dark-and-Full-of-Terrors][here!]]
