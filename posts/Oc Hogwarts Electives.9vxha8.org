So I'm planning on writing some fan fiction, and while other classes would still be there. (As I don't need to world build as much) I'm thinking it would be fun to focus more on some electives that are within the canon but a bit off from the norm. Like Muggle pop culture, Wand repair, cooking with magic etc.

I'm only asking because I don't want it to seem like some "gary stu".


** Mostly reposting what I wrote in the other thread:

Muggle pop culture feels a bit out of place at Hogwarts, at least in separate class. I rather think it might be covered in muggle studies. Wand repair appears to require very specific wandmaking skills, so you might want to replace it with a general wandlore class. Magical cooking classes sound like fun and could work as an extracurricular activity as well.

I also think Alchemy would be an interesting elective class. Another elective could cover the creation of magical artefacts. And some music or theatre related extracurricular activities would fit in too, I think, especially if you give it a little magical twist.

You could also relegate Astronomy to elective class to make room for another core class if you want to mix things up a little.

*** Thanks, I meant to reply to you in the other thread.

Wandlore sounds like a good idea, and the other ideas are good as well.

** Ok here's some ideas:

Magical cultures of the world: brief overviews of contemporary wizarding societies and a bit of their history (contrasted against the Britain/European centric History of Magic). May also include non-humans. Could include having a penpal, or 6/7th years could go on an end of year/summer trip.

Geomancy: study of magical properties of stone/crystals/soil/metals etc. If you wish to include leylines into the HP world then this would be where. A bit of application to herbology, mostly for enchanting certain metals and whatnot, maybe some architectural applications.

** Sounds interesting! This might be the language nerd in me speaking, but I personally have always thought that it would be awesome for Hogwarts to offer some language classes, both non-magical (i.e. Latin) or magical (such as Mermish, Gobbledegook, or rudimentary Troll etc).

Other than that, some general magic classes like warding or spellcrafting? Or healing? They're still pretty general but might be fun.

You could always really divert from canon and try and make a new magical field, such as musical magic or using magical weaponry (think flaming swords, enchanted arrows etc). Or take a traditionally thought 'dark' area of magic and make it legal and explore it more in your fic, such as blood magics and rituals. Hope this helps!

*** Technically, Ancient Runes is just a language class, but I still agree overall.

**** True, I concede. I wish they'd done more with Ancient Runes in canon, and find some more practical applications with it. That's probably what I would wish for with the other languages I listed - more practicality and use in magic, rather than just studying ancient texts. There was a lovely fic I read once called The Spellmaker, which really dived into Latin and spellcrafting using it. I suppose what I'm really getting at is a more practical and inventive approach to the use of language in magic

** art or music would be good, especially if you have personal experience in either to bring to the table in creating a wizarding version of it

like, photography is obviously a thing in the wizarding world. ive seen interpretations of it that treat wizarding photographs like the paintings at hogwarts, and ive seen others that make wizard photos into little portable gifs, with a repeating scene.

further drawing on classes from my highschool, theres also stuff like woodshop or welding. maybe arthur weasley learned the skills to do the expansions to the burrow from his hogwarts electives.
