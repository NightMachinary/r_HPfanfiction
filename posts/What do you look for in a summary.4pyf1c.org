** Never write "I suck at summaries" or "story is better than it sounds" or a question or imply some sort of suspense (e.g. "What will X do?" or "Will X do Y in time?"). Those are automatic turn-offs.

*** Too many "hire"s toward the end. Overusing a single word like that generally only works in a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02TrMrbxPxs][comedic summary]]; it's just comes off as awkward in any other situation. It's a good summary, but it would be better if you could substitute the first two hires with synonyms. Like:

"Harry Potter quit being an auror after one too many death eaters went free. Now he's freelance. If you can find him, you might secure the services of Harry Potter, Auror for Hire."

**** 'Harry Potter, Auror for Hire' is the title in my head so I'd drop the first from second sentence--maybe change it to ''Now he's a private dick." because I imagined it as a fusion of Shaft and A-Team crossed with Harry Potter--but I'd leave the second hire before the title of the story because it feels thematically right.

** I was replying to [[/u/gotkate86]], but I thought this might be helpful to OP as well.

I don't think you need to add the genre if the site you're posting on already has that included for each fic (like FFN does, as well as AO3, I believe). If it's something for LJ or another site that doesn't include this information, then yes, please tell us what genre it is.

I find it especially helpful if the summary has what "trope" the story is. For example, Animagus!harry, marriage law, muggle AU etc. I don't know about others, but I like to type in a trope while limiting my search to a specific character to find fics. Of course, if you're using AO3, don't bother with that in the summary. The tags are really helpful in telling what a story will be about.

*** Yeah, not only is it cliche, I always think to myself "bitch I'm /reading/ a fanfic not /watching/ a TV show." Another bad one is "Follow 'Character' as they take 'Setting' by storm!", it's incredibly cliche and tells me nothing of what the fic is about aside from the fact that it is probably a massive cliche-ridden crap-fest. Summaries that tease their major divergent event but don't tell what that is are also a major turn-off.

EDIT: Summaries with repetitive statements of "what if?" are also incredibly annoying.

EDIT2ElectricBoogaloo: Gosh, I'm looking for a new fic to read and keep getting reminded of more terrible summary tropes to list here: Summaries that are just a philosophical statement rather than an actual summary.

** I hate it when the summary ONLY is an excerpt from the fic. Usually that's not descriptive enough. Ideally the summary will include the basic premise of the fic, who the main characters are, if it's AU from one of the books or post hogwarts or whatever else and something to indicate genre (romance, adventure, comedy etc) which can just be outright saying it or can be done with tone.

** It should tell me where the story starts and in what general direction it's going. Let's go through some examples:

#+begin_quote
  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
#+end_quote

This suggests the story will be about Harry, will have science and sci-fi influences, and will emphasize magic applied in hopefully novel ways. It tells us that it starts at first year, roughly. Reading the story, it fulfills that. Pretty good, but the part about new friends kind of drags on and is phrased a bit blandly. Exceeds expectations.

#+begin_quote
  Harry makes a decision at the train platform at the end of year 5. Two little words change lives forever.
#+end_quote

This fic is probably about Harry. Probably from his POV or the POV of a love interest. It's set at the end of year five. I'd guess it's about some sort of romance. Turns out there is romance in the story, but it's unrelated to the summary, and it is indeed from Harry's POV. But no points for that part, since something like 95% of HP fanfiction is from Harry's POV. Poor.

#+begin_quote
  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
#+end_quote

A vague hint, trying to evoke curiosity and mystery. It indicates that we're following Harry and that it's going for the Tournament, and it suggests the Tournament will be reworked.

Trying too hard but basically okay. Acceptable.

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
#+end_quote

Kind of a cheerful tone that clashes with the story itself. Vague. We know that the world's scheduled to end and that we're probably following Harry. Poor.

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE: AU: JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by the Avada Kedavra cast at him. But how would things have gone if it had been different? Drabble series, five drabbles per chapter.
#+end_quote

Clear, but it doesn't get to the point as fast as we'd like. "COMPLETE: AU:" probably isn't necessary. We probably don't need to know that it's a drabble series in the summary. But we can intuit that it's about Harry and that something interesting happened to him as a result of being hit with the Killing Curse. Clear, just not well written. Acceptable.

#+begin_quote
  A gift from his uncle Vernon gives Harry a new way to fight the Dark Lord
#+end_quote

It's about Harry and the fight with Voldemort (as opposed to, say, the Tournament, or time, or growing up with disabilities). It gives chapter 1 spoilers. Acceptable.

Unfortunately, the skills required to write a good story are only tangentially related to those required to write a good summary.

** Indicative of the quality of the story in grammar. If it is bad and the story is bad, then I saved time by not needing to even read the first line.

Should actually summarize/tease the story, not be unrelated as others have complained about.

If the author chooses not to take advantage of character and pairing options in the story parameters, and a pairing is featured that isn't a spoiler, it ought to be in the summary, or at the top of the first chapter.

If you don't know enough about the direction of your story to write a summary, you may want to think about it a bit more before you write the summary and upload the first chapter. For some stories, the premise is enough, but I've read way too many stories that start off in a normal enough manner just to take a hard right a couple chapters in with no hint in the summary. No one wants to waste time on something when they could have been forewarned.

A little bit about what's happening in the story is helpful of course (if I just browse it's the summary after all that will draw me in - or not!)
