** There was this amazing illustrated fic about Narcissa. It was absolutely beautiful, the entire thing was done in watercolours. I can't imagine the amount of time that went into the fic but the author's unfortunately taken the entire thing down :(

Was called The Death of Narcissa Black. By far my favourite fanfic ever, never seen anything like it.

** Ahhh damn. I remember saving a story about how I think it's 20 years later Harry's messing around the Veil and falls(pulled?) in. He and Sirius end up in an alternate dimension where Voldemort's still around, but so is James and Lily and family. It's a mostly humorous story, but there are some parts I really enjoyed. Harry's eventual confrontation between these alternate parents of his was my favorite. I can't recall the title, though I remember it was near the top on FF.net if you searched for Sirius or was it Tonks... Anyways can't find it in my favorites anymore.
