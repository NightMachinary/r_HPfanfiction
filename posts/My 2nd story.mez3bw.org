Working on my 2nd HP fanfic (nothing posted yet). I'm about 60k words into it. A story about Ron the Hero. Wait... Ron?! Also baby!Albus and baby!Riddle. Very AU and crack-a-licious. fanfiction dot net name is 'Advait' and 'm3110w' on AO3.


** I don't see the point of a self promo post when the fic hasn't been uploaded yet

*** I don't see the point of a self-promo here, period. For me it is usually the best warning what not to read, when the author is so desperate, that he doesn't trust his work to be good enough to find its readers.

** --- "Self-promotion is allowed and encouraged!" -The Moderators. --- So I'm just following what the moderators recommend. I like this thread so I want to keep the moderators happy. I've found a number of great authors and fics that were self-promoted. Similar to publishers doing promotions before a book goes on sale.
