Anybody ever red this fic?

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6048]]

I've been looking at it for a while in my library but never ventured into it. It's 1.3 Million words and I don't want to go in on it alone. The summary seems okay, but idk...


** God i hope its good, I never knew I needed this crossover

** It has a lot of extra magic on top of what was shown in canon so that is a plus.

I personally don't like drama so it was not for me but if you like drama then you can give it a shot.

It has a really competent Order and Ministry from what I recall.

** Have tried on several occasions to read but it feels like it stagnates in the middle with bland storytelling compared to earlier or just drones on and on with little actually being done as it packs itself with fluff of little to no importance.

*** Seems to end to me? The info says completed, the last chapter's author notes say thanks for coming along for the ride and all the betas, and the last line is FIN.

** So this is not a crossover with the notable scifi movie the Fifth Element and does not have Harry replacing Bruce Willis and obtaining through a plot ordained confluence of events the Gun?

I am kinda disappointed because now I want it.
