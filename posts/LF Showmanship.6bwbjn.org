I'd like to see fics where Harry doesn't hide from everyone and try to stay out of the spot light but isn't an arrogant bastard either. I want a fic where he isn't super powerful but knows how to use magic in ways that make him appear powerful. Basically he learns showmanship and flashy magic that intimidates his enemies. Like how Voldemort uses fear to win, Harry uses fear/showmanship to win.
