When I first entered the fandom (2012ish) Dramione was my top pairing.. I read pretty much every Dramione fic worth reading on AO3 and FFNet. In the last few years, I have barely read any. So could people rec me the best Draco/Hermione Fics that were published recently (say since 2016)? Thanks ðŸ˜Š

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23296162]]) Draco accepts Dumbledore's offer and joins the Horcrux hunt. Good redemption arc and doesn't just repeat the canon events.
