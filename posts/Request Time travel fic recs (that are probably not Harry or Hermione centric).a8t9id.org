I'm on a bit of a time travel fanfic kick at the moment. I've seen a fair number of Harry or Hermione centric fics where they are the one traveling to the past/future/alternate reality... but not so much with other characters.

I recently came across this one, 'A Bad Death Eater Gone Good' only to be sad when I realized it was last updated a couple years ago... and now I'm keen to find more - preferably with Draco being the one who time traveled.

Any recommendations? Preferably with characters in character, long and completed? That or doesn't seem to be abandoned. I'm not too fussed about pairings as long as, again, they are decently realistic. OOC-ness is the biggest turn off, for me.

That said I'm still very, very open to being linked good fics that are Hermione or Harry based -- I just think I may have potentially read the good ones already. But I could also be completely wrong, given that finding fics nowadays is like looking for a needle in a haystack...

Thank you!

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  This drabble was written a while ago on the question what would happen if Ron Weasley got the chance to go back in time. Slight Ron bashing. Please note this is a oneshot and will not be added to.
