Why isn't tea-drinking used more often in fanfiction? As a Brit, though I don't really drink tea, it is an essential part of our culture. A "cuppa" is offered quite frequently to friends, family, or anybody really.


** Because wizarding culture split off from Muggle culture with the Statute of Secrecy in 1692, British wizards never took advantage of the influx of cheap tea that the East India Company imported in the mid 1700s (going from an average of 800,000 pounds in 1710 to over four million pounds in 1757) and still prefer coffee.

**** I was being flippant, but the history of Britain and America's obsession with caffeinated beverages is really interesting. I would (and have, in a recent thread) highly recommend Tom Standage's "A History of the World in Six Glasses."

** Probably because many fics are written by Americans who underestimate the cultural significance of tea, and also because the books themselves never really emphasized that aspect of British culture.

  "Um, we're in a dream." She pointed out as he sat down, feeling uncomfortable by the abrupt departure from their admittedly weird, borderline domestic routine. "We don't actually need to eat or drink anything."

  "We are British." He replied blandly. "That means when things are difficult we drink tea."

** One of the most commons Americanisms is whole population of Hogwarts drinking coffee for the morning. I am willing to accept only Snape as an exception, because he is exceptionally bitter person, but otherwise most people should drink tea.

** Maybe because a lot of fics are written by youthful folks who don't really think about mundane things like tea when they can be writing bangs and flashes and snogging? I don't know. I'm old and use it quite a lot in my fics.

** I always give my characters specific tea preferences, even if I don't end up writing about them drinking it (though I usually do).

Sirius is a cheap instant coffee guy and drinks it by the gallon. Remus likes a builder's brew (black tea with milk and two sugars) but only drinks Yorkshire Tea. Peter prefers Tetley's - they have frequent arguments and keep their own stash of teabags in their dormitory. James drinks loose leaf Earl Grey with a slice of lemon because he spent way too much time at old ladies' tea parties with his mum when he was a kid. All of them complain about the breakfast offerings at Hogwarts.

** I make a point to have my characters drink a lot of tea, but being an American, I have no idea if they're doing it right. Here are Regulus Black and Remus Lupin, having tea in Greyback's werewolf encampment:

“Milk?” asked Remus, puttering with a pretty tea set.

Black stared. “Werewolves drink tea?”

“No, we usually just drink human blood. I like mine with a squeeze of lemon.” When Black turned even paler, Remus laughed. “I'm just messing with you, Black. Sorry, it's hard to resist. You look so like Sirius, I have to remind myself that you're different. Milk?”

“No thank you. Any news of the blood traitor?”

“Which one?”

“You know which one.”

“Your brother?”

“Sirius isn't my brother! He's made that very clear. But yes, Sirius. Is he all right?”

“How should I know?”

“Did you see him at the battle in Hogsmeade?”

“No. I spent most of that battle unconscious. Why do you care?”

“The Dark Lord commanded me to kill the blood traitor. I tried, I think I managed to knock him off his broom, but I don't know what became of him after that. He may have survived. The Dark Lord is displeased. That must be why he's assigned me this...” He looked around the tent, his lips twisted in disgust.

“You have my sympathy,” said Remus dryly. “But let's stay focused on our assignment. Sugar?”

“What?”

“For your tea.”

“Oh.” Black thought for longer than the question seemed to require. “Yes please.” He sat on one of the rickety folding chairs after looking at it suspiciously. When he received his tea, he looked at it with trepidation, and didn't drink. “I must say, I'm surprised to see you working for Greyback. I always thought you were Dumbledore's man.”

“It looked like that, didn't it?” said Remus, warming his hands around his teacup. “But I've always been Greyback's wolf.” He fixed his eyes on Black. “Did Snape tell you what Sirius did to me?”

#+end_quote

That's a different tea:

#+begin_quote
  There was no Christmas tea today, as the ball included a feast, so at seven o'clock, when it had become hard to aim properly, the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room. The Fat Lady was sitting in her frame with her friend Violet from downstairs, both of them extremely tipsy, empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom of her picture.
#+end_quote

In addition to the drink, "tea" can also mean "the third meal of the day".

** Because the British are, for the most part, tea purists who don't like the interesting blends where the tea is refined with fruits or other interesting additions. At least that's what I have been told in the Britpicking threads here. People have heard of green tea, but it's not the norm to drink it.

That being said, in one of my fics I turned Madam Puddifoot's into a normal tea shop which is quite nice as long as you don't go on Valentine's Day.

*** I wouldn't consider the British tea snobs - they have their cuppa, but that's not snobbish at all. More snobbish is what you'll find with green tea/oolong/puerh drinkers more often - the whole use of loose leaf tea, not wanting blends, precise water temp, etc.

All of which I find tastes much better than fruit blends, but it does come across as rather snobbish ;)

**** Well, perhaps purist is the better term, despite its negative connotations. What I mean to say is that the British come across as rather boring when it comes to the more creative varieties. I've seen broader selections in a Polish supermarket in London than in the British chains.
