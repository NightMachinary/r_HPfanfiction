Hi all!

I'm new to HP fanfic (and fanfic in general), I just came across this sub recently and finally started reading my first story through here a few days ago but I've lost it! Can anyone help?

Harry wakes up in the dorm, Hermione is in bed with Ron, they both get up and go for a walk then to madam pomfrey where he finds a huge black mark over his heart.

It was written well enough for me to feel like it was a continuation of the actual books! I'm so excited because for years I've always felt at a loss of what to read after finishing the series.

Anyway, started it then can't find it again to keep reading.

Another thought, I hate reading on my phone - have any been published in physical form?


** I don't know how to link but it sounds like These Cuts I Have by Melindaleo on ff.net. An awesome story by an amazing writer!

*** That wasn't what I was looking for but it's even better! I'm only one page in and it's so sad and well written. Thank you!

*** That fic definitely has the black mark described, though it doesn't have Ron and Hermione sharing a bed that night. The link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317075/1/These-Cuts-I-Have][These Cuts I Have]] linkffn(11317075). It also has a sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12787674/1/Some-Cuts-Leave-Scars][Some Cuts Leave Scars]] linkffn(12787674).

** What were you reading the fic on? Phone (I'm assuming based on your last comment), Computer, App? [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], AO3 or somewhere else? You should be able to check your browser history to find it if it was recent.

Do you remember much else? Did they specifically call it a black mark? Reason I'm asking is I'm usually pretty good at tracking down fics but searching for 'black mark' is bringing up all of the fics that say 'dark mark' which is unfortunately not going to narrow it down at all.

*** It was a link I opened on my phone through the reddit app , unfortunately I didn't open it in safari so it's not in my history, gah! I think it was in the fanfic website as there were suggestions for other stories at the bottom of the page. Hmm it was only discovered by madam pomfrey and described as a sort of black veiny mark from what I can recall! He awakes, Hermione is in ron's bed next to him they go get some toast then walk to the lake then to madam pomfrey then back to the lake I think, then Ron finds them. That's as far as I got. I've just started these cuts I have and in thre it's described as a lightning shape like his forehead so not the same story but it's really good so far!

Edit: just saw someone found it:fulfilling obligations. Though I'm really enjoying these cuts I have!!

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.
