So I'm about 80% sure this fic has been taken off ffnet since I've been looking for it for years by using specific term search in google and scouring the grey harry communities and never found it, but even just hearing someone else who read it would be very nice. I actually remember a fair amount from it, so I'll just list all of the relevant details off in what i hope is chronological order.

I'm fairly certain that it's a HPB AU, set after 5th year (also think Sirius died)

The earliest scene I can remember is Harry standing by Hogwarts, and he literally tears it from the ground and floats it to some island.

He lets students stay in the now relocated castle (including Malfoy), and there's a scene where they are in the entry hall or smth and there's a glowing floating orb and they have to touch the orb to see if they are trustworthy or not. Hermione and Ron don't go to the castle at first, but I'm pretty sure Hermione sends an owl and goes later on in the story.

This is where things get fuzzy and I can't tell what order it happened in. In no particular order, the scenes I remember are:

Giant stone dragons possessed by the souls of the Hogwarts founders

Harry claiming himself to be the heir of slytherin at some point (not actually the heir, I think he claims the power because he bested Voldie when he was a baby)

Slytherin being a glowing floating orb talking to Voldie in his mansion

Seamus being on a ship and fighting Dumbledore/Voldie's ships

There being a dock where Dumbledore and Snape go talk to Harry and I think Snape chooses to stay

Madeye choosing to stay

Ginny being there

Luna being the weapons department expert where she makes robotic weapons and has metal spiders guarding her R&D area.

And last but not least, I remember that it had insanely long paragraphs. And I mean long. A page worth of information in one paragraph.

As you can see, I remember a fair amount, but have never been able to find it again despite extensive effort, leading me to believe that it has been taken from FFnet.

Any help is very appreciated!


** I think I've read something like this before.

Is it "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567429/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Power-of-Revenge][Harry Potter and the Power of Revenge]]" by God of Death and Disease?

A mere pittance in Harry Potter fanfics.

*** I'm in awe. I've been searching for this fic for upwards of 5 years by now, using every method I knew of, with absolutely zero luck. You sir, found it in less than 4 hours. I am so appreciative of this, you have no idea. It's like an itch that had been incessantly bothering me for half a decade has finally been scratched, and it feels amazing. You deserve everything in the world, including gold, which I would gladly give to you if I had the money, but as a broke 18 year old, I do not. I am so very sorry.

Do not be surprised if you receive gold a year from now when you least expect it.

(And I am aware of how terrible this fic is, by this point the fumes of my burning anger and rage from years past were what fueled my search. I have need of them no longer, they can finally rest.)
