:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Things I remember:

- Ginny cheated on Harry so he deliberately took an international mission to get away from her.
- While he was in France, he met Gabrielle who was a Healer.
- Ginny got drunk at a reunion and confronted Gabrielle.

I know this isn't much information but please help me out, it's been bugging me for a week now.

Thank you so much!


** It's not the fic you're looking for but linkffn ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11326267/1/]]) is an amazing Harry/Gabby Fic.

** I feel like I've read that one too. Not finding it on FF, I'm going to try AO3. Do you remember about how old the fic is?

**** Yeah I realised it wasn't right. I think I mixed up two different ones in my head, I'm pretty sure I've also read the one you asked for.

*** That's obviously not it. Hell, that can't even really be called a Harry/Gabrielle story, either.

**** It fits the first two points entirely, I just assumed it met the third one from my memory of it. Sorry for insulting your supreme intelligence on the matter.
