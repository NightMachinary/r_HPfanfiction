I'm looking for recommendations for great romance fics, I have no problem with Smut/"Lemons".

What I'd like to see is well written character driven fics, well written characters and realistic actions. I'm not that interested in soul bonds/marrige contacts and the like unless it's done extremely well(there are certainly fics that do it well), usually its a weak replacement for character interaction rather than simply forcing a start of interaction.

Here are some examples of fics I've enjoyed in this vein. Easier To Be - [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4641003/1]]

Vitam Paramus - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus]]

The Half-Blood Romantic - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12627473/1/The-Half-Blood-Romantic]]

Days to Come - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come]]

Half awake and almost there - [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861]]

Letters - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/6/Letters]]

I know some these aren't solely romance based but they have some very well done romance in them. Any fic suggestions are appreciated.


** It's funny to me that two of my fics are listed, and neither of them are the one story I actually focused on the Romance rather than the things going on around the character.

*** Just because the romance wasn't the focus doesn't mean it wasn't done well. I'm not simply looking for romance based fics but good fics with well done romance in them appeal to me as well. Out of curiosity which of your fics is the purely romance focused one? I can't claim to have read all your fics yet.

Also I have to say I'm currently enjoying the fuck out of Limpieza de Sangre, checking everyday for an update, I've already reread it and I only found it last week. I can't wait to see how it develops, what an incredible Voldemort, and what a great way to develop Harry's shifting world view.

**** I don't know what happened, but the writing quality of Limpieza de Sangre has massively plummeted in the last few chapters. The prose wasn't ever great, but it was alright. Now I can barely read through it.

** There's the "Power of love" series, which has a fem!Harry/Hermione pairing and a lot of focus on the characters. I didn't like that they stayed in the closet due to social pressure, because frankly after all that Harry/Jasmine has been through, I doubt that they would care about that, but the story was good nonetheless, although the Veela culture was heavy AU.

** Those are great examples! Romance is also one of my favorite genres, particularly post-Hogwarts romances. I read primarily H/G and you've already mentioned some of my favorites from other pairings, so I'll give you some of my personal favorites:

My first suggestion would be to explore more work by the authors you linked, who are very talented. Hgfan1111 has a [[http://www.perusingtheshelves.com/fanfiction/harry-potter-fanfiction/60/][ton of stories]] ranging from good to excellent, though you'll have to create an account and download them. I'll recommend Away From The Sun, Brighter Than Sunshine, and Gravity but read any of them and you probably won't be disappointed. As you can guess, they're pretty much all H/G romances.

Annerb is awesome too, so definitely keep up with her work if you haven't already. Her classic is The Changeling, a Ginny-focused bildungsroman/political drama. It has two sequels (one complete, one WIP) which feature a mostly post-Hogwarts romance with Harry. She also has a new fic, gone was any trace of you, where adult Harry loses most of his memories, published just before Christmas. It's a bit short, but I think it's arguably her best work yet (angsty romance with more body language than dialogue).

linkffn(6919395; 12569750; 12713008; 12766983)

Foolish by Tonksaholic is fantastic and really doesn't get nearly enough love. It's similar to most of hgfan1111's work in tone - adult protagonists, moderate angst, they're neighbors / housemates, etc. Another awesome work is Yellow Submarine by Deadwoodpecker (also the author of the very popular Backwards With Purpose series). Another case where the less popular fic is probably the best, Yellow Submarine has the best professor!Harry romance (with a 7th year Ginny) in the fandom (I should mention it's pretty dark).

Lastly, I'll throw in a rec from a pairing I don't read much: The Malfoy Case by natida is too good to miss. It's a courtroom / crime drama set after the war featuring a Draco/Astoria pairing with Astoria as Draco's lawyer. The romance is a slow burn and there's a great plot which keeps the stakes high and the central relationship complex and layered.
