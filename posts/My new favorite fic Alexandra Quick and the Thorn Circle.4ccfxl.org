When I first picked this fic up, I was absolutely stunned. The environment feels /tangible/, the characters are /realistic/. Kids act like /kids/ and adults like adults. It's not Harry-centric - in fact, it's a completely different story and only shares the universe with Harry Potter - which makes it a refreshing read.

It reminds me of Rowling's own PoA, in some ways, and in other ways, I think it actually exceeds PoA.

It's a slow-burning fic. It's probably the best-written fic I've ever come across in this fandom, easily published-novel quality, I think.

It's quite creative, without being overdone. It's refreshing, absent of cliches, and has an intriguing plot.

(And this is coming from someone that religiously sticks to Harry-centric fics!)

I was instantly reminded of my childhood, reading the main character.

I /highly/ recommend this, and I'm someone that is uncomfortable with OCs and usually /hates/ fics set in America.

** Alexandra Quick definitely gets a lot of love around here, and I'm sure it's a great story but I could never bring myself to read it.

I read HP fanfiction because of the characters I fell in love with during the course of the seven books, and reading a story that features exactly none of them would defeat the purpose.

*** I think one thing I liked about reading Alexandra Quick was that it was like reading a brand-new book, just with some lore I'm familiar with (eg. magic system and whatnot).

While I, too, read fanfiction because of the characters from the seven books, I treated this fic like an entirely new book, and I found myself falling in love with the characters from Alexandra Quick, too.

**** I figured as much, but it wouldn't feel right reading a story even with only some shared lore. At that point I'd rather the author just pull a Twilight and remove it from HP completely, that way I'm not actively comparing it to HP every time I see a spell I know etc.

** Having read the entire AQ series thus far, I personally... hate it. I find Alexandra to be, in kind words, a brat. I disliked the concepts of otherworld(s) introduced, and I didnt like the areas introduced.

That being said; I will not deny that this work is easily the best written, most character driven, masterwork that the fandom has produced thus far. I will not deny that I dislike it, how ever I give credit where credit is due. Inverarity is as close to a benchmark as exists in the fandom today.

This is one of the reasons I /love/ the series! Some people will like it, some people will hate it. I find it makes Alexandra endearing.

It reminds me of Harry from Shezza's Denarian trilogy, in a way.

**** It's not that she's a brat. It's that she never grows up from it. Actually that's not right either. She has character development in later books, but then always ends up regressing to her reckless, annoying self within a few chapters. It seems like a never ending cycle, really.

But then I also dislike Harry in Shezza's trilogy. A character with neither finesse nor development.

**** Same, except for me, I loved Shezza's Harry because in a way, Harry always could have been that way. (maybe not the whole hit it with fire till its dead mindset) I could totally see a harry who enjoys causing pain. Its a common mindset for those who are abused, and anyone who says Harry wasnt abused is either a liar or way to damn innocent.

Its why I am attached to harry who hates bullies trope. and why it really really irked me that Harry in OotP, didnt help Luna even tho it was obvious that she was being bullied. Even when it was pointed out, Harry did nothing. As someone who had an abusive childhood, and was a person who was super noble, Canon Harry would have wanted to save luna. but no.

Shezza's Harry is about an abused kid latching on to the only one who cares, and that person (or "angel" in this case) telling him that morals are fine, but if some one is in the way, its fine to kill them.

Alexandra, to me seems more to be a brat who never really struggled through her life to justify it. And to be honest, Alexandra to me is way to similar to Harry from OotP and HBP. That harry who doesnt bother solving his issues himself, but waits for the grown ups or Hermione to solve them for him. The moody, woe is me harry who honestly I thought was a waste of my time reading. THAT is what I mean by Alexandra being a brat. In reality I mean she is a moody little girl who needs to realize that every time she preforms magic, she is using one of the most dangerous weapons to have ever been imagined. Harry didnt realize that even after Albus died, and it strained the series. In the first four books we see Harry realizing that magic is a weapon, and a tool. But sometime during the three year summer, JK thought that She needed to turn her story, which up until that point was theme, and fantasy driven, into a character driven story that happened to feature magic. In the end, we have a Harry who I cant really say I enjoyed reading about.

The same is true for Alexandra. it is a character driven work that features magic as a main facet. it is for that reason, and for the reasons above that I dislike Alexandra.

Huh, interesting that you thought this. I just finished the second book a few minutes ago.

To me, throughout the series so far, one of the things I have /loved/ about Alexandra is her /initiative/. She has /so much more/ initiative than Harry, so much more /curiosity/ and drive to do things.

If an idea pops into her head, she's stubborn enough to do it, to experiment with it, often without thinking of the consequences.

I feel that Inverarity does an excellent job here of portraying a curious, stubborn, reckless child in a dangerous world.

****** she does have more initiative, I never faulted her for that. I stated that she was a moody, little girl who needs to realize that whenever she does magic she is using a weapon. I agree that Inverarity does an excellent job portraying her character. However, her character is not someone I personally enjoy reading. If I read the next book, (and in likelyhood I will) it will be because of the writing and the prose. Not because I am attached to the story/characters. If that makes any sense whatsoever lol

**** It's a main character who becomes a friend, not an extension of the reader. Some books you read, and you find yourself living the story through them, others, you live the story with them.

JK is an older woman who wrote about a teen boy the reader mostly lives through. Inverarity is an older guy who wrote about a teen girl you live with. I find it fascinating the insight one has the other doesn't.

** I'm not claiming in any way to reach the level of Alexandra Quick, but I'm writing one of the very few fics out there that are comprised entirely of Original Characters, in a set other than Hogwarts. It's still just beggining, but I have five years worth of complex plot and just as complex characters. If you're interested by fics that use the HP universe but not its universe, you might like it! linkffn(11847019)

** Generally agreed: the world Alexandra inhabits is original yet familiar --- both as a reflection of Potterverse and of contemporary United States --- and characters are multidimensional and compelling.

The one problem I do have with the series is that Alexandra /never/ learns from her mistakes, even as people around her suffer the consequences of her actions.

** I know it gets a lot of love here, so I tried it. I didn't make it more than 3 chapters in. I think someone below already used the word "brat." And it fits. But basically, I could get past that except for Alexandra's total failure at even caring about her friend and his sister and her inability to show even a little bit of common sense. I guess it is on purpose that she is written that way? Maybe it is just the beginning that is that bad? Or maybe that is just the way it read to me? I don't know, but I had no desire to keep reading about the twit.
