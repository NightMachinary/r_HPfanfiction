Just looking for stories that execute Harry's introduction to the Magical World well. Don't care about anything past that.

Just all the Letter+Diagon Alley+Train Ride+Hogwarts through the Sorting stuff.

Can also be done for an OC character or anything instead of Harry, as long as the spirit's the same.


** The longfic I'm writing at the moment is set in 2006 and has Snape's Muggle-raised son starts Hogwarts. It's a few chapters in for context reasons, but we've done Diagon Alley, the Hogwarts Express and just about to post the Sorting Ceremony.

  A spin-off of my Lone Traveler stories (Lone Traveler originally from The Professional). Harry gets a proper introduction with some insights from an alternate self who has lived it. What does he do with this information? How would his attitudes change?

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them)

This one has no intro to the magical world at all, which is why Harry is crazy and the story is so good.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
