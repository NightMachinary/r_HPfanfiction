NO RON AND/OR GINNY AND/OR HERMIONE BASHING PLEASE!!

I just really wanna see ordinary English dad Arthur Weasley that's like... a teacher or summat losing his mind over the magical world.

Also, how fun would it be if the twins could take the piss both out of the muggle AND magical worlds?? They couldâ€˜ve taken over the world if they combined shit from both of them tbh.


** Not exactly what you mean but linkffn(13312738) is partly set in an alternate dimension without magic where all the book characters (including the Weasleys) have Muggle counterparts. Later they travel to the magical world and the Muggle and Wizards interact.

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.

** This is an interesting idea. I would assume Ron would be as ecstatic about magic as Harry while to Hermione it would be a rather mundane thing to study magic. In such a scenario Harry would be very academically focused because Ron would be too and Hermione will be more laid back compared to canon, meaning academically the trio would be more or less equally matched. Hermione would not be petrified in the second book however Ron might.

It probably wont be Ron that rescues Harry from the Dursleys what with no magical flying car and all and Hermione is not the type of person to run off without a plan so Harrys summer before the second year is shitty at best. Dursleys probably wont send him to Hogwarts so a faculty member might come to rescue Harry when he does not show up to the sorting feast. Ginny would not grow up with the stories of Great Harry Potter the Boy who lived and might act more civil with Harry and potentially become a better friend.

Finally Ron wouldnt abandon them during the seventh year. Weasleys in large would have left the country to somewhere safe like America. Hermione on the other hand might leave, so we would have Harry and Ron stuck in the wild without Hermione to help them and if Hermione does not have a track record of cracking under the pressure like ron does Dumbledore would not leave him the delimunator so She probably would not find her way back to her friends. Couple this with Grangers probably not wanting to send their only Daughter to death, Hermione would be out of the story until the later chapters.

All in all first books would not be that different from the canon however later ones would be vastly different since as the characters age, the worlds they grow up in would cause more and more differences between them.

*** Ron probably would still leave and Hermione still wouldn't. The insecurity that the locket horcux was amplifying most was the feeling of not being good enough, so even if his parents were safe, he'd still be jealous of Harry and accuse Hermione of cheating on him. Hermione's most important traits are her sense of morality and her fierce loyalty, so even if her parents were wizards, she would never leave them. I think you're overestimating how much Ron's parents been wizards affected him leaving, and underestimating the other factors such as his insecurities. Hermione does not have insecurities that are as bad as his, so why would she suddenly leave?

**** I might be exagerating but a big reason why Ron left was because he was afraid for his family. Hermione might be as afraid as Ron in that situation. Furthermore Ron is a muggleborn. even in a family of muggleborns having magic would validate Rons need for speciality a bit when we take into the fact most people he interacts with in the summers would not have any magic.

***** But wouldn't he still be jealous that all of his siblings are more special and stand out more than him? If anything, his insecurities would be amplified, since Hermione probably grew up reading stories about the Boy-Who-Lived, while he's just a random muggleborn. Also, would Hermione suddenly lose her strong sense of wrong and right and gain insecurities just because she's pureblood? If anything, Hermione should be even less insecure, since she has nothing to prove to others. I think you're stretching a bit so there could be be a role reversal.

****** I never said she would gain insecurities. I said she would wory about her parents. She cant send her parents away considering they would be wizard and witch too so knowledge that they could be killed anyday would eat her from inside and allow Locket Horcrux to influence her decision. Ron could not Run away considering As a muggleborn he wouldnt have anywhere safe to go.

******* Yes, but she has always stuck with Harry throughout the books, and prioritized his safety above all else. If she used the same cover story as Ron did in canon, why would she worry? Ron was mostly worried about Ginny, since she was having a rebellion in the Voldemort-run Hogwarts, so unless Hermione suddenly has sibling, I don't see why she would leave. When Ron came back, the locket showed that his insecurities about Hermione choosing Harry over him was what was most likely to turn him against Harry, right? So unless she also has insecurities about Ron and Harry getting together, why would she leave? Also, Ron would have a safe place to go, since his brother would still be under the Fidelius in Shell Cottage, right?

******** No Ron would not have a safe place to go since as a muggleborn his Brothers probably would not have a shell cottage. Also as a pureblood Hermione might Develop a sense of Entitelment and need to prove herself worthy of her family name, characteristics she does not have as a muggleborn and characteristics that can build insecurities under right conditions. Also basing my assumption from the insults Run says to Harry he seems to be most worried about his mother and Father not sister.

********* His brothers would still probably have homes he could hide in though. He was worried about his parents, but the fight started because he was worried about the danger Ginny was in at Hogwarts. You're ignoring my point about how the main reason he left was because he thought Hermione was going to choose Harry over him, which I don't think Hermione would ever worry about. Also, why would she suddenly need to prove her family name? Unless her parents are rich or well-connected like the Malfoy's, wouldn't she just be a regular pureblood? What "family name" would she worry about? Why would she suddenly be entitled? A big part of her character is her strong sense of justice and how she thinks everyone is equal.

********** You make some good points However I dont think elder weasleys would stick around in Britain once the war starts so even if Ron grows to loathe Harry and Hermione he would not leave not because he would not because he could not. Also canon Hermiones parents were dentists meaning they were an upper middle class family. Translating that to wizarding world would mean they would be Healers in St Mungos so they would be reasonably rich and potentially well connected, kind of like Nevilles family.

*********** Yeah, but in canon, Ron wasn't really thinking when he disapparated. It was a spur of the moment decision that he immediately regretted. A muggleborn Ron would probably also not think about the consequences. For Hermione, I don't think she would be too arrogant or entitled no matter her family name. She's the type of person to believe she's better than others because of her hard work, not because of her parents.

************ Ron was not thinking because he was afraid. Hermione wouldnt think if she is afraid too. It can go both ways in regards to Hermione if she is a pureblood but if Ron is a Muggleborn he probably cannot afford to leave. Leaving means near certain death or worse what with limits of magic being unclear. Hermione can leave and if she thinks it is better to leave she would.

************* I'm confused. What do you mean he wasn't thinking because he was afraid? He wasn't thinking because he was angry and Hermione had just chosen Harry over him, not because he was scared. He would still be angry and disapparate away if he was a muggleborn. Also, Hermione would never leave because she thinks it would be beneficial for her. That is so OOC for her, since a large part of her character is her unflinching loyalty and her extremely strong moral compass.

************** Ron left because he was afraid. His fear for his family consumed him. When he returned he feared Harry and Hermione might have got together because he had abandoned them and the Horcrux latched into that fear. He left because he had things to be afraid of. he had a family that loved and supported him unconditionally. Harry and Hermione had no family except each other in this point.

If he was a muggleborn, where would he go? Would living in forests without shelter and eating rats and bugs to survive really be better than staying? And if Hermione or even Harry for that matter had the same things that Ron had and were afraid of losing them and had a devil in the form of the Horcrux, sitting in their shoulder, whispering and encouraging them to take the easy path would they had not done it? Hermione stayed in the mission because Harry and Ron were the only things left for her to fight for. Rons defection effected them badly because in their eyes they had lost half of the people they were fighting for while in Rons eyes he was giving up two to save nine.

If Hermione thought by abandoning ship she would be protecting her parents, she would. She loved them enough to break their trust in her by erasing their memories after all.

*************** I think you're ignoring that his jealous of Harry and fear of Hermione choosing Harry over him was the main reason he left. The only person really in danger were his siblings, and he only mentioned his parents once while he was fighting with Harry, but he talked about how his siblings may be in danger much more. Hermione, on the other hand, doesn't have siblings. You're also ignoring that he wasn't thinking about the consequences when he left, since he regretted to it immediately. Also, I'm unsure what you mean he was giving up two to save nine. He wasn't sacrificing them for his family, he was just angry and jealous.

With Hermione, why would her parents be unsafe? If she uses the same excuse as Ron did in canon, there's nothing to worry about. Ron was mostly worried about his siblings, especially when the radio said that the Weasleys don't need another kid injured.

**************** 1-)Ron was not only worried about his siblings. He was worried about all of his family. That is what giving up teo to save nine means.

2-) I dont think Ron truly loved hermione enough at this point for him to act in such a way. He was attracted sure, but no romantic feelings yet.

3-)Chalking up Rons actions to anger and jealousy is ridiculous. If he left because of that he wouldnt come back.

4-)With Hermione her parents would be unsafe because they would not be away from the brimming war in the Magical Britain.

5-)I am not ignoring the fact he was not thinking when he left. That is the whole point.

***************** Ron did leave because of his anger and jealousy. The last thing he did before leaving was accusing of choosing Harry over him. The Weasleys were relatively safe, but a big part of why they may have been unsafe was the fact that they were well-known blood traitors and Molly's brothers were even in the Order. Unless Hermione's parents are as well-known as the Weasleys, they wouldn't be in much danger.
