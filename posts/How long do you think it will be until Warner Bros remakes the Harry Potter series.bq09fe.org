My guess is in ten years time, Warners Bros. and JK Rowling will definitely for a new live-action adaption of the Harry Potter books and they will either do through a TV series or make into a film series again.

**** 100% that's what would happen. For one, it would be made for a lot of money and so it would be under corporate scrutiny (never a good thing), and secondly, JK Rowling has basically been fanservice personified since 2012.

***** Poor snape didnt do nuffin

minus hanging out with future death eaters, defending them learning dark spells

I picture it being a war between snape and the maraders

But I feel the real reason snape resented them, is because the maraders where well liked

** I think dissatisfaction with the Fantastic Beasts series and Cursed Child have taken the bloom off the rose. I doubt that WB will be willing to finance the production costs of a new series with dubious returns.

*** I wouldn't mind a cartoon series of the Rise Of Hogwarts, focusing on the founders, and the early years of the school.
