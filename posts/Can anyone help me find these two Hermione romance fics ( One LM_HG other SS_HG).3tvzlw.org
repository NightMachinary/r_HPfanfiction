I've been looking for weeks and I can't remember the names of these two fics, if anyone knows them please let me know.

 

*Hermione/Lucius fanfic info:*

 

Narcissia was killed in the last battle and while inspecting the castle for people left Hermione runs into Lucius while checking the Slytherin common room and the end up having sex as a comfort and the next day Lucius is taken to Azkaban. Several years later Lucius gets out of prison and finds Hermione living in a cabin with a child, his as it turns out, and the kid is adorable and grows attatched to Lucius, and the two start a romance, Hermione works in a bookshop, I think it's muggle, and in the end they end up happy togeather.

 

*Hermione/Severus fanfic:*

 

This isn't cannon after OoP I believe, possibly GoF but I think Sirius is dead, Dumbledore isn't.

 

Hermione is captured before 7th year at Hogwarts and brought to a revel where she was gonna be raped, tourtred, etc, and Snape quickly retrieves a potion that he lied to Voldy about saying it will let him control Hermione and she will have to give him information and the only way to maintain this connection is through sex so it humiliates her more, etc when it is really a potion that kind of determines compatibility, they become able to hear eachothers thoughts first when touching and then when they aren't as it advances. Snape has to take Hermione in to 'perfom' at a few revels and one at Malfoy mannor that after Draco goes after Hermione in RoR but is stopped. Eventually Dumbledore tries to make them break the connection formed by the potion and it is believed to be broken but only detiriorates and as a punishment to show him the pain Dumbledore caused by trying them to break this link they send him to temporatally link with a couple in Asia where this potion is used more often.

 

Which reminds me, there is a DADA professor who is a woman, has blond hair, and wears chineese style dresses and she is knowledgeable about the potion and has tried to use it before and I believe she uses it in the fanfic eventually.

*** That's the right one. I wasn't able to get through it either when my sister recommended it to me (she helped me with the description) but she wants to reread it and is asking me to try it again.

Thanks for the help, neither of us could remember the title and googling didn't work well for either of the ones I'm looking for.
