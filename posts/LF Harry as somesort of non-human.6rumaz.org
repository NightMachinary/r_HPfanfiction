** Well, there is the not-quite-good-yet-incredibly-entertaining linkffn(Basilisk-Born) where Harry's grandfather is a phoenix, grandmother is a basilisk, and he has two father's in addition to James Potter.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

**** [[/spoiler][No. The "other" storyline is Harry in the past, which explains how he goes from what you see of him at the beginning to what he becomes]].

** Theres a very explicit smut fic called Incubus, by SquareRootbeer. Hes some sort of incubus and has to have sex at least once a day or he will die.

Linkffn(incubus by squarerootbeer)

Theres another incubus one (not smut) where he grows wings. Pretty sure its Harry/Ginny but I forget the name.

  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!
