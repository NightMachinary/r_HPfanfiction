Recently read linkffn(Wake the Black Wolf) and I'm looking for more crossovers with the Witcher series.

  Having a deranged dark wizard after you is not too great. Having something you cannot quite explain after you in a strange world where the kindest fate is to find yourself on the wrong end of a sword makes that first thing seem like child's play. Geralt/Yennefer, Harry/? Rated M. Because there's no other way to write a Witcher story.

  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.

** Sadly there aren't that many crossovers with the Witcher and (much to my chagrin) one of them that started out great (forgot the name, I just read too much fanfiction and I seldom remember the titles of stories I've read months ago...) then did something I can't even forgive Rowling for:

They made Harry stupid, powerless and weak (note: No, I don't only read power-trips (they are a guilty pleasure of mine, but still far from the only thing I read, hell I only really finish the well writen ones!), but saying stuff about your hero like he's weak magically - come on we are talking about the guy with the patronus in 3rd year - while praising Hermione? No, damned! (yes Hermione is also transportet to the Witcher-Verse and while Harry gets shunted to the Witchers she is accepted into a magical school! Sorry, but IMHO Harry is the more magically gifted, he's just lacks believe in himself and isn't the most studious person, probably partly because the Dursleys never rewarded good grades (most likely it didn't matter which grades Harry had - as long as he wasn't failing classes!)...Damned, I hated this about Rowling in the last book, deconstructing your hero in the last book is not a great idea and I will not accept it in fanfiction (note: No I didn't want Harry to kick Voldemort's ass alone, but why not have a three or four way duel with Harry striking the killing blow, that would show that friendship and mutual trust/support trumps over evil, which is a much better message than what we got ("It's ok if you are a lazy slacker that sucks at making any long term plans (it was Hermione who brought the tent etc. - Harry was all like "I bring some clothes and my wand, that's ok - right?") - as long as you are willing to get yourself murdered for your friends!"...yeah thanks!)
