So, life is kinda depressing now, isn't it? I don't know about you, but I'd like to read some uplifting stuff. Something optimistic or kind or fluffy that makes me smile or laugh. So please, recommend some fics that put you in a good mood while reading them. Y'know those fics that make you sad inside and break your soul? I want, like, the opposite of that. Happy times, please. :)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.

**** You're welcome! :D But I'll have to say, Bond of Family is part of a series and you'd have to read the previous ones to make sense of anything. I accidentally started with "A Very Extraordinary Day"(I thinks thats the title) and was utterly confused until I realized it was probably part of a series and went to the authors profile. I believe page 4 is where the series starts, and then go backwards.

The basic premise of it is Prof. McGonagall decided that a group chat with Gryffindor and Slytherin would encourage inter-house relationships. And Hermione took the leap of faith required to actually go through with it. There's also a suprising amount of plot.

***** That's fine. As my boilerplate disclaimer says, I don't care what kind of relationships are in a fic. My only real fic limitation is the Leather-Pants'ed Death Eaters trope in Muggleborn/Half-Blood with a Death-Eater pairings, since it's really difficult not to see that as essentially pairing Anne Frank with Himmler and cooing over how pretty the Nazi is. But I've enjoyed fics with and without that attitude, so it's not that big a barrier either.

And yeah, I'll read basically anything if I'm desperate enough. I also happen to enjoy a lot of things others say are cliché, like time-travel, mod!Harry, bashing, heir fics, stuff like that. Though, I also like to make fun of that stuff. There's a creepypasta crossover fic I know where in one chapter Harry has weird dreams and one of them is just absolute heir!Harry crack. It's pretty amazing even if you don't like the rest of the fic. The other dream was EJ being a Theater/Broadway Major in college.

Short 2: Eyeless Jack's College Degree

Jeff and Eyeless Jack sat around the breakfast table alone, when Jeff suddenly looked up at him, "Hey, I just thought of something."

"Hm?"

"You're good with biology; I get that, kidneys and ripping stuff out of people is your "thing". But you know enough about genetics to analyze DNA from new species; enough about chemistry to break down jelly beans and find the literal 'magic ingredient'; enough about physics to do that whole magic-wavelength thingy; enough about mechanics to build your own machines; enough about coding to program some of those machines yourself; and you're a cook."

"Your point being?" EJ replied.

"What the f*ck kind of Major did you go for?"

"Do you really want to know?"

"Yes!"

The lights in the kitchen suddenly shut off, leaving the room in complete darkness. "Hey! What the Hell!?" Jeff shouted.

Then, the darkness was pierced by a single spotlight on... EJ.

In seconds, he'd changed into a formal tuxedo tailcoat with a crisp, white undershirt. He leaned on a slick, black cane and had one hand on a shiny, black top hat.

Jeff was too stunned to move.

Then EJ started to sing.

"Well... when... I...

First went out into the big blue world,

My mom would always saaaay,

'Son you gotta keep your head up and your mind aware

'cause you'll see how it all ends up one daaaay'."

Jeff peered in the darkness, but couldn't make out any of the 40-piece orchestra playing just outside the spotlight.

So, I thought about it hard every night and day

The biggest question of aaaaaalll;

In this short and all-too-terrible life of mine-" He knelt on one knee.

"What is my purpose on this great, mud-baaaaallll." His voice softened to a whisper of hanging silence before exploding back in song.

"Then it hit me and I knew what I was on this earth to do

My purpose, my meaning, my dreeeaaam.

Was to be up on the stage

With lights and songs and babes

This is who I wanted to beeee."

The blackness exploded with light and blinded Jeff with a fully-lit stairstep stage complete with 20 gorgeous women in close-fitting costumes and fishnet leggings with tasteful, but not tacky, sequin and feather adornments dancing on each step.

"My Major was Musical Theater, yes, Musical Theater

I'm straight and I'm a guy, but I love Musical Theater

The call of Broadway, the sights of New York

The musical numbers, and-of-course;

"I love the Cats on their tin roofs,

The Musical Man,

The Pajama Game,

And the Devious Plan

"Of Arsenic and Old-Lace

And the Lion King

Erik the Phantom

I love every-thing.

"So I went off to college to get a music degree

And then, I'd go on to debuuuuut

But some bitch went on ahead

And carved out my eyes instead-"

He climbed up the staircase to the top of the pedestal of the steps in one, fluid motion.

"So now here I am."

"Now here he is." The women echoed.

"An eyeless man."

"What a man"

"With a

"Degree

"In

"Musi-cal

"THEEEEEEAAATEEEERRRRRR!"

The stage erupted with hidden pyrotechnics as he leapt off the steps and took a grand-stand slide towards Jeff, who was still sitting, stunned, at the kitchen table.

The women finished with an echoed, "And a Minor in Philoso-phyyyyyy."

The song ended as EJ sat, still on his knees, slightly huffing after the number.

/brrriiiiing/

"Alright! That's a wrap!"

The stage lit up as people in headsets and clipboards started walking around. Jeff recognized the creepy doll-girl, Shiloh, among them coordinating some of the dancers.

The girls' bright white smiles faded as they started wandering off-stage, muttering about make-up and lunch break.

One went up to Shiloh and asked about paychecks, to which Shiloh told her to check in with "Betty or Darla" before she leaves.

The wall closed up back to its original appearance and EJ stands up off the floor. The "doctor" tore off his suit in one fluid motion before sitting back at the table and spooning up some more cereal.

Then, a woman, still in her stage dress walked in through the "Living Room" door and rushed over to the fridge. She pulled out a labeled tupperwear lunch and sent a mumbled apology to EJ before scurrying back out of the room.

Jeff stared at the wall that had opened up to a full Broadway stage.

Then back to EJ, calmly eating like nothing happened.

Then the torn-of suit still on the floor.

...

"WHAT THE FU-"

END.

This is one of my favorite things ever XD

*** Ah, Adorable Violence. A great fic. Have you read 'Brilliant, But Scary'? It's a full chronological story inspired by Adorable Violence. It's a bit more codependent than AV was - Harry is as crazy about Hermione as she is about him - but it's got similar vibes. :)

  Once upon a time, Parselmages were known by a different name: Dragon Singers. Harry Potter is going to bring that art back to life, though at six years old he doesn't know it yet. Eventual slash, HP/CW. Warning: Story contains child abuse.
