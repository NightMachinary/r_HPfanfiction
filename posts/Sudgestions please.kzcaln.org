Looking for a fic where Harry decides to do his own thing - effectively creating his own side in the war (a grey wizard if you would) - and learns many things both dark and light, creates things -spells items ect- A pairing is not required but bonus points if it has a pairing of Fleur/Harry, Daphney/ Harry or all three. Not interested in Hermione/ Harry - she annoys me /shrugs/-.

Would be nice if Sirius and he live together or develop the father/son bond - because....well they both deserve it /shrugs/ -

Anyways, look forward to your recommendations
