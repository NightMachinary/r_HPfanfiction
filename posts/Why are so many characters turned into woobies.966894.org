This is question that not only focuses on HP fanfiction, but also fanfiction in general. Why is that character, especially those with serious flaws, treated like precious china dolls who just need a hug, by a majority of writers?

Hell, if you go on ao3, where it is far more common, you will see tags like "X needs a hug". Seriously? I admit that some characters get the short end of the stick, yet it all seems akin to the whole "girl sees goodness in the bad boy and can bring it out" cliché . A lot of these characters aren't glass figurines who will shatter with a single insult. Why is it so rare to find a fic, where the flawed character just has a therapeutic night-out and dicking around? Why must a character who could easily handle insults and fire back, suddenly be unable to even respond?


** Speaking from personal experience here, writing "Harry needs a hug" can be a very cleansing thing to do. I bet most of us have been in a position where they would have liked some comfort after a shitty time, and comfort stories are a way to deal with that.

Of course, as with everything, you have to thread carefully. There's a difference between "Harry uses Hermione's comfort as a crutch to get back on his feet after the Graveyard" and "Harry has a papercut and now Hermione is changing his diapers".

*** Wait, you mean that writing decent plots is important?!?! /s

Also, if well done, these can be interesting character studies.

** Because people just write out of character sometimes, or it's their way of having other characters notice them.

On the “x needs a hug” I've mostly seen it in stories where said character is hurt or just having a very bad year, even if the other characters never take notice of it or the character does not suddenly become a giant baby, though.

** Possibly because many writers deal with issues in their private lives and try to make characters more relatable by adding similar issues. Mental health is often ignored in fiction, because no one wants to deal with traumatized people.

*** [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie][A Wobbie is a term popularized by TV Tropes]]

Simply put, it's a character that the audience is meant to feel sorry for, that they actually do feel sorry for and want to comfort.

** I agree it sounds really corny. It should be labeled as Hurt/Comfort.
