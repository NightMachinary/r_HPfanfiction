:END:
Hey im looking for a fanfiction I read some time ago and I cant find it anymore, Please Help?

Ron leaves the tent and Harry and Hermione somehow find the trunk Moody had left them for Dumbles quest. They realise Ron has been potioning them and there is a Portrait of Moody in either the trunk or somewhere in the tent...


** I would love to know more! This sounds fascinating.

*** Im quite certain I read this fic on fanfiction.net though I can't remember if the sixteen first kisses belong in this one or not, as any fic I found with any obliviated first kisses wasn't the one I am looking for. Im also relatively sure that I am looking for a Harry/Hermione ...

**** Solved! I asked around and someone on a discord author channel knew it. Its The Hidden War by Keira Marcos and it was one of her Evil Author Day pieces and has since been taken down

***** Huh? No. I was replying to the user triggering the ‚Äúremind me‚Äù bot. I mean TOMT has a bot that automatically changes a Flair to solved once the OP declares it, and ALSO can notify subscribers when a given piece of media is found.

Basically the process goes like this

1. TOMT post made looking for something.
2. Bot replies to post with a post with a link that lets someone subscribe to the post(they think the subject is interesting but don't know it either).
3. People try to help find subject. Eventually, the correct answer is found.
4. OP replies to the post with the correct answer with the keyword to close the search and mark the correct response.
5. Bot changes the flair to reflect the ‚ÄúSolved‚Äù status, and notifies anyone who subscribed to the topic that the correct answer has been found.

****** Oh thank god, thought I made a blunder of my very first post despite researching. Yes their bot would fit for these kinds of questions. Thanks for clarifyingüò∂
