** “I got it!” A prepubescent voice shouts... no scratch that... chokes out somewhere underneath the roars of the stadium.

“And that's Angela with the quaffle.”

“I go- /gag, retch, cough-/ the snitch!”

“Katie Bell towards the goal.”

“I HAVE- /splutter, cough, cough -/ THE SNITCH! I CAUGHT IT!”

“The Gryffindor seeker appears to be doing a dance of some kind. Harry, stop fooling around and get back in the game.

“Lee, I cau- /cough cough gag/ - I caught the snitch.”

“You caught the snitch?!” Lee jerks his head up towards Harry in excitement. Only to turn away again disappointedly upon sight. “Don't be ridiculous, Potter, your hands are empty.”

“I swallowed it!” Harry points towards his stomach eagerly. At which the entire stadium simultaneously tilt their heads and squint.

“Are you sure...”

“Po- /cough splutter retch-/ positive!”

“Um, timeout?” Madame Hooch calls out uncertainty.

“Point me, snitch,” Hooch casts upon returning to the ground. “Well he's definitely swallowed it.”

“So we we've won?” Wood calls out eagerly.

“It appears so. Um. Gryffindor wins.”

“Whooooo, go Harry!”

“Th-/cough, splutter, retch/- Thanks.”

“Um, mate. You're adam's apple's fluttering,” Fred points out.

“I think that means its ripe,” George chimes in.

“Ripe for the picking,” Fred chirps.

“Seriously though,” George inputs. “When are we getting the snitch out of him? Hogwarts only has one snitch...”

“And we can't play quidditch without a snitch...” Fred agrees.

“So Harry essentially ate quidditch,” George solemnly summarizes.

"Damn, I always thought that would be Ronnie-poo."

"It's always the scrawny ones.'

"But yeah, no snitch, no quidditch."

“Because quidditch without a snitch is just...” Fred pauses in search for the right word.

“Handball?” Dean suggests.

“What's handball?”

“I was going to say it's just fondling sticks and balls. But if you want to call that handball, I suppose that's one way to put it,” Fred finishes.

“So wait? What you're saying is that we can't play quidditch until I um... excrete the snitch?” Harry runs a hand through his hair uncomfortably.

“Excrete?” Ron's entire face furrows.

“We need Harry to shit out the snitch, lil bro.” Fred slaps Ron on the back.

“Actually, according to /The History of Quidditch,/ the snitch bonds with the DNA of the person who catches it. This isn't an issue with a normal catch. However, if swallowed, the snitch will bond with the DNA so strong that it becomes permanently attached to the catcher.”

“What does that mean?” Ron asks.

“It means,” Hermione's exasperated voice rings lecture-like. “That the snitch is permanently stuck inside Harry. And since they are bonded through DNA, it is likely that they will take on characteristics of each other.”

“Damn it, this is why first years aren't allowed on the team,” an older Ravenclaws huffs.

“I suggest you don't misjudge all first years as abiding to the low standard Potter sets,” Draco announces his presence with a long droll. “I assure you, if /I/ were the Seeker, I would never swallow it.”

“Of course you wouldn't, Malfoy,” Ron shouts. “You'd have to get near it to swallow it, wouldn't you?!”

“Well maybe Hogwarts would be able to afford a second snitch if the school didn't spend so much money trying to support poor people like you.”

“Shut up, Malfoy!”

“Wood, you did tell Potter to catch the snitch with his hands, not his mouth. Right?” Malfoy turns his attention to the captain with a sneer. “After all, he grew up like a /mudblood/. Bet he didn't even know what the snitch did till you told him.”

And though everyone snarls at Malfoy's tone, eyes slowly sneak questioning peeks at Wood.

“Um, Malfoy's a git and all. But, um. You did tell Harry, right?” George asks.

Oliver splutters.

“You forgot to tell him to use his hands!?” Angela fires up.

“I thought it was implied! Hands are used to catch!”

“And I thought it was implied that feet were used to move around a pitch until someone handed me a broomstick,” Dean nods sagely.

“Th-this is ridiculous,” Oliver flusters. “We'll figure out something. It's not like Hogwarts can run without quidditch. The professors will figure out something. Right Professor?”

(1 month later)

“And it's Hufflepuff lined up against Slytheryn today, ladies and gents,” Lee starts up at the microphone. “And Madame Hooch is releasing the quaffles. And now the Pot Snitch. Look at Harry flutter up there. No broom or anything. Now /that's/ the magic of quidditch, folks. Think that snitch-boy will be big enough for even Higgs to spot?”

“Albus,” Minerva scolds from somewhere in the stadium. “I can't believe you're allowing this. This is... what do the muggles call it... Freshman hazing!”

“It's for the greater good,” Dumbledore answers. Meanwhile, Harry twitches sporadically somewhere in the sky. Yet, blue eyes twinkle knowingly across the stadium, where somewhere a turban silently curses a thwarted future plan.

“Di-did you plan this?!”

*** Dumbledore did not answer, but looked McGonagall in the eye. In there, besides the twinkling, she saw his office.

Snape was pacing, Dumbledore looked anxious.

"So, when the time comes...the boy must fly?" Snape asked, his flat monotone only waving slightly.

Dumbledore couldn't meet his intense gaze, and instead looked to the floor.\\
"Yes, yes, he must fly."
