** Not a family but the story The Fires of Magic by Raolin has Harry's Hogwarts letter show up at a Far East Monastery where Harry has been living and being trained in a different style of magic ever since the monastery "found" him after he ran away from the Dursleys. It's a very good read. Regrettably it's starting to look like it may be abandoned (last update 12/2018).

  The curse Voldemort cast on baby Harry had far-reaching effects on Harry's magic. Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant beasts, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more. Book One will cover first year and the events of the Philosopher's Stone.

** I've read two Bewitched crossovers, and an unfinished Labyrinth crossover that I really wish there was more of. (I think there are Charmed crossovers also, but I haven't read any because I didn't watch that series.)

  When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother.

  Someone saw Harry Potter dropped off on a doorstep and refused to allow that to happen. Instead, he was adopted by a magical family, a family very different than what wizarding society was used to. Note: the Bewitched timeline was moved forward to fit into the Harry Potter universe.

  Lily Potter's last wish was that Petunia Dursely would not take care of her son. Petunia agreed, and so she used the words Lily gave her to send the child somewhere else.
