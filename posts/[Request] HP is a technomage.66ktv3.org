Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts with technologies. I want him to use them quite often.

Any kind of tech. Maybe many computer-like things. Maybe even parts of his body are machines (like Rhys in Tales from the Borderlands). Maybe his glasses are clever (with augmented reality).

I've read a fic where Neville is the BWL (Harry's parents are still killed), Harry hides his intellect and has a secret lab in Hogwarts where he makes robots with knowledge of physics and magic. Something like that would be nice.

It can be not his first year in Hog, it can even be PostHog.

I'm really sorry for my bad english


** Link to story? Also

Linkffn(The Lightsaber by Tellemicus Sundance) Harry builds his own lightsaber and more based on watching star wars.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)

*** I hated this fic. Harry builds a lightsaber and starts using magic like the Force and then EVERYBODY can easily copy what he is doing, but it is ultra evil and everybody hates him, and giant centuries long conspiracy and just...ugh.
