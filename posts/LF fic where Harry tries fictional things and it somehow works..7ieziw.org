I just finished rereading Lightning dragon's roar and I'm looking for fics where Harry tries fictional training methods, power-ups, etc. That kind of thing.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/22/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter the Geek]] by Andrius is a pretty good fic that basically matches what you are asking for, although it doesn't all happen at once.

** Did you read the sequels/alt endings?

I think he has a story where he gets stuck in Westeros or something that was pretty awesome.

Most crossovers might count.

Anyway, you may be interested in this one:

** I found three: linkffn(9596404) Fairy Tail - Harry reads the manga and develop powers based on it. Sadly incomplete.

linkffn(5284129) Harry Potter's Discovery - Harry reads the Naruto manga and develop powers based on it. Complete!

linkffn(12026631) The Very Best - Harry watches pokemon and deveop creatures based on it. Complete!

Both complete fics are Harry x Luna. In Harry Potter's Discovery, Luna is barely mentioned. In The Very Best, she have a lot more screen time.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
