I'm looking for something light-hearted and fun, where Harry carries himself with the same odd style that Dumbledore does in the early books. Or a Harry that lives as if constantly on /Felix Felicis/. In the linked story, Harry is a type of seer and thus makes all kinds of outrageous predictions and acts in strange ways to bring about a future he desires.

Linkffn(Teaching History (is Old News)) is a fun, yet incomplete story. Even if you're not into Slash, the 21 chapters out so far don't actually delve into any romance yet. It's well worth a look if you need a pick-me-up!

PS: I've already read, Linkffn(The One He Feared). Not quite what I'm looking for. It's too serious.

  In which Tom is the DADA professor at Hogwarts, secretly recruiting followers for his future army, and Harry is the worst Divination professor ever, accidentally messing up Tom's plans. Drabble series. Eventual TMRxHP.

  Imagine Harry Potter raised under the guiding hand of Sibyll Trelawney. He arrives at Hogwarts versed in the higher arts of Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry - you know 'real magic.' Prepare yourself for one humorous ride.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
