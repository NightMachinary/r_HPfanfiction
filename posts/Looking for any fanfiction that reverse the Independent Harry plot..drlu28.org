It's a bit difficult to describe clearly what I want exactly but something along the line of Dumbledore putting a ranting Harry who has went on a shopping trip and got some rings in his place.


** This is a one shot where an independent Harry confronts Dumbledore, but the confrontation doesn't go his way at all.

*** Well now that was very dark but definitely the sort of thing I wanted, No matter how many books reads or Kung Fu lessons Harry attends it's impossible for him to best a man who has studied magic for 100 years.

Thank you.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.
