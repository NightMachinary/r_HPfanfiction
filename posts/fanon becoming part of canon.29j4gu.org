As an avid fanfiction reader certain parts of canon have been warped over time. Certain things, like Dumbledore being evil or Ginny being absolutely crazy have almost become part of my canon. What elements have become part of yours? As well as, what fics have become canon for you?

** For me, the character of Severus Snape feels woefully incomplete in canon, which is why my headcanon of him is almost entirely decided by the amazing fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]].

This fic gives his character (as well as those of Eileen Prince and Tobias Snape) a believable backstory which portrays how magic can tear a family apart. The author describes Severus' mindset and motivations in great detail, down to the little things he does to remain in control of himself despite the horrors he witnesses (incidentally, the description of Occlumency is the one that makes the most sense to me).

Moreover, it covers those years after his graduation and before the arrival of Harry at Hogwarts, which are entirely missing from canon. Finally, it explains just how someone suspected of being a Death Eater can remain at Hogwarts, despite the many incidents (e.g. with Karkaroff, Crouch Jr.) that would result in his imprisonment.

Overall a wonderful fanfiction and highly recommended for /any/ fanfiction reader, since it does not conflict with canon and, in my view complements it quite nicely.

*** I recommend that to anyone who wants to read a proper character study in the HP universe. That story has so many tiny details that fit so perfectly with both British culture (and working class poverty) during the 60s and 70s, and is subtly disturbing at how accurate a description that is of the mindset of how untreated abuse during childhood turns a child farther and farther away from a normative mindset...

It's creepy how by the end of the story Snape's minimal love life, emotional detachment, anger issues, and complete and utter disbelief that life could actually be good just seems normal when reading it. It took me an hour of after finishing it to just sit there and go "wait, that's so... reasonable... I didn't even... how did I accept that?"

... and there is absolutely no character bashing. James is actually a decent bloke in seventh year, Lily wasn't a bitch /at all/, Dumbledore tries to be a good father figure so hard, and has the hands-down BEST HAGRID EVER.

And yes, this is the definitive Snape story. JKR should buy the rights for this, hire the writer for all future projects, and publish it.

** Oh god, so many things.

Let's see:

- Runes as spells
- Wards
- Masterys after Hogwarts
- McGonagall and Snape think Harry's spoiled at home
- Everything about Daphne
- Hermione is conventionally attractive
- A ton of spells
- Snape is Malfoy's godfather
- People are stronger magically than other people
- Grindelwald and Dumbledore were lovers
- Hermione using Ron's full name, "Ronald Bilius Weasley!"
- The Golden Trio referring to Harry Ron and Hermione
- Harry calling Hermione, Mione.

I'm probably missing a lot, but just from reading so much fanfiction I have this huge list of fanon that I never really bothered to separate from canon. It honestly shocked me a bit when I found out that Snape was never stated to be Malfoy's Godfather.

***** Fair enough, I was distracted by fanfiction and the movies. As far as I can tell there are four girls that Harry finds at the very least pretty in canon: Cho, Fleur, Ginny and Hermione. As far as we know he finds Hermione the least interesting of the four, but at the same time he finds her prettier than every other girl in the school. He doesn't think Luna is pretty, he doesn't seem to be interested in Susan Bones, he's certainly not interested in Justin Finch-Flechley.

So...

Hermione might not be as pretty as the woman who portrays her in the movies, but she's still pretty. She's not breathtaking or stunning, or anything else, but as far as we know she is ”pretty“

  People are stronger magically than other people
#+end_quote

Okay, no. This is clearly canon, no matter what most people who hate magic being explained want to believe. Bad fanfic might abuse the idea, but you can't simply ignore the facts as written.

I think it is easy to show that squibs exist and aren't affected by Muggle repelling stuff (i.e., can work at Hogwarts), can use magical items (though not apparently wands), and can maybe sense magically unnoticeable to Muggle creatures, like Dementors, and might be able to form magical relationships with animals likes cats and Kneazles. So that's *one* level of power above a normal human's when it comes to magic. This could end the argument right there, but let's continue.

--------------

Wizards are a power level higher than squibs and humans, so with squibs that's *two* levels of magical ability, even just sticking to human magicals -- elves and centaurs obviously have their own powers that aren't exactly the same potential as humans, but that could be said to be apples and oranges. Don't suggest they aren't /people/ however, or I'll sic Hermione on you.

--------------

Then it is implied that young kids either aren't for some reason or /can't/ be taught some apparently safe spells like the Patronus and even the freaking Point Me charm. First years not knowing something as useful and safe as the Point Me spell, and Harry managing the Patronus being a big deal, is just odd when there are no obviously difficult components like hard words or complicated motions. In canon such things apparently matter a lot, so why are two spells with minimal castings such a big deal? A spell such as Apparation makes sense -- that is physical dangerous. But that's not the case with those two spells.

That something else would make it difficult to learn or use those very safe spells raises a big question. With the absence of those sorts of difficult standard components, and given Lupin's instructions on the Patronus, those spells being hard for little kids points to it being something linked either to someone's "will" or focus -- which varies from person to person and we can actually physical measure in real life at the neurochemical level right now -- or to some other innate magical quality.

So I argue that since there is /strong/ evidence that little kids physically or magically can't cast apparently simple charms like the Point Me or the Patronus, which is why they aren't usually taught, that's number *three* on my list of of magical ability levels. Even if it is just will-power or emotional control, then /that is just a magical ability with different levels itself/.

This is my weakest level, so feel free to ignore it as it is mostly circumstantial evidence. I'm just saying, there is a reason no one under the age of fifteen ever uses an Unforgivable in canon. Youngest use? Maybe Harry in book five (15), though he sort of muffs it. Bellatrix seemed sort of surprised he even managed that much, though she then quickly mocks him for it. Again, suggesting that he was way too young for it but he was still powerful enough to still get some effect, but not /proving/ anything.

--------------

Now we get to the canon world's fear of Voldemort. He is literally said to be the most powerful dark wizard of all time in canon. That directly implies he is, as a magical person, more powerful than all previous dark wizards. However, we never really see this power manifested, so it is hard to pin down. Not impossible, though.

He isn't enchanted to bounce spells, he doesn't have powerful self-made magical items hanging off him like a D&D character, he doesn't eat lava for breakfast, and he doesn't just stand there and laugh when Dumbledore has stone statues try to pummel him.

But okay, maybe that is a figure of speech about his knowledge and madness in casting irresponsible Unforgivables or something. This seems unlikely, given the fact that he doesn't use any spells in canon that his Death Eaters don't also use.

He doesn't do anything special himself other than the Horcruxes, his cursed potion, and the ring -- all of which no one knows about, remember. We don't actually see how those work or how they might be unique. He wasn't the first ever to use Horcruxes, after all. All this points to his spell knowledge and how he uses it not being the publically scary thing about him.

And that, along with him using some sort of weak mind-controlling "accidental" wandless magic on his classmates even before Hogwarts (that's canon, according to Mrs. Cole), /strongly/ suggests he's more than just ruthless and cruel. He's more magically powerful.

I think it is silly to suggest that someone who could intentionally do wandless magic before age eleven wasn't "more powerful" than other Hogwarts students magically. So that's /at least/ a very strong third level of magical power, if not number *four* for my list.

--------------

So please, don't spread this silly interpretation of canon. It is nice to think that hard work and studying could make anyone as powerful as +Voldemort+ Dumbledore, but that seems to be directly contradicted by canon itself. Some fans hate magic having levels or points or it being explained at all. The fact is, JKR does explain some of it. And some people being "more powerful" in magic is canon in several ways.

Yes, that is true, but it isn't the end of the argument. For one, I'm talking about power levels as they apply to wizards only, and adding in squibs doesn't make sense. While squibs may be more magical than the average human, that simply puts them in a class all their own.

The issue I have with squibs is that there is little evidence of them doing things Muggles can't do. The only thing in your example that we know Muggles can't do is to see dementors. Squibs, coincidentally, also can't see dementors, as was confirmed by Rowling.

We have never seen what would happen to a Muggle led into Hogwarts, but we know that Muggles can get into anti-Muggle areas if they are led in. We know this because we saw Mr and Mrs Granger enter Diagon Alley, a place that is Muggle proofed.

We have never seen a Muggle attempt to use magical device, so we have no idea if they are capable. We have never seen a Muggle try to bond with a magical creature, so we have no idea whether or not they're capable.

There is nothing we have seen a squib do that we know for certain a Muggle could not.

--------------

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Now this is just bollocks.

I can't really comment on the Point Me because I'm not too familiar with it (I thought Hermione invented it), but I can on the Patronus. In the DA, we see numerous students completing the Patronus, some just slightly older than Harry was.

The Unforgiveables and the Patronus are both considered difficult magic for children, but we see adults toss around Unforgiveables like candy, and we see teenagers master the Patronus. The thing with these spells is that they are heavily dependent upon emotion. Not power.

When Harry repelled hundreds of dementors, that wasn't some display of magical power, but rather of emotion. When Moody said no one could cast Unforgiveables on him, that wasn't because of power, but because they lack the drive.

But let's say the spells are power dependent. Harry driving off hundreds with his Patronus must indicate rather exceptional power then, right? Considering that many adults can't cast it, and most who can can only do the mist, and that can barely ward off one.

Why then do we see multiple adults, tons even, some of which didn't even graduate, cast the Unforgiveable if they can't manage the Patronus? Obviously Unforgiveables would take more, simply because Harry couldn't manage it, and he could manage the Patronus. If magical power is some linear thing, wouldn't Harry also be able to cast Unforgiveables? Wouldn't every member of the DA who can conjure Patroni?

No, because the magic isn't based on power. It's based on emotion. Harry specifically was told that he simply didn't want to hurt Bellatrix enough. Moody specifically says that no student really wants to kill him, or has the absolute force of being to want him dead.

--------------

Ok, so first off I'm going to agree with your point about Voldemort not really doing anything special. He doesn't cast many unique spells, he doesn't /do/ much that we see. In fact, in canon, he's a bit of a joke. The only person we've ever seen him actually duel was Dumbledore, and even then it wasn't particularly impressive.

But I think it's silly to extrapolate that magical power is significant based off of that.

And there is nothing there to suggest that it is anything more than him being a natural prodigy at magic. He's naturally good at it. He is a good duelist, we know this. What's to say that he isn't simply a prodigious duelist?

The question I think is begged is, "How would the average wizard know that Voldemort is powerful?"

Voldemort was a master of fear tactics. He knew how to strike to make people fear him. He would attack vulnerable targets, he would attack dissenters, he made Britain afraid to say his name.

--------------

The only comment I have for the wandless magic thing is that we have next to no knowledge about wandless magic. We know that Harry could do lumos wandlessly. We know Tom Riddle could intentionally create effects. We know accidental magic doesn't require wands. We know occlumency and legilimency doesn't require wands.

That it.

Also, who's to say that what Riddle was doing wasn't a refined form of accidental magic? We know accidental magic is based strictly off of intent and emotion. Harry uses accidental magic when he wants something to happen, and when he is forced into it.

Voldemort, a natural prodigy of occlumency, has stupid good control over his emotions. What is there to say it isn't refined accidental magic? It might not be compelling, but it has the same weight as your argument. There is no evidence that wandless magic is based on power, and there is no evidence wandless magic isn't based on power. You're assuming it is based on power because we have someone whom we are informed is powerful demonstrated to perform it when he was younger.

--------------

I never said that hard work and studying could make someone as powerful as Dumbledore. It is clear that Dumbledore is incredibly naturally talented. He didn't just study hard, he had an aptitude towards magic. Dumbledore in canon is strictly a genius.

Riddle in canon is also strictly a genius. He demonstrated feats requiring knowledge and resources, which he attained using his genius.

I'm going to use an analogy here. People will usually agree that Einstein is a genius. Mathematics came easy to him, as did Physics. It is silly to think that anyone who is not on his level of genius could equal him in mathematics, no matter how hard they studied.

Einstein as a child could do math better than other children, and even some adults, before he was ever taught formalized mathematics. He could probably do division and multiplication before any other child could even attempt it. This is the showing of his genius at mathematics.

But Einstein's math is not inherently better than other people's. He is better /at/ math, but the math specifically is not better. His math is not stronger, because math does not work that way.

Magic is seen in much the same way by people against power. It's a skill. People are naturally better at it, able to retain more information, learn it without being formally taught, able to progress faster, able to apply it to other areas.

It is easy to see this in canon. Hermione, naturally skilled at magic, would finish things much faster than other students, learn things quicker, do things better on the first try. But she isn't /stronger/ at it. If someone casts Wingardium Leviosa, and Hermione, or Dumbledore, or Riddle, does the same thing, they're not doing it stronger than others. The charms are identical. But it's far easier for them to do it, to learn it, to remember it.

Magical power is purely fanon. There's no evidence to support it that does not also support the skill theory, and there is no evidence that does not support the skill theory in a better way.

If there is, please show me.

*/tl;dr: Magical power is canon; several categories of power exist including age and, likely, inborn magical power; respectfully, you are as wrong as can be./*

This is a little silly, as the point of that original comment was clearly that Powerful Harry floating three feet above the floor during the Sorting because he is just /that powerful/ isn't supported in canon, nor is the basic idea that that could even happen. I don't think that is up for debate.

But that doesn't mean that canon shows a world that is entirely magically equal and egalitarian, and without differing levels of ability that lead directly to some people's spells better than others, as you seem to still be implying. While also stating that innate magi-emotional and mental abilities also matter. It is a confusing argument to counter, but I'll try to refine my position on a few points just to clear up some misconceptions.

That is a terrible way to debate. You can't just create categories for phenomenon as edge cases that exclude them from consideration in your thesis. It seems clear you agree they have magic and so do magicals who get Hogwarts letters; they just have less of it, but still more than Muggles.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  We have never seen what would happen to a Muggle led into Hogwarts, but we know that Muggles can get into anti-Muggle areas if they are led in. We know this because we saw Mr and Mrs Granger enter Diagon Alley, a place that is Muggle proofed.
#+end_quote

These are not the same, and one can't draw conclusions like this. There are many times it would have made sense for Muggles to be at Hogwarts, yet it is said not to happen.

Anti-Muggle areas aren't a thing in canon, though there is at least one spell that seems to do something that repels them.

There are strong reasons to believe Muggles can't enter Hogwarts, though. Muggles can't see Hogwarts at all, instead seeing ruins, with no canon exceptions. Hermione's long and parentless hospital stay in CoS is highly suggestive given how fast the Weasleys are gathered when Ginny disappears for less than a day. Alternatives are both cruel and unsupported.

Diagon Alley, however, is not said to be spelled to make it invisible to Muggles or exclude them in some way. It is just said that the entrance (the inn) is uninteresting to Muggles and they ignore it. These are clearly different levels of protection and can't be directly equated, again supporting the squib as a level of magical ability as they aren't said to be unable to see it.

#+begin_quote
  We have never seen a Muggle attempt to use magical device, so we have no idea if they are capable. We have never seen a Muggle try to bond with a magical creature, so we have no idea whether or not they're capable.

#+end_quote

Sure, see Hogwarts. But this isn't how burden of evidence works. We know squibs have some things in common with other magicals. Suggesting baseline humans have the same level of abilities means the weight of evidence lies on /you/ to provide magical things that Muggles are shown to be even likely to be able to do, not the opposite.

#+begin_quote
  The only comment I have for the wandless magic thing is that we have next to no knowledge about wandless magic.
#+end_quote

You list several things we do know, all performed by people who are constantly called powerful wizards: Harry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort. An example of Longbottom or Dean Thomas doing something odd or wandless would be good evidence against things like wandless magic being an indication of magical power. It sown as something they learned to do, and do better. So claiming ignorance or mechanics and then listing examples of famously effective and "powerful" wizards using it is not an impressive argument.

When Dumbledore heard about Tom's early magic use, he immediately thought that Tom Riddle would be a powerful wizard. Not that it meant he'd learn faster or better, though that is certainly implied to have happened. Dumbledore thought Tom's early abilities pointed to his eventual strength as the most powerful dark wizard ever, not the most skilled.

No proof is given for this, the most essential element of a long argument. Until that is done, this is merely an opinion up against the concrete examples I gave.

The training of students in the DA who were /at least/ two years older than Harry was when he drove off hundreds of Dementors only shows that it is possible, not that they could do the same feat after even greater training time.

Spells like Expelliarmus also /strongly/ suggest that innate ability factors in. Snape was thought to be scary and powerful and we see his spell was stronger than anything someone in the later DA ever produced. That is not truly overwhelming counter-evidence either, but it is quite suggestive.

There is also a confusion of definitions here. Is emotion a primary basis for casting powerful magic? Or at least, some powerful spells that would not work /as well/ without it? If so, then people with better emotional control have more powerful magical abilities than other people do. They can cast better torture curses and a better Patronus. Therefore, their ability to affect the world with that spell is stronger. Their magic, that magic, is stronger than someone else's, regardless of time spent in practice or study.

#+begin_quote
  Magical power is purely fanon. There's no evidence to support it that does not also support the skill theory, and there is no evidence that does not support the skill theory in a better way.
#+end_quote

Given that anything called "skill" is never said to affect quality or quantity of magic, it is at least as equally fan speculation as magical power. People are not said to be the "most skillful dark wizard ever", but the most /powerful/. More so, as no one ever says, "Wow, you defeated the Dark Lord when you were only one year old. I bet you studied really, really had to do that."

As Dumbledore said in HP:PS, "Voldemort had powers I will never have." Not skills. Powers.

Even /wands/ have more magical power than others:

#+begin_quote
  "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration."
#+end_quote

Voldemort's wand:

#+begin_quote
  "Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands..."
#+end_quote

It took a "powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts," unlike unicorn blood, the Stone can make something that will bring someone back "to full strength and power". This is literal magical power being referenced, not some mental prowess or learning.

These examples were just from searching through HP:PS. Interestingly, the word "skill" appears nowhere in my copy of that e-book. Which doesn't /necessarily/ mean anything by itself, but I think might points towards what JKR was aiming for in world-building her magic.

--------------

You have only claimed readers being left ignorant of mechanics and unsupported equations of magic to mental abilities in concrete disciplines as support for this theory, not examples of people learning more and getting better spell results until finally they have "mastered" a spell, and it works for them as well as for Dumbledore.

This categorization isn't useful at all, the way presented. If you define "skill" to mean things like inborn ability to perform magical feats, then sure. Regardless of why, Harry is just more "skilled" than most anyone else with the Patronus, and that's why he can drive off hundreds of dementors.

If you look at different people able to use magic without training, like Voldemort as a child and Harry, you have to take into account people literally /saying/ they'll be powerful wizards. The results of their inborn abilities, ones that have no clear educational antecedent like Harry's use of Patronus three years younger than anyone else and Voldemort and Dumbledore's adult results, really speak for themselves. Simply saying that difference is "skill" clearly isn't sufficient explanation, and seems to contradict canon's thematic and dramatic emphasis.

****** I am generally partial to the Seigio's position, in that I like that capacity to perform various types of magic is associated with traits that are not, themselves, magical, like general intelligence and knowledge, confidence, willpower, focus, as well as capacity for love, unbridled joy, and/or sadism. In other words, wizards are, most certainly, not created equal, but the things that make them unequal are not, themselves, magical in nature.

It is thematically fitting, and it integrates nicely with characters' personalities: sure, Bellatrix's sadism lets her cast a very powerful Cruciatus, but it also drives her engage in torture when there are better ways to accomplish a goal. (In particular, if it was, in fact, Bellatrix who had taught Draco Occlumency as Snape thought, Bellatrix must have had at least some skill in Legilimency. Yet, when interrogating Hermione, she didn't make use of it.) Riddle's psychopathic narcissism facilitates his imposing his will on reality via magic, but it also means that he tends to underestimate his enemies.

*However*, the bit quoted form HBP does seem to suggest some meaningful, measurable capacity for magic that does not depend on what one is doing with it. The other usages are ambiguous. Frankly, it's the best argument for a distinct Magical Power Meter (MPM) that I've seen to date, so kudos. I'll have to rethink my position. My beautiful theory may have been killed by an ugly fact.

I do think that a lot of the resistance to the concept is motivated by just how much it is abused and how the fanon notion that Harry's MPM value is oh-so-high has spread from bad (and not so bad) powerful!Harry fics to contaminate fics that don't even involve contests of magical power. It's just taken for granted, and that can be annoying.

Other than that, some reactions to the post --- since it has interesting worldbuilding:

- My impression when reading Harry's trial in OotP was that Figg and Dumbledore simply lied about her being able to see dementors, relying on it being an obscure enough factoid that nobody present would have the confidence to challenge Dumbledore over it.

- My headcanon is that after the Troll Incident, Hermione begged McGonagall (off screen) to not tell her parents about it, because they'd either pull her out of Hogwarts or worry endlessly. Her wishes were respected during CoS as well. Not cruel; just sad.

- I think that people make too much of the Patronus thing:

1. If the Dementors aren't targeting the caster specifically (reducing his or her ability to cast or sustain it in the first place), I don't think it matters how many of them there are, and, IIRC, they were targeting Harry's time-clone at the time. (Interestingly, only Harry and Hermione would know that.)

2. Vast, vast majority of wizards don't bother to even try to learn it in the first place, making it a rare skill, and, given that many DA students were able to make a lot of progress on it very quickly, I like Vera Rozhalsky's supposition that its supposed difficulty is Ministry propaganda, because wider knowledge of the charm reduces the effectiveness of their terror weapon.

3. Patronus Charm does have an unambiguous emotional component. My heacanon is that Harry's ability to cast it was, to a large part, a result of his capacity to Just Believe and Rejoice Freely without reservation --- and it helped very much that he had evidence that he had, in fact, already cast the spell. Someone like Hermione, whose MPM is comparable to Harry's, probably even higher, might nevertheless have more trouble with it, because how can she ever be unreservedly happy in a world in which house-elves are enslaved, political influence matters more than truth and justice, and people never do their homework unless you nag them? Someone like her would need to come up with a happy thought that distracts her from the world's problems.

- On pre-Hogwarts magical training, what's the point? It's too much like work (and wizards are, statistically, as lazy or lazier than Muggles), and they'll be covering the same curriculum at the same pace as everybody else once they get to Hogwarts, anyway. Also, we don't actually know if any of the pure- and half-bloods got any pre-Hogwarts tutoring. Maybe they had, maybe they hadn't. It probably doesn't make that big a difference in the long run, compared to how intelligent and motivated someone is when at Hogwarts.

- Given how characters who are known to have performed wandless magic pre-Hogwarts (Lily, Harry, Tom, Neville) aren't actually shown using it after they get to Hogwarts (that I can recall), I am inclined to view it as something like lactose tolerance in humans whose ancestors did not practice cattle husbandry: it's almost universal early on, then goes away as the child grows. Performing wandless magic afterwards therefore seems to me to be a different skillset from controlling Accidental Magic. However, learning to consciously control it while one has it is a strong indicator of extraordinary ambition, industriousness, capacity for focus, and general intelligence, so a child that does that does, indeed have the makings of a powerful wizard, whether or not MPM is a thing.

- IIRC, Harry's Lumos wasn't wandless as such, since it did, actually, involve a wand. It was cast without physical contact with a wand, but that's a different feat. Harry does seem to have the best of luck with wands, doesn't he? :P

Keep the "love is power" thing, at least. Dumbledore says, straight up, that having a whole soul is power Voldemort never understood, along with Harry's ability to love. This isn't the "love of his mother" protecting him waffle stuff. He literally says that love and an unblemished soul adds to Harry's power. He isn't being metaphorical there.

There are only 4 other people in your year of your gender, who else are you supposed to be friends with?

***** Not necessarily... 1k students would be 250/house, about 36 per year per house. So assuming all years were even, that's only about 70 in a first year two-house Charms class.

My average class size from about third grade on was 30 or so students to one teacher. High school moved it closer to forty. Now I'm in college and have dealt plenty with lecture hall type classes. It's not unreasonable for there to possibly be 70 people in one classroom.

These classes are also, iirc, only actually required up through fifth year. So assuming all numbers are constant, there's could be up to almost 300 students not taking a particular class in any given year. Even if everyone took a class, it would only require a professor to have fourteen classes to cover everybody.

Two hours is a reasonable upper time limit for a class, so that's 28 hours. Give it twice a week, and we're looking at 56. Professors live at the school as far as we can tell, take their meals there, and some seem to do patrols at night. We also don't see any weekend classes, though astronomy was I think once a week on Wednesday.

So we have professors working eleven hour days, though that can likely be cut down depending on the individual course, which isn't too far fetched (plenty of Muggles do that!).

The professors for the elective classes would guaranteed have even smaller work loads, since students have to choose to take the course, and only third years and higher can take them. Course loads may even lighten up concerning sixth and seventh years, because we saw how each instructor can set limits on who can advance after fifth year.

So yeah. It is a lot of work. But there could be ways of magically grading homework, and there's technically no canon showing that seventh years can't help out with things like that, since we don't see a typical seventh year in the books. It can be done without time turners! (but of course since we only see our inadequate numbers, this is all guesswork).

******** True, but I rather like the interpretation that the magical world is a lot smaller than people think... and it would be physically impossible for there to be much more than 1000 students per year for the reasons I explained.

Time to do the math:

There are 11 schools in the world, and let's assume that there are a maximum of twice that amount whose education / lack of makes them outside of the educational system altogether. Let's assume that there are 1000 people per year at Hogwarts. The entire population of witches/wizards, assuming that they live twice as long as muggles, would therefore be an easy estimate.

Looking at the world's age distribution, in 2000, a tenth of the population was ages 5-9, and accounting to lifespan, that would mean a tenth of the population was ages 10-18, one eighth of which are pre-school age. So, 1000 people are 7/80 of the population of Hogwarts students (past, present, future), which are 1/11 of the 1/3 of the population that goes to school.

Therefore, there are about 377000 witches/wizards in the world (as a maximum) in this case, but let's round it to 400000, which would mean that one out of 15000 people is a witch/wizard according to the data I used (2000 census). Assuming that there are a quarter that population, (280 per year) there are only 100000 people in the wizarding world, which would explain how the small amount of deaths are such a huge deal - 150 people dead in the final battle? HOLY SHIT, that's about one out of 700 people in dead!

That would explain so much: how Harry was such a legend before he first stepped into Hogwarts, the huge percent of purebloods considering that they are only 28 families, why the Order/DE are so small, etc. The Voldermort Wars would have as big an impact as WWI and WWII have on our society.

Dumbledore, Moody and Shacklebolt would be the "big three", Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt. They were the leaders. Harry would be Eisenhower, who struck the blows that ended the war. Snape would be Alan Turing (whose intelligence work was crucial to the allied victory, a brilliant scientific mind... but while he was celebrated after he died, on a personal level was reviled and mistrusted, and only decades later was accepted as belonging in that list).

Hogwarts is /the/ top magical school in Britain (or possibly the only) and they're teaching dangerous subjects. There's no way they would have practical classes with more than 30 kids a class. Also I have attempted repeatedly to create a schoolwide timetable for Hogwarts and have yet to succeed with only one teacher per subject.

I'm no expert, but as far as I can tell, using the info we have from JKR and the books, the academic running of Hogwarts is ridiculously difficult if not outright impossible.

Fanon: Snape is a mind raper Canon: He's a shitty teacher, but who knows how Occlumency can be taught?

Fanon: The Dursleys broke all the laws, especially the act of where the queen loves all of her children 1985. Canon: It's a made up world and Harry suffered the exact amount he needed to to make a good story.

Fanon: Sometimes September 2 is a Sunday. Sometimes it's a Wednesday. Canon: the year has 364 days.

Domes of power were pure fanon, until the freaking movies. But those are best ignored as gaudy spectacles. Need something visible after all. But lots of people take movies as canon, so domes of power are, /technically/, canon.

Wards, rune spells and stones, etc, are all fanon, but protections not linked to buildings is /pure/ canon. Hermione casts them first thing on their forest camps in book seven.

**** There are very few stories that have a great soul bond and a great plot and character development. I've spent a while digging through the rubbish to get to the great stories. To recommend a few:

One of my personal favorites is /the accidental bond/ by kb0 (Harry/Hermione/Ginny/Gabrielle): Harry finds that his "saving people thing" is a power of its own, capable of bonding single witches to him if their life is in mortal danger, with unusual results. H/multi *link* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond]]

Another would be /HJ Potter/ by S.M wane (H/HR): Who would expect that sharing a simple kiss with his best friend was all it needed to begin a journey far beyond his greatest imagination? Soul-bond fic *link* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter]]

One more is /The Bonds of Blood/ by Darth Marrs (H/G): YASBF Yet Another Soul Bond Fic starting with the Chamber of Secrets. Harry and Ginny have to learn to live with a bond that steals away their privacy and leaves them dependent on each other and frightened for their future. *link* [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5435295/1/The-Bonds-of-Blood]]

***** thanks for sharing your recommendations! The Bonds of Blood seems really interesting. def going to check that one out :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384611/1/Fire-Dragon][this]] is the only soul bonding themed story I've read.\\
Fire Dragon: Their friendship was unlikely, but as time went on, she got to know the real person behind the cold mask. Friendship is golden when the world turns black. Take what you can get, and hold on to those you have. Eventual DHr and nonhuman Draco later on.

The bonding doesn't come until later in the story, but I think it has really good plot and character development overall!

** I'm convinced that Draco Malfoy was really intelligent. Even though JKR didn't explicitly state it in the books, Draco was clever enough to fix the vanishing cabinet and get an O in Potions. I guess this is why dramione makes more sense to me than ronmione, since Ron seems seriously incompetent.

also, I agree about Ginny being absolutely crazy!

I think the OWLs were more like standardized testing, since they did have testers come in. so I don't think Snape's favoritism could have extended to there.

Not only that, when Dumbledore and Snape weren't fumbling around, trying to figure out his plan (not very hard, at that), they were, effectively, covering for him, and Heaven forbid anybody harm a hair on his blond head. Because, hey, /next time/ he decides to use an Unforgivable curse on an innocent bystander to smuggle a deadly artifact into Hogwarts, Hermione Granger will /again/ just happen to be nearby and prevent him from becoming a successful, rather than merely attempted, murderer, right?

*Edit:* Also, his job was made significantly easier by Hermione refusing to be involved in Harry's investigation, by what to me, at least, seems to be nothing more than Authorial Fiat, completely inconsistent with her earlier and later characterization.

Honestly, had Dumbledore and Snape simply grabbed him out of bed in the middle of the night and had Dumbledore, in his inimitable grandfatherly way, explain to Draco that he is working for /him/, now, with Snape glowering in the background, I think that Draco would have spilled in record time. Then, Obliviate him and put him back in bed as if nothing happened, in case Draco's vaunted Occlumency (which is a separate Draco-related mess) failed against Voldemort. Repeat biweekly, and subtly make sure that his plans don't actually hurt anyone and don't succeed until it's time for them to succeed.

This, on the other hand, is not fair, I think. Harry himself noted that the Potions OWL was much easier in front of an impartial evaluator, and I think that Draco would have reported the opposite experience. I don't doubt that Draco received /a lot/ of extra encouragement and tutoring in Potions, and it may well have been the only subject in which he had invested more than the minimum needed to get a decent grade (like Harry and DADA).

So, his O in Potions is, at the very least, an accurate reflection of his capabilities.

I think a lot of people are unfair about this one. Ever since second year, Harry's been trying to pin something on Draco. And he's been sort of an asshole this year. So Hermione telling him to talk to the hand, because the genius isn't listening seems less like arbitrary author railroading or her being a bitch (like most haters claim), and more like good prioritization on her part. Not turning into a cat or getting infinite detentions seems good motivation not to chase that snipe again.

Fair enough. I still don't think he's all that, and he clearly doesn't ever use it for anything interesting like Hermione does. He wasn't even in the running for Slughorn's prize that Harry won with the help of the Half-Blood Prince, was he?

Speaking of which, Hermione not wanting Harry to use a book containing strange instructions just seems rational after a) learning some of the spells in it are darkish and b) having been paralyzed for months the last time a strange magic book showed up. But it wasn't like she was going to make the mistake of turning in his potentially dangerous property or trying to tell a teacher again. That worked out really shitty the last times she tried those responsible solutions.

Lots of haters points to this as her being jealous and spiteful. I think "frustrated" is a perfectly human emotion at that point, especially after his fuckery with Ron and faking cheating at an athletic competition with the luck potion.

Fair enough. I don't think that her actions were particularly hate-worthy, but Harry did have some evidence of Draco being up to /something/ nefarious. It is not, of course, Hermione's job to investigate threats to Hogwarts, but, at the same time, where Harry had a track record of being wrong about Draco, Dumbledore & Co. have a track record of failing to address threats to Hogwarts. That said, she had just gotten burned following Harry into danger, so, I guess I may have overstated the case a bit --- her behavior was at least understandable, especially if one also takes into account Rongst.

This is probably getting off-topic, but while (a) makes perfect sense, (b) reasoning is simplistic to the point of superstition. The Potions advice was sound and verifiable, if nothing else. That said, she did investigate the origins of the book, ultimately identifying the Half-Blood Prince, which was, in fact, a rational thing to do.

In canon, potions is also the least safe class around, even including Care, and has the most disasters and side-effects of failure mentioned. Hermione experienced one of those first hand, making it a bit of an emotional topic I'd imagine.

That was in something like the last or next to last chapter. I think after Dumbledore died, even. I'm not sure how hard she was really trying, so I'm not sure she gets points for that one. But Harry /certainly/ loses points for messing with dark secrets without understanding the source or consequences.

Well, Slughorn seemed to have expected and rewarded out-of-the-box solutions and experimentation, so I suspect that at NEWT level, students are expected to be competent enough to handle the unexpected.

That said, I do see how Hermione's experiences may have made her rather timid in that regard. That's unfortunate. (It would have been neat if Hermione's reaction to Harry's revelation and Slughorn's grading rubric had been something like "You know, Harry, Snape would have skinned us alive if we modified potions instructions like that. Since Slughorn seems to be different..."; and then she would start tweaking her own Potions' recipes, ending up about even with Harry+HBP.)

To get back on topic for the thread, this is probably the origin of the "Hermione is oh-so-uncreative" fanon.

Yeah, it's very much fanon. I am past confusion on this matter, and well into profound annoyance. As far as I can tell, the meme comes from people who write powerful!indy!Harry or Dramione fanfics who feel the need to impose an uncanonical degree of passivity on to her character, so they latch on to the "killed --- or worse, expelled" gag, and act as if it's the final word on her character, when, a few weeks later, said character set the scariest teacher in Hogwarts on fire, because it was a matter of life and death, rather than a matter of preadolescent honor. (Funny thing about rules --- most of them are actually a good idea most of the time. For example, "Don't wander around an unfamiliar magic castle after hours" is a good one, because you might, say, run into a hungry cerebrus.)
