But if its possible, minimal bashing, I hate bashing, even of characters I hate.


** Dresden files is pretty good with this. Off the top of my head linkffn(Harry Potter and the most archove) or linkffn(the denarian renegade) are good ones. Vampires don't really show up in renegade till the sequel though.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

*** How much knowlege of Dresden Files should I have to read HP and Lost Archive and not be completely lost?

I know nothing of it, except that it is a series. Not even what it is about.

**** I don't think you really need any. It's pretty good at explaining stuff and if you don't get it googling it is pretty easy. I'm only on the 4th book myself. And Dresden files books are basically more adult version of Harry Potter with a magic system that follows scientific laws. Like the whole energy isn't made or destroyed and stuff.
