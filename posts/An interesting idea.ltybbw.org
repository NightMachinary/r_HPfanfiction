Hey now this is different to the usual prompt you'll see here. As we all know harry has been paired with quite a few different people but this is my idea. What if, whilst at gringotts to say claim his lordship, harry saves the Lord/King (if you think that the goblins have a city under there somewhere) from an attack on the Bank by voldimort and is given his daughters hand in marriage. Now the how and why are up to you but the main idea is that Harry ends up with the daughter of the Lord of gringotts. I'd love to see a novel length fic about this so if anyone on here wants to do just that please send me a link, I'd love to read it
