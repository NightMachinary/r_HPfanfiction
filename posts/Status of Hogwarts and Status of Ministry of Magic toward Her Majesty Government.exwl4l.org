Hogwarts was founded by the Greatest Four prior to even the foundation of Wizard Council of which the Wizengamot is a successor and founding element of the Ministry of Magic. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is governed by the Board of Governors as illustrated by the order of suspension towards Headmaster Albus Dumbledore in second year. The castle is in usage by the school from September first to the end of the school year whenever it is. All this would indicate towards Hogwarts Sovereignty and independence from the Ministry of Magic and that it is not bound by the laws of the Ministry.

And yet the Ministry of Magic has interfered many times at Hogwarts of which we are aware

- Torquil Travers in the capacity of Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement not only interrupted the defense class, interrogated Prof of Defense Dumbledore under a posture similar to under arrest but also declared that he could go where ever he want.
- Cornelius Fudge in the capacity of Ministry of Magic proceeded to arrest on Hogwarts Ground Rubeus Hagrid, Ground Keeper and Keeper of Keys, and detained him immediately in Azkaban Prison without even a trial with the only justification that the Ministry has to be seen to be doing something. The attacks where on Hogwarts Ground it was Hogwarts responsibility to act not the Ministry.
- Cornelius Fudge posted Dementors on Hogwarts Lands in third year.
- Ministry of Magic move to expel a student of Hogwarts.
- Ministry of Magic interference at Hogwarts in year five : education decrees, teacher post nomination, creation of post not existent before, review of teachers and termination of teachers contract and finally termination of Headmaster contract.and nomination to Headmaster Post Notwithstanding that the Headmaster Office has sealed itself.

It is not certain of the board of governors position on those Ministry interference. But those interference tend to mean that Hogwarts has no sovereignty of its own and no independence from the Ministry but only a semi autonomy.

What is realy Hogwarts status ? The Lands are public domain or private to the founders ?

And what is the situation of the Ministry of Magic towards the Crown and Her Majesty Government ?

Wizards seem to do whatever they want to the muggle governments. I doubt they have any loyalty toward the Crown. They casually use memory charms on muggle leaders lol

*** Yeah, but I'd bet that MI5 and the Ministry of Defense have more than a few magic-aware people keeping an eye on things, recording all the times wizards abuse magic against government officials, and quietly working on plans to deal with the Ministry of Magic and/or the entire magical population if (or more likely when) they cross the line far enough that it's worth the cost to bring them to heel. They've probably got a fair number of disaffected Squibs and Muggle-borns working with them, too.

**** What makes you think wizards don't have people keeping an eye on them too?

And what are they gonna do really. Assassinate a few lone wizards, maybe. Wizards hide behind protections that muggles literally can't comprehend. They can hardly do anything.

If they could, they'd have done it by now. Wizards mere existence would be a huuuge threat they'd want to deal with. They wouldn't wait until wizards blew up a city or whatever.

***** Considering the Ministry is mostly run by people that consider Muggles to be clever primitives at best, I seriously doubt they'd think that the Muggle government was worth worrying about. They probably only keep in touch with the PM because there are times when it helps to have Muggles working with/for them.

"What are they gonna do" depends upon the details of how certain magical defenses work and how many disaffected magicals they have on their side. Muggle-Repelling Charms don't work on wizards, witches, or Squibs. Have a few Squib soldiers (since the military makes sense as a place for people to end up when they have no resources and no non-magical education or skills) point a laser designator at Malfoy Manor, for example, and drop a couple smart bombs. As long as the detonators are simple enough to not get fried by the ambient magic and there's no wards to block against bombardment, it'd work just fine.

As for why they haven't moved against magicals and/or the Ministry yet, it's a cost/benefit thing. Any attempt to bring the magicals to heel would almost certainly result in full-scale war, which isn't something you want to attempt unless you really HAVE to. While Muggles might be able to do a lot of damage to magicals (even assuming they haven't yet discovered technological counters to magic), magicals could definitely cause a LOT of damage in the Muggle world.

And I stop reading there. This is fanon nonsense. There are whole departments in the Ministry dedicated to dealing with muggles. Kingsley Shacklebolt, a pureblood, blends in so well with muggles in their government that even the prime minister (who knows about magic) doesn't suspect a single thing.

******* A long-awaited Ministry for Magic report made public today warns against the dangers of underestimating Muggles."\\
-- excerpt from an article in the /Daily Prophet/ (DP1)

This article in the /Prophet/ outlines the findings of a report by a committee on [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/muggle/][Muggles]], headed by Professor [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/phoebus-penrose/][Phoebus Penrose]], entitled “[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/a-study-into-muggle-suspicions-about-magic/][A Study into Muggle Suspicions about Magic]]“. Examples given of magic noticed by Muggles in the article are:

​

- [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/crop-circles/][crop circles]], which are actually entries in the “Contorting Cereals Division” of the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/annual-international-gardening-competition/][Annual International Wizard Gardening Competition]];

******* And yet Fudge describes guns as "a sort of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other" (not sure that's the exact quote, but don't feel like looking it up). The guy in charge of dealing with a lot of Muggle-baiting is treated as a joke, given an office with only one other member, paid poorly, and also knows almost nothing about Muggles. Seems to me like Kingsley is probably the exception rather than the rule.

Pretty sure a journalist describes it as that. And that means nothing. Could be for a small minority of purebloods.

"Let me ignore this whole department that's the exact opposite of all that and just focus on one wizard instead."

Speaking of Arthur, Arthur Weasley does know about guns lmao.

Muggleborns come in regularly. Halfbloods are the most common wizard.

Guns and bombs have been around for literally centuries, bombs have destroyed cities, wizards would obviously know about these.

Again, Kingsley Shacklebolt, a pureblood, blends in so well with muggles in their government that even the prime minister (who knows about magic) doesn't suspect a single thing. Barty Crouch can do the same thing and he was the Minister.

The Ministry of Magic has a whole department dedicated to dealing with the Muggle world.

***** Hypothesis : Merlin appears to exist in the Harry Potter Universe (Canon) , we can elaborate that as as "Councillor" of King Arthur he developed a way for the Crown to protect themselves from magical rebellion ? Oaths ?

Hypothesis 2 : Why magic may protect from biological weapon, I am no sure it could against nuclear weapon as nature itself is vulnerable against it. That and full scale war would demonstrate the power behind numbers, even if Magical Britain received help from the others magical community and the International Confederation of Wizards, it would still end by the muggle Pyrrhic victory.

That doesn't make sense. Magic overrides nature completely. It's not like magic relies on nature. I don't see any reason why magic can't stop nukes.

If you want to look at it from a logical/scientific/energy point of view, the amount of energy it would require for wizards to create the matter they do makes nukes look like toys.

Read up on the amount of energy it takes to create matter. Even creating a small cup of water is equivalent to like 250 nuclear bombs. Wizards casually create giant streams of water.

Also don't see why muggles would use nukes. We don't even use them in real life. We def wouldn't use them on wizards who live in our own cities.
