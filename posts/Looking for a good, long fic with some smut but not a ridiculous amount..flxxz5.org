Hello,

I lost my job last week and while I've found another, they are on a hiring freeze for the next two weeks. I'm working part time in retail in the meantime but I'm looking for something long (100k+ words) with a few lemons thrown in to read while I'm off.

I've been searching and I feel that people write 100% smut or not at all and I'm trying to find a happy medium. I want some plot with my porn.

I'd like it to be Harry centric with no slash if possible. Multi/Harem is okay if it works well in the story.

Thanks!


** "Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus" was really good. Now the author is working on a sequel.

** One of the longest fics in the HP fandom is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/41198]["Like none other"]] series by Aspeninthesunlight on ao3. Over 1.5 million words, longer than the original HP series.

Snape adopts Harry in 5th (or 6th?) year and the story goes from there. Zero slash and well-written. I especially love it for the half-way realistic description of teenagers with childhood trauma and attachment issues that get adopted - it is not all sunshine and roses and Harry and Snape struggle with lots of shit.

The third part is unfinished, but gets updated on the regular. No smut as far as I can remember. (Has been a while since I read it.)
