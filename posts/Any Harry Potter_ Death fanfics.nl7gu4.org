It could be slash it could just be platonic or weirdly intimate at the same time.

By this point I would even read it from Watty if there r any (FF.net and A03 appreciated^{^{)}}

What i am looking for are fics where Death has a physical body and a relationship with Harry. But whether Harry is MoD or not I'd rather not have the

'goes to gringotts finds out that he is the lord of (insert every dam ancient-most-noble-house-of), has a lot of frikn powers that he just suddenly gains cause of inheritance/ritual/potion/etc

-i mean i don't mind him suddenly gaining powers just don't give him all the dam powers aka-

<Harry looked into the gringotts inheritance test the blood blah blah make list "OMG dumbledore is frick-him-dore. Now i have! (Insert every dam magical power and have photographic memory bonus....) now i can have 3 soulmates that just keep adding! Oh and I now have long hair that goes to my butt and i have sudden tattoos and i---> and so on....

I think yall know what i mean right?

If its slash I don't really care if its f/f, m/m, m/f, f/m .. please.... i need a fic... any fic.... I won't even mind if Death is just friendly(or fatherly)! I want Death to interact with the wizards/muggles/humans/mortals by shockinh them that Harry knows/loves Death.

Too much?


** I have a couple! On a pale horse linkffn(10685852) Very very good fic! Unfortunately it's not finished but even as it is it's worth it! Death is a Master of Death Harry Potter form a parallel universe summoned to the harry potter universe during fifth/sixth year (sorry can't remember properly). The relationship between Harry and death is really great, at times heartbreaking while often hilarious. The relationship is often also viewed from an outside pov so that may be of interest to you! The relationship is mostly platonic I think, but can be read as romantic easily (death is a little touch starved). One thing though, I don't know how you feel about it so I thought to mention it, it contains Dumbledore bashing.

The master of Death linkao3(17672156) Includes time travel (harry from a couple years post canon goes back to the summer of fifth year) and a developing romantic relationship between Harry and Death. Harry also undergoes a morality shift due to being the master of death, which is interesting.

Also, I don't know if it counts but I cannot not include this series, which is one of my absolute favourites in the HP fandom:

Like a Ghost in my Town, which includes: Stand Against the Moon linkao3(2378855) Nose to the Wind linkao3(15562401)

Basically, after Harry becomes Master of Death he can be reborn as himself in a parallel universe every time he dies, but due to a series of events in his first life he is always born as a werewolf. The relationship between Harry and Death isn't center stage and it's platonic (the romantic relationship in both stories is Harry/Tom Riddle) but it's very enjoyable to read. Harry and Death are incredibly fond of each other, and they have inside jokes and fond teasing between them. Their relationship is explored more in the second story (which is my favourite) and it's amazing. I cannot recommend this series enough, I reread it every couple of months because I really love it!

Hope these are similar to what you're looking for!

  "A second chance,â€œ Death said. Harry stopped in front of a bench and turned to look at the being. "A second chance at what?" "Life."Harry laughed bitterly. "Because that has worked out so great the first time?"Death tilted its head. "You've changed," it stated."Life does that to you," Harry said and his mind felt clearer than ever, "Or should I say the last seven years. I never really left this place, have I? I lived a life feeling not quite dead and not alive either," he spat. "I know how you feel," Death said after a moment, grinning."Oh, do you," Harry retorted and pierced Death with a look. The being's smirk widened as it leaned closer."Bored." Years after the war, Harry Potter lives an apathetic life. When Death offers him a second chance he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.Seeking to make up for the boredom of past years, Harry isn't above carving his own space between two sides to even out the playing field.

  Cursed against his will, Harry made the best of his life until he found himself, again, wandering in Death's realm. When Death offers him a second chance, a chance to right the wrongs he'd been blind to for too long, he can't possibly refuse.

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.
