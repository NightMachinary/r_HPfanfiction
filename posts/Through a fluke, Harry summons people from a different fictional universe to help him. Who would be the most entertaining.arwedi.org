** Bayonetta would probably be worth a few solid laughs. She even has the British accent going on. Bonus points for someone like Umbridge trying to have her arrested or killed or whatever on the grounds of being contracted with literal demons and getting their ass beat for their troubles. But she'd also completely trivialize the main plot since Voldemort is nowhere near the level of Jubileus and Aesir so it would have to be pure crack/humor.

The same would probably apply to Dante, as well, although I've never played his games.

*** Yeah, I think that some universes would work well for a serious story with high stakes and tension. But others will not work for serious ones because magic breaks that universe or because that universe breaks the HP one. For example, HP magic utterly breaks Game of Thrones. Even a mediocre wizard could take over the world in a few years. Sometimes it can work both ways (eg magic might utterly neutralise the space magic from Mass Effect, but bullets at relativistic speeds are still enough to wipe the Death Eaters out in ten seconds).

Those can still make for hilarious stories and I think Bayonetta would fall firmly into that camp. Or Van Helsing.

** As much as I like ASOIAF, I don't think that any human character would be much use in the HP universe when even schoolchildren can take care of dragons. Halo has more potential in that regard, but the characters are rather flat and have few interests other than the art of war. Star Trek would either be too pacifistic or wouldn't care about helping Harry, as hilarious as Borg support would be.

Star Wars and Mass Effect have some potential, especially if you take Vader or Renegade Shepard, Samara and either Krogan companion. And imagine the utter massacre Vader would cause with his 501st Legion.

**** And neither has any form of defence against HP spells. One imperius and you can wipe out the entire House of Black and White with a human bomb or have Jaquen go berserk inside. Stuff like Veritaserum and wards also completely breaks any chance for intrigue against the magical characters. Melisandre might have some striking power against witches and wizards, but assassinating her would also be very easy (disillusionment, killing curse and apparating away).

The one thread I see is the night king, but with what we know about transfiguration, you could rig up a few shotgun cannons and load them with dragon glass to completely fuck the WW up. Or use magic to industrialise Westeros if you have more time. After all, at least Muggleborn and Muggle-raised characters (like Harry and Hermione) have heard about inventions like steam engines, flame throwers and guns. They could easily rig up enough stuff to defeat any foe without directly fighting them with magic.

***** I think you are placing too much stock on the volva magic of HP universe. The ASOIAF magic is different in essence.

Take Melisandre for example. Sor starters, the womam is over 300 years old. She has been practicing the Dark Arts for longer than Voldy and in Ashai of all places. She does not need a wand. She does not need potions. She survives poisoning...she kills a possesed animal...she gives birth to a shadow baby ...and she brings Jon Snow back to life.

If the leaks are true, she is even trained in war combat. The Temple of Light has warriors-priests who fight with Dark Magic and despite not being Mel´s main area of expertise, she is suposedly trained enough to be a powerful necromancer- yet to be seen, but I believe it is true.

All of it wandlessly, mind you.

My point being: Mel has already been attacked and survived. Whoever lives 300 years has some sort of shield against Death, so it is not a stretch, if one is writing a fic, to make Mel somewhat imune to , let´s say, an Imperious, as she should have her mind well trained to be able to entre a possesed animal´s mind to kill it, and to have at least a couple of more effective means of attack and defense in her repertoire.

As for Jacqen: the Magic of the House of Black and White is even more subtle and misterious...but in no way less powerful. Those guys have been tnuning their chops for centuries and their business is Death. The House is heavily protected by Magic too, it is implied- the door is made of weirwood; there is the hall of faces and the pool there and nobody enters the place without their knowledge. As I said, they firmly believe Death as God and they would go bonkers about Voldermort trying to deny the Many Faced God.

Their own modus operanti would make sure they are not noticed, let alone attacked by the Death Eaters. They do not combat openly. They simply steal faces, infiltrate, and kill their targets. When they steal faces, they have access to the memories of the person they are impersonating. Let´s say, they steal Lucius face: Voldemort would NEVER know what hit him. He would be killed and end of story.

Now, of course, they would only care to kill Voldemort for his offenses against the Many Faced God- Harry and the others would still need to deal with the DE.

It would be very interesting to have a fic with a plot like, Harry prays for Death, and the Many Faced God hears it- Jacqen comes and takes the assignment for free, as Voldemort has denied Death what it is its due, so he cannot let this slide. He infiltrates the DE, deals with the horcruxes ( or not- If Death, as a God is involved, it could very well be that the Faceless Men deal with getting the bodies and Death deals with getting the souls once a contract is signed?) and voilá, no more Tom Riddle!

****** You realise that anyone with a basic understanding of Muggle things and transfiguration would be able to rig up tons of explosives within a few hours, disillusion the package, place it on an outside wall and turn the entire house of black and white into a crater, right? Weirwood door or not, we are talking about bunker busting quantities of explosive, which can even be airdropped with a first year spell.

As for the scenario you described, they are still muggles. A simple repelling charm is enough to stop them. They can't get into Diagon, the Ministry, Hogwarts and presumably any pureblood manor. They have no defense against even basic cursed items. As arrogant as Lucius Malfoy is, the inherent superiority of magic backs his bark up. Even if faceless men can take memories, they can't take magic.

******** Yes, and Rowling's "the good guys don't kill" is the one of two reasons why the battle of Hogwarts didn't end like a mass charge in WWI (eg hundreds die without reaching the enemy lines). The other being that it's rather anticlimactic. And you can make an argument that shield charms would hold against firearms, even if I'm not particularly convinced. But against medieval people with no magic comparable to HP?

As for the magic, it is a lot weaker and requires sacrifice (mostly blood and body parts). In Harry Potter you have the killing curse. In ASOIAF, you need a sacrificial ritual to summon a shadow, which then grows in your womb before being born to assassinate someone. There is no transfiguration, no charms and no combat magic. It's like putting a teenager with a knife against a special forces squad.

If sacrifice is necessary, then it needn't come from the wizarding world. They could probably use muggles.

Besides, from a cursory glance at the wiki, there are capabilities that they can reach that aren't attainable by any means in the wizarding world, such as raising the dead, more focused divination, and bloodmagic.

******** I don't think the two magic systems are compatible at all. In the Harry Potter universe, magic is something that a certain subset of humans are born with varying levels of. They manifest it as children and are taught to harness it as adolescents. They use it frequently in their classes, read about research to refine and improve it, and in their adult lives they use it for purposes as trivial as making a meal or getting a haircut. It's like electricity, with many uses both mundane and amazing, as well as new applications of it constantly being discovered.

In the Song of Ice and Fire universe, magic is something rare, terrible and strange, that comes into the world and changes it forever. Magic is used to kill kings, to change seasons, to steal faces. It is not a science to be researched or commodity to be used for trivial purposes. People with magical power gain it at a terrible price, and often by their very natures are set apart from the rest of humanity, like Bloodraven or the Winter King.

Someone with the physical abilities a Harry Potter wizard has would basically be haxx in the Song of Ice and Fire universe, and someone with the narrative power of a Song of Ice and Fire magic user would similarly turn the Harry Potter world on it's head.

********* Actually, the point you are making- that Magic in ASOIAF is an exception, not the rule and it is used in twisted ways- although an understandable conclusion, is notthe story the books tell.

The world was magical once; people in the North would sacrifice for the weirwoods; Starks defeated the warg King and took on their powers; The Reeds are part Children of the Forest...The Reach, with the Gardener Kings, were keen on fertility Magic...the Storm King defied Gods and created a Magical Castle.

So, the world WAS magical once...people in ASOIAF lived side by side with Magical beings and practicioners. Just After the Long Night and with the Andals that Magic was left behind.

In Essos, there are still cities operating on Magic and creating powerful Magical practicioners.

In Westeros, the last Hurrah of Magic was when the Targs invaded. Once the Dragons were gone, the Tragaryens lost much of their Magic, but as we saw with Dany, they got it back through blood Sacrifice- because yes, you are right, to lose Magic and try to regain it in ASOIAF means you have to pay a price.

The point of the exercise at the Citadel- to ignite a candle- is exactly to show that once thier world WAs magic, but not now.

So, yes, they saw a retraction of Magic in Westeros in particular, but that world is Magical and, what is more, Magic is coming back.

But their Magic Sytems clashing ...this is what it would make writinga fic about it interesting IMO.

******** Yes, but they don't have magic in the HP sense, other than perhaps shadow binding and divination, which requires a long time to work. Compare that to killing, blasting and piercing curses, and that's only the shadowbinders of Asshai. A single witch or wizard could take over Westeros with ease.

Also, most Horcruxes are defended in a manner which quickly kills the faceless men. Especially the ring, but the cup would be safe at Gringotts as well since their defenses unveil any disguise. The cave would simply get a few corpses more.

********* Maybe yes, maybe not. That is the beauty of it: we do not know what they cannot do....just what they can do. For a fanfic writer, this is gold.

rationally speaking, I do believe one does not survive over 300 years just by keeping quiet. Mel must have some knowledge of offensive and defensive spells- her necklace glamour, for all I know, must be what was keeping her from dying when the Maester tried to poisoned her.

and this:

#+begin_quote
  It is rumored that spellsingers, aeromancers, and warlocks practice their arts openly in Asshai.[15] Asshai is open to all sorts of practitioners of the "higher mysteries", as well as torturers and poisoners, and even worshippers of the Black Goat and Bakkalon and the Lion of Night. No practice is forbidden in the city, however depraved"
#+end_quote

Mel is from Asshai...so, yeah, i think she would be good face to face with DE. Not all of them- you are just trying to imagine who would be assisting Harry in his quest, so he would still be casting like crazy at his enemies.

As for the Faceless Men- more or less the same. We just have hints of what they can do. Political assassination is something that would have helped end the First Wizarding War for instance, and possibly the second. Jacqen could very well kill Voldemort- he does not need to keep his cover for even long for that- Harry and the others could still hunt the horcruxes and face off with the DA. Jacqen is a killer, not a soldier.
