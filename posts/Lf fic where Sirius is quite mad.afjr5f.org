I'd like to read a PoA fic where Sirius is actually as mad as Fudge claims him to be, post breakout. I just don't see how he'd actually be so unaffected by Dementors after twelve years in their company. He'd have brief bouts of lucidity, sure, but his mind would still be under their effects.


** I don't know of any, but in regards to your not seeing why he'd be so unaffected; this might be fanon, but I'm reasonably sure that it's canon that being in his animagus state shielded him from the majority of their effects, as animals aren't nearly so badly affected.

*** On the other hand staying in one's animagus form for 12 years should have some non-trivial side effects, those could be fun to explore.

**** Wormtail seems to disprove this, at least in canon. He stays in animagus form longer than Sirius and is affected less, showing it's the Azkaban that does it. Any fic, in order to be internally consistent would have to make Wormtail similarly changed.

***** I dunno I mean we don't see enough of him to be sure that Wormtail wasn't effected. Seeing as we know very little about Sirius or Wormtail before they spent years in Azkaban I'd say it's free game.

** Simply being in prison for twelve years could drive someone mad, no dementors required. He was either in solitary confinement or only had demented Death Eaters for company.

He didn't seem particularly sane when we first encountered him, slashing the fat lady and so on. I'd like to read more about this too.

I started writing one where he decides to just stay in dog form for the rest of his life, but I have too many works in progress already so it's not up.

*** Well, I'd wager it was simply rage at not getting his way on that day (it /was/ Halloween, the night it all went wrong) I'd say he was sane enough to know the date, but the Fat Lady refusing his entrance was what set him off.

** Per canon. Ie the third book. Fudge describes Sirius as perfectly same and we spoken right before his break out.

We like to fanon it to him being slightly deranged, but per canon he is supposed to have endured it very well be turning into padfoot.

*** Maybe, just as wizards are naturally resistant to muggle diseases, they're naturally resistant to insanity.

** I wrote a fic set during OotP in which he was certainly damaged, but not mad. I don't think he ever lost his grip on reality (though the OotP film implies differently, which---being that Sirius is my favourite character---infuriates me).

I have never attempted a fic set during PoA but I definitely think there are stories to tell about how he got to Little Whinging and all the adventures he might have had. Though I don't think he was insane, I do think he was very damaged and very very angry. It would be an interesting exercise in writing an unreliable narrator.
