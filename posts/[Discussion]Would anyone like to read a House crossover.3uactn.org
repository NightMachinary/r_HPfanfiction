I saw [[http://powerupz77.deviantart.com/art/It-s-not-lupus-507890701][this]] brilliant piece of fanart subsituting House characters with those from Harry Potter.

It had Snape as House, Harry as Foreman, Hermione as Cameron and Ron as Chase. The artist also mentioned that Lupin would be Wilson.

Think about it. I don't really know about the rest, but House and Snape are really similar characters. Both of them are full of angsty shit from their pasts and have a very caustic brand of sarcasm.

I tried subsituting some lines and it worked +beautifully+ fine. See it [[http://imgur.com/a/YrJbp][here]]. Yes, it is by nature Snape/Lupin and slightly Snape/Tonks, but I don't care.

So, what is your opinion on a crossover fic? It will be post-DH, and Snape lives, but with some sort of permanent nerve damage from Nagini's venom. Lupin and Tonks survive as well. Somehow, they will find themselves at St. Mungo's as volunteer Healers after the war.


** I prefer "House thrust into HP world" if it's a HP/House xover. Hence my previous House/HP recommendations in previous xover threads. If you're talking about shoving lines from House into HP characters mouths it might be interesting....depending on how it is done.

*** Or Harry peaces out after Voldemort dies and ends up working in a teaching hospital in New Jersey.

I doubt I would read your story OP mostly because House is great because of the character house and the dialog with him, and I am not a fan of Snape centric stories.

** I don't know where you got the idea this was a Snape-centric story, or that it didn't have good dialogue... linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8380948/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Devilishly-Handsome-Doctor]])

** Actually OP, what you're describing is a fusion and not a crossover.

** Okay, thanks for all of your input, guys! Actually, now I'm thinking of writing a fic in the same vein as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4427065/1/Strange-Bedfellows][Strange Bedfellows]] where a HP character on the run stumbles into the Muggle world and struggles to assimilate, finding new friends and a new place in life. In this case, I'm using Snape because he's my favourite character, and the clash of personalities with House will be very interesting to write. So the focus will be very much on the House universe and not really about HP. I guess that Snape will find a job in the hospital or something. Of course, House will do some digging on his own, and sooner or later confront magic.
