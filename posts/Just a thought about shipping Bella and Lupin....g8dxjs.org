(I wrote something about the same...I am a very much amateur in writing fanfic...This is my first one...All sorts of criticism and suggestions are welcomed)

It was during their last year , Andromeda , still a part of the family then , invited Sirius to a friend's party , and he brought the Madaurers along with him , after all , he couldn't imagine staying around his pure blood prejudiced family. And in the party , Sirius was thankful to have just his cousins and Andromeda's friends around. So Remus went to fetch some wine and on the way , bumped into Bellatrix.

" HEY ! Watch out ...you blind git !" Bella yelled at once. With her lustrous dark curls resting over her charming face , she turned hastily , cleaning the spilled wine over her violet dress robes.

"Look , What you just-" She looked up towards Remus , losing track of her words.

" Whoops ! I'm so sorry ! " Remus suddenly spoke, with his free hand reflexly raising up , and soon realising it was Bellatrix .

Bella looked at Remus , pale brown eyes , with stretched scars over his face. She didn't break the stare , peeping deep into the wild scratches , the ones that constantly reminds him of what a monster he is , and she , as if finding patches of him , which could overlap with hers...

Remus glanced at the unintentionally revealed dark mark on her arm , a flick of anger sore to his throat , but as he gazed upwards to her , he suddenly felt something more than all the malice she had. Her scarlet cheeks blooming, beyond all the wrath. He saw the slight movement of her lips , as if breaking all the vicious chains she was binded into , her dark eyes , concealing secrets untold, wrapped fears and helplessness burried so deep under dreaths of voldemort.

And Remus was lost , feeling so close untying the unknown knots , which were far away from hatred and depravity.

"There you are , C'mon Remus ! "

She flickered her eyes , and broke the glance.

"Where on earth have you been , Moony?"

She saw Sirius and James coming into sight. She moved back , a step or two ..

"You stay AWAY from my friends , Bellatrix! " Sirius , inches close from her face , said furiously .

" I don't fancy company of blood traitors , either." She said coldly , glancing Sirius , turning away from him.

Remus stared Bellatrix leaving , his mind spinning upon what secrets could the heart of such an evil person , hide? And what's in her that he's attracted to - her maleficence or the curosity of what lies behind it?

"Moony !-" Sirius waved his hand in front of Remus' eyes "-Are you okay?"

"Yea...Yeah..I am good. Just that wine..." Remus pulled himself back from his thoughts on bellatrix , who now was completely out of sight , merging into the crowd around.

"Here's to..er..us" he raised his glass up in the air. And the party was about to end.

"Thanks for the invite , Dromeda ! " Sirius smiled , biding farewell to Andromeda.

" See , told you it would be fun. " She then turned towards Ted , whose arm she was holding in his , "I've always told him to join such gatherings , atleast with us, his cousins." Sirius blushed .

" Ohh dear Dromeda! How many times , do I have to tell you to stay away from such mudbloods."

"Cissy! I...I 've told you...I love him."

" Andromeda! Don't get started, again. You know the consequences."

"Cissy is right Dromeda... Don't loose your senses drooling over in the nasty love tale this flithy mudblood has spun around you."

Bellatrix looked at Ted with all the contempt in the world . She glanced towards sirius , "Unless you want to be thrown out as a blood traitor." She hissed. Sirius tried to control his anger.

But suddenly her gaze went to Remus... And he looked back , locking his eyes deep into hers .The trail of thoughts began in his brain , resonating with his heart beating faster.

"Let's go guys ! See you Dromeda..." Sirius broke the silence .

Remus was not willing to break off...She was beyond a killer , he knew , but there was some kind of inertia , tempting the hidden monster inside him to her demons...

As if two poisons were being poured together in a single goblet , annulling each other , revealing what lies hidden ,deep.

He couldn't gather himself to turn and go...he wanted to see , what'll happen, when the venoms react , it would be catastrophic he knows...But he yearns to stay...waiting for the answer... waiting for what may not happen ever...

"She's with Him...Just as you so know" James whispered to Remus , pulling him towards the exit door...


** Woah, dude. This is some deep s*** pardon my language. Also I've actually seen the paring though mostly not explored and barely talked about so good for you!
