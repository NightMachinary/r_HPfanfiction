** What the fuck. Literally nothing about this story has to do with magic or Harry Potter. I don't give a fuck that Harry's supposed to show up later, as it clearly shows that you tagged it complete with 1 chapter. This fic is as far from Harry Potter as possible. The least you could do is change the tags and add some warnings for the oc's.

*** Dude I haven't posted the second chapter yet A03 automatically tags is complete if you don't check that little box that says it's a multi chapter work. When I post the second chapter I will market as incomplete I don't know how many chapters they're going to be yet that's why I haven't posted it as one of however many chapters as of yet.

**** You have it marked complete, you have it tagged as an original work, and most importantly, you've done this several times before. In fact, I recall you specifically using this same excuse before, only to delete the story instead of ever including anything about Harry Potter. So I am really not inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt anymore.
