I see this as a major problem when people write fics in years 1-4. It erks me when an 11-14 year old versions of the characters start waxing poetic like a drunken English major. Hermione i can understand to a degree since she is a smarter character. But have you ever heard an 11 year old speak or seen teo 12 year olds have a conversation? They don't talk like mini adults. Regardless if they've been had a "proper upbringing." They're speech is simplistic and less refined. But a lot of authors don't seem to grasp this. Am i alone in this? Does it bother anyone else?


** 11 year olds definitely shouldn't be waxing poetic or talking like politicians. That said, with the right upbringing and the right amount of snobbishness, you can have 11 year olds going about like awkward politicians. I've certainly talked to 8 year olds who used words like privilege and duty and whatnot in that funny but nonsensical way. Mind you, my mother was babysitting one such child, which made it ten times funnier when it was him who had privileges that could be taken away and not vice versa.

*** A touchstone for me when writing children discussing political issues is my own memories of 9/11.

A momentous event like that of course attracted a lot of discussion among my year group - it's not like, because the event was political, we wouldn't talk about it. Children can and do talk about subjects of a political nature.

But the key is to remember the /way/ we talked about it i.e. in very basic terms. For us, the matter was very simple: America had been attacked; America was the most powerful country in the world; ergo America would have swift and effective vengeance. I even remember people talking about how America would use nuclear weapons in response.

So we were talking about political things, and we had our own ideas and opinions on the topic. But we completely lacked perspective or nuance. We didn't comprehend the idea of asymmetric/guerrilla warfare. We didn't understand that having nuclear weapons wasn't some kind of magic bullet against all kinds of military problems - to us, it was obvious that the country with the most powerful weapons should always win. And we didn't understand the history behind the attacks. Etc.

This is just background for this story: I was reading the newspapers as a 7 year old, not understanding much when I happened upon an article about the AIDS epidemic and how condoms are essential to combat this fatal disease. (This was the mid-90s and there was still very much fear and panic over HIV/AIDS.) My family love reminding me that they found me running to the sitting room in tears, sobbing and asking them to please buy me some condoms or else I might get AIDS!

***** I go on a 4 night overnight trip with 5th graders every year. About 75-80% of them bring stuffies. Most of them are still anxious about a laundry list of shit. Their emotions go from 12 to 6 and back again within a span of a few minutes. They are constantly insecure about social dynamics and even the ones that seem confident are screaming on the inside. The majority still want to be kids and are pissed off that that's changing, and the minority want to be doing things teenagers are doing but have no idea how so they're awkward as hell.

I love the Harry Potter books, but the 11 year olds in the books are nothing like real 11 year olds. That actually holds true for most books involving preteens (His Dark Materials, Chronicles of Narnia, Lemony Snicket, etc).

Truth is readers would hate reading accurate depictions of 11 year olds because of just how haywire their minds are. It's a really fun age to work with as an adult, but only if you have a good sense of humor and know how to deal with their craziness to help them find a more stable, central zone of thinking.

Didn't you know that in fanfic, a Slytherin character's plot potential is directly correlated to how well he swirls his beverages, smirks, drawls, and quotes Milton? Without these kinds of interesting traits to indicate a character's level of sophistication and intelligence, they might as well be a background extra.

** It's always a tricky balance. On the one hand, you want your characters to feel realistic, which means acting their age. On the other hand, realistic children are going to annoy any adult reader due to their immaturity etc.

It's a bit like dialogue: the goal is to provide the reader with a sense of /realism/, without actually replicating genuine speech (which lacks the focus of fictional dialogue).

Indeed, sometimes writing children too realistically can actually result in readers feeling like your story is unrealistic, because when we read children we are comparing them not to real children, but to the myths we tell ourselves about children. Real children of Hogwarts age can frequently be quite cruel, and are often more sexually aware than adults are comfortable with. So if you write a child too realistically, an adult reader will probably feel that they are not written in an age-appropriate way. Children are a lot more innocent in our heads than in reality.

I ran into this problem in the original Alexandra Potter. I wrote characters saying and doing things that I distinctly remembered from my own school experiences in "First Year", and they were frequently identified by adult readers as being too mature for 11 to 12-year-olds.

In Victoria Potter I try to circumvent these issues by being selective about what I show. I evoke childishness by showing children playing games, by having them argue over relatively silly things, by having them resolve their arguments in childish ways like not speaking to each other. But I don't /fully/ commit to realistic children... I don't show them giggling about sex, for example, or indulging in crude humour, or engaging in (too much) casual bullying.

That's not to say those things aren't happening, it's just that they're not /shown/. And in that way I (hopefully) depict children in a way that evokes childhood without putting off adult readers.

Not necessarily, which is why fics like Alexandra Quick are polarizing. Some people project themselves onto the protagonist and have a hard time identifying with an immature, bratty preteen. Other people, like myself, don't mind as long as the characterization is consistent, understandable (i.e. the reader can understand why the character is the way they are in the context of the setting and the character's experiences), and interesting.

When she would be around her friends, her friends seemed a lot more capable of holding conversations and had better vocabularies. She didn't start sounding her age until she was about 12.

Then I met a friend's daughter, who is eight (8!!!) and her communication skills and vocabulary and even self-awareness are all exceptional. I totally believe that by the time she's 11, she'll easily be talking like some of these seemingly too mature children.

** In short, writing children is often hard. For younger children (ages 4-6) I suggest that writers make that child a savant in one, maybe two topics, then a dunce beyond that one thing. When at all possible, have the kid rather bluntly try to steer the topic to more familiar territory.

Once you get to early teens, it gets a lot harder. They should be able to understand the world, and more advanced concepts, but don't have the frame of reference to understand the complexities and nuance of the world.

This of course doesn't account for differences from child to child, as some will be more jaded, while others are more sheltered. Meanwhile some might be more eloquent, while others will struggle to put words to their thoughts. This of course doesn't even fully cover general intelligence, knowledge of various subjects, motivations, ability to influence others, and a dozen other similar things.

Human interaction is hard to write realistically, and children and teens are another step removed from the adult writer. The best they can do is try to consider it.

Personally, I don't get bothered by it unless the dialogue is too cumbersome to wade through, and that's usually because the author is a bad writer, and is trying to prove just how intelligent the character is, in the worst possible way.

** It's hard for adults (or even teen writers) to write 11-year-old kids. I don't remember what I was like at 11 years old. And even adults with 11-year-old kids have a hard time mimicking the speech patterns of children.

The real thing that gets me is the romance of fanfiction. 11-year-old kids don't proclaim their love for another person romantically (outside, perhaps, of a time travel fic where their minds are older). It just doesn't happen. Teenagers do experiment romantically and some of those relationships persist into adulthood, but most kids move from one relationship to another, and use the world love as a euphemism for "wow you're hot, I want to touch your body". When I was younger I loved the romance of my HP ships getting together at Hogwarts and living happily ever after. Now that I'm in my 30s (fuck, I'm old), I no longer enjoy that type of romance. I can still read it, but I much prefer more realistic portrayals of romance post-Hogwarts. It's a lot easier to see a 20-year-old Harry find love with someone and stay with them than it is to see a 14 year old Harry fall in love and stay that way forever.

Don't even get me started on the trend in fanfiction that has young girls and boys falling in love with their teachers or adult death eaters, sometimes while they are still in school. Outside of the whole Snape/Malfoy is redeemable BS, they are still old enough to be Hermione's father. That age gap always just makes me queasy.

not really, but it helps.

Also helps if Harry or another muggleborn show up and have no idea until they are told how magic children are raised. You can have children that are very "adult" if they are expected / trained to be.

100 years ago, a 15 year old might be getting married and living on their own...especially in the case of girls married to older men. I can sortof see a transition period in the magic world, where kids are expected to be kids longer but still trained to be little adults.

Only if its explained properly.

This is also why I generally start 5th year or later in my fic... I prefer more adult situations and can't stand to dumb my characters down to make them seem younger.

*** Beyond a few superficial things like robes and parchment, the wizarding world is nothing like middle ages. If anything, wizards live in a post-scarcity society and are more progressive and advanced than muggles in certain aspects. Yes, they write with quills, but some of those quills can write your story for you.

Why would magical children be expected to contribute? What could they even do that magic can't do in a second? The Weasley kids certainly don't slave their summers away on the odd jobs or something, and they are relatively poor. They have some chores, but even that's more for building character than anything else.

Wizarding entertainment is also not medieval at all, more like 20th century before every family got a TV. They have radio, organised sports, many games. With magic, possibilities for toys are enormous. Toddler Harry had a toy broom that could fly, for example.

***** Arranged marriages are absolute fanon. In fact, with so many women in power and in all areas of life, we can safely say that all these Victorian-society tropes from 'pureblood culture' fics do not exist canon. For some purebloods from families who believe in blood supremacy, which is not the majority of the population, there's pressure to marry other purebloods, yes. But that's like a very racist family not wanting the child to marry a person of colour. Nothing suggests they arrange anything beyond that.

Why are the Weasley a bad example? They are purebloods from a magical village. Arthur is a Ministry clerk, Molly is a housewife. While they may be muggle-lovers, they don't seem to have any contact with the muggle world at all, so it doesn't actually influence their lifestyle. I think they're pretty representative, certainly more representative than, say, ultra-rich Malfoys.

I also think fiction novels exist in the wizarding world, why wouldn't they? It's just not relevant to the plot, so it's never brought up in canon.

Make of that what you will, some of those are mentioned in the books/movies, and some are only mentioned in the video games.

[[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Magical_games]]

Again, make of it what you will. Some are in the books/movies/games.

In any case, the fact that there are some mentioned clubs and games within canon would lead one to believe that there are more that simply aren't mentioned in the books due to the fact that we only see things through Harry's POV. Same for the novels, Hogwarts has a decent sized library and I think it'd be presumptious to assume that it's all school-related material, especially since the kids have to buy their own school books. We know that fictional stories exist (a la The Tales of Beetle the Bard), and in my experience school libraries carry plenty of fictional novels (hell, that's how I started reading HP).

Also, you're ignoring the comments about the radios and magical toys. Sure, they're only touched on, but the idea is there for us to assume that students and children use them for entertainment. The only real argument is that "traditional pureblood families" reject radios due to the Muggle influence and raise their children like mini-adults, which is possible but there really isn't enough evidence to go either way.

​

1) While your point is true (though you make a rather bias exception for Hermione specifically) let's be completely honest. Some, like Hermione as you point out are just smarter than others. This leads to more adult behaviors Earlier.

​

Then there's also the "Proper upbringing" Gentry aspect you reference. This is just patently wrong. In Private Maybe, but in Public, you are expected to proport yourself Properly and speak eloquently. At the age of 10, I started Ettiquate and Allocution classes. at the age of 5, my parents gave me a "Word of the Week." I was to be able to Spell it, tell what it meant and use it in a Sentance by the Next week. And If I acted improperly or ill-mannered by this standard in Public I was grounded for a week.

​

Next, Some are just forced to grow up faster. I think Harry and to a point, Draco fall into this category

Book smarts and big vocabulary don't equal adult behaviour. First-year Hermione is clever but immature, as you'd expect from an 11 y.o.

And Draco certainly wasn't forced to grow up faster. If anything, he's a perfect representation of a sheltered kid. Canon 11-year-old Draco is a whiney, spoiled, entitled brat with no social graces, and continues to be so until mid-sixth year when reality smacks him hard in the face.

I'll give you Draco being a spoiled brat, because let's be honest - he was lol. However, as far as my read of it that had less to do with his age and more to do with Lucius and the indoctrination of Draco that he's better than everybody else.

​

As to book smarts and vocabulary equating adult behavior, this is also, while not entirely wrong, a mistaken idea because it does affect it. The more intelligent & educated a person is, the more likely to observe and read into a situating you are before acting - a very adult behavior. Was she perfect, lord no. Did she make mistakes? Of course, she did (and so do adults) but I think we can all agree Hermione was more mature at that age than the majority of her class
