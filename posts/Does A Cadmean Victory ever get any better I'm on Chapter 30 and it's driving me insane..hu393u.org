Like Harry is the most unlikeable little twat i've ever met.

"I do not forgive, I do not forget...even towards strangers who've done nothing to me...I am 14 and it shows..."

Straight up abandons his friends because they all believed he put his name in the goblet, even after they apologise...okay, dumb, but fine...but then the author goes to great lengths to make sure we all know he could have done it with his invisibility cloak in this AU and he's still adamant everyone else is wrong. Even worse with Dumbledore who doesn't really know him in the slightest and he's straight to "obviously Dumbledore believes in the Greater Good...a concept I have never actually heard about before". He also definitely knows about the Horcruxes I only learnt about from a secret library and Slytherin's portrait and I absolutely shouldn't share this information.

Also everyone comments on his new personality and he just yells about finally being a Grown Up and needing to LeArN. Just casually ignoring that he killed a man and clearly has serious trauma and everyone is right to be creeped out by him now he's a totally different person.

And oh my days the fucking Pettigrew murder. Right so for some reason Pettigrew is just randomly hanging out around the Quidditch Pitch all year like some sort of optional videogame quest that Harry repeatedly acknowledges but does nothing about, at one point saying he's not strong enough (lets ignore Dumbledore and Sirius exist) and then 2 days in story he suddenly is so goes and murders him and burns and hides the body.

Congratulations, you've ensured Sirius will never be free and destroyed all evidence of his innocence and are now running around cheering yourself on for doing so.

I actually thought the Fleur stuff would be good when Harry thinks she's not actually interested in him because he's only 14 and that'd be weird but no, no cut to Fleur's POV and she's all like "oh yeah underage kids really get me going, can't wait to get with him in the Room of Requirement ASAP".

I just don't get why this is so well recommended, does it ever actually get good?

*** I'm only really keeping on going because it's been recommended so much. Absolutely nothing stands out so far as particularly unique, but there's so much more to go and it has a good reputation so...

I will say the A/N are putting me right off. The rant about a review on DLP in a recent chapter was jarring and there's one about how the author (and now Harry since he studied for a couple of weeks after the World Cup) never use informal contractions like could've as it's uneducated. Really irritated me and I'd bet a lot of money i've had a far greater education than the author.

Also it's not just this fic but the increase in Harry's ability due to what is literally like a month absolute max of studying is ludicrous. He's now magically at 6th year standard, probably further and casting non-verbally after genuinely only a few weeks.

And your last point, that has been a reason for me to abandon several fics. I'm okay with intelligent Harry, even super-intelligent Harry (and secret bookworm Harry is plausible in canon), but not when he gains knowledge at such a ridiculously advanced rate.

** short answer: nope.

Long answer: The reason stories like this get recommended a lot is because they had a fast update rate and and are now completed. Quantity > quality can be used to explain the popularity of a lot of fics. Something being "good" is just not a requirement. Regardless, you're always going to find someone who thinks a story like this is the best fic they've ever read.

***** I'm planning to read all the way through it in the near future (after completing current projects). But the reason I put it after those projects is because I read as far as chapter 4 and found that I was skimming over most of it because...well, because I'd have a hard time making myself stop and properly read it. But I think I should give it a proper go before judging it.

At this point my thinking is that the premise of the story is, What if goblins were actually much more awesome than wizards in every way? Which, as a premise, obviously has problems when it comes to creating a compelling storyline, but might at least be a consistent lens that makes sense of it.

I might do a compare and contrast with Methods of Rationality afterward; I've already finished that one.

***** I remember it used to get recommended a lot more a while back. From what I heard, it was good for its time, but I admit when that when I started reading it, I couldn't stand it. The story seemed forced, the dialogue uninteresting, the characters flat. My guess is that at one time it was overhyped/over-recommended, then people who saw all of those recs started to read it and were thoroughly disappointed when it wasn't as good as others made it out to be.

That said, I don't think it gets that much hate beyond being used as an example of a poorly-written long work. I compare that treatment to how, a couple years back, anybody who would rec HPMOR would immediately get downvoted and get the "Why would you ever recommend such trash"-type responses. Which I always found rather rude - Just because I don't like a particular fic doesn't mean I'm going to get angry at somebody who does.

Also, with this story in particular, you have to reach the end for it to be satisfying. Its one of those stories that is not enjoyable to read, but is enjoyable to have read, if that makes sense.

****** I think that one of the really interesting things about A Cadmean Victory is that, in the end, all of these changes that Harry undergoes are ultimately not for the best, and the narrative at the end of the story reinforces that. Spoilers ahead, but I really enjoy the ending of the story because of how it subverts Edgy Harry tropes: Harry sacrifices everything for strength, but that strength isn't enough; he never becomes strong enough to out-duel Voldemort. Dumbledore is treated as manipulative by Harry, but ultimately is revealed as doing his honest best to save Harry's life and soul while still defeating Voldemort The story is called A Cadmean Victory because it's Pyrrhic--- canon Harry has a happier ending despite existing in basically the same world. It turns out that, no, sacrificing all of your friendships, never forgiving people, and giving up everything for power /isn't a good idea./

You just have to reach the ending for that to be apparent.

******** That's an interesting take, and reminds me of Methods of Rationality - although people often seem to miss the fact that that Harry does get bitten by his mistakes many times throughout the year, before looking back at the end and recognising that he's been an idiot. Such as the Defence class where he is reprimanded for escalating a conflict with Professor Snape to the point where his school enrolment was in jeopardy, over a matter of losing 10 House points, and is told that he needs to learn how to lose.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.

  "Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.

  "What /precisely/ did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?"

  Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my temper."

  "That is /not/ precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will describe it more exactly. There are many animals which have what are called dominance contests. They rush at each other with horns - trying to knock each other down, not gore each other. They fight with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe their claws as well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest with a winner and a loser, both of them might be severely hurt."

  Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry from the repeater screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that - unlike those animals who keep their claws sheathed and accept the results - you do not know how to lose a dominance contest. When a /Hogwarts professor/ challenged you, you did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your claws, heedless of the danger. You /escalated,/ and then you escalated /again./ It started with a slap at you from Professor Snape, who was obviously dominant over you. Instead of losing, you slapped back and lost ten points from Ravenclaw. Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."

  "I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That /had/ been precise. /Frighteningly/ precise. Now that Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry could see in hindsight that it was an /exactly/ accurate description of what had happened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to wonder whether they were right about other things too, like your intent to kill.

  "The /next/ time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest rather than lose, you may lose /all/ the stakes you place on the table. I cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high for the loss of ten House points."

  Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.

  ''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts, a much more important goal worthy of great risks. That is a /lie./ If you had been -"

  "I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible time to make my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But that would have meant /losing/. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the Dark Lord couldn't do with the Master he wanted to learn from."

  Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose."

He ends up happy with Fleur and they have a daughter, supposedly he's also immortal now. Yeah, he doesn't roflstomps Voldemort but he accidentally outsmarts him. But in the end he wins.

Right, grand, but if the first 30 are irritating and make the lead (and quite honestly one of only two) character an unlikeable twat it's not a good story.

If it had POV's of other people reacting to Harry to show he's not right all the time i'd feel differently, but it doesn't, it's all Harry and it's either pure evil from everyone else or falling over themselves to get Harry to like them. Except even the pure evil falls flat when Harry is just a dick to everyone apologising to him.

I don't really think there is a big twist ending when you consider the title of the story is "Cadmean Victory"

I, personally, think Harry is fine, having done a quick re-read of the first 30 chapters. It kinda makes sense why he reacts the way he does. You have to realize this is a pre-GoF Harry, he did not joke about entering the tournament, unlike canon Harry. This is also after he realizes the corruption with the government in not granting Sirius a trial, and he was just attacked (to put it mildly) again at the World Cup. It makes sense to not forgive them in the moment and isolate to try and survive the first Task. Especially as he realizes he has to get better with the signs pointing towards a rise of Voldemort sooner rather than later.

#+begin_quote
  His driving motivations are stupid and entirely self-compiled
#+end_quote

Not too sure this is entirely true. Wanting to survive is a pretty good drive for motivation. The social aspect is fair, I just think it makes sense given his characterization and mentor for this particular Harry. I do think this part does get better as Harry grows though.

#+begin_quote
  particularly interesting about this Harry
#+end_quote

I thought it was interesting because Harry's action generally make sense and he is consistent with his choices. I would say it is slightly different from Indy!Harry because you don't get a curve ball out of nowhere, and you get a mentor that kind of makes sense when you consider where they were found.

Also, most of the characters act/react the way you expect them to given their characterization in the fic if you separate them out from their post-GoF canon part. I think finding things interesting about this Harry is dependent on what you're looking for, for a fiction of this type. If you aren't a fan of this type of fanfiction, you may not be interested about this type of Harry. Most versions of x!Harry are all re-skinned version of one another. It's the story telling themselves that set them apart.

Just to hit on some of your points

#+begin_quote
  then the author goes to great lengths to make sure we all know he could have done it with his invisibility cloak in this AU and he's still adamant everyone else is wrong
#+end_quote

Harry's 14, he never joked about entering unlike his canon counterpart, he was attacked at the World Cup and is looking more towards surviving and surrounding himself with people he can trust, rather than those who would believe him to be a liar.

#+begin_quote
  Even worse with Dumbledore who doesn't really know him in the slightest and he's straight to "obviously Dumbledore believes in the Greater Good

He just found out about horcruxes and believes Dumbledore is willing to sacrifice him. After the betrayals of this year, it isn't so far-fetched. It also isn't far-fetched to believe Dumbledore knows about horcruxes after having the diary and being renowned as having a lot of magic, even if we disagree about it b/c canon. As for "Greater Good", well two things. 1 - it's "greater good" in the story, lower case "g" which makes all the difference I think. 2 - Lower case g's indicate a greater good in the sense of believing to sacrifice (when they don't have to sacrifice) for the benefit of society rather than an individual (when the benefit isn't to you as an individual). It isn't so far-fetched to believe.

  Pettigrew
#+end_quote

In this story Jr is dead, so it makes sense for Voldemort to send in Pettigrew to mess with the tasks. He doesn't trust Dumbledore at this point, and I think he doesn't trust Sirius can get it done here. Also, Pettigrew was around, but wasn't lingering. Harry starts to think about doing something once he realizes Pettigrew was lingering a lot more. Then I would think more than 2 days, but maybe my timeline is off, he goes off to do something while not acting rationally. It makes sense in the the sense of Harry is in an emotional state and acts in the heat of passion. People do it all the time. He definitely screwed Sirius with the move in the moment.

Overall, I think the characterization of the all the characters and their growth generally makes sense. It doesn't exactly come out of left field in my opinion. Ask for liking the fic, and if it gets better, it kinda depends on what you mean by better. Writing wise it is pretty consistent, the rational for the actions taken don't feel out of place. It has okay world building, even if you (general) don't agree with it. Oh and for A/Ns, I generally ignore them but can understand why it may be off putting.

******* Once again as one of the buggest advocates for this story you'll ever find, I can't say I agree with all this. Most of it yeah, but Harry really is an annoying little shit at the beginning. It's understandable why he's an annoying little shit, but understanding why he is that way does not change the way he is. I find the character growth later on to be well earned, as well as being satisfying largely due to the contrast between where he started and ended especially between his actions towards Pettigrew and where he ended., but the ending wouldn't have any value without the way he behaves at the beginning.

** From what I remember? No. The fic is... pretty much a convoluted mess in plot and characterization.

Also, not sure where you're from (America?), but age gaps like that are pretty common everywhere else? Between Harry and Fleur themselves, there's only a three year age gap. I think the main issue is that although Fleur is supposed to be 17, she's portrayed as being thought of in her twenties, or something.

Hell, one of my friends at 16 was dating a 21 year old.

Maybe it's an American cultural hang-up. I dunno.

Granted it's usually an older guy with a younger girl, but the reverse happens, too.

I mean, at 17 I was chatting up a 22 year old Aussie bird, so it's not strictly a UK viewpoint...

*** I don't think it's a cultural thing. It's just that in your teens, even just a couple of years make a huge difference.

I was different when I was 13, which was radically different when I was 15, which was again radically different when I was 18. After that though, I haven't changed much.

I think teenage years are just that age where your perspective of the world and yourself keeps changing rapidly. You are not a child, but you're not yet a full grown adult either. Just two or three years can make a huge gap in maturity.

I'm not saying a 17 year old dating a 14 year old is /wrong/. Or that it wouldn't happen. But I think the age gap would come into play in their relationship. For all its faults, I think 'A Cadmean Victory' handles this particular aspect decently. Everything else though? Ugh.(I never finished the fic either, so I don't know if it gets better)

Honestly, I've known people who were more mature at 14 than other's were at 25. And I know quite a few who were more mature at 16 than they were at 21.

A friend of mine had a 14yo GF when he was 17. They stayed together for more than two years, his next one was 2 years his senior. They struck me as equally mature, despite the age differences.

In my opinion, I wouldn't really give it the light of day. I don't know how the flying fuck I ever thought it was a good read. Take that as you will, but keep in mind my standards a little high now so I might come across a somewhat jaded.

** It has been some time since I've read this fic in it's entirety, last two times I stopped around chapter 30-ish and then skipped ahead. But here are some points.

Harry at the beginning is being an angsty teenager with a lot of trauma and that's then bombarded with a lot of stressful situations one after the other until snaps and becomes ultra-paranoid to the point the only person he trusts is a thousand-year-old portrait. He's not /healthy/.

He then proceeds to try and learn and improve himself so he can keep himself safe because he's very afraid. His friends and house, being OOC, doesn't help and he starts avoiding them too, authority figures don't seem to help, some are decidedly corrupt, BAM he doesn't trust the teachers.

He learns about Horcruxes, figures out he's one, deduces Dumbledore knows, and from his experiences, 90% of the adults want to screw him over, so Dumbledore is probably a utilitarian who will sacrifice Harry to stop Voldemort(he /actually isn't/ for a change).

Harry develops a large distrust of Dumbledore because he had such a high image of him that when the man can't help him he sees it not as a lack of capability(which is what actually was) but as a lack of will to help him.

He finds Katie, reconnects with some of the House, but the Trio is broken, enter Fleur, another jaded and somewhat edgy teenager, and they both see similarities in themselves and being so paranoid with everyone else, become desperate to find a partner in each other(This relationship becomes unhealthy at some points).

Katie 'betrays' Harry(honestly this was forced as hell, and it's not like she had 5 options instead of 'Sorry Harry I /have/ to go with the guy who asked me on a whim, fuck you kindly.' making Harry for some reason just write off Hogwarts as a lost cause save for Salazar and Fleur.

Around this day he completely snaps and murders Pettigrew on a whim.

Then Harry and Fleur start dating(after some angst) and then Harry gets even more wary of Dumbledore because he's afraid the Headmaster will find out about his international excursions and stop him from seeing his girlfriend overseas.

He then manipulates the entire DA just so he can get Dumbledore out of the castle so he can do something illegal I can't remember anymore.

This is where I normally stop reading, BUT, the goal is to show you this story, IMHO, is not about an Indy!Harry who becomes a hero and everyone else is against him.

This is about a Harry who's traumatized, doesn't get the help he needs, starts becoming paranoid and desperate to save himself, goes through another traumatizing and stressful situation, and starts doing anything he (thinks) need to survive.

He meets another person who's just as jaded and stressed and who buys into his paranoia, they both do a lot of reproachable stuff.

It's basically an anti-hero Harry who's an angsty teenager with trust issues but placed in situations that don't allow him to solve that.

People often forget Fleur, but eventually, Fleur starts getting just as 'dark' as Harry out of love for him.

** So far, it's the only H/F fic i have enjoyed (that is longer than 20k words). It is by no means perfect, but I enjoy fics where the hero believably powers up to fight the villain (unlike canon, where Harry doesn't even try and instead waits for a deus ex machina; or in fanon, where Harry reads a few books or inherits some Galleons and suddenly is a BAMF).

Also, didn't think that the Fleur dynamic was unreasonable. Bill didn't enter the picture until way later, and Harry getting commitment-phobic was done fairly well.

If it were a novel or original fiction, I'd be much harsher. As it is, I'd rate it a 7.5/8 out of 10.
