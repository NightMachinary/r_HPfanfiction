As the title says, I would really appreciate it if y'all could recommend some fics where Harry is sent (by whatever means) back to the Marauders period and befriends young Severus Snape.

I would prefer them being close friends or slash (dunno if that's a thing for the Marauders period).

Thanks to the friends who find any!

  When he looked back on it in later years, Severus realized how much worse his life could have gone. Those few short months in Sixth Year were of much greater importance than he could have ever known at the time. Then again, it was hard to have perspective on something like that at 16, when his daily existence consisted of constantly dodging hexes and being ignored by Lily Evans. The Professor had known, though. That's why he'd come.

** linkao3(3836032), which is a mixture of time travel and post-canon. A favorite of mine. Slash.

linkao3(2749223), which has a rude, misanthropic Snape who smokes. There's also a sequel linked in the header. Slash.

[[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=1929&warning=4][Just Another Soldier in the War]] - this takes place right after Hogwarts and posits that Snape was already Dumbledore's spy. Slash. Pre-DH.

  Kink Meme Request: Semi mirror!verse fic. Tony gets pulled into another universe where Steve's side won Civil War, Tony died, and Steve took control of the government. By the time they get 616!Tony back, he's slightly broken and convinced that Steve owns him and can't make any decision without Steve. And gained the 'distressing' habit of offering his body to Steve and waking him up with blow jobs.
