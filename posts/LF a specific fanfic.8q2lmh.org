I remember a fanfic that I read a while ago. In Sirius's houses refrigerator, there was a weird mutated creature. It was a crack fic. Anyone know what I'm talking about?


** Balls, I know the fic but can't remember the name. Harry kicks everyone out of Grimmauld Place because of angsty reasons and Moody goes along with it because everyone else was being an idiot. Harry beats Voldemort by summoning his head. Ron and Hermione are sent into Grimmauld Place to try to convince Harry to let people in again but join up with him. The fridge monster ends up in Hogwarts and reproducing.
