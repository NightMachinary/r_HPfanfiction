I'm hoping there's an AU out there where Remus is honest with Harry from the beginning that he was best friends with James. I'm rereading the book atm and every interaction they have drives me absolutely mad that you can see Remus bottling it all up. So is there a story out there where Remus tells Harry about his parents and they have long chats with tea?


** This would be sweet Sharing stories They work though the Peter Pettigrew on the map and get Sirius off all charges (any 'fees' for escaping overlooked for all the wrongful imprisonment) I dig it

In most conties escaping prison is not a crime if you don't hurt or destroy anyone/anything
