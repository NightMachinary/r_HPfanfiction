I don't remember the name of it, but it was either Poweful!Rich!Harry story, or a Time Travel one, with Dumbledore and maybe Weasley Bashing. It may also be HP/HG. I know it isn't Harry/Ginny either way.

Unfortunately, all I can really remember about it is a scene where the Gryffindor Quidditch team gets Nimbus 2004 or Nimbus 2005 broomsticks from Harry in retaliation for Draco cheating his way onto the team with Nimbus 2001 brooms.

If there are more like it, that are equally ridiculous, like Harry buying the entire team Firebolts or something, It'd be great if you linked those as well.

I've tried using Google to find it, and I couldn't, so I had to ask here, sorry.


** Could it be linkffn(4101650) or linkffn(2636963) ?

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
