There's two that I can think of that I love off the top of my head - both are HP x LV/TM. One has Harry who cannot die - I believe he's on his twelfth life in the fic? and the other has Tom and Harry (hadrian is the name used I believe, or another alternate name) where Harry finds his own flavor of immortality through necromancing & reincarnation. If anyone knows where to find these fics, please do link them as I've forgotten the names. They're also both unfinished. :(

What I am looking for are more fics that experiment with this. I care less about canon compliance and more just about the building of a world so complex, or relationships so complex that just keep coming back together again and again.

Thank you for any recs!


** One of these is definitely Again and Again by Athey linkffn(again and again by athey), and I'm pretty sure the other is Rebirth by Athey linkffn(rebirth by Athey).

I'd also love to know of more.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

**** Athey is definitely the master of that pairing! And it's not an easy one to make work. She also uses canon details really, really well. I do hope that she has time to start updating again, even if it ends up being slow. Or that she becomes a published author. That would work too.

  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three. The sound of shedding skin crackled loudly in his ear as he got up to look over his new body, he was a girl this time, maybe eight or nine years old. Time travel fic Tom RiddleX Harry potter

** linkffn(6517567)

This is sort of what you're asking for. Not reincarnation, but repeated time travel whenever Harry and Hermione die.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
