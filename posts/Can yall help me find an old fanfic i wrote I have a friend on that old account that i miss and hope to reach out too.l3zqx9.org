:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So it was a snape fanfic... Uhh, it takes place after his death and faith or destiny decided to give him another chance at life... Except for this time he's Remus lupins twins brother... I didn't get many chapters in... I think the last chapter is Remus and severus birthday party... Also, severus jumps in front of Fenrir greyback and becomes the werewolf instead of Remus... I wrote it when I was like 12 or something... So like 2013..2014... The last time I was active with that account was when alan Rickman died...so 2016... I think I posted a memorial to alan in my bio... Anyways it would make me very happy if anyone could find that fic for me! I don't remember the title or my accounts name...
