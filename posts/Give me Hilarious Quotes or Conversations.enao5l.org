It's been some months since I've seen the classic "Asking for Quotes" post so here it is. I'll start with ones from linkffn(12407442). I found this fic just today and it's pure gold.

#+begin_quote
  /That was mean of them./

  Yeah.

  /I can help you get back at them./

  How.

  /I know this great little stinging hex. Totally harmless but it will knock them down a peg./

  What is it?

  /Ok, it's easy. No added wrist motions to worry about or anything. Just point your wand and say Crucio./

  Tom...that's the torture curse.

  /No it's not./

  Yes it is.

  /No it's not./

  Yes it is!

  /It's not, I swear. Just try it. You'll feel better after./

  I am not using an unforgivable curse on my classmates.

  /Fine. Whatever. Have fun in detention./

  Tom?

  /What now!?/

  Are you sure you've never seen a nargle?

  /If I say I have will you give the diary back to Ginny?/

  Have you?

  /Yes of course I have Luna. Who hasn't?/

  If you've seen one then what did it look like?

  /It...well...what do they look like to you?/

  You haven't have you?

  /No you ridiculous child, I have not seen one of your imaginary creatures! Give me back to Ginny!/

That said, "you can keep my sandwich" from A Black Comedy always makes me chuckle. It isn't really a joke, and it doesn't mean anything out of context, but the complete nonchalance there has always been hilarious to me.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** Hack grunted with disappointment. "Wizard duck Hack's club. Hack only hit arm," he said, pointing at the arm in question. Well, you assume it's the arm in question. Identifying a limb dismembered by a spiked daemon club would be sort of like trying to figure out what Riddle had for breakfast by looking at the shit on Malfoy's lips. "Hack aim better next time," the big guy finishes.

The actual dialogue is at the bottom, but it requires context. First: Harry is teaching River occlumency - she's basically an uncontrolled legilimens. Second: Simon is River's brother. Also, this is kind of long, but it has to be.

#+begin_quote
  Harry tried to think of an analogy that wouldn't be misconstrued. "Think of it as a dam," He began. "Your gift coupled with some of the Alliance's experimentation has you leaking. Now I'm going to eventually be teaching you how to plug the leak on your own, but if you'd like, I can sort of jam my own mental thumb and plug the leak with a little effort on my part. It weakens to the point of barely working if we're not in the same room."

  "A dam?" River asked.

  Harry nodded.

  "And that makes you the little dutch boy holding the flood back?"

  Harry chuckled. "I suppose you could say that."

  [snip/scene change]

  They all looked up as River came sprinting into the room shrieking in glee.

  "That was amazing!" River exclaimed in unbridled joy.

  "What's that?" Mal asked hoping for a change of conversation.

  River waved her arms up and down while she spun in circles. "Harry said I was some sort of dike, so I let him stick his thumb in me."

  Simon began cough uncontrollably.

  "It felt wonderful," River sang. "Him just filling me up and plugging my leak."

  "River!" Simon shouted aghast.

  "Okay," River smiled brightly and nodded. "I'm going to go have him stick it back in." She used one hand to clap a wave goodbye and spun right around to sprint back towards the bridge.

Honestly, this fic is full of one liners and while it gets a bit more serious at the end, most of it's hilarious. After all [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YArfb1gCcBg][look at the source material.]].

  This was totally the best day of Harry's life. Might be the last, too, considering how bullshit the Holy Grail War was, but that did not even make it wobble in its position.

  There was no other day he'd see people trying to murder each other over who got to murder him while in the ruins of the place he'd lived for the worst days (and majority) of his life.

  If nothing else, Number 4 Privet Drive couldn't be burned down again. A building by that name could, but it wouldn't be the one he had hated so much.

  He could even enjoy the sight of Privet Drive burning to the bedrock - oh how sweet this was, if only he had a camera on hand like the Creeveys - without a single twinge of his conscience, because one or the other of the people who'd come after him had been nice enough to evacuate anyone that might get hurt first.
