** "Harry Potter" The voice carried through the great hall, smothering all other sounds in its wake. Everyone turned to look at him, as he strolled towards the Sorting Hat. The Green eyes focused on naught but the hat, the chin ever so slightly raised, his shoulders back, and strides long. Everyone could see he was every bit the Boy Who Lived they imagined he would be. He sat down, and while the hat began speaking to him, his eyes appraised his fellow students.

"Well, this is odd" The hat spoke to him.

Well, speak was a poor term Harry thought. Did the hat think to him? A question for the philosophers he supposed. "WAIT IT CAN READ MY MIND" Harry thought to himself. The hat patiently waited for Harry to get over his shock of a mind-reading hat, whilst being rather impressed by how calm his face was considering the chaos of his thoughts.

"Mr. Potter, you are not the first person who has carried with them considerable secrets when under my head. Do not be alarmed, the magic i was built with prevents me from sharing student information."

That was good, very good. He wasn't sure on how wizarding law differed from normal but he supposed a 38 year old man trying to pass himself off as an 11 year old child wouldn't be taken well. Oh god, he had read about Azkaban, would they send him there? Why did such a prison exist anyway, especially in this day and age. The wizarding judicial system also appeared to be a joke. At least the muggle one had the decency to pretend it didn't favor the wealthy and well connected. Though, he supposed, given that he was considered among that tier in the wizarding world given his parent's fortunes, he should be thankful. Though at the same time-"

"Mr. Potter! Your ability to get sidetracked alone is worthy of Ravenclaw, although your previous success as a businessman would make you perfect for Hufflepuff. Your courage to try and make something of yourself despite your upbringing would see you fitting in well in Gryffindor, but at the same time-"

"I would like Slytherin, no, I will be put into Slytherin. I've had a read about all the Houses. Ravenclaw for smart people, scientists, and whatnot. Hufflepuff for the laymen, while it was a house of undeniable morality, and their hard work is admirable, but the value of hard work for hard work's sake is folly. Gryffindor, would suit me fine, I admire the willingness to do what needs to be done, no matter what everyone else thinks if it's the right thing to do. But let's be honest here. I worked in insurance and did some lobbying on the side for the fun of it. Put me in a house with the sons and daughters of almost every rich bastard in this country and I'll be ruling this country by third year. The Wizarding economy is depressing in it's simplicity, so with a little help from their heirs of established businesses, I will have the ability to fix this miserable state of all the problems I can bother to care about. You sort based on the person's wants, and the person's ability to do well in a house. Well I am telling you what i want, and how well i'm going to do."

"An admirable sentiment, however, I'm afraid that you shouldn't have trusted two sentences in a discontinued version of Hogwarts A history on how I work. You would do brilliantly in Slytherin with relatively little effort. But in another house, it might take more effort, but the world will be better for it. So, while i know Godric would have my head for putting a conniving brat like yourself in his honorable House. I will do what is right for you, than what is easy."

The hat, in it's booming voice called out " Hmm, you want to be in Slytherin ehhh, that is very courageous of you. Better be Gryffindor!"

Harry looked around, the facade on his face shattered. Eyes were staring at him and the traitorous hat. Not only did it put him in the wrong house, but it announced his plans to everyone. How could he make allies with anyone now? He should have known that despite all of his reading, and preparation, this world was going to make things as difficult for him as possible.

As he got up though, his excitement began to take hold. He had studied psychology, bartered with politicians and CEOs, and had experienced the very worst the world could do to a man. Sure, this wasn't going as planned, but no plan survives its first contact with the enemy. He grinned, once again surveying the sea of open mouths and stares, and walked towards his new table with a confidant stride.

"This is going to be fun" He thought to himself.
