i haven't posted on here in a while because I've had no trouble finding fanfics recently, but i would like some help with this. im looking for fanfics where harry becomes a dark lord/grey lord (just not on the side of light, stories where he takes voldemorts place, and/or stories where he gains an inheritance and becomes independant. I would prefer if they were COMPLETE and longer than 50k words. i know "use google" or "look into communities" well i wanna hear from this reddit community a few suggestions.


** linkffn(11858167) Not sure if it fits your criteria since it's post-Voldemort but Harry is certainly not light in this one

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
