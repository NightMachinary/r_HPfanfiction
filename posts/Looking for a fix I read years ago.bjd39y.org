:END:
It was on fanfiction.net and feature a tattooed Harry. The tattoos had something to do with tune magic or something similar. He has to duel someone at some point causing him to lose an arm which his tattoos somehow fix. It's probably pretty crack but I can't stop thing about it.


** OMG I found it! I am going to read that (again) next

*** Oh man, you're onto it. Harry was in a duel, Snape refereed and thus vanished debris, Harry's arm got cut off so Snape Switched it but claimed he Vanished it, then brought it back to his lab because he was on Voldemort's side. Harry wins and later paints a rune chain around the stump to regrow the arm.

I can't remember the title but we're all thinking of the same one for sure.
