Which story do you think of when you think of the Marauder Era or see it mentioned in the canon 7? Which story do you think of first when you consider what comes next? Not necessarily looking for closest to canon, but which has made the greatest impression and influences your read on the canon most.

EDIT

Also, "Which" would probably be the better word to use. Long Monday.


** The Life and Times is my head canon Marauder Era fic, it's a WIP but I think it's fantastic.

*** This is actually the fic that prompted me to ask this question. And is that the term for this? head canon?

** I lot of my headcanons come from short stories that focus on specific characters, so I haven't read any era-defining novels. The most influential story for me for next gen humor - not so much in headcanon as much as the flavor of atmosphere - is by far [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]]. It was one of the very first next gen stories that I read, when it was only five chapters long. It got me acquainted to British humor, wordplay, comic timing, and raging alcoholics, Ever since, I've tended to see next gen through Lucy's eyes. The author's now one of my very good friends! She also writes my headcanon war and post-war Draco :)

**** She writes a few Draco stories, most of them unfinished or in a perpetual state of revision unfortunately, but the post-war ones that I've read are [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290059][Memento]] (complete) and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=282827][The State of Things]]. I'm a bit biased because we've discussed Draco a lot and share a similar lack of romanticism about him, and my headcanon is really more formed from that. I also have a lot of out-of-story knowledge of her Draco(s) and their cameos in her next gens where you see various versions of the Malfoy family as a unit (or not, if there's divorce in the mix), and that's where I think he shines.

** [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/][The Shoebox Project]] was the pinnacle of Marauder fiction before Life and Times rolled around. It's a collaboration... and gratuitously slashy... but awesome nonetheless.

Haven't read it in a long time, so I don't know how well its aged or if there have been more updates since it went dead... but it was damn great back in the day. The only things the older generation of Potter freaks ever talked about was The Shoebox Project and Cassie Claire's shitfic trilogy.

*** Thanks for the recommendation. I'll check it out. You say before L&T... Is that the fic that you would now consider your definitive Marauder narrative?

**** Not in terms of being exactly how I pictured the Marauder story... but certainly in terms of being the best Marauder-era fic available. I've never really read anything that nails it on the head. Much of my headcanon comes from snippets of other non-Marauder fics.

** For Next Generation, I haven't explored it much, but this one was excellent:

Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided]]

The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

It's fairly self-contained yet still very much Potterverse. Also, it's complete. Fair warning- the action of the story really doesn't get rolling until 2/3 of the way through; the rest is character stuff.
