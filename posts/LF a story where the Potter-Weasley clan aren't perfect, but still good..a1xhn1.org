Most next-gen stories that I've come across paint the family as perfect: perfectly understanding, completely proud of everything each member of the family is doing, etc. It's been a while since I've been the sort to go digging through archives, but with the sheer number of stories always being published, there have to be some done differently that I just haven't come across!

So, I'd appreciate it if someone could direct me towards stories where...

- Characters (preferably the next-gen kids, because I find their blank canvases interesting) start off misunderstood by their peers, but come to be understood during the course of the story, OR
- The clan are downright dysfunctional but not out-right villains, and who still try to support each other, OR
- The kids aren't all sports stars or super-geniuses, they're just ordinary people who are good at some things and bad at others, and some of them aren't even very nice, but that's just how they are, and that's okay.
- I'd also like to see next-gen stories with underutilised pairings! No Scorpius/Rose or Scorpius/Albus unless the story meets my above asks really well, please! The majority of stories I've come across feature these pairings but they don't really interest me.

Thanks :)


** It's really not everyone's cup of tea because it was a tribute to an extremely British comedy author and not everyone "gets" that kind of dry, cringe humour, but I wrote a one shot featuring Hugo- linkffn(The Secret Diary of Hugo Granger-Weasley, Aged Thirteen and a Half)

In it, he is an obnoxious, oblivious and indignant mix of Ron and Hermione raging with hormones and angst, fed up with the family ignoring and teasing him. Teddy is seen as the responsible adult but has his own thing going on and resents being the GO to babysitter. Ron is not the most understanding of Dads. Harry uses his war experience to dodge awkward questions. The kids are sick of listening to the story about the troll in the bathroom again.

There are some hints of Albus/Scorpios, but nothing explicit.

** linkffn(Grow Young With Me) might have been much too angsty for my usual tastes, but it is very well written and a great fic.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
