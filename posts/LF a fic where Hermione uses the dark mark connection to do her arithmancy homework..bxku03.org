*** I've always thought it Arithmancy of more as magical statistics, which sounds pretty freaking cool, and ancient runes was like taking latin nowadays, which is somewhat boring.

That being said,I love this oneshot because canon Hermione would "borrow" anything to help Harry. And Voldemort is an amateur ritualist apparently. Just look at the calculation of taking Harry's blood.

Plus as a person who's been messing with computers almost as long as I've been alive, I appreciate all the references.
