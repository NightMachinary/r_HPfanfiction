Hey so I read this really good fanfiction (slytherin!harry) and I cannot find it or remember the title. The big scene I remember is the whole slytherin standing up and leaving in formation. Like first years, then second, etc. Then I remember Snape telling Lucius about it and lucius being shocked. Pls help!!
