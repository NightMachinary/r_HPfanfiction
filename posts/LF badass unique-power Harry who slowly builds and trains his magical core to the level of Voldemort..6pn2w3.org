I'd like a lot of emphasis on magical cores and Harrys power growth.

Unique power such as elemental or in depth parseltongue magic or magical animagus or whatever.

No slash. At least decent prose. Dark Harry OK. Evil Harry is also OK if it's exceptionally written. Pairings and romance are fine. Mild bashing is fine as long as it makes sense in the context of the story.


** It's funny seeing this kind of thread after reading through the 3 stages of fanfiction evolution thread.

***** I'd say I'm at stage 4... I was right all along. Dumbledore is a manipulative old fool who should have shown Tom Riddle love instead of being distant with him like he did with Harry. Everything is Dumbledore's fault. He was lucky that Harry didn't turn out to be just like Tom for leaving him at the Dursleys for 15 years and the whole Sirius episode.
