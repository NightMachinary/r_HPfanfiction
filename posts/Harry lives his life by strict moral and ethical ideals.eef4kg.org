Fics where Harry lives his life by very set moral and ethical ideals that he strives to uphold? Honor, chivalry, ect.


** There was one where he was a D&D Paladin. I can't recall the name (something like Harry Potter and the Burning Heart, maybe?) but it was decent enough and he had to remain semi-bound to his ideals to maintain the Paladin-ness.

On an 'evil' standpoint, there was also one where he kept quoting Machiavelli in which he was very strictly adhering to his Lawful Evil-esque moral-ethical code. Can't remember that one's name either, though.

  Harry Potter, raised by Sirius Black in Japan alongside the last surviving clan of samurai warriors, must return to the UK after many years when it is revealed that his name is put in the Goblet of Fire. It is a very different Harry that comes to Hogwarts, wearing odd clothing, a different hairstyle and a snow leopard cub as a pet! What else does the new Fourth Hogwarts Champion have up his sleeve?Starts during the events of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

** linkffn(HArry Crow) is really good, although you may have already read it, since it's so popular. It basically starts with Vernon abandoning him off at Gringotts, and then Harry is raised by goblins.
