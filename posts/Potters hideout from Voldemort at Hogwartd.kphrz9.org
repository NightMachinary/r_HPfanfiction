I never know whether to label things prompt or request. It could be either! If it already exists, please link me! If it doesn't and you want to write it, please do that too!

This prompt was inspired by a fic I got a link to here today or yesterday where the Potters' survive the attack on their house and get away. I've just started it but I think Lily portkeys to Dumbledore's office with Harry. Got me thinking: if they were in so much danger, why not have them at Hogwarts in the first place? They could still be under Fidelius, and sleep in some unused teachers quarters, or a magical extension of Dumbledore's office so he could protect them if needed.

Especially considering /that/ prophecy, you'd think Dumbledore would have Lily, James, Alice, Frank, Harry, and Neville under lock and key. Imagine the Longbottoms and the Potters all living together in secret Hogwarts quarters, as a big family/neighbors. Imagine Lily and Alice being mother buddies. Imagine Harry and Neville growing up together.

They could even be each other's secret keepers: Alice or Frank holds the secret about the Potters' quarters, and James or Lily holds the secret about the Longbottoms, right next door - with a direct door between them of course.

The only reason I can think of not to do this is for fear that Riddle would come to Hogwarts if he found out and endanger children. I suppose the fic would be even better if this were addressed somehow and given a realistic solution (some way to guarantee the children's safety even if he found out).

Anyone got anything? TIA :D


** As my headcannon, you can't put a Fidelius on anything that is too well known, such as the exsistance of hogwarts, while something obscure like the safehouse on godrics hallow or the residence of the elusive black family is fair game, also it relies in you trusting in the fiselus completely, as it is a fickle peice of magic that disables or removes any other source of magical protection, and any forms of contingency will be removed with extreme prejudice, which means no /if we die kill peter/ notes in the potters wills, the spell forces you to be completely reliant upon the secret keeper as defence.
