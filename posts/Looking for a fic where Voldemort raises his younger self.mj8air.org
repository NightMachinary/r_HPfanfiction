:END:
It was on AO3 and I found it on a reddit comment and was reading it through the app but when the app refreshed I lost it. It involved Voldemort picking his younger self up from the orphanage and him growing up. He called himself Marvolo Gaunt.

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

** In the bleak midwinter plays with a related concept (Hermione and Tom Sr. raise baby Tom) and is a /much/ better story. Tom Sr. also fakes being a wizard (with the help of a house elf) and joins wizarding society.
