Hey all, I feel like I've sifted my way through a solid amount of [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], but at this point have been struggling to get into ao3 because I'm not super big on in your face slash. Some of my favorite fanfics off of ffn include:\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born][Basilisk-born]]\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory][A Cadmean Victory]]\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]]

Anything like these, and preferably of similar/greater length would be amazing. Also open to try some new things, but yeah, would rather avoid the silly amounts of in your face slash that seems to be all I can find. Not bashing people who are into it, but just not really my thing personally.


** Not sure what you are looking for, but my standard list of AO3 recommendations is:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/][Northumbrian series]] starting with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and then go on (you can return to the earlier ones later, but they are mostly not as good as his post-war works)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/White_Squirrel/pseuds/White_Squirrel/works?fandom_id=136512][White_Squirrel]] both the large series (Arithmancer and The Accidental Animagus), but don't miss the smaller works, they are excellent as well.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]]'s three stories ... it is very much adult writing (not porn, but I don't think the theme will be of interest to teenagers)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] ... on its face it is Dudley-has-a-magical-daughter story, but it is a way different from anything you read in the post-war world.

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

** I'm only familiar with two of those, and I've only read one to completion IIRC, but it sounds like you enjoy reading competent and somewhat gritty Harry?

Some of starfox5's work might interest you, such as linkffn(Divided and Entwined). It's more Hermione-focused, though.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Fate linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]])

It's not a very common reccomendation, because of the fact that it's Ron centric that puts people off, but trust me, it's one of the best long fics I've seen. Even if you don't normally like Ron, this Ron has had a very different childhood and therefore developed as a character completely differently.

But it's awesome! It's definitely the kind of fic that I like, and I feel like our tastes are similar because many of the fics you've reccomended are my faves too.

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.

** Well there are other things I can reccomend as well, but if you are specifically looking for long Peggy Sue fics....

 

The first that comes to mind is C'est La Vie which still makes the rounds in recommendations on occasion. linkao3(3390668)

 

Double Back is enjoyable and is unique in that it has both 11 year old Harry and time traveling Harry existing as distinct and separate characters linkao3(19267840)

 

My personal favorite on this list and one of my favorite fics on ao3 is Face Death In the Hope by LullabyKnell. Yes it technically has a Harry/Regulus pairing. However, in the 234,537 words currently in the fic itself and the 49,744 words in the alternate PoV companion fic the possibility of such a relationship has not come up. At most there are a couple lines that , if you squinted hard enough, might be said to lean in that direction given the prior knowledge the pairing will supposedly happen.

 

Fair warning that it is a very slow paced fic with a lot of introspection and character interaction. While I'm absolutely ok with that (more great content is more great content), some might be turned off by the fact that the 53 chapters and 234,537 words have only covered the span of a few days. linkao3(5986366)

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

#+begin_quote
  Thrown back in time from 2019 to 1991, a grown and disgruntled Harry Potter finally has the chance to change his life for the better, fixing things before everything went wrong and becoming the father figure for his younger self that he never had. Changing time is difficult though, and the more changes he makes, the less predictable the world turns out to be. Though now maybe he actually has a chance at happiness, both for him and his younger self, and just maybe a chance at romance as well.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

** Well, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20459714/chapters/48544922][The Heir to the House of Black]] might interest you, although it is posted on ffn as well, so you might have already seen it (but I do not think it is being updated there). MoD Harry re-born as Turais Black, Sirius' brother. The fanfic is very well written and updated regularly.

** I'm afraid that I am not familiar at all with the fics that you mentioned so I will just recomend my own favourite long fics/series.

​

Perfectly Normal by BrillianLady

" Harry just wants to have a quiet life and get along with everyone. He wants to be normal, and accepted. Being “normal” for the Dursleys yielded great results in improving his standard of living, and as he heads off to Hogwarts he still retains that impulse to keep his head down and blend in. Of course, life isn't as simple as that, and Harry is a magnet for trouble. And what does "normal" really mean, anyway? The pure-bloods in his group of friends think he should learn more about their culture and religion if he wants to fit in. "

This author is a master at in depth worldbuilding and does a lot of research. An extremely enjoyable reading. Beware that the theme is leaning a little towards Wizards are obviously better than those silly muggles.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]

​

Rewnwal by AzenorSage

"At the point of death, Regulus Black is de-aged. Given a second chance at life, he becomes a new beacon of hope for the nearly defunct Black Family. He is haunted by strange dreams of his past and the feeling that he has an important mission that he must complete, no matter the cost to himself.

This is a story that shall center around the members of the Black Family, their connections through marriage, and their friends and allies."

A different take on the wizarding world where everything is a bit more like the Regency era. Lots of very grey morals and messing with canon.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/404224]]

Royal Ward by Catstaff

" Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen, an event which causes Vernon to die of a heart attack. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry's 9th birthday and several years before Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced. Warnings may change as the story progresses. "

Very much a muggles are way smarter than the wizards. But it is fun and rather lighthearted.
