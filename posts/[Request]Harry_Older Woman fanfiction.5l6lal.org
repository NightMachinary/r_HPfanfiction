Harry/Lily, Harry/Narcissa

This is basically crack, but it retains a profile of seriousness on the surface. After you stop taking it seriously, it becomes extremely entertaining.

  Harry Potter has escaped grief twice now, looking to distract himself as a volunteer at St. Mungo's. But it seems he's not alone in this escape, and it may be more than work that distracts him. But perhaps he was looking for more than a get-away in the first place... Hear a playlist for The Volunteer by visiting the link on my profile!
