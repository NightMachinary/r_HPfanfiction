I've seen fics where the man is better than a bloodhound; he can tell who has been making out by scent, act as a an olfacation polygraph, and smell people's emotions and shit.

I know it's not uncommon in other fiction for werewolves to have enhanced senses in their human forms, but does this have any basis in canon?

 

And while we're at it, I also sometimes see it said that he has enhanced strength. Nothing too crazy, but definitely more than he should. I seem to remember several instances of fics having Sirius horsing around and jump Remus only to get easily out-wrestled by that werewolf strength. I'm pretty sure this is entirely fanon?


** Yeah it's fanon. As are scars on his face.

The only thing I can think of that slightly alludes to it is in HBP when they're talking about Bill and Remus says he won't be a full werewolf but "he may have some selfish characteristics" from now on, and it's mentioned that he then goes on to like very rare steak. The fact that Remus suggests this might mean there are some attributes he has connected to his werewolf side even when not transformed, but it never mentions what they are or suggests it's anything like super strength or heightened smell or anything like that.

**** I guess so, but it's always irritated me because they're never mentioned in the books and you'd think it would be quite a distinguishing feature and a pretty big clue to him being a werewolf.

***** I want to scream every time his facial scars are mentioned in a fic. It's a mystery to me why authors are so determined to add them. Of course, it doesn't help that I find it hard to accept movie details in fics and most fics that give Remus wolfish traits seem to miss the point. Out of curiosity, what wolfish characteristics would you consider using in a fic?

****** I don't know that I would add any to be honest. I think I might slip in references to a fondness for rare meat as established in canon, and maybe as the full moon approached and he felt ill he might be able to hear or smell slightly better (but not so noticeable that it's overpowered, and only while he's too ill to be any use) but in general I think it makes more sense to avoid it and keep it as a monthly transformation.

** Complete fanon, but that shouldn't stop you from using it for a story.

Funny aside- the movies actually go the other way, where Scabior is tuned in to smells more than Greyback himself while they are hunting for muggleborns in the forest.

That said, I could see where a werewolf who embraces his wolfish traits can consciously bring up one or another aspect. Heightened senses might explain the appreciation for blood in their meat, but Remus wasn't one to embrace the wolf inside, nor to discuss details of his condition.

** It's fanon and may I add that I hate this idea. Like another user said, it's only mentioned that Bill, who was bitten by Greyback, now likes his stakes a little rarer. I really do wonder what Remus meant by 'some wolfish characteristics'. In her piece on werewolves, Rowling mentions that a few days before and after a full moon, a person with this condition might feel ill, so it seems like it's an illness with no benefits whatsoever.

**** Would it be more acceptable if I called it a condition? I specifically said an illness because fanon tries to make it something it isn't,i.e., an illness that has advantages.

** Remus just seems to get tired around the full moons. Greyback was able to do something to make himself more wolfish when it wasn't the full moon, even able to partially infect Bill even though the moon wasn't full. I don't think werewolves can normally do that without a lot of intentional magical changes. However canon doesn't actually say if it's a magical or psychological thing that gives Greyback more wolf when he should be human. Bill took on some wolfish qualities like preferring steak more raw, but it never really says anything about enhanced abilities. It's logical to presume a full werewolf would have more wolfishness than Bill, but the books don't really give any definite answers.

** It's fanon. The only indication of anything vaguely like it is Fenrir Greyback's wolflike traits in human form, but it seems like he probably had the psychological condition of lycanthropy in addition to the literal magical curse.

*** Saying Greyback had the psychological condition is a nice way to describe his behaviour. It somehow seems to fit. But then I start thinking that would mean lycanthropy affects your mental state when you are human and Rowling's material contradicts this by saying werewolves are normal people when in human form.

** It's fanon, and I suspect it came from people wanting the Werewolves in the Harry Potter books/movies to be more like those seen in other media.

As an aside, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but I always had the impression that the way Lycanthropy, and those afflicted with it, is portrayed in canon to be an allegory for the AIDS scare in the 80's.

*** Rowling said that lycanthropy in her universe is a metaphor for HIV/AIDS. I know fans have issues with this because it doesn't seem to fit perfectly but she apparently was interested in exploring how prejudice in this case makes people intolerant.
