I would like a story where:

1. Harry or Hermione lead a rebellion or revolution against the ministry due to some terrible actions or law they have created either after the war or during it.

2. I would prefer if the fanfiction is currently active or complete, but I will still read abandoned fanfiction.

3. No parings of HG/DM HG/SS or HP/DM please, I'm fine with (almost) everything else.

An example of a fanfiction of this type that I like is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]].


** I'll take the karma for the classic recommendation:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][*/The Sum of Their Parts/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7396284/holdmybeer][/holdmybeer/]], regarded by many as one of the better works in this fandom.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

*** I actually just read that one recently, I usually don't like Dark Harry stories but that one was done very well, and in a way the reasons for his actions are justified.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.

I like it. But it's...strange. There's def parts I'm not a fan of. The...interactions...yeah. Interactions. They're very sudden and wordy.

But the idea? It's neat.
