Some kind of Crack fic, where instead of Azkaban, Death Eaters get sealed into a Magical Whack-a-Mole like machine, where Wizards can pay 10 galleons a turn, and the money goes to fixing the war damages, and anything else goes to the important Departments (DMLE, Saint Mungos, etc). Short, Oneshot


** "Hey, uh, Ron...isn't that the author who was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/82qcux/the_different_kinds_of_ronbashing/dvd7jlu/][bashing you earlier]]?" Harry pointed out.

Ron looked around; there, sitting in an alcove right next to some public toilets, was a whack-a-mole machine like you'd see at the arcade...

...But instead of regular mole heads (or niffler heads, or goblin heads (/that/ particular machine was destroyed after a brief but destructive goblin rebellion)), the heads popping out of this machine looked to be those of unmasked Death Eaters...in fact, they looked like the actual people, looking rather frustrated and upset...

...And gleefully bopping them over the head with a squeaky mallet, was one small dragon...dragonet.

Ron peered closely, "Huh, yeah, I think it is. I guess he likes bashing Death Eaters too."

"It's ten galleons a turn, how's he paying for it all?" Harry wondered aloud.

"He's an author and a self-insert, he can have as much money as he wants." Ron answered, "Heck, he can give you as much money as he wants, you're generally the star of these things. I saw a parody once where you inherited literally everything, including Gringotts and Hogwarts..."
