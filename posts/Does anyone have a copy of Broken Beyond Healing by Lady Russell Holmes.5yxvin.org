This is one of my favorite stories from the old times (published around 2002). It featured a heavily abused, crippled Harry slowly ajdusting to his situation and developing some interesting powers, centered around Divining - like farsight, looking into the past and as the story went on, even looking into diverging timestreams (glimpses into alternate timelines and such). Granted, the abuse was absolutely god-awful, but the second part of the story was quite compelling.

Unforunately the author removed it from her FFN page and after over 15 minutes of exhausting research I can't seem to be able to locate a copy.


** Let me look through my black magic archives tonight when I get home. I'll see what I can find. (Because I also want it.)

**** Still looking :) I'll know I will hit a milestone in 20 minutes and I hope it's a good one!

Edit: Sorry man, the archive I was looking for didn't have it. :(

** Are you sure it was published around 2002? Do you know when it was removed?

*** Not sure. I believe it was published in 2002 or 2003. The last chapter was probably posted in 2004 or 05? Not sure as to when it was removed, but I wanna say around 2008.

***** Thanks for giving it a try anyway! I've even contacted the author in pursuit of my quest :)

Out of curiosity, what sort of archives did you search - are they available online?

****** All of the archives noted here: [[http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=FanFiction.Net]]

Also looked through Portkey and Portkey archives like [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/]] and also one that I downloaded awhile ago; though to be fair I didn't expect anything because I don't think the author was ever on Portkey.

Also tried the way back machine which didn't have anything on FFnet.

And as a last Hail Mary I'm downloading another archive I found on this sub, but I don't think it'll have it either.
