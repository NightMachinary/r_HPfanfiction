There a lot of fics in which Dumbledore manipulates Harry for the Greater Good of the Wizardry World and treats Harry as a a chess piece. I am looking for fics that Dumbledore manipulates Harry for his own good.

Examples:

Dumbledore creates a rule that unables Harry of taking Divination and instead has to take Ancient Runes or Arithmancy, in order to prepare him against Voldemort.

Dumbledore takes advantage of his position as Harry's Magical Guardian and invest Harry's money to double or triple the amount. Put him in a Marriage Contract with someone that will make Harry happy or the family can help Harry.

Dumbledore manipulates Snape to pressure Harry to be better at Potions.

Dumbledore manipulates the students around Harry to make friends with important people, Susan Bones, Fleur Delacour, Blaise Zabini, etc.

Overall, I want a Dumbledore that cares more about Harry than the Wizardry world and wants him to live a long happy life. No slash or Harry/Ginny please. Thank you!

*** It does not have to be that way. I remember reading a Marriage Contract fic in which neither Harry or the girl wanted to be in it because they were rivals and 'hated' each other but everytime one was in trouble the other was quick to help or beat everyone senseless to protect them. Their parents or guardians agree to put them in a marriage contract and they were happily ever after. I just can't remember the name. Which is why I added it to the examples.

Anyway, it was just an example in how Dumbledore could manipulate the world around Harry to help him have a happy life.

I mean, it might be fine for Fanfiction, I don't really give a damn if you like marriage law fics - read and write whatever floats your boat!

But if you're writing a truly good Dumbledore, I'd personally stay away from marriage contracts that don't involve consent.

If there's not consent from both parties in the contract, it's /not a bloody contract/. If there's not consent from both parties to the marriage contracted for, the marriage isn't valid and therefore doesn't count as performance under the contract.

So, so, so, so, so many marriage contract fics are written by people who probably don't understand what contracts are and /definitely/ don't understand what marriages are.

****** May be true of legal contracts in modern real life for the most part but from I've seen from fics, "Marriage Contracts" are typically contracts made by guardians to arrange marriages between their wards, usually without the consent of the ward. Arranged marriages definitely existed in the past and still exist to an extent in the world now. "Marriage Contracts" may be a bit of a misnomer, but arranged marriages are definitely a thing.

There's even canonical evidence that indicates that contracts (in the HP world) may not require consent on the part of all parties. Harry was placed into a binding magical contract by the Goblet of Fire. Of course that may be different because it was a magical artifact and we don't see much elsewhere on contracts in the magical world.

***** I am sorry if I offended you. I did not meant to imply that consent was not necessary in any relationship. Any marriage contract made for the sake of money and 'purity' is wrong and should not exist.

Rape is a horrible thing, but I am not refering to an ironclad contract that forces two people to have sex whether they want to or not. I meant a contract that is about MARRIAGE. I am refering to the marriage contract in which both parties love one another and simply make the contract because they want to.

Anyway, the marriage contract example can be completely ignored. It is afterall just an example. I am looking for fics in which Dumbledore manipulates the world for Harry's greater good.

Number two, "informed" is the part that matters for children. You don't own children. They are not your property, despite people being under the power trip and acting as if they are.

Your job is to teach them how to handle the world, not puppeteer them.

"Because I said so" is not valid, and not only that, using forms of manipulation on them rather than explaining the situation and reasons for outcome, teaches them that it's okay in adulthood.

So yes, any way in which you spin it, some aspect of this is part of a valid critera.

************** The whataboutisms are strong with you, and I can see that no matter how many times I explain this concept to you, you're going to come up with something new to try and make a false equivalency.

Reading a book is not manipulation.

Manipulation - the action of manipulating someone in a clever or unscrupulous way.

Unscrupulous - having or showing no moral principles; not honest or fair.

In what way is reading a book showing no moral principals? It's not, because you're using the term "manipulation" towards things that are not manipulation in order to try and get me to swallow your justification.

Social interactions are nuanced. If you're lying to someone in order to get someone to do something, that's manipulation due to the fact that you are breaking a moral code to do what you want.

If you are just reading a book to a child, you're not lying or breaking any ethics by not offering every bit of information upfront. There are no negative rammifications of doing such without informing them why.

And, as has been your MO thusfar, I'm sure you're going to come up with another whataboutism to try and contest this, but I really need you to understand something, as I'm done explaining it:

Lying to someone, or potentially compramising someone's mental health or wellbeing, in order to get what you want, is not "helping". It's manipuating, and manipulation is not love. Just as obsession is not love, rape is not love, and compromising someone's right to their own life is not love.

Encouraging politically useful friendships, well, that depends on how it's done; there are plenty of ways an author might depict it that are legitimate.

My daughter gets backpay from SSI for being special needs. I had to put that backpay in a special account for her, in her name, and am not allowed to touch it unless it's needed for her disability, or an emergency where she may go without food or shelter-- putting her in direct danger.

There's a reason I would be financially responsible for spending that money on stocks and shares or some other form of investment.

/It's not my money./ It's *her* money. It's my job to give her a stable home where she is free from physical and mental abuse, shelter, clothing, and food. It is my job to prepare her for the world in which she will eventually need to manage herself. It is not my job to choose how money that is her's needs to be spent. To think it is, is egotistical and controlling.

Additionally, it is not moral to purposely put a child in a position where you know he will be bullied by an adult, just to get the outcome YOU would like. The fact that you think that's not morally questionable makes me worry for your children.

Requesting such stories, as I've said many times, is 200% fine. My issue, is classifying "manipulation" as "love". Many people get abused because they confused obsession and manipulation with love, it's something we need a clear understanding that these things are not the same.

***************** Actually, it's normal and legal for trustees to invest the contents of the trust, so long as they don't have conflicts of interest like investing in their own companies; just ask Google "can trustees invest?". And many fics make Dumbledore Harry's guardian in some fashion - after all, he had Harry's vault key - so it's quite plausible that he was legally justified in acting as a trustee.

The OP didn't request bullying, he requested something like Snape putting pressure on Harry to do well. Bullying is what happened in canon and was not aimed at helping Harry succeed. Reading a variation on it where Snape is still harsh, and still prejudiced, but is being made to rein himself in and actually do his best to teach, could be quite interesting.

And, since you mentioned google...

  Trust fund assets may be invested *only in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.*

In which, you would need the government permission, and it would need to be shown that your beneficiary /needs/ the investment to survive or thrive.

Harry's vault was, in canon, not used to even support him. As far as we know, the Dudleys took on the entirety of financial support. Now, we can obviously play with this with fanfiction, but in terms of argument, this would be an entire fan-made issue.

Would I argue that some of OPs requests are indeed, not manipulation? Yes. But there are some that, if not flat out manipulation, are teetering that edge.

My whole point is that the romanticism of manipulation doesn't sit well with me. Seeking out fics where Dumbledore is a kind and caring guardian to Harry, fine. Seeking out fics where Dumbledore is teetering the edge of morally justifiable acts and pronouncing it "love" isn't so healthy.

I actually enjoy very dark (psychologically dark) stories that make you explore these themes, but to write them as something good and acceptable isn't healthy.

I've read marriage law where it's very apparent that the entire ordeal is fucked up, and I've also read marriage law where the marriage ended up happy in the end, so the morality of the law isnt even worried about.

Guess which ones i'll recommend others to read?

******************** That is true, and the wizarding world may work differently, but I was more referencing the law as an example for the morality of it.

Investing has risks. If someone gives my daughter a million dollars, and I take a chance at investing it, I'm also taking a chance at losing it all. I'm (not as seriously, but still) gambling with money that isn't mine.

My grandmother set up an account for me when I turned five for college. My mother spent it, going down to Florida for a job interview which paid well, intending to return the money to my account.

She didn't get the job. I didn't have college paid for.

Morally, investing is only seen as "good" as long as something comes from it. But, let's be real here... many, many times investing can lead to nothing.

So, is it morally justified to spend your child's money? I would claim that, in most cases, no.

Look, I just want everyone to be happy and free from abuse, and I genuinely worry when people confuse love with things like manipulation. Hell, I have confused it with love at one point in my lifetime, and it can lead to extreme ramifications that I hope no one ever experiences.

**** Canon blaise was at least a coward. Likely a bigot. However he has no real characterization. So its likely you could alter his trajectory with early intervention. Also, his mother killing her husbands is not proven canon, but speculative. A fanfic writer could write it as a woman just extremely unlucky in love, or she was cursed.

I dislike when people feel like they have to abide by canon entirely. You can justify sweeping changes by using the butterfly effect. Or by showing moral progression of a character facing facts and learning against his bigotry. Look at Draco Malfoy in Accidental Animagus by White Squirrel. Its so dumb how people want to lock in characters to their canon mindset. As if you come across a child in real life who was raised to be racist, and he cant change.

This is a fandom you can change and tweak the very foundation of the universe. You can expand upon magic, invent branches of study. But god forbid you change a canon character or expand upon them from what we are given in canon.

I do not like Malfoy one bit in canon but in the fic Novocaine by StardustWarrior2991, I really like what the author did with him. He shows personal growth from his 'My father will hear of this' to a more independent actions on his own and creating a life outside his father's influence and expectations.

I did not supported Harry being with Ginny for this reason.

So I do not see that spark between them. On the other hand, I read this fic that has Harry and Daphne Greengrass being together. It was so beautiful written with a great plot, character development, and romance that I "saw" the spark between them even though they do not even interact in canon.

****** You have explained yourself properly, and that's why I believe the movies ruined the fandom. That director was a shit of a person who made something that's nothing more than bad fanfiction.

I see where you're coming from though.

****** I see that screenwriter Steve Kloves has succeeded in his character assassinations of Ron and Ginny, and planted the prejudice into many Movie first viewers.

For that reason alone, I shall never consider Movies canon.

  in the books, Ginny is described as beautiful

Not disagreeing with you, and I love HarryxGinny as well, but I do feel obligated to point out that Harry describes a lot of people as being beautiful, and about half of them are boys lol

******* lmao that's fair

Still, I didn't say "about half" out of nowhere, I remember there was someone who actually counted how many times Harry commented on someone's physical attractiveness and it was about half toward boys, half toward girls. Now, of course that could just be JK Rowling's own opinions showing through, or aesthetic attraction, but it stands.

*** Harry/Ginny doesn't make much sense to me because Harry was Ginny's “celebrity crush” and I think that's not a good basis for a relationship. But if you like Harry/Ginny, I'm glad that you have a pairing that you enjoy.

**** JK at least did a good job of showing Ginny growing out of that. She calls Harry out on his shit on later books like the whole "you're not the only person Tom has possessed" thing. That's not something you'd do if you were still star stuck by someone.

*** 'Making the most sense' is a bit too strong IMO - narratively in the books, I don't get that impression myself, and it'll at least be up to personal taste.

She can be made to make sense, of course - and it's not /wrong/ to have Ginny as the pairing for Harry. At the same time, she's also not the only choice, and there's a lot of people who would disagree with her as the most logical choice as you seem to portray her.
