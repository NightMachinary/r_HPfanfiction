Am I the only one who gets slightly turned off when an author tries to measure a wizard's powers by using Magical cores, or just using them as a device in the fanfiction?

And 'Wards'? Where did this come from? Referencing Protective Spells or Protective charms as Wards!?


** Historically speaking, a 'ward' is a form of protection - it used to refer to protective walls around buildings. The etymology is 'wardaz,' an ancient Germanic word that meant 'guard.' So it's not inaccurate.

I'm with you on magical cores.

** I have no issues with wards in fanfiction at all. I'm fairly sure canon has them, even if they don't use that particular word. I mean, consider the camping protections Hermione set up -- they're basically what fanon calls "wards", even if canon doesn't use the word.

I don't like how "magical cores" are usually used in fanfictions to denote power levels. However, I don't mind the concept of a limited power that recovers with time, which can be called a "magical core" if you wish to.

*** The magic cores thing seems like it comes from the author thinking magic needs limitations to be interesting (which I agree with), but canon doesn't really provide much in that respect. It just seems like if Harry tried a little harder or had the right type of inspiration, he can do anything, which works in canon when you are taking each book as a sort of self-contained mystery where magical discovery is part of that mystery; it doesn't really work as well in fanfiction, because the audience generally has mostly-complete knowledge of the entire series before the first line of text. There's no mystery when it comes to the way magic works or what a canon spell does, so we have to introduce drama and limitations to the magic in another way.

I guess what I'm saying is I agree that there's nothing wrong with the concept, but it's really easy to execute something poorly when it diverges so wildly from canon, much like any trope, really.

The wards thing I just take as a shortcut to saying "anti apparition jinx" or "muggle repelling jinx" which just gets to be a mouthful when you can just say "ward."

**** This is a great reply, especially the part about magical cores as a limit to power. This is something that I am wrestling within the fic I am writing-- not including magical cores-- but how to make the magic interesting without sounding outlandish or adding something that seems to over the top. I'm much more interested in how magic works than what wizards did with their poop and I wish JKR had added that kind of detail to Pottermore.

** I've been told this is fan fiction, so wards can be used, but it still irks me as there are actual terms for "wards" and it kinda lumps different types of magic together.

Magical cores are a way to cap HP magic. By fantasy standards it's very OP. I hate the idea and it's why I read few crossovers.

*** The idea of being able to measure your kids magic is not present in the canonical work.

JK Rowling presented magic as the mind.

By going to school, being educated, your mind gains knowledge. So magic grows the more you are trained. Just like people, we have different types of minds, people who are intelligent and people who are average.

The idea of magic being some weight or body fat sounds like something from Dragon Ball Z to justify why one character can kill the villain in an minute.

** Ward is just a broad term for magical protections so I don't see a problem with it.

As for cores - they are a cheap and lazy way of limiting the characters by arbitrary and unnecessary means. HP magic works from will, intelligence and knowledge, not some "magichlorians".

For in universe stories there is no reason to introducing them, and for crossovers... well, I don't think there is either. If the cross is with some non-superpower universe magic will be OP no matter what, and when crossing with universes that have some sort of powers... well, some are already stronger than magic in some aspects, and magic should be there to help them where they can't make it for themselves.

If you want some limits look at the already canonical ways of doing stuff instead of introducing a mediocore and overused trope that really doesn't need to be there

******* Then tell us you don't like it.

But calling someone lazy just because you didn't like something they did is just plain rude.

I personally don't really remember using magical cores, I might've, but just reading this hurts my brain.

If you had written a fic, I would let you say what you want - you would have the right, even if it would still be wrong.

But you haven't, and yet you call authors lazy?

I could say you're extremely lazy, since you don't even write fics.

** They are apparently widespread enough that, when I described the sensation of Harry utilizing his magic, I was criticized for the description not matching the usual convention of a magical core.

Wards are a common term in fantasy for protective magic, so I have less of a problem with them.

** We have to limit wizards power to certain limit. It may be a magical core with certain amount power or something like midichlorians in blood. We can't have people to born with same amount of magic or able to use unlimited amount of magical power. I expect dark wizards to perform lots of rituals to increase their magical power. We saw in DH movie that Voldemort with the help of Elder Wand single handedly destroyee the protections around Hogwarts even the wand was not his, while lots of his followers struggled.(I don't know it was in books or not, as it's been long time since I read them). It shows us how powerful he was.

Wards are same as protection charms to me so they were close to canon.

*** JK Rowling didn't use Magical cores but she did fine in being able to differentiate wizards power levels. This magical core trope is not canon.

In canon it depended upon your skill, intellect, and also hereditary.

Most powerful wizards in canon were very smart or skillful in one magical area.

**** I would say creativity, intelligence, and willpower are the most important aspects of magic in canon (also a wand that agrees with you, to some extent):

Wizarding society does not provide a lot of incentive for one to excel at magic. Your basic needs can be met with very minimal effort, and I imagine a very large chunk of society gets by without ever learning anything advanced, while the "greats" like Dumbledore and his predecessors transform and shape the world and allow everyone else to simply coast along and be happy.

Now, because there is little incentive to be so good at magic that you could rival Dumbledore, guys like Riddle are rare, and rarer still due to the small population.

The rarity of all this, and the fact that magic can "sort of" do whatever you want, means that everyone ends up at wildly different "power levels" where it comes to magic. Kids like Harry seem pretty good at combat magic because he's stubborn and /needs/ to learn it, so he practices something like the Patronus for months before it clicks in his mind. He's always on edge and got hunted by his cousin as a kid, so he's more than decent at dodging. He's a natural-born flyer, so he's learned to think in a 3D space and how to pay attention to his environment while focusing on a singular goal. Most other characters don't have all these advantages where it comes to Defense, so Harry seems "powerful" in comparison.

I kind of like the opposite idea of a Magical Core: Magic is like a drug. It invigorates you, wizards literally get giddy and high off casting spells. It's just that you get burnt out on it really fast if you go too far, which in canon is "magical exhaustion." People who are exceptionally skilled at magic have the willpower to suppress their inherent giddiness at reshaping reality and take into account the reality of their situation, to focus on the ideas and form a solid emotional + mental picture of what they want their magic to do, which is why the somatic and verbal components of spells are so important to novices; they help keep your focus when the magic just wants to do whatever and distracts you with the pleasure of doing magic. This is also why older mages tend to be better, despite not really being more physically fit: they know what to expect, they can suppress that elation.

This is also why Dementors should be inherently disgusting to wizards. They are like anti-mages.

No one gets physically tired by waving a twig around for any length of time, that would be ridiculous, and no way a centenarian would be better at it than a teenager, but we see people get exhausted from doing magic. Some authors go the "core" route, but I think it's really just all the concentration and constant flow of power can leave one burnt out while trying to do all the multitasking.

** Magical cores are as best as I can tell a way of easily overpowering the protagonist (usually but not always Harry). In other words, its a way of making HP into Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and other fantasy/science/magic based stories, where the characters are automatically stronger without requiring an abundance of work and building up of strength. The MC is just 'so powerful' and everyone is awed/amazed/enraptured/pick-your-adjective. Its also a very simple way of solving lots of issues with canon (not just in HP) without doing a lot of leg-work and writing and plotting.

As for Wards. Wards are not native to HP, as you can probably guess. The concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apotropaic_magic][Apotropaic Magic]], or magic that protects against harm in various forms, is ancient in origin. However, wards are something that has commonly existed in magic-based fantasy for quite a long time (ex. [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Guards%20and%20Wards#content][Dungeons and Dragons]]), and its fairly clear in canon that protective spells of different forms do exist. From Protego to the Fidelius Charm, there is a type of magic that has the specific purpose of protecting from harm. However, the problem for lots of people is that protective charms/spells are not really characterized as 'separate' in canon, in ways such as different types of transfiguration are. This leads to a lot of people 'inventing' it as its own sub-branch of sorts that has its own rules and requirements, often involving Ancient Runes as a way of explaining why that course is actually taught in Hogwarts. There is also the fact that people are more familiar with the term who have had any investment in other fantasy fandoms, and wards are often similar in nature to what is described as protection spells in canon.

** To me, "wards" is strictly a matter of semantics. Even if the magic used is more properly referred to with other terms, I'm willing to accept "ward" as an informal catch-all description for any more-or-less static enchantment over an area. No big deal in my book.

Cores are a bit different. When used as a way to directly measure power levels, it just reeks of unoriginality and forcing the reader to accept that so-and-so is special. But I could envision a fic where it's more akin to a muscle that every magical person has, including both the ability to exhaust it through overwork and the ability to build stamina through practice. That's more reasonable to me. Not necessarily canon-compliant, but within the realm of plausibility. Just get out of here with "he has a bigger core therefore he's stronger" nonsense.

** Not terribly big on either, unless the writer's good enough to make me ignore them. Wards kinda exist by another name in canon, but Magical Cores are just a dumb and lazy way to quantify power levels like a shonen anime. The only time I could tolerate Magical Cores was in a Fate Stay/Night crossover, and it was more to differentiate and contrast a Magus and a Wizard so I just rolled with it.
