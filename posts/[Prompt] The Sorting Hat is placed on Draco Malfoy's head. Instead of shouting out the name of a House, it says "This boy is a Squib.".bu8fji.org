**** I'm on mobile and can't link, but I found a Pottermore article called Scottish Rugby, and it has the story you're thinking of. His siblings were all magical, and they all conspired against their parents to protect their brother. One sibling forged a Hogwarts Acceptance letter, then they pulled off a trip to Ollivanders and successfully faked one of the wands choosing their brother, then one of them took him to Hogwarts via broom, where he shoved his way in front of another student whose name had been called, then the hat apologetically informed him that he was a squib.

** I doubt a true Squib Draco could work (can Squibs even see Hogwarts) for several reasons (Would the blood purist Malfoy love a Squib, no Hogwarts letter, no wand . . .), but I could see this as a revenge.

Someone cursed the Hat to shoot Squib when he touches Draco. He has magic, but teacher don't know what to do with him (the hat gave his judgement, even if it's a strange one, and they can't really resort students). Malfoy's reputation goes to the drain (No Slytherin hate him because he is himself, Slytherin don't respect the "Squibb"), media (Skeeters) learn about it and make things worse. So Draco has to grow up in a school that doesn't live to its promise, and find some true friends on the way.

Could almost be the start of a redemption story (though can we wall this redemption is Draco is 11 and not really bad yet, just stupid?)

****** Nah, considering that they've been doing this to children for a decade (besides the initial purge), they have way too much societal momentum to be derailed by even that.

​

Also, reading between the lines, it's pretty clear that the reason for Fiat Lux was a /much/ harsher Blood War. There's too much popular support, even among the canon good characters, and the ones who would protest have been purged (Hell, Nymphadora's mom would have been purged).

​

This is not a McGonagall that would have objected to the bouncing ferret...

​

Even Dumbledore, the champion of forgiveness and the innocence of children, merely shrugs and turns away.

​

The children are split between "terrified of being purged" and "indoctrinated" - the only children who sense that /this is not right/ are the Muggleborn, who are far outnumbered - and considering that they have magical-Light-SS patrolling the corridors, the savvy do not speak, and the unsavvy are silenced.

​

Their only hope at this point is:

​

1. International intervention
2. Someone destroying the Sorting Hat, or at least rendering it incapable of or unwilling to Sorting into Slytherin
3. Revolution

​

If a hypothetical continuation has him so Sorted, I'd expect plots of any of:

​

1. Sentence immediately executed, Harry dies tragically, having been sent back to the Dursleys, which induces any of the hopes. Possibly it is smoothed over by claiming that he was an imposter, having treacherously killed and replaced the 'real' Harry in an attempt to hide his darkness. Possibly followed by another purge, with the Hogwarts students denouncing each other.
2. They 'suspend the sentence pending further investigation', Harry is quietly unpersoned.
3. Sentence commuted, or used as excuse to choose option 2. However, in the former case, this easily leads to 3, depending on how many unpurged people are unhappy with the system, and in the latter, FL will replace the Sorting Hat with something /worse/ - like having one of their SS mindrape the students, and purge any who have committed thoughtcrime.
4. Dumbledore kidnaps Harry, and starts a rebellion (which is doomed to fail, considering the lack of popular support).
5. Dumbledore kidnaps Harry, hides, takes him as his apprentice, recruit the disgusted Muggleborn, and lead a rebellion.

​

In fact, Harry /not/ being Sorted into Slytherin ends up with a possibly less interesting bundle of possible plots - it basically means that every year is like canon year 5 taken to 11.
