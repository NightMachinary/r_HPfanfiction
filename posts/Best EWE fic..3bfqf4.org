LF best non epilogue fic. Meaning the fic starts anytime after defeat of voldemort but doesn't include the post 19 years scene.


** I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] seems to fit and is absolutely fantastic.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

**** In that case here is another great fic, this one distinctly non-compliant: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation]]

#+begin_quote
  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  EWE. The war is over, but Voldemort isn't as dead as everyone believes. Harry returns to Hogwarts, expecting a normal school year, but a sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle has other ideas. It seems sometimes the line between good and evil is very blurry and fascination and hate can easily coexist. Features: powerful!Harry, Dark Arts, Slytherin schemes, and very twisted love.
