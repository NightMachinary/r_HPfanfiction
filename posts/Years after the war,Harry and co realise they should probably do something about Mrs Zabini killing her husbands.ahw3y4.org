** I'm of the view that if you so much as mildly flirt with a woman who has buried seven husbands before you, you're asking for whatever happens to you thereafter.

**** See the reply by [[/u/Prisioux]] above, for one of the popular ones. There's also the idea that she's a Seer who foresees the death of rich bachelors and takes advantage of that knowledge. And the one that her jealous first husband put some variation of the Defence Professorship curse on her.

** I've read a couple of fics where she didn't actually kill any of her husbands. Like one died of natural causes, another admitted he was gay and is living in Manhattan with his new husband. The others are all still alive and it's just vicious high society gossip that she's a black widow.

On the other hand, I've read another one in which Harry's a serial serial killer killer, and she's one of his victims. I'm pretty sure it was Tom/Harry slash though so a lot of you probably wouldn't want to read it.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
