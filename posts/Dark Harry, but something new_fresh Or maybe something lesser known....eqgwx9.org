** While not exactly Dark Harry, this is a Harry who could be easily and ignorantly labeled as “Dark” by the other characters. Mostly because Parseltongue is his first language.

(Copypasta)

Ongoing: PadfootIsMyHomeDawg's Parsel linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6146470/chapters/14082718]]) is a story where instead of going to the Dursley's, Harry, dubbed Silas, leaves the doorstep in the morning of November First in a snake animagus form to live among other snakes. After he has been missing for 10 years, he's discovered by Fred and George in the Forbidden Forest. It's a Harmony fic, cute as heck, and a cool exaggeration of Harry being a fish out of water, having to learn magic and how to be human at the same time.

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".

** If you haven't read it, the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/893422][Harveste Addams]] series is excellent. It's a cross with the Addams Family, so it's a little bit cracky, but it's very well written and delightfully dark and twisted, without falling into annoying cliches.

  "I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while."Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet."I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time."You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench."A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead." Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it.Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected.And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself being used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

  Voldemort has captured Harry and for his own twisted reasons has chosen not to kill him outright. Revenge in the Dark Lord's mind requires a fate worse than death and Harry is about to find out what that is.

** Sadly, despite there being 800k Harry Potter fanfictions on ff.net, like 90% of them are utter garbage.

Would help if you explained what tropes your tired of seeing so I can try to think of a fic that doesn't have those tropes and features new ideas.

*** Mate, literally any dark!harry fic that isn't utter trash

Well, the trope i hate the most is starting from first year, not doing anything and then not finishing the fic. The trope i like the most is light!harry discovering dark magic and keeping it a secret.

If you have the time, id really appreciate if you could just wrie down as many dark! Fics, i mean some of them are bound to be decent no?
