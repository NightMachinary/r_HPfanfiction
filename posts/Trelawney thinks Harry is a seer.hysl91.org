Remember when Harry described Witherwings (Buckbeak) flying in the exam? What if Trelawney thinks he is a seer because, as far as anyone knows, Buckbeak freed himself and flew away. Harry, being Harry, most likely would go with it (although that's up to your discretion.)


** But what if he went with it, started bullsh*tting predictions, only for them to end up coming true in the most convoluted ways possible. Turns out he actually is a seer, which is the power moldy-shorts knows not.

**** Well yes. But I'm thinking even more out there than cannon. Like he predicts Malfoy joining a herd of prancing unicorns and it turns out Malfoy becomes a unicorn animagus, or Voldemort is killed by the thing he hates the most, and he ends up getting hit by a bus in muggle London in the middle of a raid or some such nonsense

** This sort-of kind-of happens in linkffn(Oh God Not Again). Harry is thrown into the past and, among other things, ends up convincing everyone that he has a psychic scar. He's not psychic; the scar is. Trelawney completely buys it (as does everyone else).

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

  A prank in Professor Trelawney's class leads to Ron being hailed as a seer. But nobody could predict how that would change Harry's fate. AU, starts 3rd year. Powerful!Harry. Adventure/Humor.

  Thirteen year old Bella Black intended to go back in time to start a war in service to her patron Power. Ritual magic goes awry and she finds herself in 1993, faced with a failing House of Black, an insane alter ego, and a Dark Lord on the rise. Chaos ensues. (Title drop.)
