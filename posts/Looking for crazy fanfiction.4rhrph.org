Looking for really insane fanfiction. The weirder, darker, more profound and/or hilarious the better. I prefer either a really literate, competent author or an author who is so terrible that it's hilarious. I want to read something that will traumatize me or make me laugh, and I know that the Harry Potter fandom has it.

** First one was on DLP, the rest was a quick google search, so I can only guarantee the first author is competent.

** linkffn(Partially Kissed Hero) Features many wtf moments, including when Harry, Hermione, and Luna become magical shape-shifting half-fairies (at least I think, my memories on this are kind of fuzzy).

** *Inheritance* by megamatt09, linkffn(9970406), is so bad that it actually becomes funny. Harry basically fucked every woman who came across him, beginning with his mother Lily and ending with Bellatrix Lestrange.

  The events of the graveyard result in interesting ramifications as Lord Voldemort is not the only one who returns to a body. Harry/Multi.
