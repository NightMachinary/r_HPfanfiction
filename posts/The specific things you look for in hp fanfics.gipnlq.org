Im always on the look out for specific things from hp fics some of it i can find some of it i cant but crave it anyway.

As a couple examples im always looking for Sirius fics where he handling ptsd after azkaban as well as fics in general that explore hp world outside hogwarts.

So what specific things in fics are you always looking for?


** Decent grammar and punctuation. I mean the occasional typo is fine. But if it just repeats the same mistakes over and over it's an instant turn off.

** I almost always look for fics that involve/center adults. I really dislike fics that it have children interacting with children.

*** same I guess ive always had the mentality of Harry's gen is around my age so to have them much younger than me now feels odd. I can still read things with them at hogwarts but i much prefer post hogwarts also because its less familar something that has more new creative untouched potential than hogwarts which was explored more in series.

*** seconded. It kind of surprises me how willing people are to read stuff that doesn't have proper punctuations or spellings.

I prefer only harry-centric and (sometimes) ron-centric fics though.

** Not too dark, mostly no-bash and either newly published or updated. That or completed, there's nothing that gets me down like a good fic left unfinished

** I tend to prefer fanfics that tread the familiar territory of Harry's Hogwarts years.

I generally will avoid fanfics with egregiously bad grammar. I also stay the hell away from mpreg and slash fics, most of the time. For some reason, the few that I've ended up reading and quitting were lewder and cruder than most /smut/ I've read.

There also ones with gratituous violence that I've rather harshly reviewed. I remember one fanfic I read with a bunch random 2nd years violently beating up a 1st year, and a 12 year old threatening that same 1st year with crimes that 12 year olds shouldn't even be aware of, let alone threatening. So far it has only one chapter, but it was enough for me to say, "What the hell?!"

** I'm going to give you all a tip on specific searching on reddit, using your specific searching as an example

Search "[[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] Sirius ptsd" and you'll probably get a lot of posts with the words Sirius and ptsd within them

You can change those words however you like, I keep it simple usually (3 words max)

** I always look - first and foremost - for good writing quality, as it'll be impossible for me to enjoy the fic otherwise.

In terms of plot/inclusions, though, I always am on the lookout for fics involving time travel or dimensional travel. Also, for fics that have Harry starting off as older-ish, the inclusion of some trauma or PTSD or some other mental scars are - though very hard to handle correctly - something that I find myself looking for, especially in conjunction with the previous ones.

** Depends from day to day, but in general I tend to stray away from slash fics, just because I don't really enjoy reading that. Doesn't mean I don't like any slash fic, there are some great ones out there. Can remember the name, but harry was in slytherin and happened to get together with Theo Nott, though it was a particularly minor detail.

** Specifics changes from time to time but in general, I look for non-slash, male Harry centric fics. Also, for the last year or so I noticed I'm much more interested in crossovers.
