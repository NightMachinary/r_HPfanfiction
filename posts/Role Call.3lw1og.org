Just wondering how many of the 5,825 subscribers are actually here!

Comment down below, and maybe add an interesting fact, your favorite fic, your FFN profile, etc.

I'll start!


** Are we polling the 44 online right now or...?

I am [[/u/wordhammer]], found on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Ewordhammer][fanfiction.net]], [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewuser.php?uid=1432][hpfanficarchive]], [[http://ficwad.com/a/wordhammer][ficwad]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/wordhammer/pseuds/wordhammer][Ao3]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/member.php?u=10665][darklordpotter]] as wordhammer. At least I'm consistent.

I've been reading fanfiction since 2008 and posted my first chapter in 2009. Some might say my works are a good example of what can go horribly wrong with fanfiction, but I have a small following of fans.

My favorite character is Tonks; favorite magic is legilimency; favorite movie in the series is Prisoner of Azkaban, favorite book of the series is Order of the Phoenix. I'm a recovering Harmonian.

Fic I recommend more often than others do: linkffn(Memorium by Aesop)

Unrelated book worth reading: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics][Freakonomics]] by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner.

** Hello, I'm bunn2.

Bunny was taken so I used bunn(ee); the 'ee' sound is 2 in korean.

My favorite character is Luna. I admire her ability to stay true to herself, as well as her wisdom and courage. And she reminds me of a cat.

I really don't have a favorite fic, but I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/The-Legacy][The Legacy]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6132272/1/Reversed-Life][Reversed Life]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The-Sun-Soul][the Sun Soul]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6175861/1/Dauntless][Dauntless]].

Actually most of my posts are in [[/r/leagueoflegends]], even though i suck and rarely play, and [[/r/GlobalOffensive]], which I do play (and suck less). But my secret hobby is reading fanfiction until the morning hours when I work a late shift.

** Hey everyone, I'm [[/u/girlikecupcake]]. I'm 23, and I've been reading fanfiction since I was around 12. I'm magicalmalady on FFN, but don't trust my favs list there, it's a work in progress.

My favorite character is Sirius Black. There's so much potential there- what we see in canon is one of the bad outcomes possible. I love exploring his background, the Marauder era, him before the traumas of war.

One fic I love recommending is linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie). It's got time travel (one of my favorite tropes), it's Hermione centric, explores two of my top ships, and its /long/. I limit my searches to at least 100k words usually, so the longer the better!

My favorite book in the series is OoTP, favorite movie probably PoA.

I can look through my kindle and bookmarks later tonight to see what I have! But check out Granger enchanted, you might find something there that wasn't put on FFN or ao3.

Edit: yeah most of what I have saved is fairly popular, or something you've certainly seen on FFN

** [[/u/pddpro]] here..

My favorite characters are Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore. Both are interesting and yet faulty which kinda strikes a chord with me, I don't know. However, there tends to be a lot of Dumbledore bashing around the fandom which makes me a little sad. I have been fan of HP since ten or so years but (believe it or not) have started reading fanfics only for past couple of months.

** Hello!

I've only been reading fanfiction for about a year.

My absolutely favourite story of all time is Jamie Evans and Fate's fool.

My favourite character might actually be Harry when he is a snarky bastard.

I've recently expanded from just hp to Twilight ff too (I loathe the originals, Edward,) from Kathryn's In Another Life. I adore femslash stories.

** I'm [[/u/KeriRussellBrand]] and I've been reading fan fiction for about 1.5 years. I read HP fan fiction nearly exclusively, with my only exposure to other fandoms coming through crossover stories. I have no FFN profile that I'm willing to share on here.

My favorite character would probably be Tonks. I think that there is a lot that can be done with her due to her versatility, not just because of being a metamorphmagus.

Favorite aspect of magic would probably be transfiguration, I've read some stories that had impressive demonstrations of that skill.

I don't remember any of the canon books well enough to have a favorite, and I never saw any of the movies.

A recommendation would be HP & The Temporal Beacon - linkffn(6517567)

A non-fanfiction reading recommendation would be Innumeracy by John Allen Paulos - [[http://www.amazon.com/Innumeracy-Mathematical-Illiteracy-Its-Consequences/dp/0809058405][Amazon link]]

** Hullo.

I'm [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/][Steelbadger]], and go by the same name on DLP. I also recently got an AO3 account, but haven't got around to posting anything there yet.

I've only been writing about a year, though I've been reading fanfiction for closer to three. My stuff seems pretty well received, if rough around the edges. I mostly write crossovers. Slowly.

Favourite fic is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]. Or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]]. My favourite /under-appreciated/ story is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]].

Favourite character... tough one. I always kinda liked McGonagall. Favourite pairing, Harry/Fleur, but more out of /hope/ than any actual story I've read. I will read most pairings that aren't 'my greatest enemy is my true love' pairings, that's probably cos I'm a guy in my mid twenties and don't find much interest in teen angst.

Favourite book that's not Harry Potter; Night Watch by Terry Pratchett ^{^{^{GNUTerryPratchett}}}

** I'm me, my username is above if you want to see it, I use the same one pretty much everywhere, including FFN and AO3, but I don't write often and my stories are trash. I'd delete them but I'm still getting occasional nice reviews and faves so I guess they can't be completely awful. I think I'm improving but jury's out until I finish and post my latest fic.

I've been in the fandom for almost 15yrs, but I read a lot more during 2002-2007 than I do these days. I don't have a single favourite fic, but the ones I keep going back to reread include /Just a Random Tuesday/, /Fizz/, /Dear Sirius/, and /[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/hayseed/OP.html][Ordinary People]]/. linkffn(3124159; 2301238) linkao3(856175)

Favourite characters are Snape, Harry, and Draco. H/D is my biggest ship, but I'm an open multishipper. With the exception of incest, I'll read almost any pairing as long as the individual story writes it well. Favourite book is either Chamber of Secrets or Prisoner of Azkaban; favourite film is CoS.

** Hi, I'm perverse_idyll on LJ, DW, AO3, and ff.net, and I've been in HP fandom for 10 years. I read less voraciously than I used to, and I've never been a prolific writer, but lately my productiveness has dwindled almost to zero. I write explicit shipfic for the most part, but I read all over the map. I love this fandom wholeheartedly. It may be wanky (shipwars! BNFs! Draco in leather pants!), but it's amazing and creative, and there's no other fandom like it.

I'm a newbie to this sub, so I'm still figuring out my comfort levels. I hail from the slash & femslash end of fandom, and I somehow stumbled upon a link to this community, so I've been lurking and occasionally commenting because I like the way ideas and queries get floated here. I'm continually surprised by the divide between here and my usual hang-outs - for example, more than half the fics I've seen repeat-recced by members of this comm are completely unknown to me, and I assume the fics familiar to me and my LJ friends would draw a blank from most folks here.

My favorite character is Severus Snape, and most of my fic-writing is fueled by his mistakes, contradictions, and backstory. I prefer him young, skinny, ugly, messed up, bitter, brilliant, volatile, and capable of self-sacrifice. He's my fandom bicycle, and much as I admire Alan Rickman, the casting for movie!Snape is all wrong. (I'm not a fan of the movies, to be honest.)

I can't imagine narrowing the field to a single favorite fic - the very thought makes my brain seize up - so I'll just drop a link to my recs list, which is mostly HP, mostly slash, and very Snape-centric.

[[http://perverse-idyll.livejournal.com/62663.html][PI's favorite fics]]

I look forward to seeing more discussions and recommendations, though my reading time is limited and I'm more likely to try fics under 100k words.

And yeah, I was a bit startled the first couple of times I noticed the old-style slash disclaimers here ("I don't have anything against slash, but..."). Snape/Harry is what got me into fandom, and I've heard every insult, rebuttal, denunciation, and expression of disgust you can imagine. I'm pretty ship-and-let-ship, though. And I love discovering fantastic new authors.

I'm a huge sucker for DM/HP. I fully admit that it's because of my Tom Felton head-canon. For that ship to sail, I have to suspend my disbelief and read OOC Draco. But I don't care! :D But I love me a good HP/DM redemption story.

****** I don't read DM/HP, although it's the most popular slash ship in HP by far. For some reason, it doesn't touch whatever nerve lights up in me in response to character dynamics and sexual chemistry, although I do understand the appeal of a good redemption story. I'm also susceptible to well-developed romance fics, although I lean in the direction of dysfunctional relationships (why else my interest in Snape?) and complexity. I can be bribed with good banter, though, and one of my favorite Snarry fics is completely OOC, so my standards are, shall we say, flexible. Once I fall for an author, I'll follow them pretty much anywhere, even into the wilds of fanon territory.

** Hey, I'm [[/u/Psantium]]!\\
I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for 4 years now. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5917039/][This is my permanent FFN profile.]] I have lots of ideas, but +no time to write+ I'm too lazy.

My favorite character is Severus Snape, mostly because he is one of the characters with a good backstory that can be developed in so many possible ways.

A fic I'd recommend is linkffn(2318355) -- Make A Wish, a hilarious fanfiction.

A book I would recommend is The Alchemist by Paulo Cohen.

** Hi, I'm [[/u/Chipp]] and I've been reading fanfics for 4/5 years. I don't write but I might in the future, I've got the odd idea or two that I might try to develop when I've got more free time.

I like most fanfics but disliking Granger tends to limit the number of fics that I can really enjoy. I prefer non-Hinny and non-Harmony pairings and have never been able to understand what anyone sees in Angsty!Whinging!Harry fics (not that I begrudge them for liking them, I just can't see it myself).

I'm not sure I have a favourite character, I tend to go more by fic genre and in that regard Competent!LeadCharacter fics are what I look out for.

** I'm here. My FFN profile is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4038447/][here]], and AO3 is [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Agogobell28][here]]. I'm not much of a writer, but I love reading well-written fic, and I think(?) I've been reading fic since around 2011.

My favourite character is probably Hermione, with Remus and Bellatrix close seconds.

I used to be primarily an Avatar: The Last Airbender fic-reader, and then I found this. I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] was one of the first HP fics I read (and one of my all-time favourites). It's hard to remember.

Some of the fics I love most are the aforementioned Jamie Evans, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6919395/1/The-Changeling][The Changeling]] (I hope it's finished /sometime/ in the next century), and the truly high-quality /Alexandra Quick/ series, which is likely the best Harry Potter fanfiction written to date.

Favourite movie is probably either POA or GOF; favourite book is definitely GOF.

If you want a recommendation for OF series to read, I highly advise you to check out Garth Nix's Old Kingdom books (/Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen,/ and /Clariel/ plus a few other assorted novellas). They're really fantastic.

Interesting fact: I frequent [[/r/analog]] and [[/r/drumcorps]] in addition to [[/r/HPFanfiction]] - not a commonly found trifecta, I'd think.

** I am [[/u/PsychoGeek]], and I go by Stan on DLP. Aside from my brief flings with the Worm and ASOIAF fandoms, I've been reading HP fanfiction on an almost daily basis for five years.

Favorite characters are Harry (as he is in canon), Ron, Ginny and Molly. I like Luna and Bellatrix too, but in small to moderate doses.

I like fics that keep true to canon thematically, and I like large scale AUs based on a single point of divergence. I also like fics that focus on characters other than Harry, and I am waiting impatiently for someone to write a non-shippy Ron-centric story that doesn't suck.

I hate character bashing, shippers who put down almost every canon character in existence to justify their OTP, bashing of the wizarding world and muggle glorification. Coincidentally, I also hate Robst. I dislike illogical OOCness in general. I dislike fics where Harry (or any canon character) is blatantly more skilled/talented than in canon due to authorial fiat. I dislike both the indy!Harry and super!Harry genres, fics with too much angst and fics that try too hard to be dark and gritty.

My favorite fanfics are linkffn(On the way to Greatness) and linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). If would probably give away my first born to see them complete. Other favorites are linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided; Ectomancer; Song of the trees; Prince of the Dark Kingdom; Backward with Purpose; The Changeling by Annerb). Almost all of are either abandoned, or will almost certainly remain incomplete, which is clear proof that the universe hates me.

I'm an infrequent reader and an embarrassingly slow writer. Still figuring out how that writing business works. Favorite book is PoA. Favorite fanfic is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary by Arabella]]. It's so masterful at being quietly unnerving and has HANDS DOWN the best depiction of Tom Riddle I've ever seen. Arabella does a great job pulling horror from the seemingly mundane, everyday convos between Tom and Ginny.

I used to ship HHr pretty hard when I was younger (how I found the fandom), but now I'm fairly impartial to characters/ships/genres. I like well-written stories that explore cool concepts, while retaining a human focus. I also like there to be some degree of harrowing darkness in what I read.

**** After a quick read through chapter one, Hermione reminds me a lot of [[https://i.imgur.com/QW0gfBR.jpg][myself during the run up to puberty]]. Either He hasn't figured out he's trans yet and is wondering why he just feels weird(awful) or he has figured it out and has learned to keep his mouth shut about it. My money at this point is on it being the later considering the mention of the rushed haircut.

Just a guess but polyjuice is going to be featured at least once in this fic isn't it.

****** I'm gonna read this fic next and give you my take on it later but a good rule of thumb is, if a cis-gender person writes it then chances are it's mediocre at best.

I've been on a quest for some time now to find a good gender bender or transgender themed fic but I haven't found anything yet. Which really sucks by the way, I think a great fic could be written from Ron's point of view as he tries to come to terms with Hermione transitioning or from Harry's point of view when a magical genderbending potion changes his body to female but leaves his mind male but I guess a girl can only dream.

These fics drive me crazy because they so often turn him into the most stereotypical teenage girl imaginable. A magical accident turns him into a girl and suddenly he's crazy about boys and shopping. I don't think I've ever read one where he experienced any trauma over it.

I really like the idea of the fic from Ron's POV with Hermione transitioning, though maybe an alternating POV for contrasting perspectives?

** Present! Every couple of years I get really invested in trying to figure out what's left of the HP fandom, and this most recent jag landed me on this subreddit, which has been a pleasure. I read and write H/Hr (or gen) almost exclusively, though I was a lurker through most of the shipping wars, and I'm not really interested in seeing any more sex than canon was interested in showing me, so there is a very finite pool of fanfiction for me out there, but it's fun while it lasts.

linkffn(A Serpent's Sacrifice by Gabilian) was the first novel-length fic I read after the series ended and I started getting back into it---I think I'd landed on HPFF, for whatever reason, rather than FFN, and it's wider read there. Full Pensieve's [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net][two huge pre-DH fics]] got me into the habit for good.

Whenever that fanfic kick happens I start working on a novella about a coup at the Wizarding UN, which has moldered totally abandoned on my profile for a while now. This time---probably because of all the activity here---I've made a ton of progress, which I hope to upload once it's finally done.

Other than that, I've written some goofy little one-shots. linkffn(The Grunnings Man by halffareprince) is about Vernon trying to sell Hermione's parents some drills, and At Neville's Reception is not about Vernon trying to sell Hermione's parents some drills.

Is anybody else on a weird schedule like me? It seems like every other year I get on a fanfic jag that lasts for months and literally disrupts my sleep, and in between those times I think about it maybe once a month.

'Disapparate' is the term for a departing teleport from the 3rd book onward, both in narration and in dialogue. You may write it otherwise, but the term is valid, much like deceleration is specifically an acceleration involving a reduction of speed.

** Hi, I'm [[/u/canaki17]]. I usually go by 17n or canaki, or a mixture of some sort with added under-bars and hyphens.

I got this account because I wanted to participate in [[/r/HPfanfiction]], and as I've only been reading HP fanfic for a little over a year, I'm really new to reddit. Please let me know if I make any mistakes!

While I have some ideas floating, I lack patience and confidence to actually write anything. English is difficult. I'm from Japan, so finding lots of crossovers with anime/manga was an unexpected surprise.

My favorite character is Tom Riddle, including Lord Voldemort and his merry band of horcruxes, because I find it interesting to think why did he do the things he did in canon, how it could have been prevented, and how he could've been happier. I ship Harrymort because I think Harry has the best chance of succeeding in helping him.

I'll recommend linkffn(Little Differences by Theta Serpentis; In Somno Veritas by Ansketil and Lilacs; Their Verdict of Vagaries; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus)

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

** Hello everyone, I'm [[/u/TheGeneralStarfox]], on FFN i'm TonyThePony (both names are equally bad so I couldn't decide which to use).

I love one-shots, they're definitely my favourite type of fanfic (my favourite being linkffn(Allure Immune Harry), because I kinda like Harry/Fleur just because there's so much possibility there - they have literally no canoninical basing so you can do whatever you want and there characters are my my favourite.

My favourite thing in fanfiction is when the magic is described vividly - like linkffn(Magics Of The Arcane) - I love massive displays of magic that make me feel a sense of awe. I prefer fanfiction where Hermione's role is played to a minimum ( I feel it leads to rather lazy writing where all problems are solved by her 'genius' and Harry is reduced to some Gary Stu piece of shit character). My favourite character is Dumbledore.

I also read a lot of Pokemon and Elder Scrolls fanfic, which I would wholeheartedly recommend.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.

** [[/u/naraclan31fuzzy]] here. I've been reading since around 2008 but I keep putting off the writing part. Most of my favorite stories have already been posted, but I haven't seen linkffn(8262940) yet.

My favorite characters are probably the Weasley twins and although it was one of the least faithful adaptations imo my favorite book and movie is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fv02JVCloo][Half Blood Prince]]

** Morning all, [[/u/aidenk77]] here.

I've been writing fanfiction for around five years, started out on HPFF before switching to FF.net. I'm a harmonian, though not the militant type, it's just one of those things that I like.

I'm a Royal Navy veteran, having served sixteen years in submarines, I turned to writing to help with being away from my family. I now undertake similar work (heavy marine engineering) but as a civilian contractor in the same dockyard.

I'm an avid Terry Pratchett fan, Night Watch being my favourite book.

** Hello, I'm [[/u/damnyouall2hell]], I've been reading fanfiction for about 4-5 years now ( I used to read it on my PSP).

My favourite story is a xover between Elder scrolls and Inheritance cycle called Dragons.

Favourite book is Crusade in jeans by Thea Beckman.

Edit: oh! And my favourite character in HP is Tonks because Tonks, but that said, favourite character in HP fanfiction is probably Harry himself because he's practically a skin suit.

** I am mostly a lurker on this sub as well as on most fanfiction sites. I don't have profiles on any of them so even if I leave a comment or review, I'll do it anonymously. I am not native to the English language, so I haven't dared writing fics so far, although I think I'd like to.

I am not sure if that counts as "actually here", haha.
