:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm wracking my brain trying to remember this goddamn fanfic. It started in the triwizard tournament, I believe. Harry had a sister that discovered that Harry would unlock the Sharingan at some point, so the potters abandoned him and put him in Azkaban or something like that in order to unlock it. I remember it had a very Cadmean Victory vibe to it, Harry constantly having one liners about how he'd never forgive or something like that.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.

*** Pretty certain it's this. ---spoilers for like chapters 1 and 2-- Basically they needed a weapon and had enough knowledge collected from fragments of history to figure out how to awaken the Sharingan, send Harry to azkaban in like 5th year, and torture him daily until he gets the sharingan, then give him the eyes of his ancestor so he has the EMS. After being let out, he talks (read: yells) at Dumbledore, and then James walks in.

His sister is iirc a year older then him and a prodigy from Buexbatons, and she fights in a war effort while Harry is off angsting and having sex with the spirit of his ancestor.

At some point later it crosses over with Dresden Files.

*** Yeah, I vaguely remember him having a sister that was probably attracted to him, and an ancestor who he was in a relationship with in his mind? I dunno, I just need to find this damn fic so I can stop thinking about it.

  Harry Potter, thought a squib and dead after being abandoned by the Potters at five, is back. No longer under anybody's thumb, and wielding the Eternal Mangeky≈ç Sharingan, watch as he blows the wizarding world away. Full summary inside. WARNING: INCEST!
