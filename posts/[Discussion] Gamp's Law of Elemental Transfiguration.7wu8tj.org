I've heard plenty of speculation about the Exceptions, but what's the actual Law? Any clues?


** "It is magically possible to Transfigure anything into anything" [except for blahblahblah], presumably. It sounds dopey when one puts it like that, but I presume Gamp's breakthrough wasn't so much that he came up with that oh-so-inspired concept, as it was providing theoretical /proof/ of it.

*** Yeah, since the exceptions state what you can't transfigure, the rule presumably states what you can transfigure - everything except the exceptions.

That said, it probably also defines the scope of transfiguration - there are probably things that you can't transfigure which aren't in an exception simply because they're not within the scope of transfiguration, like souls, magic itself, etc. - non-physical things.

So Gamp's law probably states something like "It's possible to transfigure any element into any other element". Probably the understanding of "element" is not the same as Muggle chemistry though.

Probably.

Basically the same thing.

** Also, what's with /Elemental/ Transfiguration? Is there some other type?

*** Elemental can mean "basic" or "fundamental" as well as "relating to the elements". As in "Elemental, my dear Watson". Could be either. Though even if the latter, we can't be sure what system of elements it refers to.

**** True, but why does it say that? Is there a different Law for Advanced Transfiguration?

No matter what kind of system of elements is used, if it encompasses everything (as most elemental systems usually do), specifying Elemental Transfiguration is redundant - it could just as well be Gamp's Law of Transfiguration. As such I suspect the Law concerns only a subset of Transfiguration, albeit a large subset.

No? The idea of something fundamental/basic is that it underpins all the more advanced stuff, like the foundations of a building.

***** I imagine elemental in this case is like fundamental in the fundamental theorem of calculus. Its the backbone rule that everything else is built off of.

** Some people have suggested that money might be another exception. After all, Leprechaun gold disappears and the Philosopher's Stone's ability to create gold is supposed be really special. And if it were as easy as transfiguring stuff into money, or inxreasing the amount of money, there wouldn't be poverty.

And I think another exception may be life. That if you transfigure something inanimate into an animal, it isn't truly alive.

And of course the law itself has already been explained here in other comments.
