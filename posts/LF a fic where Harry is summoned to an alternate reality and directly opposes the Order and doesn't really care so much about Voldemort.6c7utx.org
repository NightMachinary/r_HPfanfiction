I'm looking for something where he's summoned from his reality where he defeated Voldemort by Dumbledore or the Order or something and he wants revenge on them, not Voldemort.

I've read a couple that have this sort of theme, but Harry usually get's over his annoyance with the Order after a couple minutes. The closest fic I've seen to what I'm looking for would be linkffn(Fav0800-Rent-A-Hero) where Harry is summoned by the Order and pretty much hates them, but still uses his knowledge to hinder Voldemort like giving the DMLE information on attacks and Death Eaters, as well as destroying a Horcrux or two. So even here he doesn't oppose the Order, he just specifically makes it a point to let them know that he doesn't like them while he still goes around trying to stop Voldemort.

I suppose a story with "evil" Harry might fit, though I've never read one of those before. To be honest I'd be a little surprised if a story that I'm asking for exists, so I'd take a good "evil" or "dark" Harry story that you got as well. But I'd want him to have good motivation for being that way at least.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another!

***** Thanks, sounds pretty interesting I might pick it up since it's getting frequent updates, though I'm usually apprehensive about starting an uncompleted story.

I'm curious though, it sounds like you're hinting at Harry is mainly at odds with Dumbledore. While that is definitely part of what I want, I was looking more specifically like he didn't like most of the Order. Is that how it is? It's just that in like 90% of time travel or reality jumping fics, Dumbledore is as much of an obstacle/enemy to Harry as is. So if that were my criteria for a fic then it would garner a large number of responses.
