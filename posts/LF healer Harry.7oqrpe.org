  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11186055/1/To-Soothe-The-Soul][To Soothe The Soul]] by Halfway To Reality is a HP and MCU crossover. But Harry is a healer in this one and George is along for a trip to America. It starts off with Tony's PTSD nightmare in first person POV, but the rest of the fic is really third person POV.

  Honestly, if Harry had told them once he had told them a million times to keep their stupid experiments in space and time out of the areas that the general public was likely to tread. My shot at the dimension traveling plot. Mostly DH compliant. Complete!

  Words have more power than we think. Thoughts & dreams can be revealed to those closest to us, to those we want to know more of, & to our greatest enemies. A single act of kindness, a single word can change someone's entire world. Join Harry on another adventure through his time at Hogwarts where even the quietest whispers can make a difference. Harry/Multi. Mature for a reason.

** There's one with Harry in a harem starting with Susan and Daphne. The story was average but went for a little while. I don't know if it is still updating as I don't think I could get through it all. Harry apprentices to Pomfrey though so it is a healer fic.

****** Hence why I said it was average. Some may love it to pieces, some may hate it - to me it was average. Unless the characters are relatable in some way, I rate it average as I think the author could have worked on character development more. We all read and write fan fiction for different reasons though so, as you said, to each his own. :-)

** Why not just write, or read, about a different character? To become a healer, he'd need a drastic change in temperament, personality, and values.
