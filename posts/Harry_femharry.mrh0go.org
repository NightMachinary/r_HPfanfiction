:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where harry travels into an alternant universe where the female version of himself (I think her name was rose) looked Like Lily and He had to pretend to be her cousin, but eventually she finds out the truth and the end up as a couple (?) and they have portraits of james and lily done so they can talk to them.

I also remember at one point, he helps her get to a normal weight and gives her a makeover. So, when go to hogsmead together, hagrid thought they were the ghosts of James and Lily or something like that.


** That sounds like REALLY advanced masturbation.

Harry, dude, I know they say you have to love yourself, but not like that.

***** well, they explain in the story that they are not genetically siblings, and they dont think of themselves as siblings because they have different DNA or something like that idk. They also explain it as that they are the same person from an alternant universe, not siblings. so its alright. Idk it's been a while since I read it and I randomlly remembered it today so i guess I'll have to reread it to see for myself
