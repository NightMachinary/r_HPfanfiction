It's common fanon that when a Muggleborn get's picked for Hogwarts they send a teacher to explain the situation. Well, what if when Hermione gets picked, they send in Trelawney to explain the situation? The result leads to Trelawney "sensing" the Inner Eye within a Hermione that's completely blind to the world of magic, leading Hermione to pick up every book on "real" magic she can find (as in Divination, Arithmancy, Numerology, and Palmistry), and, convinced in the whole thing, is determined to find the, for lack of a better term, science behind Divination as she seeks to focus her Inner Eye.


** If she in convinced it is real, then she is very likely to find "proof" that it is real. Hermione makes thirty predictions, one comes true, and then ignore all the ones that didn't. It's nothing against Hermione, but I don't think part of her skill set at eleven was skepticism especially when she learned it was all real along with magic.

I always hit the bullseye playing darts if you ignore atlll the times I don't hit bullseye. Another common trick is throwing the dart and then drawing the bullseye around it.

*** That's exactly what Trewalney did in PoA : "What you fear will happen the 16th of October". Unless Lavender passed had the most perfect day ever (so full of Felix Felicis), anything even remotedly bad that would have happened that day would have fit the prediction, from Broken Nail to bad grade. By doing very vague prediction, you don't even have to draw the bullseye around it, the client will do it himself.

That also works with the prediction made to Parvati "Beware the red haided man". Considering the school is British, we can suppose there is not a shortage of red heads, but even with the Weasleys alone you had 4 red heads just in her house. Some people say the prediction worked because of how Ron treated Padma during Yull Ball (more than a year later), but with how vague it was, anything would have fitted from Ron puting his foot in his mouth to a bad Prank of the twin, even Head Boy Percy berating her for something she did worked.\\
It's like saying "It will rain" in the future and acting all proud when it does.

**** That's one of the issues with prophecies.*/You need a time limit./* Basically anything is possible if given enough time. Saying that there will be a tornado landing on that exact spot is an impressive prediction unless it doesn't happen for 300 years at which point it would have began to be unlikely that it wouldn't happen.

A prophecy must be precise, have a time limit, be unguided, and be significant. I'll explain why in that order.

- It isn't a prophecy if I say that sometime somewhere someone will do something. That's guaranteed to happen and is so vague that anything that happens can be called fulfilling prophecy.

- It isn't a prophecy if my predicted event doesn't come true for centuries when I never gave a time limit. Improbable things aren't improbable if given enough time.

- Unguided means that people aren't actively trying to perform it. This is also intertwined with self-fulfilling prophecy. People are actively trying to make the prophecy true which makes it trivial if said people make the prophecy come true.

- It also isn't a prophecy if I order a medium rare steak in twenty minutes and my waiter brings me a steak. That's a completely mundane thing. Sure, it was specific and on a time limit, but it was so normal that it isn't a prophecy. It is also a bit of a guided one as the waiter was actively trying to fulfil it.

** I can imagine a scenario like that. I can also imagine Trelawney's face when Hermione actually discovers how to "open the Inner Eye" and actually starts making accurate predictions consistently.
