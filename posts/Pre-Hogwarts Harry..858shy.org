Could someone please point me towards a community, or stories where it starts a couple years before Hogwarts, and he's discovered his magic earlier, and experiments with it like Riddle did, or he has discovered some other skill like chakra, telepathy, telekinesis, animagus, etc... After he could either run away from home, or make the Dursleys behave, or anything.

I don't mind if there's bashing in it as well. I've learned not to be picky, and understand that i've missed out on some good stories just because there was bashing in it. 30k+ words, or complete please.

I'll start first, this story has a very unique concept, and takes place almost completely before Hogwarts. If you remember reading Libromancy, and enjoyed it, then you'll definetly enjoy this story.

Thanks,

Warryn.


** Funny, I've started writing a fanfic like what you're requesting, "Break the Limits". Harry discovered he had magic and began to build it up over like 8 months before using it to run away and live on the streets in the years before Hogwarts (note: I'm only a couple of chapters in so far, life has been fucking with me lately):

No bashing planned though. Few people can write stories with bashing that don't A) Go over the top B) Be even more unreasonable than canon was or C) That doesn't make me want to drop the fic.

*** What I meant by that was, I don't mind bashing, but i'd prefer if there is none. There are certain stories where I enjoy bashing(like Naruto, some of those characters honestly deserve it in my opinion), and while Dumbledore is suspect, and I never really liked Snape, most of the time I rather a story without it.

I'll also take a look at your story since it looks interesting. Is there any way I can convince you to bring out more chapters. I can help beta any future chapters you write.

Thanks,

Warryn.

**** I can handle bashing, I just prefer it when characters face consequences for their actions and behavior through the course of events in the story more so than the reader being told how bad they are. Like Naruto fanfics where Sasuke tries to come back to Konoha after killing Itachi, and is summarily thrown in jail for endangering his comrades and trying to kill Naruto. Probably because I read so many bash fics when I started reading fan fiction, lol.

I've a chapter that's mostly done right now. I planned on continuing it, it's just that decent free time is a bit hard to find right now. Would you like me to PM you a link to the Google Doc later? I've been in need of a beta, so your help would be much appreciated (especially in, er, Britishizing things if possible, hehe).

***** Sure. I'll help where I can, and I know what you mean, all I read was bash fics for the first few months.

Thanks,

Warryn.
