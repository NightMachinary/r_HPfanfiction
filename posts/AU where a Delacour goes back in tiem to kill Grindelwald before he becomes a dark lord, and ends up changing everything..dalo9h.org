:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was on FFN. Harry/Hermione. It was a fourth-year fic if I remember correctly. The Potters were alive and Arcturus Black, after he died, left the title of Lord Black to Harry. Harry gets flashes of hic canon life. Grindelwald was still alive and I think it was because he had a Horcrux. Tom Riddle was MInister for Magic, and under his government, muggleborns are forbidden from attending Hogwarts (I'm not too sure about this one), though, he eventually comes out as a Dark Lord and now there's two. Harry pulled off a Thestral Patronus when under his cloak. The Delacours were living with the Potters, I think, after France was attacked by Grindelwald. The Delacour who went back in time gave Ariana Dumbledore a pendant that belonged to his wife (who I believe Grindelwald killed) that allowed her to control her magic and she became the healer at Hogwarts during Harry's time. Credence was somehow displaced from the time flow because his destiny was intertwined with Grindelwald's.

Hope that's enough to go by.
