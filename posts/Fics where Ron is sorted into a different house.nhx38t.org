We see a lot of other characters being sorted into various different houses, but I've never seen a proper fic where Ron goes somewhere else. I'd love to see a bit of his experience/the fallout of being sorted somewhere other than family tradition dictates. Thanks!


** I have some Slytherin!Ron fics I liked:

There are these two I: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10352232][To Those with Cunning and Ambition]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5421695?view_full_work=true][Actions Speak Louder than Words]] Both are short but have a really nice take on Slytherin Ron.

Then there is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16525733][A Darker Shade of Red]] which is also short but quite dark and really well written.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7467796/1/Choices][Choices]] is longer and still WIP. It get's updated slowly (WIP since 2011) but it get's updated.

** In linkao3(18608212) he's sorted into Hufflepuff. Which apparently is common enough that "Hufflepuff Ron Weasley" has 61 tagged stories on AO3. But too my knowledge, it's the only one where his initial reaction is to complain he's been sorted into "Dufferpuff".

#+begin_quote
  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.
