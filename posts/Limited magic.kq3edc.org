You know how every super!Harry starts with dismissing all magic taught at Hogwarts, pulls out some forgotten grimoire and starts using much more powerful long forgotten spells nobody else knows?

What if it was just the opposite? What if the spells taught in the regular courses at Hogwarts are it? (Let us ignore the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries)


** One of the things that always bothered me about the whole HP universe, is that there don't seem to be any rules when it comes to the magic system.

It often feels like, if you can formulate something in Latin, you're good to go. In my own fic, I tightened it a bit. For example, Apparation takes skill, and huge amount of concentration. No one's going to Apparate while fighting. It's too easy, in my opinion.

*** One of the things most fanfiction writers overlook is this dialogue statement by Mr Weasley (emphasis mine):

#+begin_quote
  “Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. “But they got a heavy fine, and I don't think they'll be trying it again in a hurry. You don't mess around with Apparition. /There are plenty of adult wizards who don't bother with it./ Prefer brooms --- slower, but safer.” (HP&GoF, chapter 5 “Portkey”)
#+end_quote

In most fanfiction stories, apparition is something so simple that basically everybody manages to do that (including fifth-year Harry in many cases). If it was so simple why would the main way how people get to work at Ministry use Floo? Why would there be Portkeys at all?

**** Absolutely. But in my fic, in regards to the Ministry, I decided it was a security thing. You can't Apparate into the Ministry, and there are only the Floo entrances at the Atrium, and one in the Minister's office. And of course, the phone booth.

Ministry employees have a clearance, and their Floo is connected to the Atrium.

This is canon, btw. Destination, Determination, Deliberation. The three Ds.

**** DDD yes, but Dumbledore and Riddle are Apparating all over the place when they're fighting. I don't care who it is, you're going to leaving some things behind, if you're doing something else while getting ready for Apparation...

** ...I wouldn't say /every/ Super!Harry was like that. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2030536][Harry of El]] series does have him use some magic no-one else knows, but it has some very hard limits (just over 11,000 possible highly-defined spells with multiple spells that are hazardous/suicidal to cast) compared to the far less rigid Wand-casting (an almost infinite spell library with the spells themselves being very mutable).

However, to answer properly, if the Hogwarts Curriculum is /it/ for spells (any new spells getting added as soon as they are created/formalized) then the emphasis shifts to /how/ a spell is used. A soapy-suds creation spell could be used to blind an enemy or make them slip up. Spell combinations would also be far more important (summoning coal dust, then sparking a flame to create a huge explosion) as well as timing (a small banishing charm when the target is at the top of a staircase can do far more damage than one when the target is in the middle of a huge, empty room).

The problem here is that as the application of imagination becomes more important than spells no-one can counter, it means that many characters will get buffed/nerfed. Hermione would be seriously nerfed (at least, at first) as she is all about knowing everything, but not always thinking it through (S.P.E.W...). Ron would get a boost as his chess skills indicate that he is used to thinking tactically, looking to loopholes/exploits and timing things carefully for maximum effect.

Then on an out-of-universe issue, you have the writers. Being able to introduce long-forgotten spells is far easier to do than making spreadsheets of potential spell interactions and/or augmentations since people will pounce on any breaking of the system or changing of previously-established canon.

It's a great idea, but one that would take a great writer to actually put into practice and while I may be adequate, I am not that good.

** My default setting is that magic advances. Spells used by the Founders have long since become obsolete for the most part.

** What actually bothers me when it comes to magic in most fics is that the /Protego/ charm seems to be able to block any spell that is not Unforgivable. In most cases it doesn't matter if Harry or any character is using simple /Stupify/ or some seemingly powerful 'dark' curses, all of them are blocked by this damn Shield Charm.

But yeah, I like the idea that magic is constantly being developed, but there is a limit to what they teach in schools. I can certainly see the appeal of having your character find a spellbook related strictly to battle magic that is not taught at Hogwarts.
