Blatantly inspired by the Ginny/Harry incent thread by [[/u/Bleepbloopbotz2][u/Bleepbloopbotz2]]... and in particular [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jl062a/harry_dating_ginny_is_incestuous_because_she_has/gan56zi/][this conversation.]]

Obviously the basis for the trope is Sirius' line:

#+begin_quote
  The pure-blood families are all interrelated. If you're only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left.
#+end_quote

And, of course, the Gaunts.

Mind you, I'm not sure how prevalent the "purebloods are all related" concept is in fanfics but [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Inbreeding][HP Wiki has an entire article on inbreeding]] in it, so there is that at least. Similarly, you do get people who pick up on certain (canon-ish) relationships like Teddy and Victoire... e.g. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/ex77wq/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_ending_of_the_series/fg6plpr/][here]].

The point I'm making is that people probably exaggerate both the degree of inbreeding (outside the Blacks and, especially, the Gaunts) and consequently the level of relationship between characters. After all, it is sufficient to say that the Potters and Blacks are related because Charlus, but as far as we know Charlus and Harry aren't lineal relatives. What that means is that Harry isn't actually related to any of the Blacks because only Charlus' lineal relatives would be. (And, also, any standard descent system with Dorea and Charlus, instead of Fleamont and Euphemia, would have Teddy as the Head of the House Black or whatever BS before Harry since Teddy's got more recent male-line ancestry.)

Here's a thought exercise for you... how many of your second, third, fourth, fifth and so on cousins do you know? How many have you met? Would you consider yourself overly closely related to even your second cousins? Oh, and if you go and research your family tree to figure out who these cousins are and discover you're related to a current or present intimate partner... don't worry... [[https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170668-Average-percent-DNA-shared-between-relatives][even first cousins are pretty distant relatives.]] Similarly, you need repeated related parent events to get to a point where inbreeding is any more problematic than, for example, old parents.

Now, that being said, Sirius does specifically point out that he and Molly are related by marriage so we can assume that Sirius includes non-lineal /and/ non-genetic connections in his thought process. Of course, Sirius and Dorea aren't that distantly related... she's his grandfather's sister, so great-aunt (I know a lot of my great aunts, for example)... so if James and Harry were lineally related to Charlus (and Charlus only had children through Dorea), they'd be more closely related to Sirius than Arthur is.

Honestly, it may be harder to articulate how everyone is mutually interrelated given the known sizes of the Black and Weasley family trees unless we lean heavily into the marriage thing (which thus allows the Blacks, Lestranges and Malfoys to all be connected through a single, albeit childless, marriage). Obviously, though, it does depend on what you recognise as being canon... from a "declared canon" perspective Charlus and Dorea aren't Harry grandparents, but if you take a book only approach... they could be and Sirius conceals the closeness of his relationship to Harry for some unknown reason (that your fanfic will presumably explore).

Related... [[https://medium.com/@Frameworkisdigimon/sort-of-a-harry-potter-fanfic-4327e9e0a821][shameless promotion of my pre-Harry Potter family headcanon.]] It takes a HP Wiki information is canonical... unless it's clearly (not probably or possibly but clearly) from the films... and tries to reconcile both "Harry isn't related to anyone" with "all the purebloods are interrelated".


** The issue is the small population of purebloods, intermarrying for centuries. A small population has to have a lot of inbreeding in it, even if they don't keep track of the details of exactly how related they are.

Sure, to us muggles, who've generally been in very large populations for a long time, we're not that closely related to our second cousins etc, because our relatives have been marrying people we're not related to. In magical Britain, our distant cousins have had no one to marry but our other distant cousins (if they wanted to keep their blood pure.) The inbreeding adds up.

** As a note, my Covid summer project was tracing my family's history on Ancestry. I gave up quickly after roadblocks (thanks WWII) and decided to make the Black family tree (using Pottermore) as reference instead. Much more fun!

From there, using the information on the Potter, Malfoy, and Lestrange and Weasley pages, I was able to build family trees and really see how interrelated everyone is.

In terms of incest - it really depends how close were talking about here. Orion and Walburga Black are first cousins (their grandparents are siblings); the Leatranges canonically have a case where two Lestrange brothers married two sisters (Trembley or Falco, I'd have to check).

Using the software I have, I do get duplicates in the Weasley, Black, Lestrange lines because of the Black family having 4+ children pre-1900 and their marriages with other family lines.

But other than that, there's very little /Game of Thrones/ style incest. Is Harry related to the Weasley's? Yes. But as maybe third or fourth cousins to Arthur, if at that, and depending how loosey-goosey you want to get with potential bloodlines and canon marriages.

Now, in terms of my own head canons and as reference for writing, *hells yeah* I made the families related! Daphne, Astoria and Pansy are cousins; Millicent's mom is a Flint, so she's related to Marcus distantly; I even researched where double-hyphenated names came from to create Hermione's line. But, that's for me now and I'm enjoying figuring out family names and creating a bit more of a diverse "cast". ðŸ˜‚

And despite all that... Everyone's still distantly related enough that my duplicated lines are still limited to the Blacks, Leatranges, and Weasley's.

** It is true that the entire pureblood population is related distantly. Even James and Draco are related (through the house of Black). But unless you're talking Gaunt-level inbreeding, or first cousins marrying each other (Orion and Walburga), it is very distant.

Or maybe that's just me trying to justify shipping Sirius with another pureblood.

** What is wrong with this sub lately?

Possible fourth cousins marrying is incest, reading stories about a teenager over the age of consent having sex makes you a pedophile, not liking Harry/Snape makes you a bigot...

I'm guessing that next week someone will be arguing that having sex with an animagus in human form is beastiality.

The problem is that unlike Muggle humanity the Wizarding community has a lower total variability in genetics - simply because there are so few of them. In normal humans even first cousins is not a problem until done repeatedly.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

That debate was over explicit sexual descriptions in fanfictions and hoooly hell there's a /lot/ of these. These are officially banned by this sub's rules anyway, and if some "think of the children" politicians have their way it is possible this kind of story gets banned by law in Germany soon-ish. Legally, this is a fucking hot bed to lie in.

Besides: I can... understand kids at 13+ doing sexual ... experiments. Okay, fine with me. But second years (12y old) engaging in fetish? Decades old teachers having sex with third years? Somewhere lines have to be drawn.

At least there we are of the same opinion.

Interesting question... what was that with Abe Dumbledore and the sheep?

** I would say that they're fairly interrelated, but possibly not quite to the level of European Royalty and Nobility.

** I mean you say â€˜outside of the Blacks' but off the top of my head just in the last generation the Blacks are related to the Crouches, Crabbes, Rosiers, Weasleys, Prewetts, and Longbottoms...

I think one of the issues the grandmothers of Magical Britain would be concerned about here isn't necessarily the moral issue of incest as the health issues that might start to happen after the population was thinned so significantly by the two major wars in the same century. Whole families were wiped out, and it would at the very least be cause for getting a little organised, a little like the matchmaking women I hear are commonplace in Jewish communities. The problem is the pureblood don't seem to care about making sure they don't breed too close to avoid issues like Astoria Greengrass' blood curse etc

I honestly don't think it would be too bad if they didn't seem so xenophobic about marrying people from outside Britain but it seems that isn't encouraged...it makes me wonder if events like the triwizard tournament was actually in place so that young people would meet others from different gene pools. I went to a Dutch Reformed school (which was wild, I assure you) and found out that they have this thing they call a â€˜convention' where young people do just that, though it was only people coming from all over Australia

but anyway I agree that true incest seems quite rare and mostly a joke people say. I'm sure that Orion and Walburga's marriage would have actually caused quite a scandal, and that the Gaunts would be seen as a tragedy, and an example of something to avoid
