#+begin_quote
  Edith Potter's life with her abusive family taught her two things. First - the only language some people understood was violence. Second - fear only lasts a generation; kindness lasts forever. The Girl Who Lived returns to magical Britain a cynical visionary; drawing in allies from all four houses for an end game neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort anticipated. Dark!Fem!Harry
