I want a brutal fic with the main thing being war, whether it's Harry summoned to different world by the order and gleefully proceeding to slaughter Voldemorts forces and moving on, or like in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13426392/1/Raven][Raven by justbored21]] where he refers to himself as a weapon.


** Linkffn(What we're Fighting For by James Spookie) enjoy!

** This is a post-Battle of Hogwarts Harry and it gets pretty gritty. I enjoyed it. Canon compliant, mostly. It's lengthy and there's a sequel as well.

  Deep within the Department of Mysteries, a clandestine unit dedicates itself to the destruction of Voldemort's surviving forces in the aftermath of the Wizarding War. This group, lead by Harry Potter, does not officially exist. But for those who fight the darkness that threatens to engulf their world, it has a name, heard only in the shadows: Operation Wrath of Merlin.

  Harry Potter, master of death, finds himself in another world. He attracts the attention of Nick Fury and shield. Harry can't help but think of this as an opportunity, after all, a weapon needs something to aim at.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

***** "Emperor" was spelled wrong, and I think Learning to Breathe might have been a generic title that was too hard for the bot to figure out which one to link. That's why it's easier to use the fic's id number.
