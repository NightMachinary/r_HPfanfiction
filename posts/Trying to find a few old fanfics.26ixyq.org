Hi everyone; I'm trying to find a few oldies; one is where Voldemort wakes up billions of years in the future and his wand is embedded in a Perspex type thing, and the other is an old one (circa 2004? ' 05?) where Cho tries to kill Hermione (it's a H/Hr ship) but fails because she didn't mean it properly. Been looking for these for a while, thanks a lot guys!
