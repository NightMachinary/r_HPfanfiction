So I've only ever used Fanfiction.net and I'm starting to struggle to find stories to my taste so I was wondering what other sites are good places to find HP Fanfiction? :)


** On the sidebar is a list of numerous fanfiction sites.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/]]

In addition, do not forget fictionhunt.org, an unofficial archive backup site for fanfiction.net. Some of the stories here are /not/ found on fanfiction.net anymore.

**** No offense, but I love it when people forget the sidebar answers quite a few questions.

Here's the links and Bot userage.

BOT USAGE

Fanfiction.net - linkffn(...) Archive of Our Own - linkao3(...) HP Fanfic Archive - linkffa(...) Fictionpress - linkfp(...) Adult FanFiction - linkaff(story URL only) Linking by fic title will usually work (eg. linkffn(Emperor)), using fic title and author (eg. linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black)) will almost always work, linking by fic ID or URL (eg. linkffn(5904185)) will always work. Link multiple fics by using semicolons: linkffn(Emperor; Wit of the Raven) Edited your comment? Bot reply not there? Reply to it with ffnbot!refresh to re-link fics. Want to recommend a thread? linksub(thread_id) or linksub(thread_url) (works with hyperlinks, too!) Bot replies too long? Recommending many fics? Add ffnbot!slim to your comment for more compact bot replies. EXTENDED BOT USAGE GUIDE
