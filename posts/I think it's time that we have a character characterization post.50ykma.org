As I've read fanfiction, my knowledge of canon has grown and become a little skewed, so to help combat that for everybody, without re-reading canon, we can set up a thread for canon characterizations for all the important characters.

Frankly, I have completely forgotten how Harry Potter is actually supposed to act after reading an innumerable amount of fics featuring an OC who is named Harry Potter. Also for those who have issues with Canon, this makes it easy to find proper characterizations without re-reading.

I'm gonna comment the names of the main characters, feel free to reply to them with what you feel is the canon characterization of that character. Also feel free to add any character you want, but first comment with their name only before replying with a characterization.

Tl;dr I want to set up a one-stop-shop for canon characterizations.

*** I'm going to specifically focus on those characteristics which Harry possesses in canon which I feel could be highlighted in a fic that seeks to make Harry strong/talented/pro-active but do so without rewriting his character.

- Learning through doing, practice and experimentation. Harry can master some very advanced, powerful magic when he learns it in this way. One example is the Patronus charm, another is his apparent mastery of occlumency in DH.

- Learning motivated by necessity. Harry learns best when he needs to know how to do something. He's also motivated to a lesser extent by competitiveness (e.g. against Malfoy)

- Determination. Enough said.

- Curiosity. Harry is curious about things, even if it doesn't manifest in the same way as Hermione's curiosity. But he does like to know things, often sticking his nose where it doesn't belong, and will often go to great investigative lengths to satisfy his curiosity once it's been roused.

- Intuitive deduction. Harry is great in canon at solving mysteries by making intuitive deductive leaps. He's like a mini Sherlock Holmes.

The only thing we might get less of is plot, and I'd like to think she's a good enough writer to get the balance right.

*** Harry is the character most writers like to experiment with. So we get everything from passive!weak!whinny!loser!Harry to saint!Harry to super!Harry to DarkLord!Harry to SerialKiller!Harry.

My favorite Harry is canon Harry growing up in a much better family. It can be good Dursleys, Sirius, Grangers, Tonks, or anyone who gave him a nice childhood. Harry's situation already warrants enough sympathy without subjecting him to further childhood abuses. In fact, abused children are more likely to end up like Tom Riddle than the all-loving canon Harry. Also, losing his loving adoptive family later could probably generate more drama for the story and sympathy for him.

*** I will comment on an often overlooked part of Ginny's character: her frustration with her position in her family. The over-protectiveness of her parents and brothers, and later even that of her boyfriend, is something Ginny's had to fight against all her life. Her brothers prevent her from playing Quidditch; Ginny sneaks out at night and learns to fly, and later becomes a professional player. She is the only one not allowed to listen to Sirius's explanation to Harry about the war; she gets the necessary info from Hermione. Ron doesn't like her dating at all; she dates three boys and generally gives no fucks about what Ron thinks of it. Harry doesn't want her to go the the DoM because she's too young; she goes anyway. Harry persuades her to stay 'safe' at Hogwarts; she leads the mutiny against the Carrows. Her parents don't want her to fight at the Final Battle; she ends up participating in pretty much the entire fight. The futility of everyone trying to keep someone safe during war, especially someone with as much of an independent streak as Ginny, is a theme I find really interesting.

This is also the core reason for her dislike of Fleur. From HBP: /“It's the way she talks to me... you'd think I was about three!”/ Ginny absolutely hates being seen as a child. Fleur's condescension gets on Ginny's last nerve, and she is in turn less than subtle about her dislike of Fleur. Ginny also disapproves of Fleur's marriage to Bill: Bill is "hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person", while Fleur is "a cow". She is proved wrong about the last part and finally accepts that they're getting married after Fleur demonstrates her love at the end of HBP. She later stands as bridesmaid for the wedding.

It also puts her position in the family in an interesting contrast with that that of Ron's. The Horcrux's words to Ron in DH: /"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter"/. Ron envies the attention Ginny gets as the youngest and the only girl, Ginny craves the freedom that could come with not being the same.

**** Great explanation, but I think she essentially created this problem for herself with her actions in earlier books, such as being incapable of even talking to Harry before 4th or 5th year, and being possessed by the diary. A family would certainly be overprotective of what they see for a few years as a shy, vulnerable young girl, especially when she only seems to get this determination in 5th year, when things really start escalating.

Even when she still has a crush - although admittedly, at this point it's subsiding - she won't hesitate to tell Harry and Ron to stop laughing at Neville with regard to the Yule Ball.

***** Definitely misdirecting, Steve Kloves had his own agenda that he would have put in place regardless of who played Ginny. Kloves felt that he pretty much had the go-ahead from JKR to fuck with the canon characterizations - watch especially PoA for proof of that -, [[http://movieline.com/2011/04/19/jk-rowling-reveals-how-harry-potter-screenwriter-steve-kloves-set-her-at-ease/][after he admitted early on that his favourite character was Hermione]].

In fact I'd argue that Ginny's characterization got somewhat better in the OotP film - /precisely/ because this was the only film in which Kloves wasn't the screenwriter. Obviously nothing compared to the books, but when you're a Ginny fan, you've got to make do with whatever is given.

****** My Dad recently watched all the HP movies without any knowledge of the books. However, I showed him a fan edit of HBP, which removed a lot of the teen drama. Thus his mental picture of Ginny came out a bit closer to the books. He surmised she was a lot more fiery and possible stronger than Harry, due to her reductor curse and general awesomeness in OotP and the trope of "Ron's little sister isn't little anymore".

So yeah movieGinny in OotP was pretty interesting and had some potential.

It's such a great scene for Ginny that shows off her character, so why replace it with just Ron's side. I have to think the director and screenwriter just wanted a different type of Ginny, which I don't understand. And then I consider the added movie scene where the Burrow is attacked. They show Harry going after Bellatrix and then Ginny going to help Harry. The writers decided there that Ginny is a badass because she wants to fight Death Eaters just like Harry. That's true, but the scene where Ginny tells off Ron is really what makes her a badass and awesome character.

She also seems to deal with Harry's brooding much better than Hermione (as is clear in the 'Sectumsempra' chapter in HBP). She was also one of the leaders of the DA (along with Luna and Neville) during her sixth year, which means that she must have recovered from her rather traumatic first year.

That's at least how I see her.

*** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4g7qoe/can_we_talk_about_percy/][This post]] from [[/r/Harrypotter][r/Harrypotter]] describes Percy's character & why he's unquestionable Gryffindor.

Comment from [[/u/lyraseven][u/lyraseven]] in the post:

#+begin_quote
  Percy is the quintessential Gryffindor. Contrary to what we might expect from following the trio so closely, most Gryffindors aren't about the showy kind of bravery, but about quietly doing what they think is right, regardless of the cost to themselves.

  The cost for Harry doing what he thought was right was risking his life, and sometimes his friends'. The cost for Percy doing what he thought was right was his family and his dignity - yet he continued anyway. He knew he got his later position out of a sad nepotism and that people wouldn't respect him for taking it, but he did he best job he could anyway. That's still bravery.

  I don't think there was an ounce of Slytherin-like ambition in Percy. Notice in his early career how enthusiastic he was about being part of legislation to standardize cauldron thickness. He didn't care that he was part of writing a law, he cared that he was part of something that would quietly save lives, regardless of the fact that no one would ever notice.

  His glee about serving the ministry wasn't about the promotions he could earn, the personal status, it was that the more responsibility he was handed the more good he could do - as he saw it. Compare to Harry who, after failing to become a prefect, seemed largely offended about the slight to his ability and achievements as opposed to disappointed that he couldn't help the younger kids understand Hogwarts, as Percy did for him.

  Percy was also one of the very few people in the Potterverse to do something which seems rather obvious: he took a third option. He put his faith in the Ministry being the right entity to investigate the existence of Voldemort, over the word of an old man who's made some very questionable choices in the past. He put his faith in the Ministry being the right entity to organize the fight against Voldemort, rather than same said old man and his zealot followers - who apparently didn't do much good last time.

  Just take a moment to realize how rare that is: someone in the Potterverse considered the Order and the Death Eaters and decided to go another way, the one hethought right. Even when his family pressured him, he still - rightfully, IMO - saw the Order as something like a cult and stuck to his principles.

Voldemort in HP canon has strategic objectives - he removes opposition and takes control of the Ministry of Magic.

Voldemort in most HP fanfiction just goes around being evil, attacking random non-strategic locations, basically just waiting around for Harry to be ready, at which point he just leads a random full-frontal assault on Hogwarts.

******** Yeah, though Canon!Voldemort's assault on Hogwarts was just as ill-advised. His attack on the Wards (especially in the movies) was a stroke of genius;

Sitting on high ground, he and hundreds of other Wizards & Witches blasted a set of 2000-year-old Wards wide open, overcoming the defenders' efforts to keep them out in a matter of minutes.

His next move, however, was blatantly stupid.

If he had continued the barrage, he would have severely weakened the defenders' morale and numbers while the rest of his Army used the massed artillery as cover for their advance. When the defending statues and most of the frontline defenders were dead thanks to a long-range /confringo/ or two to the head, that's the ideal point for him to try and waltz in through the front door. Utterly demoralised at not being able to find a Dark Wizard to fire back at and still besieged by the Dark Creatures that made it through the defending cordon, a hundred or so Death Eaters charging the already broken main gates would probably have been just enough to convince the rest of the defenders to leg it.

Instead, with the Wards down, he begins a full assault on the main entrance-which ends pretty fucking badly for him, given the number of dark creatures and followers he lost in that first assault.

The defending forces, by comparison, managed to get away with little more than a bloodied nose with not a single one of the defending professors lost to enemy fire and only a roomful of casualties-which, when compared to the Death Eaters' losses (Neville and the Bridge, Malfoy and Co, the Stone Brigade wrecking some Dark Creature shit, the entire defending student body managing to /not die/ in the face of a determined assault by a numerically and theoretically superior enemy) is laughably minimal.

Which is why it's stupid.

Voldemort was, up until that point, terrifying because of his competence. Issues with killing a scrawny under-trained teen aside, he managed to suborn the questionable elements within the Magical Ruling Class as his personal army, almost takes over the country with said personal army before dying, /comes back to fucking life/ and then finally, /finally/ takes over the country-which is when he sets the purges in motion. Up until the Battle of Hogwarts, He Wins, Period-as long as it's not Potter-related, that is. And part of that is the almost insane machinations he gets away with every time-his resurrection, the campaign to erase his origins from the history books, the sheer crazy that must have gone on during his undermining of the ministry, both entire wars where killing him would have instantly ended the conflict and yet he still fights frequently enough to cause collective brown-pantsing wherever he goes-none of these schemes are simple or easy to pull off. The triwizard tournament alone had a dozen to a hundred different failure points, not the least of which was the Greatest Auror of The Age managing to escape from his own trunk. And yet he pulls it off beautifully until the inevitable Potter Interrupt.

He was every inch the genius villain when not doing something hilariously stupid due to Potter & co.

But the Battle of Hogwarts was Voldemort's screwup.

He held a commanding position overlooking the castle. He had drawn in enough troops to subjugate a large-ish town without the use of magic. He was, additionally, the ruler of Wizarding Britain, able to command its armed forces and reinforce his own lines if casualties became too high. He had an entourage of a hundred or so of some of the finest Dark Wizards to come out of England since the fall of Albion.

And what does he do? He just assumes the Wards were it and launches a full invasion without proper consideration that maybe, just maybe, he was marching the bulk of his forces into a trap.

And it was a trap. Neville's bridge was one thing, but the /piertotum locomotor/ activated Hogwarts' secondary defences-bits of magic put in place to slow down or completely thwart an invading force. Slytherin's Basilisk was another layer of defences too, one Voldemort knew about long before he became Voldemort, so he knew that there was bound to be something nasty lying in wait for him.

Neville's Bridge loses Voldemort his army of Snatchers. The Main Entranceway completely decimates his dark creature forces. Wood's flying squad presumably either kills the giants or routs them. Hogwarts itself forces his troops to conduct a brutal room-by-room clearing of a castle full of people that consider death to be the more merciful of fates that may befall them.

By the time he comes back with Potter's corpse, the cost is steep-most of his lower-level followers are simply gone. Gone are the Snatchers, the Dark Creature armies, the lower and most of the middle rung of Death Eaters that are his to command and quite a number of his other loyal followers too.

It's even odds that, with Hogwarts attacked and a large number of students dead, Voldemort's regime may very well die because the now berserk parents kill off the entire Ministry of Magic in retaliation simply because he no longer has the numbers to defend it.

In short, due to his short-sighted order, he may not be a Dark Lord for very long afterwards no matter what the outcome. Immortality won't save you when you're buried in cement as part of a skyscraper's foundations.

ED: Yet compared to some of the more prevalent fanon Voldemort's quirks, he's the goddamn god-Emperor of Mankind in comparison.

Yes it's true he lost a lot of his followers and all but...

You know everyone is so terrified of him they are afraid to even say his name. Even after he'd been "dead" for ten years. So I think after he'd killed the last hope for his opponents (Potter) he would have just *won*. Despite all else.

*** Voldemort, or Tom Riddle, is defined by fear. He grew up in the Great Depression in the 20s, 30s and 40s. His young adult life was during the Second World War. During the majority of that time, he was in an orphanage or a private school, two extreme contracts. From the time he was in the orphanage until the age of 9ish, he was bullied mercilessly, and in likelyhood failed to have the same amount of food as the other children due to it. Most bullying in orphanages occurs during meal times, and result in the bullied having less to eat. Riddle would swiftly learn that power equated to who lived, and who lived WELL. We see that when Dumbledore found him, he was not skinny, which does not equate to the fact that we know he was bullied in an orphanage during the Depression. That means he took from the other orphans.

Tom also has an acute fear of death. His whole life began at the death of his mother, leading to the hell that would be a london orphanage during the depression. And yes that would be hell. Orphanages during the 1930-1955 in Great Britian were NOT monitored adequately. Meaning ANYTHING could happen in those walls. If the Sisters wanted to beat a child within an inch of their life, as long as the child was not crippled, or killed, it was able to occur. It wasnt legal, but it happened. The fact that the Sisters were /scared/ of Tom, means that they tried punishing him... and it didnt work.

Moving back to Tom's fear, he also had a fear of attachment. Every person he connected with either was dead, or a part of the problem. He would have connected with the sisters, but they allowed him to be tormented by the other orphans until he couldnt stand it anymore, then treated him like a monster for striking back. He found that his father was a muggle, and didnt want him. He felt that his mother didnt want him either because she died before she could prove otherwise. It is these aspects that mark Tom Riddle's fears.

Tom is also defined by his pride. Tom does not consider himself anything less than a wizard. He /cannot/ define himself as anything else. He looks back to his ancestor Salazar for his ideal form of wizardry. He also believes due to his pride that all wizards are superior to the muggles. Which due to his experiences would make sense. Any muggles he encountered during his travels would be post-WWII, which was nothing but strife. Soviets were feverously expanding, the USA was attempting to do the same, only covertly, Europe was in shambles, Africa was in a power vacuum, and Asia was attempting to either hold back the soviets, or without any form of military presence at all. Tom would have seen nothing but suffering children, men ransacking homes trying to find food or money, kidnapping, corrupt military officials, and worse governments. Not to mention the wizards who would decide that the muggles are weak lets have some fun, like I am certain occured.

That is compounded by the fact that he had already created horcuxes which seem to warp and corrupt the person. Everything he saw would have been through a metaphorical haze of darkness.

We finally get to his hatred of Dumbledore. Dumbledore was the only person who treated him as first a child, then a student, and finally a human being that was being bad. Dumbledore was the one that broke the mold, the one that Tom could never understand. Everyone else around him either cowered or bowed as soon as his heritage was spoken, or as soon as he lifted a wand. Dumbledore didnt. He loathed Dumbledore not because he was on the other side, but because Dumbledore didn't treat him the same as everyone else

This finally brings us to his attempt at rule. Tom was accustomed to people obeying him, from the time he became a bully onward. It is a natural progression from "everyone who meets me respects me" to "I am so respected that I must be right." He was never contradicted until it came time to battle Dumbledore, the only wizard who could match him. Tom respects power because without it he knows you dont live well. Yet by that time, Tom believed himself to be all powerful. For what is more powerful than an immortal? Dumbledore would eventually die, he was already getting slower, and losing ground everytime they battled, yet Tom, no Voldemort grew every day, every hour. Voldemort by the time the prophecy was uttered, was /winning/. He could not be stopped. The only one who even slowed him down was Dumbledore, and it was only a matter of time before he was dead. Then... the prophecy is uttered.

"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies"

Voldemort for the first time in years would have felt the one emotion that defined him profusely. Fear. Everything he had, everything he ever worked for, his perfect future, his life. It all was going to be taken away by a /child/. A snot nosed brat just like those in the orphanage, just like the ones that took his food before he taught them different. He would solve this issue just like all the others. Eradicate the threat. So he finds the two boys who could be the Child of Prophecy. He does as much research as possible. He finds that one is much like him, a half-blood who maybe destined for great things. And a pureblood birthed entirely in the magical world.

He chose Harry because to his knowledge, every half-blood he encountered were dangerous. Snape was one of his most loyal followers, and he himself was a wizardry prodigy. The choice was made, and Riddle went to destroy his fears. He failed.

**** Failure to Tom Riddle was not something he was used to for it rarely happened, and if it did it was not /his/ doing. That explains why he fled to Albania, an area he knew he could gather power back. For he was defeated yes, but he was not dead. He still had power, he was alive.

For 10 years he thought, and thought. I believe that during this time he discovered that could possess others, and that he started with animals, and when Quirrel arrived, he took over him next. The philosopher stone incident occurred. During the first year, he watch Harry Potter. He saw him every week, every day, he studied him. And he found him lacking. He found him as a lazy, uneducated, wizard whos only talent seemed to be on a broom. That shapes his view of Harry for the remainder of the series. He believes that it is not possible that Harry has talents that he doesnt, he just can not see it. Which brings us to our first of the secondary character aspects.

Voldemort is blind to all power that is not blatant. More precisely he is blind to power that is not connect to one's self. Voldemort became strong to better himself, and his situation, he never did it for anyone else. He believes that survival will bring out the best out of everyone, that is why he threatens his servants, that is why he would punish with the Cruciatus, and that is why he killed. It had nothing to do with "I enjoy killing" though a part of him did, it was a part of his life's philosophy. The powerful live, the more powerful live well.

After quirrel's death, Voldemort goes back to his hiding ground of Albania, and waits. During this time, he finds a creature that seems to live via his philosophy. Nagini being a snake is an apex predator, and is rarely ever hunted. It is one of the most powerful animals in the forest, and no one fucks with it. Voldemort connects with this.

Peter Pettigrew comes to Voldemort, and here we see his philosophy come true. Peter is a wizard, and thus has power, but he is weak in mind and emotion, he is not the most powerful, and it is proven by his cowering before a spirit, no less than a spirit, but Voldemort will use it, just like his final character aspect dictates

The most powerful will use the less powerful to keep or gain power.

If we look back, we see that Voldemort formed this opinion early. During his Sixth year, we see that his "friends" already followed his commands, that he gained power from their obedience. And we see it when he talks to Slughorn. He is manipulative, to the point that Harry, not a slouch when it comes to getting people to listen to him especially after his fifth year states that he is good at it. He uses those who he feels are weaker to himself, which he also sees as all people trapped on the mortal plane. He respects power, but again, who is more powerful than an immortal?

***** It was not from Harry Potter, it was from the concepts of Orphanages in 1930s. Tom would not have been the oldest child there, and all the younger children would have been bullied by the older children during that time frame. Its a historical reference, not a canon one. Since Tom was raised in a muggle orphanage, I took the time to look up life style in 1930s london for orphans.

Here is a blog about such a life:[[http://kindred-spirit.co.uk/blog/harsh-life-in-a-1930s-childrens-home]]

Here is a source on Orphanage Asylums though it is skewed less to the orphans and more toward the positives, though if one reads between the lines one can see what I am talking about:[[http://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/subjects/schools/london_orphan_asylum/]]

And there are several studies on how bullies would react while the only thing that they had to bully over would be food. To be fair however, there is a single source that countered my assertion. It stated that Railway Servants' Orphanage attended a boarding school and that bully was nonexistant. However upon further research I found that Railway Servants' Orphanage was an extremely well funded orphanage that ensured every tendent had every need met. A "dingy orphanage in london" would not have been able to do the same.

the source for the Railway Servants' Orphanage story is found here. [[http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/bullying-unheard-orphan-boys-despite-hardships/story-18409927-detail/story.html#1]]

It is stated that Tom lived in a 1930s orphanage that was dingy and located in London. Considering that it was labeled as dingy, then we can then apply the rest of my statements. Are they one hundred percent perfect? no. But then again The Word of God as also rewrote canon multiple times during and after the books were published, with many inconsistencies.

*** I believe murderers (not those who commit crimes of passion) have to be born with certain traits. One can be born with certain psychopathic traits and either become or not become a psychopath, but if someone is not born with those traits, he or she cannot be a true psychopath.

Tom Riddle was born with those traits, most likely due to the interbreeding / incest of the Gaunt line and the unwillingness of Tom Riddle Sr. Tom Riddle grew up in a early-1900s orphanage that had limited resources, full of hatred and neglected, and was characterized with the phrase, "Kill or be killed." Without a mother-or-father figure, he does not develop emotions, but rather a manipulative nature, as seen with the fear he instilled in the others at the orphanage. He was always a loner.

When Dumbledore came, he sensed the nature of Tom and what he could do. Dumbledore knew exactly what Tom was--- a manipulative boy without emotions. While Tom could charm all his other teachers, he could not charm Dumbledore because Dumbledore was the one who found him.

He used his father's good looks to woo, and he used his power and ancestry to create the "Knights of Walpurgis." All of this to further his quest of power and domination. Recall, his first kill was at 15 years old, and he made a horcrux out of it. Splitting his soul and his quest for immortality was part of the "kill or be killed mindset" that always stuck with him.

He used fear and reward to gather followers. He did not torture his Death Eaters for small things; that would not help his agenda. Tom Riddle knew exactly how to manipulate people. Remember, Tom was extremely smart. The carrot was power in his new world order, and once branded, the stick was that fear of torture.

After his resurrection and the numerous horcruxes, he continued to go insane as part of the Gaunt curse.

*** Severus Snape is... complicated. What we know is that he seems to have come from an abusive childhood, and "loved" Lily Evans obsessively and possessively. He was bullied by the Maruaders, and it eventually lead to the events from the Peniseve in OotP. We also know that He eventually became a Death Eater, and that He would find the prophecy.

The issues with all of this... is we dont understand WHY.

Snape was defined by three major things in his life. His abusive childhood starts him on a darker path, yet Lily was his light. She ensured that nothing he did was ever as bad as it could be. I find it interesting that he only becomes a full death eater after fifth year,possibly even graduation. while Draco got his mark much later. It shows that Voldemort was willing to mark anyone at any time as long as it served his purposes. The bullying of the Marauders continued his push down the Dark Arts path.

The next big event is when Snape hears the prophecy. I believe that was his turning point. He told Voldemort and come to find out, its the only person he couldnt ever hurt, but also the man who he could easily kill.

Lily of course dies.. We see that Snape lost himself in his grief, and it was only his vow to Dumbledore that he protected harry.

Over all I would say that Snape was a man who valued the past more than the present, and he had a form of honor. He did not break his word, and he refused to allow children to be slaughtered. It shows that there are definite boundaries that he had. In HBP, he could easily have killed one of Harry's friends, or maimed Harry himself. In DH, he could have allowed the Carrows to run rampant, but he didn't. I am also certain he could have found where the DA had hidden themselves, but didnt.

Snape seems to be the most confusing character in the series because we have all the pieces of his personality, we just cant categorize him correctly.

From what I see in canon, Severus Snape seems somewhat naive, letting himself be fooled by two masters. Then again, they were master manipulators and almost no-one must have seen through them. Besides, it's not like there is so much choice in powerful wizards with organizations to join. Snape seems very obedient and respectful of rules, and envious. I think he didn't do all those evil things because it wouldn't have contributed to his mission. I think it was a case of loving the Dark Arts instead of the ideology of Voldemort, and then again, more in fantasy than in practice after seeing the horror unfold, just like Lucius and Draco. He switched sides easily, even though it was really dangerous. He seems to have an obsession with getting respect from others and apparently likes insulting and frightening people weaker than him.

**** I would like to point out that I don't dislike Rickman's performance (almost no one does). But it's an entirely different interpretation. Movie-Snape /without the context of the books/ comes off as a better, mature adult. It could almost be surmised that Movie-Snape has grown up and agreed to put aside his past with James Potter. There is very little unfairness from him in the films outside of the first movie. He also seems more helpful and concerned (even if that wasn't the case) during the Occlumency session due to Rickman's poise and superb acting. Movie-Snape is not a tantrum-throwing young man, he's someone who's learned his lesson and suffers silently while helping the only remnant of Lily.

These observations came from my father, who only watched the movies.

I think this is where mischaracterizations of Snape come from. Movie-Snape written into Book-World-building is a warning flag that the author might have a shallow interpretation of canon and thus the fic might include other not-so-good aspects of the flawed films or fall victim to other overdone tropes.

And I completely agree. Book-Snape to me is petty, childish, and honestly an all around terrible person. Being on the good side doesn't change that fact. But almost everyone views Snape through the lens of Alan Rickman (similarly how a lot of people view Ron through the lens of Rupert Grint).

He seems like a form of wish fullfillment. That said, I saw a documentary about a man obsessed with an actress once, and she was literally the person his life centered around.

But what more could there be to Snape? It can be my limited imagination but I don't see it - he was very admirable as a double spy, it was very good of him that he was so capable at teaching and even becoming a headmaster - why is it likely that there was more? Harry did not think of his dead parents all the time, no, but Harry also didn't bully other people because he still cared about things that happened years ago.

That's not to say he doesn't change during his time at Hogwarts. Or that he can't change, but if you're writing a fic where Draco changes his entire worldview, it has to be a gradual process filled with lots of resistance.

*** Lucius Malfoy was his role model and he took his father's words as law. His behavior was modeled after his father and his ways and manners. Most likely spoiled as a child and thought he was the center of the world. He didn't think much before his words leave his mouth; often said things that are controversial and made many people his enemies. He has pride in his great wealth and pure-blooded lineage and thought that other people below him weren't his equals and shouldn't be treated like one.

He also had a proficiency at compartmentalizing his emotions and thoughts (Occlumency.)

He loved to sought attention and had people flatter him. Can be quite obnoxious due to his theatrical and melodramatic manner. Intelligent for he mastered Occlumency, repaired the Vanishing Cabinet, and took several NEWT classes. Quick-witted for he always have a comeback.

He had his beliefs and prejudices that had ingrained into his person be challenged in the most frightening ways. He probably had seen people tortured, familiar people, those who he went to school with, his teachers, his schoolmates' parents and siblings and couldn't do anything to stop it. His parents had suffered for their loyalty to Voldemort. His most hateful people in his life had offered him kindness and his life.

So I feel like, after what had happened in the war, Draco would probably reject the pure-blooded beliefs. Maybe he's still wary of Muggles or couldn't be in a relationship with them, but maybe educate himself more on the Muggle world.

*** I feel that Dumbledore is very much misunderstood, mainly because people insist on trying to pigeon-hole him into one of two camps: perfect or evil. In reality, Dumbledore can only be understood as being the result of two conflicting desires which form the root of his character.

On the one hand, he does not trust himself with power. He hates Grindelwald's philosophy of the Greater Good and would rather remove himself completely from all political concerns. This side of him would have him treat Harry as a regular kid, albeit one he favours, and values Harry's life over winning the war.

On the other hand, despite his attempts to avoid it, he inevitably ends up holding a huge amount of power, by virtue of his intelligence and magical skill. Magical ability in the HP world is important, and when you have it in the extreme people will look to you for guidance. The conflict with Voldemort forces him reluctantly into a position of leadership, because to stand aside would be to allow great evil to occur. This side of him would have him treat Harry as a weapon to defeat Voldemort, and values winning the war over Harry's life.

In applying these two root beliefs, I would suggest that Dumbledore's instinct is the first, but when circumstances grow desperate the second can overrule it. On top of these core attributes, Dumbledore has a number of other beliefs. Among them are:

He values Harry's life over his happiness.

He places high value on freedom of choice.

With these four beliefs and attitudes in mind, I think everything Dumbledore does can be understood. Essentially he's continually compromising, and that balancing act is where he most often opens himself to criticism: sometimes the compromise can be said to be overly cautious, other times it's not cautious enough. Though this is often only clear with hindsight.

For example, some people say Dumbledore should have prepared Harry better, telling him more information and training him to fight. This would fall into the "Greater Good" category: training a child soldier is very much not okay. It would be an immoral act to win the war. So while Dumbledore no doubt considered it, he can't bring himself to do it.

On the other end of the spectrum, some people say Dumbledore should have placed Harry with a wizarding family who would have treated him well, like the Weasleys. But this goes against the ultimate priority of keeping Harry alive, because the Dursley household was the only place he could be sure Harry would be completely safe (as demonstrated by what happened to the Longbottoms days later).

(Also, it's heavily implied that the Bond of Blood requires the Dursleys' freedom of choice and so Dumbledore cannot apply pressure for them to treat Harry in a certain way. Forcing them to treat Harry well would mean the Bond of Blood would break.)

We can also see the fine line Dumbledore walked in PS. He allowed Harry to learn about the Philosopher's Stone and the Mirror of Erised, and even hints that Harry might come across it again. He gives him the invisibility cloak to aid him. However, he never forces Harry into wandering the halls of Hogwarts at night (whereupon he found the Mirror), nor does he force Harry to go after the stone. Harry chose to do both of those things. In doing so Dumbledore simultaneously tested and prepared Harry, in line with his second core attribute, but at the same time respected Harry's ability to choose (which derives from his care for Harry). Harry could equally have chosen to hide in his dorm, as 99% of children would have done.

I could go on, but I think these are sufficient examples for now.

What I find most interesting about this is that different people criticise Dumbledore from different angles. Some people criticise him for treating Harry too much like a child, others criticise him for not treating Harry like a child enough. Hell, sometimes one person will simultaneously criticise Dumbledore for both at once, which just goes to show what a difficult position he was in. Essentially, both motivations are valid. Dumbledore knows this, and that's why balancing them and reaching a compromise is so hard. No matter what compromise you arrive at, the result will be unsatisfactory, because the situation overall is shitty.

His animagus form is a common rat, unlike his friends regal stag, or massive shaggy dog. He is capable of amazing magic, especially when under peer or survival pressure.

As an animagus at 15, and a capable potionteer, he was a wizard with ability. His most amazing accomplishment was blasting a street apart, while cutting off his finger and immediately after transforming into a rat. To put that into perspective, a street is commonly 1-3 feet of concrete and asphalt, and is normally made to withstand five years of millions of tons crossing it daily. Concrete is also used by the military to protect themselves from high explosives, and anything less than 10 lbs of high explosives will not make a dent in it. it was not described as a dent however, it was described as a crater. A CRATER. Peter Pettigrew blasted a crater into at least a foot of concrete. It took Ginny Weasley, a talent witch, several months to be able to destroy a table with a blasting curse. Peter did the same curse, we assume, once, and made a crater in concrete.

Peter is also attracted to power. James and Sirius were obviously skilled, and Voldemort was arguably the strongest wizard on earth for years. Peter was also a coward in that he feared strength.

- The smartest witch since Merlin

- A sexual prop for your pervy fantasies

- A stand-in for your own self-important political beliefs

- A mindless drone given to obeying the nearest authority figure

Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about (IMO) one of the most interesting characters in HP canon.

Hermione is self-assured. Many times, this is a good thing as she has every reason to believe that she's on the right track, academically and morally speaking. It can also be a hindrance, as it was in the case of the Half-Blood Prince's identity or the Firebolt incident.

Hermione is intelligent /and/ hard-working. She regularly receives top marks in every class, no matter the material with the notable exception of Divination.

Hermione is impulsive. From lighting Snape's robes on fire in PS to decking Malfoy in PA, she often acts first without thinking about possible repercussions.

Hermione is motivated by praise, especially academically or when it comes to solving mysteries.

Hermione is curious and willing to break rules and ignore directives from those in authority to get to the bottom of a mystery.

Hermione is capable of profound empathy, but has blind spots when it comes to a few areas such as house-elf free will.

Hermione can be catty if she feels threatened as she often was if she shared a scene with Fleur Delacour.

Hermione is tenacious. Once she was committed to stopping Voldemort with Harry and Ron, she never wavered.

*Strong characters have faults.* If an author's Hermione doesn't have her stress about academics even though she's top in the class, whinge about others' lack of maniacal study habits, or make assumptions that are at least occasionally wrong, then she's a Mary-Sue and extremely boring.

*** Ron has one of the most definite, slow build character arcs in the series. Ron's defining moment and the culmination of his character arc is him leaving the horcrux hunt, and choosing to come back in DH. It is, to my mind, the greatest character moment in the books.

#+begin_quote

Lord Voldemort twists facts to serve his purpose, and as with the greatest of lies, they always have a hint of truth in them.

#+begin_quote
  /"Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy Who Lived?"/
#+end_quote

Ron's insecurities were born out of him being unsure of having a place in the world, a place along side his more superficially talented friends. Those insecurities got the better of Ron in a moment of weakness; later Ron faces those insecurities and comes out on top. It is very, very significant that Ron literally takes the sword to the horcrux and stabs through it, the horcrux which is a physical manifestation of all of Ron Weasley's greatest fears.

#+begin_quote
  "After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone..."
#+end_quote

After Ron destroys the horcrux, Harry tells Ron that both he and Hermione were miserable without him. It isn't the most glamorous acknowledgement or reassurance, but it is validation of Ron's place in the world, and it fits him perfectly.

#+begin_quote
  "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you."

  He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.
#+end_quote

Incalculable power, indeed. It is one of the most important themes of the books, that the perfectly ordinary can turn out to be much more. Lily Potter's perfectly ordinary love overcomes all the skill and power of Lord Voldemort. More than Harry, Ron is the character who exemplifies this quality. Ron doesn't have extraordinary talent or skill or ambition or dedication, he doesn't have Lily's blood protection or a prophecy or a super-significant wand. Yet he is very much an integral part of the trio; he is the heart to Hermione's brain and Harry's hands. His character arc isn't about beating a Dark Lord, isn't about changing society; it is about making mistakes, growing up and facing his fears.

Ron Weasley might be completely ordinary, but perhaps that makes him the most extraordinary of them all.

*** Ron is a character, I'd not want as my friend.

His character had great potential upto 2nd year. Since then, I think JKR forgot what to do with him than she initially thought. His intelligence on chess on first year suggested he could be some General/plan guy during war yet rest of the 6 books JK completely forgot Ron played chess at all. In 3rd year, he had very few to do. 4th year, he was all about jealousy. I mean, what his role was upto 2nd year, it was completely changed at the beginning of 5th book & the change was downwards. If his greatest ability(chess/thinking) has no role in rest of the series why to introduce it at all? Gave him some quality that could have real use during rest of the series. For me, the defining moment of Ron is when he left Harry & Hermione during 7th year. Even if he returned that doesn't excused what he did. He did the same thing in 4th year. And I'll bet you he'll do that again if situation arises in the future. Being that said he was brave throughout the series.

Ron was good at chess in the first book because one of the obstacles in the way of the stone was a giant chessboard. Also, being good at chess doesn't mean you're a 'general'.

Asking your friends to die for you is well above and beyond the call of normal friendship. Ron failed to be a perfect friend twice in 7 years. He's still far better a friend than you or I could ever hope for in real life. Being willing to die for someone is a rare thing; having a friend who demonstrates it to you practically annually is unheard of.

And I've seen bond between him & his friends from during war. I can't think they could have betrayed each other once during their lifetime.

And I couldn't imagine their 2nd in command betraying their chief. So yeah, I have issues with Ron character.

Imagine what could have Hogwarts students (Neville, Ginny & co) would motivate themselves had they know Ron left Harry? Or better yet Voldemort knowing/catching Ron & used him as a bet. And knowing Harry, he'd definitely went for rescuing. Ron's little mutiny could have caused significant troubles. And he was supposed to Harry's 2nd in command.

You can't. Because you haven't lived through war. Neither do I. And I can't imagine myself pulling a gun in my lifetime. But the situation never existed for me to do that. When my father & his friends went to war they were 17 to 20. Think about a Palestinian. Don't you think they would pull a gun at 15? Because that's normal for them due to live through war. So yeah, I don't see any unusual for Ron to follow what situation required. His character always was brave. I told it before. But betraying during midway through is more saying about his character even if he regretted & returned. He did it twice. And there's no guarantee that he wouldn't do it 3rd time.

Book five, where Harry is angry all of the time. Ron's there for him, even though most people aren't. Remember when Seamus and Harry start arguing when they return to Hogwarts? Ron has Harry's back. He also has Harry's back when Harry decides to go to the Ministry to fight Voldemort. Once again, Ron knowingly walks into a situation with Harry that he knows will be extremely dangerous.

***** I posted this to the comment that you replied to, but I think it's relevant here as well:

I think Arthur Weasley's views are really similar to the idea of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism][Orientalism.]]

In his case, I think he genuinely likes muggles and what he sees as their culture, but he fundamentally doesn't understand a large portion of it. As you said, he wouldn't work well with muggles. Harry has to deal with something as simple as muggle money for Arthur in both the fourth and fifth books.

From Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  Since the publication of Edward Said's Orientalism in 1978, much academic discourse has used the term "Orientalism" in a more restricted sense, to characterize a perceived patronizing Western attitude towards Near Eastern societies that is used to justify Western imperialism. In Said's analysis, the West essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped---thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior, while Oriental societies embody the opposite values.

  “All right, all right, I've got the point,” said Sirius. He looked most displeased. “Just an idea, thought you might like to get together.”

  “I would, I just don't want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said Harry.

  There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a crease between his sunken eyes.

  “You're less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. “The risk would've been what made it fun for James.”

I think Molly has a solid point. It is not as if Sirius actually knew Harry at that point in OoTP (or know him much at all, actually). They had barely had two or three conversations till then. Sirius's love for Harry comes almost solely from his love for James, at least at that point in the series.

There is a bit more if you include things Harry has heard about but did not experience directly (like this bit) and yet a bit more if you include things Madame Rowling has said outside of the books.

I will not deny that many things are jumbled enough that people cannot distinguish between them being canon or just popular headcanon, like the thing with him being the primary creator of the Marauder's Map. That said, both of the things I'd said are true, assuming you take things that supposedly happen but that Harry does not experience directly (because we do see Molly chiding Sirius for this in the books, and Sirius's response does basically amount to “so what?” rather than him denying it, even if a few lines down he does remind her that he is aware that Harry and James are different people thank you very much, which is what I meant by “it takes him a moment to actually get a hold of himself when it happens”); what is speculation is whether Sirius took Harry for James because his mind was so fragmented or because he's been trying to rebuild what he had with James before or because whatever else; his conversation with Molly indicates that it might lean in a certain way, but yes, that one would still be a speculation.

Unless you mean the “when your grip on reality is as feeble as his” bit, but again I did not write that he lost contact with reality.

Think about how it sometimes happens to old people. Are they all psychotic? Heck no, they're just not fully there mentally and though they aren't psychotic it does not mean they can't overlook things just like that, sometimes even major things. The same about depressed people, who sometimes, when their state worsens, just overlook things around them because they don't really perceive them all that well. Have they lost contact with reality? Are they psychotic? Heck no to both. But can their grip on reality be described as “feeble”? For some of them yes. And the bit about being depressed is especially important here because dementors are supposed to be a, crudely put, magical version of depression, so him having spent so long amongst them certainly makes them close to that very comparison.

******* You do realize that the things you're listing are examples of psychoses from a mental health professional's point of view? Psychosis isn't always as pronounced as complete catatonia.

More to the point, /treating/ someone like a replacement of your friend from long ago is not the same thing as literally seeing them as said friend.

******** And you do realise that having something that appears to be a symptom does not necessarily mean having a serious medical condition that has it as one of its symptoms, right? Because either we go into serious medical conditions in which case I did not say nor intend to say that Sirius was afflicted with any of those with the exception of depression and then that's a “maybe”, or we go into “well, many people are slightly off in their heads from the norm” in which case treating the fact that I noted that Sirius wasn't all that well as going too far is ... well, not really constructive in any way because it adds nothing.

I do not wish to invalidate your medical education, assuming you have one as your words make that assumption fairly easy, but there are times when treating others' words as accusations of the presence this-or-that medical condition are neither professional nor conductive to anything. Sometimes you don't take phrases and treat them as shoehorns for book definitions of symptoms. And this is one of those times, because we are not discussing the exact state of Sirius's mind from the medical viewpoint but rather the fact that his time in Azkaban did change him in some way and there are leftover effects of his stay there.

********* Your implication was that Sirius literally believed that Harry was James, as opposed to simply treating him as the friend he'd lost. That's psychosis. You then compared it to a similar symptom of dementia in old people. That's also psychosis. By the way, psychosis is also a sometime symptom of depression.

This is a really over the top reaction, by the way.

**** Sirius seems the outlaw archetype, loves motorbikes, and Muggle culture (obviously). I wonder what his relationship with Hagrid was. He gave Hagrid the flying motorbike, which I think was his most prized possession, so I think they were friends. Sirius seems very loyal to his friends, true to his dog animagus, while he didn't seem to be to anyone or anything else. Also, he seems witty and intelligent, and school bored him. Perhaps also because Walburga ensured he got a good education at home, and because he disliked (parts of) the wizarding world. I don't know if James and Sirius really were the best students of their year, or that this was exaggerated. However, they were good at transfiguration, and this is supposed to be a difficult subject. Sirius might also have had ptsd, especially after Azkaban.

*** Sirius Black suffers from what I have termed the "Black Curse". Now most fandoms state that the Black Curse is being reckless, but to me it isnt. It is valuing family beyond yourself. Sirius Black viewed James Potter, Peter Pettigrew, and Remus Lupin as his family. In one 24 hour period it all went to shit. James and his small family, shattered, his godson injured, and Remus disappeared. Peter was a traitor and needed to die. Sirius handed his godchild to Hagrid who stated he was taking him to hogwarts. Sirius most likely assumed that he would be with Madam Pomfrey or Dumbledore, in other words SAFE. Peter knew in likelyhood every secret the Maruaders had. The hiding places, the spells, the habits, everything. In order for Harry to ever be safe, Peter had to die. And it just so happened that Sirius was already in a rage about his family being threatened.

Sirius is also defined by his abilities. He was an animagus by Fifth year, he was at the top of his class, and he was surrounded by people who were just as good as he was. James and Remus were both capable of great magic, and Snape, though Sirius hated him, was also capable of the same.

He was arrogant, passionate, and courageous. And then Azkaban happened. Azkaban is inhuman, even during the height of Guantanamo prisoners were not forced to relieve their worst memories, undergo psychological, emotional, and possibly physical torture for decades at a time. All it takes to break a person mentally, is twenty days. Sirius lasted 12 years. Yes, it was lessened by the animagus transformation, but the torture was still there.

After Azkaban, the only thing that mattered, was Harry. Protect Harry. Peter was still alive, and the only way to protect harry was kill the rat. the only way to kill the rat was escape. Escape via animagus transformation.

Sirius after being trapped had an issue with sitting still and doing nothing. My guess is after Azkaban his psyche was cracked, not broken. I have a feeling that if he wasnt focused on something, he wouldnt be able to function. That is why being forced into Grimmauld was such torture for him. He couldnt help but to think of the hell that occurred in that house.

*** So there are a two conflicting pieces of information I have about Bellatrix that I need help reconciling.

On one hand we're told she's an evil badass and a kickass fighter. She's the Dark Lord's most trusted servant and (roughly) tied with Lucius for second in command. She revels in destruction and has extensive experience in the Dark Arts.

On the other hand, she gets killed by Molly Weasley.

It's impossible to overstate how strange that last sentence feels. I get that this is an awesome moment in the books (and I love it, don't get me wrong). It's just that I can't fit it in with what we're told about Bellatrix. Molly may be a competent spell caster at Household magic, but she's definitely not a trained fighter and she's decently out of shape.

Possible explanations I've thought of are:

1. Bellatrix underestimates Molly. This is the most realistic IMO, I just think it's a bit silly for the Dark Lord's second in command to grossly underestimate a member of the Order of the Phoenix. Especially after the first few spells. Especially when she's surrounded by hostile forces.

2. She pulls an Azula and is actually insane. The issue here is we don't see a gradual breakdown of sanity, like we do with Azula.

3. She's exhausted from the battle. But wouldn't Molly be as well? Bellatrix has more combat experience and is in better shape, so I can't imagine her tiring out faster than Molly (when she was just holding off Luna, Hermione, and Ginny at the same time).

**** Bellatrix is killed by Molly because she underestimates her and her love for her children. Her death is explicitly compared to that of Sirius in the text: she chooses to taunt Molly about her children instead of fighting her to her full capability, and is hit by a direct shot. She doesn't realise till the last moment that she should be taking the fight fully seriously, and she pays the price.

Here's that part in the book:

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.

  Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.

  Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemed to bulge: For the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemort screamed.

I'm guessing what you're saying is exactly what JK intended (Molly digs deep because she loves her kids and clutches it out), but realistically I can't see the fight playing out like that. Molly would be a hard fight, but in the end the better-practiced Bellatrix would take her down (maybe getting injured in the process).

***** See the issue I have with that is that "love" and "hatred/madness" don't really help you in a fight. Sure they provide determination, but it's borderline hollywood-fiction that someone an succeed just because something they care about it on the line. Determination can help you get the job done when you need determination. It can't make up for a lack in skill.

Unless you were referring to the fact that love boosted Molly's magic's power? Which would be a bit of a cop out (plus the fact that Bellatrix probably loves Voldemort to the point where she'd give her life for his cause).

*** Fleur is definitely bad with first impressions, both her impressions of others and others impressions of her.

I can see what would cause Fleur to be a bit overbearing on Ginny. Ginny is used to acting like one of the boys (even if they don't always accept her). The only young female family member of Fleur's that we meet is Gabrielle, who is far younger than Ginny. I'm sure that Fleur means well and is trying to be protective, but that doesn't work as well with someone that's five years older than her sister.

She immediately calls Harry a "leetle boy," not knowing of his "exploits" in his previous three years. To be fair, Harry is probably still rather scrawny at this point.

From what we know about veelas from the first few chapters of GoF, they're very sexualized. Fleur, who is only 1/4 veela, still apparently looks at least somewhat like a full-blooded veela (Harry seems to have guessed that she was at least part judging by his thoughts at the wand weighing ceremony). I could easily see her getting tired of people treating her as a sexual object and not as the (very powerful and intelligent) person she is.

However, she gets angry when that is used against her.

*** Neville in the earlier books has major problems with being shy, and a lack of self confidence. He does a few braver things, but for the most part he is just a shy kid who isn't good at anything but one school subject people probably don't value highly. In later books however, we see Neville build up his confidence. He leads the hogwarts resistance in book 7 and he ends up destroying the last horcrux. Neville is probably my favourite character because he shows clear development in why he changes, like he becomes a lot better at duelling and becomes more confident when Bellatrix is free from azkaban. As much as I liked the symbolism behind Molly killing Bellatrix, I really wished we got some kind of epic duel between Neville and Bellatrix.
