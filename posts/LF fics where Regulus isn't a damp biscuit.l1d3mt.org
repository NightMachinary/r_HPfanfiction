I'm after bingereading all of TheDivinesComedians work on Ao3 and was blown away by how regal and coy and sure of himself their Regulus was. He was so fun to read. Usually Regulus is a soppy nothing who hides behind Sirius or is a complainy/moany whingebag the entire time.

Are there any other fics where Regulus stood out as a character, even if he wasn't the main character?

Here is a link to TheDivineComedians work if people are interested -- [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian]]


** I think "Neither lost nor found" fits your description a little. Regulus definitely is his own person there, though his stubbornness is a little annoying.

  In the thick of the first war with Voldemort, Regulus steals the locket Horcrux; and pulled from the grip of its trials, he survives the cave. What follows is a tale of espionage, blood politics, and accidental vigilantism. Welcome to 1979.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1060709][Face Death in the Hope series]] by lullabyknell. Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.” “Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly. Time travel. Ao3.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][The Black SheepDog]] by Izzythehut. Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent. Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life. Mostly complete. Ao3.

**** If you don't like the characters being any different from the books then you shouldn't read this. It being good is completely subjective to opinion. Some people dislike it because it's quite lengthy and they don't like reading that much, others like it because it uses a trope that is heavily cliched but successfully manages to circumvent all the usual cliches(e.g. there's no bashing/Indy!OP!Harry/Extremely bitter harry who hates his parents since they completely neglected him) and has new problems and conspiracies introduced frequently so it never exactly gets stale.

****** It's a WBWL story, in which Harry's twin was the one who 'defeated' Voldemort. Lily and James are still alive, and the plot is loosely based on canon, except that there is a lot more world building and the Wizarding World is slightly more logical(Thirteen year olds don't have the ability to manipulate the timeline just because they got good grades). Quirrell is still around in Harry's first year and the Diary still manages to open the Chamber, but events are significantly different. For example,Ron gets the diary instead of Ginny. However, the story is over 1.7 million words so it's rather hard to describe the whole plot. Also many characters are OC simply due to the difference in events that transpired and some are OOC to enhance the plot. For example, Peter is more than a sniveling coward, Narcissa Malfoy is far more dangerous, and Gilderoy Lockhart is very competent.
