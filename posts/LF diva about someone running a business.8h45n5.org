Preferably a novel length story, doesn't have to be Harry-centric, I'm looking for something similar to the Draco-Ginny subplot in linkffn(Biting the Hand That Feeds You by Andrew Joshua Talon).


** Interesting, I don't think I've seen this particular autocorrection/mistake before.

Anyways, I have a few business fics somewhere. I haven't gotten very far in your linked fic, so IDK exactly what you're looking for. Some of the fics I'll scrounge up are Harry-centric, some of them are the twins or Ron and Fred. I may even have a story with Harry as a wandmaker somewhere. I have a couple bookstore stories, and even one where Remus owns a store near Surrey so he can keep an eye on Harry. Most of these fics aren't really money oriented though, more about how the business makes for good interaction. If you're interested in caf√© AUs, I ought to have one or two.

Although, if you do want fics about money, I think this fic counts: linkao3(Business by esama)

Edit: or maybe not, considering what the fic that was linked implies the original was based on Moriarty

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

*** Yea, I like the people interaction part and also the day to day of actually running the business, the way Draco makes the plans and gets people to do things, etc. Also, I'll take the Ron and Fred stories, please. And I thought that typo was very strange, too but I'd already posted and it wouldn't let me edit the title, lol.

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

** There's some of it, def not a focus, but still... linkffn(A Study of Magic; For Love of Magic) One is obviously a x-over of Sherlock (the british tv series) and the other is a rather interesting and a bit different fic, but with a shitload of smut and harem. It has a really well done plot though, so the smut is only an extra, imo. I did get bored eventually at around 550k words and didn't finish it.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
