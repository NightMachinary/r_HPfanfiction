Alright so now that Endgame is very close, is their any fics or series that have a huge build up and pays off. Sad ending or happy I just want something big. I dont particularly care for ships as long as it isnt slash. No offence but it's just not my thing. Oh and action. Lots of action!


** Lots of action?

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has plenty.

If you like the badass!Hermione check out the other fics of Starfox5, they are all pretty good.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
