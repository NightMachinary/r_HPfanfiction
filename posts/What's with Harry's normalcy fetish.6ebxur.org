I mean why does he want to be normal? Why just Harry? why not forge a new legend rather than complain about being The-Boy-With-To-Many-Hyphens?


** Harry was picked on for not being "Normal" for nearly 10 years, then he gets a world where he is different but still inherently normal for it, yes he was a Wizard but EVERYONE was a Wizard so it didn't stand out so much. Then to learn that he isn't even normal in this amazing world, he's still a Freak.

Harry would of loved to forge his own path, until it struck home that the world he had entered had already given him a legend, one that they had lived with for 10 years, one that he couldn't ever top. The boy does amazing things over the series, a number of which is rather public, yet the world only ever see him as The Boy-Who-Lived and later The Man-Who-Won.

** The grass is always greener syndrome. We who have never been famous naturally want to be, or at least enjoy imagining what we'd do if we were, and (you see this in celebrities a lot) those who are tired of the constant attention of the press and fans will say how they hate not being able to go out in public without being bothered, and life was so much better before they became famous. It's human nature to want what you don't have.

That said, Harry really doesn't complain too much in the series at all. And when he does, it's not complaining about his fame, but everything that goes with it. The-Boy-Who-Lived is no cushy movie star title. It's a constant reminder that he lived- but his parents died. It means Voldemort is always after him. It gives the paparazzi carte blanche to write whatever they want about him, apparently. And it means that he has to be the one to eventually kill Voldemort. There doesn't really seem to be an upside.

And "forge a new legend"? With what? Harry is incredibly ill-suited, even more so than an ordinary 11-year-old, to do such a thing. He's been ill-treated his entire life, knows nothing about the wizarding world, and came from a family that didn't exactly value reading, academic achievement, or indeed, any kind of learning. All he's learned from them is that any time he draws attention to himself, or even asks a simple question, he gets in trouble for it. It's not really easy to overcome that kind of early conditioning, and that's if you even want to in the first place.

*** In canon, Harry doesn't show that many of those signs of abuse - he talks back, blows up against his relatives, and generally doesn't act as if he has been broken.

**** yeah i always, get irked when harry is this broken little boy who has been raped since 4 years old. Also you can't forget petunia breaking some part of his body with a pan. And then Vernon beats him up so badly he activates accidental magic and ends up with the Flamels or Delacours and gets a harem while simultaneously beating voldemort with a finger.

*** I get that the grass is greener on the other side. But dude like, what do you mean he doesn't complain? the 5-7 and some of the 4 were all Harry Potter angst and Harry's "oh woe me my life is shit" shit. also, Harry does not show that much conditioning aside from emotional neglect and the occasional physical striking that does not occur that much, he should be seeking any and all attention sometimes even negative attention because his primary form of abuse was being ignored rather than being physically or verbally tormented meaning that his greatest wish would be for people to care about him which is shown in the scene with Erised where "his heart's desire" is for him to have parents and family who care about him rather than ignore and disdain him.

Before you debate that the abuse was worse than being ignored and occasionally stricken, there is no sign that it was not and I'm not including being given labor because the books don't show it being that bad from at least my perspective because by seven I washed my own dishes and by twelve I was cooking meals by myself every couple of days when o got hungry and there were no leftovers in the fridge and of all things one could be forced to do as a kid weeding and watering the garden as well as doing the dishes and occasionally cooking are among the least terrible things you can force a child to do. there is also no evidence that so long as the conversation has nothing to do with magic that he is forbidden from learning and asking questions (though the Dursleys would likely treat all interactions with disdain). so in terms of early conditioning he was forced into thinking independently, likely learned to seek knowledge independently, and that it's bad being known for things you did not do; so which part of the Dursleys "conditioning" does not put him at a stage of wanting to be known for his own achievements, which is why the hat wanted him in Slytherin.

** Probably because 'not normal' means people trying to kill him. Taking that out of the equation, Harry would have grown up very differently in his Hogwarts years. If Voldemort had never returned Harry probably would have been a Quidditch star, imho.

** I would assume his horrid childhood with the dursleys scarred him quite a bit. Being the most famous wizard is the most profound contrast to his previous life. In both cases he wanted close friends, to be loved, to have purpose, and to not standout.

Now the gripe I have is wanting him to pursue his purpose more than he did.

Edit: yes I agree with the boy with too many hyphens part. I get not wanting to be legendary but his biggest mistake was meeting Ron first and not hermione...

*** Both of them are bad lol. They are extremes on the "study" spectrum, both are not inspiring to academic achievement.

Edit- you fucking cretins downvoting me. Please explain how having a chronic slacker on the one hand and an obsessive, overbearing teacher's pet on the other is conductive to the development of someone's study habits and interests in academics. Is love to hear this rationale.

**** I agree. I just think if I was in Harry's shoes I would be so unsure of everything yet it's a whole new world that has no idea who I am or who I am capable of. Combined with Harry being so impressionable that the first person he meets is a slouch when neither of his parents were...well he could've picked worse I suppose.

An aside that I have wanted to investigate in writing is how much did the piece of Voldemort soul hold Harry back?

**** He never get any attention or love. He should be craving for praises etc... Embrassing his role as the boy who lived. Hell, he should be more like Tom Riddle. After all he had a worse childhood than Voldemort. I love the universe of Harry Potter don't get me wrong, but don't forget that it's a story made for children. If it was realistic, the story would have been so much different.

***** This is a very interesting point I never thought about.

It makes all kinds of sense that Harry appreciates his friends more than most people. I love this scene after he first meets Ron:

#+begin_quote
  “Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
#+end_quote

But Harry also never got any attention from authority figures in his life. You can make the argument that he should be brown-nosing for teachers' praise more than Hermione. But of course he doesn't do that. I wonder if Dudley and his gang beat up Harry anytime a teacher praised him in front of the class.

and Harry dodges it with ease, as if it was predictable to him. There was definitely physical abuse.
