Is it worth reading If I like a solid romantic sub plot?


** To some extent there is. The problem is that since Harry doesn't get any significant character development throughout the series it doesn't really "go anywhere."

That said, I usually can't read stories that don't have some sort of romantic subplot and the one that exists in the series is adequate enough. The entertainment value of the rest of the series makes up for the mediocre main character growth and stale romance. Good for at least one read through.

** Yeah, it's basically fluff all the way.

** No romance, but there are a couple of non-graphic sex scenes.
