Trace: This person is holding a wand, making sound, and intending meaning. Are they attempting a spell? No, not any spell I know of. Are they speaking a language, then, so that I can ignore them? Not one I'm aware of.

Trace: The hell? [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire_(computing][halts and catches fire]])]

** Well the incantations used by English speakers are in Latin so there's that. Unless the esperantos speaker tries the "Eat slugs, Malfoy!" spell. But as far as we know, that might just be an English incantation. Besides who the hell speaks Esperantos?

*** "Manƒùu limakojn, Malfojo!"

(Oh! I've just realized, in typing that - "Malfoy" written as an Esperanto name translates to "the opposite time"! Also "Voldemort" would become the word for "a death wish". That's cool.)
