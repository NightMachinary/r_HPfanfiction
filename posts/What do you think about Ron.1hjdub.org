Some writers seem to hate Ron, as they portray him as unlikable and immature (this seems to be most prevalent in stories that ship Hermione with someone else). Are you one of them? Do you think people actually dislike Ron, or do you think writers use him as a source of drama by exaggerating his canon characteristics?


** Of the three central characters, Ron was the most authentic. If Hermione was the author's mouthpiece and Harry, the self-sacrificing hero, Ron was the most human, with moments of weakness and greatness, of frailty and strength, of laziness and assiduity, of self-deception and reflection.

As others have noted, much of the antipathy toward Ron (and the Weasleys in general) stems from expectations many readers had that Harry would end up with Hermione in the "happily ever after" sense. They can't accept that Ron and Hermione would make a good couple, or that Harry and Ginny (herself pretty much a blank slate in canon) could make a go at things. Were it not for the unfortunate Epilogue, which erased any ambiguity and constrained any canon-compliant post-Hogwarts era fanfiction, I suspect either would be more beloved characters.

Myself, I'm fond of stories that treat Ron fairly, as a complex character and not a caricature. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker's]] (she of Backward With Purpose fame) tales come to mind. Another is jbern's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]].

*** Ron specifically: The hate probably comes from "he doesn't deserve her!"

Weasleys in general? Fred/George could be bullies (though often well meaning), and Potions!Ginny is so incredibly plausible it makes it easy to implicate Ginny and Molly in a conspiracy to drug Hermione and Harry with amortentia. Most of that stems from the fact that Ginny has almost zero role until book 5 and in book 6 she is suddenly the center of Harry's world. People should have seen Harry/Ginny coming a mile away when she was introduced on the platform, and became the focus of book 2. But then she disappeared again and H/Hr took center stage for 3 books.

I've always loved Arthur though, I don't think I've ever read Arthur bashing that didn't immediately turn me off the story. So it is more like...Prewitt bashing than "Weasley" bashing.

**** I /never/ saw Hermione and Harry getting together, and I still disliked her and Ron together romantically. I can understand his liking her when they were younger and her liking him at the same age (up to about book 4). But I don't think that they would have still liked each other as they got older and more mature (book 5 onwards). I don't /like/ that Rowling made this childhood crush turn into a life-long commitment. I don't have a problem with happy endings or puppy love, but I think it would have been a much more powerful message about friendship if none of the three of them liked any of the others (or ended up together, that is. Liking your friends is totally fine, especially as young teens). I think the Trio should have stayed just friends, and I think it would have been a pretty powerful statement about friendship and what you would do for your friends, rather than a weird third-wheel-but-best-friends dynamic.

** To me, he's a counterpoint. He's pretty much the everyman stuck between an incredibly intelligent nerd and a boy who craves normality in between bouts of death-defying heroics. He's the fulcrum, the boy who tries to balance out the socially stunted tendencies of his two extra-ordinary friends-and succeeds sometimes.

He shows his two counterparts what being a normal teenager is like-the brashness, the need to have fun, the ability to relax and enjoy whatever situation they find themselves in...

In fanfiction, he's generally bashed because it's easy. He's a teen with severe confidence issues. It's ridiculously easy to exaggerate those traits and warp his personality into something ugly.

He's a much more complex character than most give him credit for, but reflecting that complexity is harder than dismissing it and going for the surface detail. It's hard to do the character justice. It's hard to want to, given how easily he got off when he done goofed. Compared to Hermione's ostracism in third year, Ron's punishment for his transgressions is downright tame.

For a dude to still get the girl after technically committing treason in wartime by going AWOL in the middle of a top secret, crucial mission is stupid and one of the major major issues I have with book seven. If it'd been anyone else leading that effort, Ron would've been executed for jeopardising the success of the war. It's part of the reason why I think a lot of writers have severe issues with him and use him as the general purpose scapegoat.

Essentially, he's a less loyal, more complicated Xander to Hermione's Willow and Harry's Buffy. Making sure you write him the way he's meant to be written-the smart boy who acts like an airhead most of the time but is far more perceptive than most can see- is truly one of the greatest challenges when writing an HP fic.

I read a fic not too long ago,, one of the "after the war and before the epilog" things; it was the ONLY one I have read so far in that GINNY defends Rons.

She actually gets up and hugs him after they hear about his leaving. You know since SHE understands what it is like to be under the thrall of a Horcrux. Have to try to refind that one....

** The thing is Ron is the kind of guy I would like as /my/ friend, not someone I want my kids to be friends with.

He's a bad influence type of person, he just has that energy about him that draws you into bad habits really easily. For him everything important about his personality is shifted to the right, in a working-class tory sort of way.

I think that's why if your trying to make a 'better harry' fic, you have to get rid of him. The story I'm doing at the moment I have an oc si Dudley act as a barrier in his mission to make Harry happier/ready for the war, but still have Harry drawn to Ron as a friend.

** I love Ron, but I have trouble seeing him as a romantic lead, so I don't often read about him in anything other than gen or humor. It does really irritate me when people write him as an asshole. Unfortunately, I'm a big fan of Hermione ships, so authors have to come up with /some/ way to remove Ron from the picture... and often, their solution is to make him a dick so that Hermione can run into another man's arms. I've learned to just look past it. It pisses me off sometimes, but I usually don't care enough about it to just give up on a fic (assuming it is good otherwise) unless the bashing gets really out of hand.

I really do think that some people just hate Ron. Weasley-bashing is so crazy common. I don't even get it. The Weasleys are the /best/ people ever. I've never understood the hate people have for them, but it's truly there.

I can stomach these Ron-the-demon fics, but I do think that authors use it too often.

Some of the Weasley-bashing probably comes from the fact that the Weasleys were /so/ well-liked in the books. Some people like to disagree with everything, and others like to purposefully ignore every characterization that canon provides. Hence why Snape can suddenly be dark and mysterious in a good way, rather than a greasy and "get away from the children" way.

Prior to kids/marriage Hermione would never take it...unless she's convinced herself she isn't worthy of anyone but Ron, fixated on him, on the inside she is still the bucktooth bookworm with no friends... Strong Women can do some strange things when they go into denial.

The one author that I think gets Ron absolutely right is *little0bird* on Fanfiction.net. I am in the process of rereading her series of post-DH fanfics, and her Ron is perfect. It is obvious that he has grown up, but he still has his moments, too. This author has the best characterizations by far.

I think that's the reason she's so great: Her characters all have flaws (just like canon) but they're still likable.

*** I agree with your description of Ron here--good hearted, dim, no sense esteem, defined by his flaws. We try to think of him as loyal but really, how many times has he given Harry or Hermione the silent treatment for weeks or months?

Additionally I tend to think of Ron as "the funny one" and the friend character who lightens the mood. He doesn't want conversations to stay tense--or intense, for that matter. I can see why that works narratively, and I admit I enjoy his sense of humor, but that's why I believe he doesn't belong with Hermione; I feel he shies away from exactly the kind of experiences that Hermione lives for.

Also, I totally wanted his brilliance at chess to really /matter/ in the endgame of the novels...like his strategic thinking would somehow translate to the real world of the war against Voldemort. I really didn't see that happen. He was only good at chess to defeat McGonagall's chess set I guess.

*** Well, he's not pointless. His point is to humanize and flaw Harry by creating a counter influence to Hermione (who is pretty out there in terms or real life, even as a gifted person). Thus, Harry and Hermione without Ron, don't become the people we know, or can believe.

For instance, we know Harry is skilled and can learn quickly, but Ron sets the example that that doesn't matter, which is good because that type of person can be pretty hard to resonate with. As a consequence to the story, I would say that Harry gets a lot of his charisma from being friends with Ron.

***** I don't think Fred of George have the same sort of pull that Ron does, their more involved with themselves that you'd only ever really be a satellite friend. Harry needed something deep seated friendship wise, and Ron gives that in boat loads he has a very likable sense around him that if met him in real life in a pub/night out would be fun.

For me Luna seems too out there for a 1st year Harry and it would put him in-between two extremes with Hermione there as well (i think we can agree she is an necessity). Also, you have to remember it was only out of a desperation for company (not Ron or Hermione) that he made a bond with Luna in the first place, he probably wouldn't have considered her otherwise. Even so, I feel she would give him the wrong personality he need a male influence and male friend who also embodied the flaws of being a Gryffindor.

In the book I wouldn't consider Draco too be really cool in any sense, hes a racist for a start and 'friends' he has don't even like him. Moreover, Harry would never be friends with him (or if so, not close friends) unless it was out of absolute necessity (and he did 180 on his personality). Draco is simply too much a bull for Harry to ever really trust him, particularly with his experience of Dudley.

The only sup for Ron i could see working is Seamus, or possibly Dean.
