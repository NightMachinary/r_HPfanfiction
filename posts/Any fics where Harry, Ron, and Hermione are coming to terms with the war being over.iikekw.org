I feel like a lot of fics just gloss over it. Like by the start of 8th year (or Auror training), everything is smoothed over for the most part. Sure there are some where they write in a nightmare here and there. But in reality-there's only like 3 months between the end of the war and where a lot of fics pick up -things don't get back to normal that quickly. Idk maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places. Thank you for any recs!


** Yes! Pitry's the War is Over is exactly that.
