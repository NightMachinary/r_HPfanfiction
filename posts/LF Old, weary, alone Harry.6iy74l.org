Basically, I'm looking for a Harry potter version of Old Man Logan. An old, powerful Harry, who has lost all his friends and family. This doesn't have to be time travel.


** By no means this story fills your quota of request but last chapter of this story kinda similar, lost everything in the war, died alone: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11467524/1/White-Nights][White Nights]]

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
