I'm searching for a fic thats set after the war. Harry is raising Teddy, but Gringotts falls and therefore the economy takes a hit. Everybody struggles to get by. Theres mention of Harry going hungry to feed Teddy. Eventually another bank opens.

Also I've been reading lots of fics where Harry gets dragged into an alternate universe. Can I get any and all recs where this trope is used?


** I don't know if this is the fic you're looking for, but that sounds similar to a fic by CarlieD called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4308033/1/In-War-and-in-Peace][In War and Peace]].

*** Oh wow. This might be it. I thought it would be a one shot - but the author might not have been finished when I read it last. Thank you

**** She's written another fic with a next-gen time travel plot that ties into this one a lot. I remember reading it and thinking that certain details like the Gringotts thing sounded like a rip off of a next-gen fic I read.

Most of these are not completed and some I haven't read in a long while, but they are all in my favorites so there's bound to be good things in there. Enjoy!

** Somewhat off topic (SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT):

I thought Samwise Storyteller had a cool idea with how he intended to end Laocoon's Children (Stealing Harry sequel). His alternate harry would somehow meet the original harry (since his ff was written before HBP), and they'd travel to the past to set off the nail that diverged canon and the fic. The fic was abandoned about 8 years ago unfortunately, and this was in his notes for the fan detailing how he intended the story to continue and finally end. So far, I've yet to read a fic that used this particular plot point
