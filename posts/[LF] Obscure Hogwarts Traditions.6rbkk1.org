Old institutions like Eton or Oxford end up gathering dozens of seemingly bizarre traditions and slang. Has anyone discovered a fic in which Hogwarts is portrayed in this way? From slang for particular lessons/staff/students, to weird magical games only played within the school, to odd formalities between the different year groups?

In absence of existing fics, suggestions for possible traditions is also welcome!


** Saturnalia. Yearly event that takes place in December.

For this week, the Professors and the house-elves swap places; the elves 'teach' for a day, award and take points and handle detentions, while the Professors take care of the castle maintenance, the mopping and polishing and clotheswashing and everything.

At the end of each day is a 'Banquet Lesson', where the house-elves turn the Great Hall into one big kitchen and show all the students (who haven't gone home for the Christmas Holidays, at least) how to use their magic to cook a truly glorious feast.

The Towel Raffle's also become a part of the tradition, over the years; those students who want to, enter in the Raffle a few days before the Saturnalia. The winners get an embroidered towel with their name on it, which they traditionally wear as a loincloth for the whole week (fortunately, said towels come with warming charms).

*** Huh, my reply didn't post.

I was going to say that you reminded me to check out the Wheel of the Year (yes, I know it's not /really/ Pagan but I want astronomy to affect magic so it seems like a good place to start!)

The Towel Raffle made me laugh :') and I looked up Saturnalia and like what I saw!

**** You know what occurs to me? If either of Fred or George won the Towel Raffle, that'd be the one week of the year that you could tell them apart!

Although, eesh...can you imagine going out in the snow dressed in only a towel? Your toes would freeze off.

Come to think of it, I wonder if house-elves ever get runny noses from walking around barely dressed in a big castle in winter?

** I would love to see this! Now I want to incorporate it into one of my fics!

My fic, linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) features the professors betting on which houses the first years will be sorted into, which is kind of a weird tradition?

*** Gambling does seem to be pretty common, doesn't it? Don't Fred and George run bets between students or is that fanon?

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione. Over 75k hits!
