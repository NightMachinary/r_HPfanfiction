For those of you who are not HP fans and history buffs (I can't imagine those traits to commonly overlap), the Habsburgs were a European Dynasty who ruled various states for over 800 years and at their peak controlled a sizeable chunk of the world's population.

The Habsburgs were originally minor German nobility, but they slowly amassed wealth and power by marrying into other families and getting family members elected to certain titles.

The Habsburgs can be compared to the Black family in several ways, and I believe Rowling might have used some comparisons on purpose when writing the books.

The ways the two families compare are as follows:

1. Both the Habsburgs and Blacks seemed to marry into every other major family out there (i.e the Blacks married into the Longbottoms, MacMillians, Weasleys, Malfoys and others and the Habsburgs married into families in Spain, Italy, France, Bohemia, Hungary and Germany), and as a result both families ended up consistently inbreeding and were nearly wiped out because of it. Case in point, Sirius Black's parents were second cousins and Charles II of Spain looked like this: [[https://bit.ly/3bvf702]]

2. Both families had massive influence at their peaks. In OOTP, Sirius mentions that his great-great-grandfather was a respected headmaster of Hogwarts, he had several relatives who headed up St. Mungos, and he had a great uncle (I think) who literally bought himself an Order of Merlin. The greatest of all Habsburgs, Charles V was the ruler of the Spanish Empire and its colonies in the New World and the Indies, Archduke of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, Lord of the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Emperor, which gave him an enormous amount of power and influence across Europe.

3. Both families became stuck in their ways and died out because of it. The Habsburgs lost Spain due to inbreeding in 1700, the Netherlands to the French Revolution, Germany to Napoleon in 1806, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire following WWI in 1918, because their rulers became complacent and refused to adapt to the standards of the new ages.

Likewise, the Blacks died out in the male line because of their refusal to accept family members who supported muggle rights and their possible requirement for male heirs who could produce children to inbreed. They refused to take part in wizarding society and eventually died out.

This concludes my essay on the Habsburgs and the Blacks. If you have anything to add or any feedback please comment below!

P.S. While the Blacks did die out in the male line, they have married into so many families that any relationship between a next-gen Weasley, Potter, Malfoy or Longbottom would be inbreeding, as at they would be at the least 4th or 5th cousins.


** thank you for this, this is very interesting
