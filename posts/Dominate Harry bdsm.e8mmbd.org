** These 3 are probably what you're looking for. The pairing in the 1st and 2nd is Haphne and in the 3rd it's Harry/Fem!TRiddle.

  In 1981, Dark Lady Voldemort murdered Harry Potter's parents and mysteriously perished. In 1993, a fragment of her evil soul almost killed Ginny Weasley, only foiled by Harry's heroic effort. Yet in Harry's fourth year, he learns that the Dark Lady's hold on Ginny's mind was not broken like everyone thought. Harry/fem!Riddle.

**** I've read quite some bdsm smut fics but never with nice aftercare honestly. It's why most smut readers develop a habit of reading short sweet stories after a particularly hardcore one.

***** I have read a little more than a few with aftercare but that might be because I generally don't read bdsm with slash... but that is a great suggestion! I'm definitely gonna do this, thanks:)

** In case you don't know, "dom" (noun) is short for "domin*ant*," which is an adjective or a noun. "Domin*ate*," is a verb. You are looking for a fic in which a /dominant/ Harry /dominates/ a female.

This is an extremely common error in smut and it completely breaks my immersion.
