** Hermione's family loved to explore new places, and she didn't really mind. They seemed to have a knack for discovering picturesque places; peaceful spots where the world seemed to spin slower. Places that were... evocative. Evocative of all the evasive emotions that life never seemed to capture for more than a moment. They led to feelings of the peacability found only in leaving a beloved hometown behind, finally cherishing the preternatural purity of its fresh air, and the soft yet warm embrace of the sun in its sky.

The Forest of Dean was one such place they had found themselves in. While one could argue that the trees that would have towered over giants were dampening the chirrups of the birds and the rushing of of the wind so much that time itself seemed to stand still, Hermione still thought there was a deeper underlying meaning to it all. That is not to say that she didn't believe that was why the forest seemed to evoke such an aura. She did. She just thought that maybe, just maybe, it was peculiar that she felt such peace so infrequently.

Regardless, even breathing in and breathing out, while her parents happily set up camp without a hurry, was truly a treasure here, and so she was desperate to make something of it. It was a euphoria that brought sorrow in its beauty, and the purest of joy from its sorrow. Moments passed in silence. Minutes passed in silence. As she lived, and as surely as she would die, greater meaning eluded her, just as it would for the rest of her life.

The silence stirred a few creative ideas within her, but none too great, and none could be as enriching to any as the peace she had found herself in. They were quickly forgotten without a care, replaced with unadultered appreciation. She was soon stirred out of her reverie by her mother, who called for her to join them in the tent for tea. The tent was a cramped affair, but it didn't spoil the view, and soon she was back in her reviere, undisturbed, even as the chatter picked up again.

Amidst the mind numbing yet enchanting browns of the forest floor and of the tree trunks, which led up to seas of green and blue which were equally captivating, something seemed out of place. But there was nothing out of place. But there was something. Everytime she shuttered her eyes, just for a moment, it was as though she saw something. And so she shuttered her eyes for a moment more. She saw nothing, yet was strangely reminded of a heap of flesh. A heap of flesh the same colour as the putrid tones of the inner eyelid.

Everytime she opened her eye it seemed to remain for a split second, partially, concealed by the coniferous trees. The heap of flesh looked upon closer inspection, wrinkled. It's head, if it could be called that, looked deformed. It looked as though someone bludgeoned it in terror with a tent stake, crumpling its horn, as it slowly approached them even as their eyes were wide open. And it was doing exactly that, moving while appearing stationary, as though she had summoned an unstoppable spectre that would stop at nothing to consume her.

It is said that most who are approached by the crumple horned snorkak are driven mad before it ever reaches them. They hurriedly pull themselves up, then take a hopeful step left or right, their dreams being mercilessly crushed as the snorkak continues on its direct approach to them. It is said that the 73rd Edition of the Quibbler contained the only record of how to escape the beast, and survive to safely observe part of the world Wizards wished wasn't true. Hermione did not know that doing a handstand because you were looking for spatter sprites meant the beast would travel unceasingly under you, because only insane people believed spatter sprites were real. Nobody believed Xenophelious when he thought the snorkak was real, too.

The beast approached Hermione. Upon closer inspection, its crumpled face was mangled in more than a single way. Its teeth had torn the flesh off its lips as far as they could reach. The boundary was marred by the tell-tale signs of puffy, infected flesh. Red, raw, and grotesquely inflamed. The rest of its surface, intermittently pink and purple as it was, looked as though it had been scarred a thousand times in a thousand battles. The snorkak never stopped approaching her. Terrifying didn't describe half of it.
