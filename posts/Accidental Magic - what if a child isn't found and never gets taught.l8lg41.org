I know this happening is probably unlikely, but I'm curious what people think might happen if it did.

Imagine Harry went missing and the letter never got to him. He grows up, never learning to control his magic (but he is still magical).

Does his accidental magic get worse? Would he work out the rudiments of controlling it on his own? Would it fade away until he walked near something magical or got into a dangerous situation?


** I think this was explained by JK in her Quill of Acceptance and Book of Admission entry on Pottermore, with the quill recording every instance of magic done for the first time by anyone and the book only allowing it to write the names of those that do it repeatedly. Also it seems that the wizards do have a way of finding you considering that Hagrid managed to track Harry down even on an island in the middle of the ocean. However probably if a kid absolutely refuses to go to Hogwarts then all the magic build up will turn them in an Obscurial in situations where they lose control according to the Fantastic Beasts canon. Therefore in the spirit of the Statute of Secrecy, probably it is in everyone's best interest that that kid would be taken away to Hogwarts.

*** Yeah, like I said, I knew it'd be unlikely. But there's always a reason to contrive that might make a flaw in that system somehow.

I thought Obscurials were just if they were forced to repress their magic? Like a bursting valve, I suppose. Would they happen if a magical doesn't know how to control their magic as well?

** Check out

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897?view_full_work=true][Life Skills outside the Curriculum]] by Endrina. It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se. complete. Ao3.

Has some interesting ideas about how Harry would deal with accidental magic if he didn't get a letter.

*** How an Obscurial works is you have to deliberately /suppress/ your magic, or be forced to an extreme to do so.

I doubt an Obscurial would come from just not going to Hogwarts or some other magic school, there'd be /way/ more danger of Muggleborn witches/wizards turning into one.

Justin Finch-Fletchley could have been an example of that - his name was down for Eton, one of the most prestigious schools in Muggle Britain. I doubt that him just saying "You know what, I'll take Eton over some unknown school in Scotland" would have made an Obscurial, though him being forced to keep the Statute of Secrecy in that situation might have.

If the child was never /found/ (and thus, not really pressured by having to keep the Statute), I think accidental magic would just sort of keep happening to the same degree until the child figured it out on their own. Canonically your magic doesn't really "grow", you just get smarter and learn how to use it better.
