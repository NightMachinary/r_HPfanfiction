I really like reading about immortal Harry, where the fact that he is immortal is part of the story but not the only thing going on. Crossovers are cool, no harem, no mpreg please. :) Finding Home is one of my favorite stories like this, I highly recommend it. Thanks!


** Hey can you link the fic you are talking about? Sounds like a good read.

*** Yeah definitely! It's one of my favorite crossovers with the Avengers. Takes a couple chapters to really get going though so forgive the first chapter's pacing. :) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]

** My favorite MoD!Harry crossover is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/Illusions-of-Grandeur][Illusions of Grandeur]] by Kanathia, which is a HPxSupernatural fic. It is complete, with an in progress sequel.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

*** Thanks! I've already had a look at these spots, google was very helpful finding those. :P Some of the stories in there are really good! I posted because sometimes fics where the fact that Harry is immortal/MoD isn't the biggest plot point don't come up in searches because the author didn't tag it that way, but usually the more subtle ones like that are my favorites. Thanks for the recs! :)
