Mines Not From Others, I am always recommending it even if the request doesn't completely fit lol What's yours? What's a fic that you love so much that you consider it more canon than canon, or you genuinely wish you could have a physical copy of it. Or you actually tell your friends you read fanfic just so you can get them to read it. What is your absolute number 1 that you will never stop going back to


** Right now? “Harry is a Dragon and that's ok” but it's probably a bit ... not exciting enough for some.

*** This is one of those that I find way overrated. It's not bad or anything, but people make it out to be a great work of literature when it comes off more like a highschool writing prompt complete with over the top prose. The entire "scars make you beautiful" thing is also not particularly unique either. Its like it was written just to show off the prose and for nothing else. If it was long enough to have a little bit of character development for Dennis then I'd probably be able to overlook the overdone prose. It seems like a lazy take on a potentially good story idea.

The author just completed Book 5 of 7 and it was a BANGER of a story. Even better, they don't write half completed stories: nothing is published until the full work is complete, then it is released twice a week until finished, so you won't ever be left hanging any more than you were for the actual HP books.

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

** It has been a long time since I came here, a long time too since I really read a new story in this fandom.

Still, one of my favorite is A Long Journey Home by Rakeesh, story is dead unfortunately, but still one of the best, the top of fanfiction.

And, on crossover, I can think of two with Star Wars which could be worth the top position, if not for the Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger. To be clear, it is probably better for Tolkien fan than HP fan but my god, it is masterfully done.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

Given it doesn't change canon just speculates on what happened in the intervening years helped a purist like me get used to the idea of fan fiction. Helps that the whole series is a real tear-jerker initially but helps the characters get over the devastating war they were in.

** If you're in the mood for a crossover that has depth and is well written, linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger)

It's a LOTR/HP crossover and you can tell that Steelbadger has a boatload of passion for both of the fandoms. LOTR has depths that the average reader of the trilogy never even get introduced to, and this story has managed to tie a lot of the obscure, deep lore from The Silmarillion and the Appendices into a well done crossover in an elegant way. I won't pump sunshine up [[/u/SteelbadgerMk2][u/SteelbadgerMk2]]'s ass and say his writing is Tolkien-Esque, but it's as close as you would expect any fanfic writer to get to.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** *Mischief's Heir* (series)\\
*Say a Prayer* (first fic) linkao3(4629198)\\
This fic covers A LOT of the plotholes that JKR left behind. It overwrites a few things, like Dumbledore always having the Elder Wand. Adds a new villain that explains Azkaban, and how Dark Lords always seem to be cropping up all of the time. And how the Blood Wars happened. Seriously, Magical Britain alone is so intermarried that practically everybody is related. Why would they go around killing their own relatives? Especially when you have betrothal contracts and whatnot that could cause another family to come to your defense, which causes another to come in, ad infinitum.

Anywho, the Marvel crossover in my opinion tastefully done. Besides Loki, you have SHIELD, HYDRA, and the Avengers. It adds a very realistic way for the Statute of Secrecy to be put in danger. Besides Loki, they are background elements, aside from a few interactions.

The Harry/Hermione/Ron relationship is great. They have their arguments, Harry and Ron flourish. Which is explained in a very convincing manner.

** Harry Potter's Second Chance. Yeah I know Severitus isn't everyone's cup of tea, and I actually don't normally like fics with deaging in them. But I love this so, so much. It's one of the few fics I can think of that has a genuinely well developed OC who furthers the plot and the development of other characters. And if anyone deserves a second chance at a childhood, it's Harry.

** To Play the Devil and its sequels are still my absolutely favourite HP fic series, simply because there's no other fic in the fandom like it. If you like dark fantasy, old European mythology and folklore, mixed with a bit of realism, I absolutely recommend the fic.

*** I love To Play the Devil and its sequels (so happy that a new chapter came out yesterday), but I'm intrigued you say 'a bit of realism'. It always read, to me, like a crack fic that went off the rails and became a bit more serious.

Edit: when I say crack fic I mean that it began with the whole premise of Voldemort and Harry teaming up (for incredibly shaky reasons) to go off and solve a few kidnappings. There were those weird bits in early versions about wizarding tourists in shifting coloured robes, and Harry teasing Voldemort about his choice of name whilst in hiding. It just felt a bit wacky at first.

**** It does seem quite crackish at times, doesn't it! Even the author admitted that To Play the Devil had many flaws in terms of pacing and certain poorly-planned plot lines, apparently due to the fact that the author did not have a clear narrative in mind and actually brainstormed each chapter(!) But I do think the underlying themes of “outdated heroism”, in that the story seems to be both a homage to, and deliberate subversion of heroic fantasy tropes, is a breath of fresh air. In any sense, I am personally of the opinion that plot doesn't really matter that much, in comparison to good characterisation and thematic coherence; and I think To Play the Devil did very well in those departments. Fortunately, its sequels are more cohesive, plot-wise.

Edit: I've just read and reviewed the new chap as well! Fantastic stuff, in true Lovecraftian style!

***** Absolutely. The underlying ability to tell a ripping-good yarn and spin out some interesting themes really makes the story worth reading. I think that they admit and know (I'd be interested if you could remind me where to look for that) that it wasn't very clear does credit to them really and perhaps makes the story more enjoyable for me in retrospect as an experience.

The characterisation was really its strong point, more so I felt than the second part (though I'm really enjoying the characterisation in the third instalment, even though I get the feeling that they may be straining a little under the weight of integrating the last two stories with this one).

****** Well-said! The author, The Wayland Smith, seem to be extremely personable and humble. I may have been exaggerating a bit about the brainstorming, but you can read some of their thoughts about To Play the Devil [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/299060749][here]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/comments/184340432][here]]. Each of the sequels had very distinctive themes from the first, I would say, which is why they're a little hard to get into. I personally had difficulty enjoying “The Traveller” until I did some cursory research and gained some surface knowledge of Scottish/Gaelic mythology and folklore, as well as Arthurian mythology, which are apparently huge overarching thematic elements driving the story. And “The Lord in the Mist” is another narrative whiplash, like you said haha. I'm committed to the series, and I love what the author is putting out, but sometimes I do wish we'd get a continuation of the original universe. Obviously the main characters in this instalment are very different from the ones in the first story. I'm not sure how to feel about that, to be honest...

*** Hmm... The mention of European mythology reminds me of a Miraculous Ladybug fanfiction I've been following, actually, which blends the Miraculous magic with the Celtic fair folk. The first two books are mostly light enough for a bedtime story for age eight or so, lots of well executed friendship building, but the third arc has a lot about trauma recovery (let's just say that the folk became /more involved/ in the protagonists' lives and it didn't go well for anyone).

  Regulus survives the cave and goes to his older brother for help. He strikes a deal with Dumbledore: the Horcrux in exchange for his family's protection. Sirius, meanwhile, is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing his estranged parents, who find they like having both their sons back and are prepared to use all their cunning to make this temporary family reunion permanent.

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history loom large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker---and more boring---than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web.

but i really love the following:

​

linkao3(i give you all of me (all of you)) (fem!harry with a very very interesting relationship w tom riddle)

linkao3(crazy little things) lovely luna/hermione fluff. absolutely delightful pairing

linkao3(perhaps) lovely cissamione, works super well. probably the best cissamione story objectively, other than

linkao3(Extinction) best *completed* cissamione

linkao3(Our Mercurial Selves) classic Bellamione. Actually finished lol

​

linkao3(to reach without) really good fem!harry and trans!harry, but abandoned. The author's newer stuff is much less interesting imo bc they seem to have a thing for writing sociopathic good characters. It's kind of a gimmick they've gotten into. In this one Harry is a full fledged human being with emotions lol

​

linkao3(occurances) fleurmione with a really cute backstory

probably a couple more bellamione that i'm forgetting tbqh.

  “I'm Harry,” she finally offers when the silence in the cupboard feels like it's going to overwhelm her. “Harry Potter.” There's a warm sense of satisfaction resting in her stomach, not her own, and Harry doesn't know why Tom seems so smug. It's wonderful to meet you, Harry he practically purrs, sounding like he's whispering directly into her ear. Harry twitches, a small smile starting to grow on her face. “Are you going to help me, Tom?” If you'll let me. I'll take very good care of you, Harry. Tom Riddle starts talking to Harry when she's six.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever.

The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

****** Well, some people do like it, that's why it's in the top ten most favorited on FFN. It just does things that turn a lot of people off. Super!Harry. Dumbledore bashing. Harry/Hermione love at first sight. Super!goblins. If you like it, you'll probably like his other work too. If not, you have plenty of company.

******* ....i have a bad feeling about this.

I don't mind BAMF!harry or super!harry whenever i want to do a light read (i even made a request for these fics in this sub), but this fic seems like just a collection of often used tropes. H/hr love at first sight is giving me warning bells lol but i will give it a chance. Wish me luck lol

******** It's over 700k words, so not really a light read, which is why I haven't read all that far myself. But yes, 11-year old Hermione sees Harry on the train platform and decides that he looks like Mr Darcy except too gorgeous even for Jane Austen to describe and that her mother's talk about boys is relevant to her after all.
