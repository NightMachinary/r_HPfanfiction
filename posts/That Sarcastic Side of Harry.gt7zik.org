I love the Harry Potter books, even if you look into them too deep you can see a lot of issues, I don't let it bother me, because it's a fun read.

But, upon saying that, it's rather unfortunate, that people write about Harry being the brooding character, or the filled with regret character, or some such, that I feel like authors forget Harry being sarcastic.

I loved his sass in the books, it was regular teenage sass, but a lot of fun. "No need to call me Sir, Professor" to Snape, or "It changes every day, you see" in regards to why he was listening to the news.

I want more scenes like that. It can be a minor thing or a major. The story itself can be comedy, drama, serious, adventure or anything else.

For pairings (if any): Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

No Weasley Bashing. If Harry is smarter and/or more powerful then in canon, that's fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can be: Oneshots/Drabbles/Multichapters.

Can be as close to Canon, or as AU as possible. Can be magical or Muggle setting. Can be Time Travel, Traveling to another AU or anything else.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not, that's fine.

Edit: Don't want him being pretentious/stuck up or the like.


** That's tough. To write a sarcastic character well kind of requires the author to be funny, otherwise the sarcastic character just comes off as a jerk. I don't think I could figure out how to balance it.
