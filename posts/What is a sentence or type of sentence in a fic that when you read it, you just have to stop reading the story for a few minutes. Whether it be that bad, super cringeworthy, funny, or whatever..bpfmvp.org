Trying to find a good way to describe what I'm thinking when I say this, but anytime Harry will go to Gringotts and has to fill out several forms which will grant him powers as the Lord Paramount of such and such house, and the author takes great care describing that bureaucratic rambling process, I just tune out.

Also, any type of children in Slytherin scheming, where kids are acting like adults, makes me cringe as well.

"Harry looked over at the young, blonde girl with the ice blue eyes. 'Hello, Potter, would you like to form an alliance,' said Daphne, angling her nose into the air like a haughty aristocrat.

Dumbledore being visibly horrified by that makes sense, since Horcruxes are supposedly the darkest of the dark arts, so twisted that nobody had dared to go beyond one. To make multiple Horcruxes was an idea so evil Dumbledore had not even considered it.

It was always in the narration, and it was always some weird fragment question, and it was ALMOST ALWAYS followed with ‘yeah. That won't end well'. I read the whole story, but it drove me up the wall. Of course can't remember the name of the fic now. 🤷‍♀️

‘Daphne hoped Harry never found out. Because this? Yeah. This was going to knock everyone for a loop.'

‘Ron turned to Hermione with a look of shock. That face? Yeah. This was going to go poorly.'

** Anything that ultimately results in heartbreak causes me to pause reading a fic for a bit, but usually not to stop entirely. Who the involved parties are, or the exact context (rejection, death, acceptance to a 3rd party, misunderstood signals) doesn't matter much, but some cases are worse than others.

It has gotten to the point where I have a habit of spoiling endings of fics to myself for tropes/ships especially prone to this, because fics where this is an /ending/ can kill my mood for over an hour or worse if I was particularly invested. I've never really understood why this happens, because I don't actually have any notable experience of this kind of burn in real life, which would be the obvious source of this reaction otherwise. Not even death causes this (except when a death has heartbreak as a side effect) -- probably because HP death has a fully functional afterlife in my headcanon.

While I don't know when I started to have this response (it hasn't always been around), I think the major reason it's as strong as it is, is because I tend to completely lose myself in fics emotionally, basically "becoming" the protagonist, including inheriting all emotional responses, etc.
