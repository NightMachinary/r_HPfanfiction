To tackle the task of getting the golden egg, Harry gets a pet niffler (platypus like magical creature, loves shiny objects, has a deep pouch, travels underground) and trains it. They bond very well.

On the day of the first task, Harry Potter's pet niffler, eager to please his caretaker, brings him his latest haul. Harry didn't even had to step into the arena. Judges are impressed (even Karkaroff couldn't resist giving ten points) by the sheer brilliance of the idea. They, along with the audience, soon realize that many of their trinkets are missing. Too bad they already gave their scores.

While Harry doesn't know what to do with the mountain of shiny hair pins, buttons, and many other trinkets.

Oh, and he was suddenly significantly more richer.

And is that Dumbledore's beard?!


** i was actually thinking of a prompt like this recently. harry goes back in time or something and can only bring one thing with him

or: harry brings a fucking niffler that steals fucking everything and suddenly being broke isn't a problem anymore
