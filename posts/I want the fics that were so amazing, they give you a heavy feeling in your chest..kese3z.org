Something so fantastic that you had to stop reading for a few days in honor of it. Something written so well that everything after it seems bland in comparison. Something filled with such emotion, such truth, that they might as well be the words of a genius philosopher.


** I was rereading linkffn(Grow Young With Me) recently and had to stop at chapter 18 because I knew what was coming and couldn't bear it.

(The summary makes it sound like a soap opera, but that's misleading. If you want to know what it's like, just read chapter 1 and decide whether you like Abby.)

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]] by MissKingBean69.

^{^} An incredible story I ended up binging on one night. Marauders era that follows Remus but he's brought up in a children's home so real rough around the edges. It's the OCs that make this story. There's not many but holy crap the ones that do break your heart. I can't even think of Grant without crying. He's a muggle who is just doing his best and is such a GOOD man. This story is cannon to me. It's so achingly wonderful and heartbreakingly emotional I can't begin to describe it.

--------------

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle]] series by Flamethrower.

^{^} I will never stop talking about this. It's holy shirtballs incredible. It's 11 books long. It covers the Founders Era, Marauders Era, Present Day but in a whole new light.

The main reason I like it so much is because of the detail gone into all the little things. Like the language barriers of the Founders era when Britain was a mishmash of invaders. Or the politics in wizarding law and ministry, what it means to have a title. Or the amount of Magic. Elemental magicians, magical masteries, what they mean. The culture of different races. The intertwined family trees. History, cold wars, moon landings and how that impacts the world It's stunning. An incredible amount of thought has gone into every tiny detail and it's just wonderful to read. I am gobsmacked with every chapter it's just epic.

^{^{^}} I have a weakness for Black Family stories but this one always hits home. It's a short oneshot of the consequences Sirius deals with when his family realise he's changed his subjects. It's so perfect. How Orion acts is ice cold. How Sirius deals with it is terrifying. This is just a great representation of how I think the Black family is and it's the story I always come back to. It's chilling.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  Lily remembered her sister, how there had been a time she was curious and delighted about magic, before it slowly sank in that she could look and not touch.The last thing Petunia had said to Lily before she died was a chilly goodbye, ending a holiday dinner where they'd had a shrieking row in the entryway. Petunia had said 'freak' and Lily had hissed 'better than this, better than this being my whole fucking world, Tune, do you even see yourself, are you happy--'And now here was Dudley Vernon Dursley fussing himself to sleep as Lily walked the halls of the Godric's Hollow house. His tiny soft hands with their tiny soft fingernails curled under her chin, the same way Harry's always had.She passed James, who was gently bouncing his way up the hall the opposite way. "I think he's asleep," James mouthed over Harry's tousled head. His hair was the same mess, his head bent down as he peered at his sleeping son.Lily stopped where she stood, her nephew heavy on her chest, her husband smiling, her sister buried. "James," she said. "How are we going to do this?"

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.
