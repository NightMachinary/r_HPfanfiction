What I mean by the title: I am not looking for stories where the fanfic writer just changes Harry's gender or put another OC female character in the story and then change almost nothing in the story.

I am looking for stories where the writer is not afraid to change the canon and try to expand the "Harry Potter universe"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/The-odds-were-never-in-my-favour][The odds were never in my favour]] is a good example where the female Harry is not the "child-who-lived". There are a lot of changes in the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13510736/1/Spells-in-Silence][Spells in silence]] is another good example

​

Thank you for any recommendation


** The Changeling was pretty awesome if I'm recalling correctly. Ginny is the protagonist, and she gets sorted into Slytherin.

** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) might be just what you're looking for. The world building is incredible particularly in potions, mind magic, and Diagon Alley. Riddle never becomes Voldemort and changes the wizarding world through politics instead of violence. The author just finished 4th year and the next fic should be published within the next few months.

** The Pureblood Pretense definitely fits the bill. Female Harry pretends to be her “cousin” in order to go to a Pureblood only Hogwarts, and Riddle is a politician.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)

Alexandra Quick also, which is a series at an entirely new school in the US.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079]]

And if you don't mind self recs, I have a female Slytherin Harry series. She is selectively mute when she arrives at Hogwarts. Some of the same events happen as in canon but they don't end the same (there are different solutions) and it mostly focuses on my own plots and scenes and is very focused on family and on female friendship.

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

I feel like I should also mention The Changeling) which is Slytherin Ginny focused.

Linkao3(The Changeling)

And The Arithmancer, which is Hermione focused but does start out with the same plots as in canon but rapidly diverges.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
