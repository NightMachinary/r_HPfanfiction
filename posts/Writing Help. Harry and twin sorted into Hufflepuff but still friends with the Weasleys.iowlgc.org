I want to write a fic where Harry and his twin (I know, cliche) get sorted into Hufflepuff. Growing up with the Dursley's, they'd be unwanted and tormented. Their only source of comfort and love would be each other, and, as a result, they'd have a fierce loyalty and attachment to one another; hence they'd be sorted into the house of the loyal. (The twin also has a lot of other Hufflepuff qualities: hard working, kind, just, etc.)

They meet Ron on the train, like canon, and become fast friends. I could simply have them remain friends while being in different houses, but I don't think they'd be as close. Not /nearly/ as close.

They'd be in different dorms, different classes, different common rooms... Not a lot of time to bond is what I'm getting at.

With them not being such good friends, it leads to a lot of missing plot. Ron and the twins not rescuing Harry from the Dursley's in the second book. Them not going to the Quidditch World Cup, and lots and lots of other stuff. You know what I'm talking about. Not to mention, the Weasleys are my favorite part of the story, and I don't want to write it without them.

On the other hand, I could simply put Ron in Hufflepuff, but I'm afraid that might be a cop-out.

Ron /is/ very loyal, and I think Hufflepuff might help him to be less prejudice and more open minded. It could give his character a lot of development, but there's a small problem... All the Weasleys are in Gryffindor, and, IMO, he's more of a Gryffindor than a Hufflepuff. He is loyal, even though he makes mistakes due to his insecurities, but he doesn't really have any other Hufflepuff traits. I would say he was pretty patient when Harry went all teenage angsty for awhile, so there's that.

Anyways, maybe after seeing his two new friends- not to mention one of them is famous for defeating The Dark Lord- become badgers, he'd want to join them. Maybe? I don't know...

I also played at the idea of not all the Weasleys being in Gryffindor. We don't really know much about Bill and Charlie. They both have awesome jobs where you have to be brave, but maybe they value another trait more? Just because you're sorted into a house other than Gryffindor, it doesn't mean you're automatically a coward.

Maybe after one of his older brothers were sorted into another house, Percy accepted his Slytherin quality's and joined the snakes. (Although, that probably wouldn't do him any favors at home.) This would make Ron's sorting less... odd?

Before you say it, I know the hat picks based off what you value most rather than the traits you already possess. It's just an idea... Don't come for me, please.

What do you think? Any other ideas? Please help.

Also, sorry for any grammatical errors. I'm on mobile and about to go to bed, so I know it's not as perfect as I'd normally like it to be. Thanks!


** Ron following them to Hufflepuff would actually work I think. This was the case in another fic( I don't remember the name) and it was done well enough that it didn't feel out of character at all. After all, he IS 11 and kinda starstruck to meet Harry. After seeing how nice Harry is, following him would be like a natural reaction for an impressionable child. This is coming from someone who's completely for Gryffindor Weasleys. Even if the others are in Gryffindor, Ron in another house could work vey well if done properly.

Would love reading your fic btw. Would you mind promoting it here when you post it?

*** I would love to see a Hufflepuff Ron, and though I adore him, he'd have to show himself as hardworking, and for that he'll need good motivation to become hardworking. I can definitely see it happen, though it's up to OP to create a believable motivation.

**** Well canon Ron did want to stand out from his brothers. You'd think this would make him really motivated, but Rowling never really explored that side of him.

***** But wanting to stand out would rather fit Slytherin. To make a name for himself and such are ambitions. I mean, that's half the reason the hat wanted to stick Harry there.

*** Thanks for the reply!

Ron in Hufflepuff seems like the best solution, I'm just worried that people would perceive it as taking the easy way out. But I'm glad you think it would work.

The fic is still in early development and I don't like to post until I get a majority of it done or at least planned. But I'll definitely promote it when I post it if you'd like! :)

** Don't feel like you have to follow canon. Also, I don't feel like Ron is prejudiced. Not too prejudiced for Hufflepuff. It doesn't even say you have to be non-judgmental to be a Hufflepuff, and please consider the Hufflepuffs shunning Harry because they thought he joined the Triwizard tournament deliberately and took Cedric's glory, and their judging him for being a parselmouth.

*** Oh, I'm definitely not following canon. I just want the Weasleys to still be a major part of the story because I love them. I just used canon examples to make my point.

I think Ron is pretty prejudiced against Slytherin. (So is Harry.) When I picture Hufflepuff, I picture most of them being good and open people. I know not all of them are that way, but I don't think most would be discriminatory. I think Ron and Harry being around more open minded people would be good for them.

Now, the Hufflepuffs had their reasons for being upset with Harry, IMO. Keep in mind most of them have no clue what actually goes on behind the scenes, and “famous Harry Potter” just stole their one way ticket to having a little glory for their house. Hufflepuff are widely known for being “duffers” or just extras who don't really fit into any of the other houses. Of course, we know this isn't true; Hufflepuffs are awesome, but this would give them their chance to prove it. I'd be a little upset too, honestly. From the outside, it seems that Harry put his name in the goblet on his own. They don't really know the whole Voldemort plot behind the scenes.

Also, the whole school judged Harry for being a Parseltongue. (Not that I think it's okay. Just pointing it out.)

You also have to remember Hufflepuffs are loyal. I don't think they'd discriminate against their own so easily.

** Have you considered splitting the twins between the houses? If you keep the perspective mostly on the Hufflepuff twin you can explore the alt house dynamic but still maintain a foothold in canon relationships.

** Eh, I think it is a good approach to his character arc. The idea of diversifying where families are sent also seems interesting, I would suggest making Bill set the example by going to Ravenclaw (could also be explained by him going into cursebreaking because of his curiosity to learn more about the older forms of magic and the culture of other countries. With the older and coolest brother setting the precedent and their parents reacting well (I sincerely can't see either Mr. or Mrs. Weasley letting a sorting affect in anyway the way they treat their children) the younger siblings would feel comfortable letting the hat put them wherever they are best suitable, Charlie would probably still go to Gryffindor, while Percy going to Slytherin would indeed suit him well, the twins... actually could fit well in any house, and Ginny would probably still be a shoe-in for Gryffindor.

** You could probably put Ron in Hufflepuff. The Hat seems to listen to the wishes of the student, at least to some extend (Harry and Hermione sorting in Canon), so he could probably "accept" to put Ron there is he asks for it. Ron is also a loyal character, which is a Hufflepuff quality , and at worst you could also play with Hufflepuff reputation of acception anyone (see Zacharias Smith, who didn't seem to have . . . any quality).

Also, Canon Ron (and the Weasley in general) are not really prejudicied. Sure, his parents would probably be a bit uneasy about him being Sorted in Slytherin, but it would be more because of who would be his roomates that the House itself (Arthur's mother is believed to be a Black after all). Hufflepuff is a "safe" House, so while some people like the Twins could tease him about his Sorting (not being Gryffindor and all), and Malfoy may mock him for being in the "uselessé House, most people would accept it relatively quickly and without any troubles.

** As others have mentioned, Ron being sorted into Hufflepuff is a decent option. He gets sorted after Harry, and could easily want to be in the same house as him. Another option would be Ginny being sorted there second year, if you keep her crush on/celebrity worship of Harry. That would give a little more interaction between them and the other Weasleys if you keep her brothers in Gryffindor, and if they become friends with Ginny and Ron you can keep the other interactions outside of Hogwarts despite them having less screentime with Ron.

** I don't really understand what you're going for. Harry and a twin, they lean on each other and so Hufflepuff, sure, I might even say it makes sense.

As far as I can tell you're asking how indulgent can you be? To which the answer is as much as you want because it is your story. If you want to put Ron in Hufflepuff just because you want the Weasleys involved, sure you can do that. If you're asking if I think it is a good idea the answer is no. Other than having Ron in the story because you want Ron there I don't think he adds anything. You have a twin for Harry, a foil an ally, everything Ron was. I would say that if you have the twin and they shared the abusive background I would be more interested if they were very close to the point they were distrustful of others. Hermione dies, Ginny goes missing, they don't feel safe at Hogwarts and stick together even more.

To keep bloat to a minimum you want as few characters as possible. If you're in Hufflepuff with a twin you already have a lot of characters to come up with. Adding Ron isn't just indulgent, it might be lazy. That's fine, it is your story. You do whatever you want.

*** I wasn't necessarily asking how to put Ron into the story. I was just asking whats the best way to still have the Weasleys involved in their lives.

I'm not trying to write an indulgent fic. It's meant to be a serious story that explores how things would be different in the scenario I have planned. I guess I just have an attachment to the Weasleys that I don't want to let go of.

I appreciate your reply even though it was a bit impolite at certain points. Thanks.
