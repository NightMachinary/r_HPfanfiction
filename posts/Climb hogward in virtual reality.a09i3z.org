** First of all, you misspelled Hogwarts on all 5 Harry Potter related subs that you posted this on. Please proofread, because misspelling the most important and iconic location in the HP universe on five different subs dedicated to the HP universe just gives people a lower opinion of you from the start

Second, this just comes off as a way to promote your channel, instead of sharing the map with the community. The map creator obviously put in a ton of work to make this. Just include the download links for the game or map in the post along with your gameplay next time you do one of these. That way people don't /have/ to click on your video to click on the link, but your video is still there as a helpful reference. Your method now just seems a bit scummy.

Third, this game looks laggy. Is that the game, your computer specs, or your recording? Because some of your footage from other games seems to be laggy as well.

Fourth, about the actual game, while the game looks simple and easy to understand with the mechanics you show in your video, it looks boring and bland and takes away any feeling of life from the Hogwarts castle.
