:END:
I'm fuzzy on the details. There was only one (maybe two) chapters done when I read it. Harry's been behaving oddly, and Hermione uses the Marauder's Map to find a now-sex-swapped Harry in the Room of Requirement I think? Harry used a potion she'd been brewing IIRC.

I think it was on ffnet, but can't seem to find it.
