:END:
Harry's parents are killed by Voldemort but the dark lord decided to adopt him. A detailed blood ritual is done to finalize their family relation and then Harry goes to Hogwarts with the last name of Riddle and new changes in his body due to the ritual. Prior to leaving, Harry is training in martial arts then later attempts to bring Neville during his workout at Hogwarts who first fails spectacularly but later develops a better endurance. He writes letters to his father address as Tom Riddle during the school year. Also becomes friends with Luna who he later fucks in the Forbidden Forest (only mentioned in one chapter).

This was a M rated story with multiple lemons. There were probably around 50 chapters last I read 5+ years ago. It may have been deleted years ago due to the lemons but I'm interested to see if anyone can give links to it.


** I read this less then a year ago(or at least part of it, I'm horrible at finishing fics). I will see if I can find it saved on my book marks. Or history.

I don't know if that's the exact one you are looking for. Lily and James didn't die but they thought Harry's twin was the chosen one. If I remember right they gave him to the Dursley's still. Voldemort took him from there and did some ritual thing to make Harry his son.
