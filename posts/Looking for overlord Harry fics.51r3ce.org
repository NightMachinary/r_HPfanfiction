Looking for a story similar to linkffn(5155522). I mean this in the sense that he is evil, has his own lands and crap, and is an OP overlord.

Over 70k+ words!

EDIT: It doesn't have to be in conjunction with the overlord game! I just meant that he is an overlord, not necessarily part of the game!


** Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1117301]]) Harry recounts how and why he took over Britain to Dumbledore.
