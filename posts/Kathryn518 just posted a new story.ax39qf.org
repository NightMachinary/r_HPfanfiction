Toward the bottom, some updates are given about I'm Still Here. Plums is also alive, and also just posted a new story.


** Kathryn's finally back? Plums is back after more than four years? Wow. Between this and The Merging finally nearing completion in the recent months, I have to thank whatever genie apparently granted all my wishes.

We'll, considering it went more than a year between updates before, I'm still happy.

  The Goblet of Fire is a powerful magical artifact. Powerful enough to lock four powerful magicals to a binding magical contract even when one is unwilling. What else can it do to fulfill a contract? Pull someone to fulfill a contract from a distance? Reach across space and time? Summon the dead?

I sure hope they update it :)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

Edit - After reading the posted chapter, I really hope the older stories get updated. This new story started out horribly.

Great start. Also, I'm willing to bet that Hermione landed in the parallel world too somehow, and arrived at the logical conclusion that Harry has somehow fucked up and is at fault.
