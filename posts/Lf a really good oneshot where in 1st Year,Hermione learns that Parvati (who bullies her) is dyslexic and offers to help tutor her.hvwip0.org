** I don't know this one (and I would love to read it), but for anybody who is interested in stories which mention somebody (quite often Crabbe or Goyle, but Pansy happens as well) having dyslexia and usually the magical world is completely lost (so it is diagnosed by Harry, Hermione or some other Muggle-raised students; *no endorsement on any of these stories, some of them are quite bad*):

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
