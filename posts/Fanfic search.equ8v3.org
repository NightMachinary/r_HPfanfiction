Please, if anyone is out there, help me find a fanfic. I forgot the name and I'm desperate ðŸ˜­ It's a Drago/ Hermione fanfic. It happens during the half blood prince (6 th year) . Harry is cheating in potions with the half blood prince's book, and Hermione is getting frustrated with him. So I think she teams up with Drago to play a prank on Harry in potion class, while she distract him . Then they start getting feelings after :) Please if you have any idea let me know !
