No crossovers, please.

I don't mind ships. Throw 'em at me.

Harry doesn't have to have a happy ending.

(By the way, if you know one where Harry gets cursed and becomes depressed and commits suicide, but the curse breaks and he lives, please tell me. I wanna find that one.)


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617][An Hour of Wolves]] linkao3(14164617) has a whole bunch of triggers (PTSD, rape, eating disorders, self-harm) so proceed with caution, but is excellent. WIP.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

#+begin_quote
  Terror and destruction seemed inevitable after Voldemort finally revealed himself to the Wizarding World but, at Hogwarts, Harry lives a disturbingly unchanged life. He exists in parallel to the people around him and, as time passes, the line between friend and foe stretches into a complex gradient, difficult to decipher. Seeking desperately to become the hero the Order needs, it becomes more and more clear to him how dangerous that prospect is.But, in a life fraught with crisis and tragedy, what's just a little more?

**** There are so many stories I like:

- anything from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]]

- almost anything from [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/White_Squirrel/pseuds/White_Squirrel][White_Squirrel]] (although the last Animagus at War is dragging too long)

- following Northumbrian, I like something which I would call magician realism: more oriented on good story and characters, rather than BAMF!Harry and obscure magic. I have just suggested [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] to somebody.

- anything related to Petunia (and Dudley) Dursley, so for example I like stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], or linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) and its sequel. Just writing continuation of linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee).

That's enough for now.
