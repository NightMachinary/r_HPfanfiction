Rather, Harry becomes a blood Mage, or something, and his blood is addictive to vampires. I don't think he actually became a vampire.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.
