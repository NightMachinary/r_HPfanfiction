The story seems to jump, and it feels like is missing info, especially his parents reactions, they just seem to agree to let him go with a stranger to do some wanky magic without any thoughts. That isn't rational. I'm currently reading chapter 10, and it feels like a lot of info is missing...

** Though I like HPMOR a lot, I've come to understand its flaws. But it gets a lot of slack from me mostly due to it's use of time turners. I haven't read a fanfic that used fixed-timeline time travel in such an awesome way. Not that that could save the Azkaban chapters from being a slog to get through.

At it's best HPMOR is the perfect example of the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool][rule of cool.]] At it's worst its an OOC and preachy Mary Sue fanfic. For me the fun parts are worth the bad stuff. For others, it isn't.

And it definitely suffers from hype backlash. Wouldn't be so much hate if it weren't for so many people treating it like it were better than the actual books.

**** Okay, so one of the main problems with methods is that it tells a lot, but doesn't show. You will, for instance, be told about Harry'sâ€‹ emotional reaction to something, which could have been heavy had we not been told well after the event took place and Harry is merely recounting it.

Then their are other things. Characters being ooc, episodic nature of chapters, the lack of any science actually taking place. There's very little investigation into how magic works. Then combine this with Harry's way of science, which is to see a problem, think really hard, then come up with the answer, which is an awful way to investigate something.

But one of the worst things is the way the world seems to bend over for Harry. Adults seem to take his silly threats seriously rather than treating him like the horrible brat he is, problems exist in the world purely for him to point at and say how stupid the wizarding world is, other children seem to worship the ground he walks on etc... He's a Mary Sue, only for intellectual 20 something's rather than teen girls.

I might have strayed a little, and there's probably alot of things that I missed, but you should be able to get a good idea of why this story can be pretty bad. It has good moments, but it's just overshadowed for me by its many flaws.

***** This particular fault of HPMoR can be summed up as "By the time the author realized he wanted to make a story and not a series of humorous/scienc-ey oneshots, it was too late."

It's like Less got to chapter 40 before suddenly deciding, "Maybe I don't want this to /just/ be crack."

******* Well, there's always the classic linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), infamous for being a great example of the exact opposite of this done in a way that actually makes it resemble this somehow. It isn't exactly rational, but it has the cracky vibe this has without going too overboard.

More in line with what you want is linkffn(Harry Potter and The Nautral 20), starring a very munchkinny protagonist with DnD Magic (don't need setting or mechanics knowledge to follow this, does its own thing with the rules as written). Bonus points for a later arc of a random muggle who uses tech to spoof the Obliviators and learn about magic. Really well done, hits a lot of the same notes as MOR in new and exciting ways.

Previously reccommened are linkffn(Blindness) and linkffn(The Arithmancer), which are both also awesome in their own way. Actually, anything by the author of Arithmancer is awesome. The dude recently took on the "reading the books" cliche just to see if writing a genuinely good story with it was even possible, and somehow it actually worked.

All of these are more approximations than genuine ratfic, as the stuff is incredibly rare in its purest form, and materializes in the strangest places (for reasons no one understands the two best (or at least two among them) are based from Twlight and My Little Pony, probably two of the single least likely sources possible for the stuff)

I'm not sure that merely referencing real maths (linear algebra, group theory, etc) is enough to qualify as a rational fic. A rational fic about maths would probably be really boring if it contained multi-chapter math proofs to solve a problem. People are already annoyed by the long-winded rational explanations in Methods of Rationality...

** People on this sub seem to hate on this fic, but I guess it just appeals to a very specific audience.

Anyway, why isn't it rational to send your child to a magic school if magic exists (which has been proven to them without a doubt)? It's the only sensible option.

And no, nothing is missing... a lot of it is written in a "vignette" style, only showing the important bits. IMHO it actually flows pretty well, but I guess most fanfic authors are used to the extremely verbose tone of most fanfics ("then this happened and then this and than that" - it's not really a good way to write a story). Not that Methods of Rationality is the perfect example for correct pacing, it has its own problems there.

** I'm surprised nobody has seen this yet.

I don't believe HPMOR is meant to be a serious fic, purely by its demeanor. It's meant for people who like funny fics(like me) and intellectuals like the author himself. HPMOR isn't meant for everybody. It's a niche fic.
