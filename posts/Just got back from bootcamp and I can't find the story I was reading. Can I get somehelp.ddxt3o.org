:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I remember a few things about this fic. It was long,time travel (back centuries not a few years) he met Merlin (or became him) Camelot is Hogwarts. People can't pronounce his actual name so it eventually became slytherin,true bloods are wizards that are descendants of magic animals (harry was related to the basilisk in the chamber) and he was the person who sent himself back and took his place in the time line.....I rly hope that helps. Cause i can't get this story out of my head.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!
