** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is a time travel fic in which the sorting goes wrong in a hilarious way. The hat gets stuck in an endless loop because it detects two minds in one head. The only way the 'Master of Death' protagonist gets through the sorting is to reprogram the hat to sort differently from then on. And thus is born the glorious house of "Default."

**** Lilly (fem Harry) is the 'Master of Death' of her universe. The story continues to be whimsical, going off on philosophical tangents, but it also has some great serious moments.

I was put off by chapter 1 the first time I tried to read it as well. My advice would be to read chapter 2, and if it's not to your taste by that point then you probably won't enjoy the rest of the story.

**** 1. yes

2. no

If you didn't like the first chapters then you won't like the rest of it. It's a funny read and wonderfully absurd, but not something everyone enjoys.

**** I don't recall the writing style changing much. I often don't like overly "airy" writing styles myself, but I do like the writing in this fic, but if you didn't like the first couple chapters it's probably not for you. It maybe gets a bit more grounded later, but it's still very surrealist/absurdist the whole time. However I don't really recall it being that incoherent or hard to follow at most parts. But the first couple chapters might be a bit more confusing than most as it's not quite clear what's going on without context that comes later, but after that context everything basically makes sense for a while after that.

The main character is Lily. Lily is a female version of Harry Potter. She probably isn't a MoD Harry though, as she appears to literally be an incarnation of death itself, which is similar, but not quite the same. There is also another Harry, from an alternate dimension which resembled canon much more closely, that shows up from time to time. He isn't the main protagonist though.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

  In the station between Life and Death Harry makes a different choice. Now he is eleven again, nothing is going the same as before, and people are starting to ask questions, especially the Malfoys, the Hogwarts professors and, most worryingly, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry is beginning to suspect that he might not be up to this Master of Death business and everything that goes along with it.

** Can't see the Hat out such a secret (headcanon says it's magically compelled to never reveal what it sees in people's minds), but I can definitely see it call BS on the requested sorting and decide to sort somewhere else.

** There are about 9 chapters of one of my fics where Hermione as a time traveler was sorted into Slytherin as a mistake. It was actually a great deal of fun to write, because of looking at the core of what makes a Slytherin a Slytherin. It's a very long, unfinished as of yet story with a massively rare pairing though, lol. Someone hexed the hat, and it's fixed later. Pairing is Sirius/Hermione, I'll link if you want, but IMO it's probably not your bag.
