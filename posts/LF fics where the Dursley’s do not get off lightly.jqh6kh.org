In a lot of fics where Harry get revenge in everyone the Dursley's get a paragraph or two on how they were either sent to Azkaban or killed but nothing more than that I'm looking for fics where Harry instead of either pretending they did nothing to him or being fine with what they did Harry grows up hating them and everything ha out them and he does everything possible to make their lives hell


** linkffn(Paint by Numbers by Wheezy1) Harry's older, and much more severely treated by the Dursley's, but this is a good (if short) story of revenge on them.

  Dark Harry. The war is over, the UK in shambles, as is Harry's life. It's time for vengeance against the people who started all his misery. Rated T for violence and torture. No sex, no romance, no language, no slash. Complete.

  Harry was sent to Azkaban after being framed for murder in the beginning of his 6th year at Hogwarts. While there, he unlocks the "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not". What will happen once his former friends know he's innocent? Watch the fun.

  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).
