From the ministry trying to take over its halls or the fact they endangered its students by hiding the philosophers stone in its crypt. It's just not happy about what's going on


** I think that to a certain extent it's canon. Didn't the doors of the Headmaster's office lock themselves when Umbridge becomes Headmistress? And also it seems that (I know a spell was needed to awaken them but) the armor suits knew exactly whom to fight against.

*** I always assumed that Dumbledore or one of the other teachers had locked them and the people trying to unlock them just weren't up to that level.

**** They were in Dumbledore's office when he left, were able to leave just fine, and no mention of him doing anything to the doors is given.

*** I always figured the armour was a bit like when Dumbledore animated statues or Hermione conjured birds, magically animated stuff seems to just do what the caster wants.

**** Well Dumbledore was a few levels above everyone else (except Voldemort maybe?). Hermione conjured canaries but then she used the Opugno spell that causes everything to savagely attack a certain target.

** I think Terry Pretchett's Unseen University was semi-sentient. It was described as having the personality of a big friendly dog that just wanted to roll onto its roof and have its floor rubbed.

Hogwarts was probably the same..... in normal times, that it.

** That's the premise of mjimeyg's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7665632/1/Potter-s-Protector][Potter's Protector]]. There are three following stories featuring the same Harry Potter but take place in different (non magical world) universes, Harry does tend to get around in his old age.
