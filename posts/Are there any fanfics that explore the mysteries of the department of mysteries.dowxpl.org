I'm not looking for ones that focus on what happened there. I'm looking for any fanfic where someone works there, or that otherwise explores/gives their own theories explaining the stuff that's in there. Are there any like this?


** People always seem to do weird things with the Dept of Mysteries. There are a lot of stories where the members go hooded everywhere and no one knows who they are. In the books Arthur points out two of them by name. They always have them as spies or commandos or people who do practical magic research. The last is closest to what they do in my opinion, but not quite right.

It always seemed to me that the department itself is not mysterious but that it studies the "Mysteries." Life, Death, Time, Love, Sentience, those kind of things. The magical equivalent of theoretical physics researchers. Arthur doesn't know what they get up to because he doesn't read theoretical magic journals.

** The Department itself is very much not the focus, but Daphne is an Unspeakable in linkffn(Days to Come), and there's a fair amount of focus given to her research into time turners.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** There's a fic in a next-gen series focused on Teddy Lupin where he does an internship there, it's pretty good, will link when I get on PC and not mobile, it's called Teddy Lupin and the Daedalus Maze or something like that. It goes decently in depth for all of the areas: Love, Death, etc

  If you drew a time-line of Lily Potter's life it would look like a maze. But for the head of Temporal Investigations at the D.O.M. that's perfectly normal- What isn't is the strange man who appears impossibly in all of history. Add a temporally misplaced Potions Master, a time-bent elephant and her family and you get either a mess or a grand adventure. Lilly isn't yet sure which.
