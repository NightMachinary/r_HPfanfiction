It just seems odd to me that people seem to think they're fools for not immediately accept Voldemort is back despite the fact resurrection doesn't seem to be common in the magical world. The evidence as far as I can remember it is; Cedric being dead, something that could have happened in the maze.

​

Another clue is that Snape's Dark Mark is acting up, this does imply Voldemort is returning to power, or it could mean another Death Eater, or even Snape, is messing with it somehow. The mechanics of the Dark Mark was never explained much.

​

The most obvious proof they have is that Harry actually saw it. But having your only major proof being a single witness who is a student who could have been fooled somehow doesn't seem rock solid.

​

I admit they should have listened to Harry and investigated what he said more but it seems odd to say they should take what Harry and Dumbledore say on face value about this super obscure event and magic. Of course the Ministry is corrupt and doesn't want him to be back and should have done way more but still.


** They are not fools for failing to accept Voldemort is back, they are fools for failing to investigate the incident. The initial evidence available: Potter shows signs of Cruciatus curse, has other injuries not suffered in maze. Diggory dead by killing curse. Should be dead dark wizard impersonating teacher/famous auror. should be dead dark wizard's dad (and high level ministry employee in charge of the whole tournament) is missing. So even without any statements this should have been an extremely high priority investigation. They are malicious for their summary execution of BC jr, attempted assassination of potter, slanderous newspaper propaganda, and all the other messed up things they've done.

From Hagrid's investigation free imprisonment, to Sirius not getting a trial, to the kill on sight order given for him after he escaped, to the extrajudicial killing of Crouch Junior to *all of OOTP*, but particularly Umbridge's entire character, I can't think of a single instance in the series where the Ministry isn't portrayed as one of the least competent fictional governments I've ever read about.

Fanfic portrays Piggot as some sort of pig-eyed incompetent or malicious idiot, the Protectorate as hapless or hopelessly corrupt, and Cauldron as two steps below the Nazis. None of those portrayals are even close to the canon organizations.

Besides that, you are slightly off on your description of Taylor. Taylor is a propaganda-fed, anti-authoritarian, depressed angry 15 year old villain that was manipulated into villainy by an intelligent villain her age with a power that makes her think through that process better, and was slightly mentally impaired, favoring conflict, throughout the entire process.

****** Worm is a web serial (not a fanfiction, a web serial is fiction like a book posted on a website), specifically on this site: [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com]]

Anyways, I have only read the first few chapters of this, but from what I have read about it from fanfiction, none of the characters are role models in any form.

A summary of it is that it is an overly gritty Superhero setting, where the villains outnumber the heroes by default.

Badass normals? Nope, even though quite a few of the supervillains could be taken by a non-powered hero on the level of the Question, Huntress, the Punisher, or just a generic marine, there aren't any badass normals. Instead, everyone of importance is extremely traumatized, and the more traumatized or psychopathic someone is, the more powerful they tend to be.

Here is a list of the Villains and Heroes MO's:

ABB:

Lung - Leader of asian gang, can escalate in response to threats indefinitely, turning into a dragon, thus being named the Chinese word "Lung" for dragon. Of course, it isn't really a dragon, more of a blob of surprisingly fast muscle with wings and pyrokinesis. He tends to gather a mob of gangsters from his gang around him. He could be killed by a sniper, but hey, no killing.

Merchants:

Skidmark - Can make certain areas propel everything in a certain direction, usually in or on tank things when actually in combat. Could probably accelerate the speed of bullets to an obscene level with this, but the given excuse is that he is too high to put that into practice. Leader of the Merchants, which is a drug-based gang that forces kids to use hard drugs.

Squeeler - Idiot savant methhead with the ability to make and drive vehicles. She usually makes some form of ugly tank, and wears obscene clothes. An engineer could probably do a better job than she could. Co-leader of the Merchants.

Both Skidmark and Squeeler could be killed by spiking some form of drug, but hey, that would be baaad, after all, meth is totally used in medicine.

That is just a taste of how screwed up things get.

They use containment foam against Parahumans. They don't use it against human criminals.

How effective could a hero like Velocity be if he had a knife?

How about Vista paired with containment foam?

Worm shows each and every villain can be neutralized, short of the Endbringers, and the Endbringers are only a thing because powers are made to not work on them, so in a more "realistic" setting, that wouldn't matter, since the Endbringers really, really aren't practical for what powers are meant for.

The Simurgh is able to tinker and predict what is able to kill the Endbringers, for Pete's sake.

Honestly, it would make the most sense if all parahumans had a fairly versatile power as well as a copy of the Number Man's power, that way, the outsourcing might make a bit more sense, but then that would mean eliminating most of the Manton Limit.

*** Fudge wasn't too bad at the start of PoA. He helps Harry with his aunt ballooning, sorts him out a place to stay and makes sure he's ok and is fairly reasonable when he's having a chat in the pub with the teachers.

On top of that the underage magic people are very efficient in book 2 even if they got the hover charm caster wrong. The quidditch world cup (barring DE attack) seems to have been well planned and organised by the ministry even if the attendees were a bit unsubtle.

** In canon, Fudge is portrayed as an idiot with his head in the sand, who just doesn't want to believe Voldemort is back. But you're right, Fudge's skepticism could've been portrayed as much more reasonable.

It's widely known that there's no magic that can bring back the dead; a reasonable person would ask Dumbledore to explain how Voldemort could have done that. And Dumbledore probably wouldn't be willing to explain the horcruxes to Fudge, since he wouldn't want his knowledge of them to get back to Voldemort through Fudge telling Malfoy.

If Dumbledore wouldn't explain how Voldemort came back from the dead, even Harry's eyewitness testimony could have been discounted. Even looking at the memory in a Penseive, how would anyone be able to tell the difference between Voldemort really being back, and some kind of Death Eater trick? Presumably, the ritual Voldemort used is very obscure--even Dumbledore may not have heard of it before Voldemort used it.

I feel like there's a major disparity between JKR's narrative goals and the worldbuilding she potrays through the characters: The Ministry, and Fudge by extension, is bureaucratic nonsense turned up to 11, but in a world of a few thousand wizards this sort of "government" should be a lot more efficient and lean in its standards.

***** In addition to that there is also this scene at the begining of Half-Blood Prince, where Fudge tells the Prime minister about Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  I've just come from Azkaban,' Fudge had panted, tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket. ‘Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight ... the Dementors are in uproar --' he shuddered ‘-- they've never had a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister. Black's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-Know-Who .. but of course, you don't even know who You-Know-Who is!' He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for a moment, then said, ‘Well, sit down, sit down, I'd better fill you in ... have a whisky ...'

  The Prime Minister had rather resented being told to sit down in his own office, let alone offered his own whisky, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge had pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime Minister's hand and drawn up a chair.

  Fudge had talked for over an hour. At one point, he had refused to say a certain name aloud, and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister's whisky-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the Prime Minister had stood up too.

  *‘So you think that ...' he had squinted down at the name in his left hand, ‘Lord Vol---'*

  *‘He Who Must Not Be Named!' snarled Fudge.*

  *‘I'm sorry ... you think that He Who Must Not Be Named is still alive, then?'*

  *‘Well, Dumbledore says he is,' said Fudge, as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin, ‘but we've never found him. If you ask me, he's not dangerous unless he's got support, so it's Black we ought to be worrying about.* You'll put out that warning, then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don't see each other again, Prime Minister! Goodnight.'

***** The full scene of the Minister and the various teachers speaking over drinks is too long to post, but to my mind the kicker is this passage:

#+begin_example
    “I wish I could say that he was,” said Fudge slowly. “I certainly believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel… pointless. Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s no sense in them… but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the crossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the Dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.” 

    “But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said Madam Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is he?” 
#+end_example

- As the above text shows, Fudge was very clear on being shocked at how Not Insane Sirius was, and then goes on to say "“I daresay that is his --- er --- eventual plan,” said Fudge evasively. “But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted servant, and I shudder to think how quickly he'll rise again...”

If he believed Sirius to be insane and Voldemort to be dead, what was that all about? How likely is a dead man to rise quickly, no matter how many devoted followers he had?

No, I think that Rowling forgot what she had done in Prisoner when she created the panicked cowardly Fudge of The Order of the Phoenix.

** Not believing a 14 years old kid when he tells you the Dark Lord who died years ago was backis perfectly reasonable (and even Dumbledore "suggestions/orders" were pretty heavy without any tangible proof), but an investigation should have been made (if only to understand how Cedric died and, in case of murder, to not let a potential cold blooded murderer return to a school full of children.

The whole slanders and abuse of power just to silence a little boy was in comparison way other the top and should have raised some alarms into at least minister employees (normal withes and wizards only heard the public truth and not believing is acceptable for them).

​

But as people said, Fudge is an idiot who :\\
- Feared Dumbledore wanted his jobs (forgeting he only got said jobs because Dumbledore said he didn't want to do it)\\
- Was buyed/ best buddy with Lucius Malfoy, member of Voldemort Inner Circle who probably also thought Dumbledore wanted his jobs and proposed to support him, as a friend.\\
- Had Umbridge as Under-Secretary, he woman so bigoted the only reasons she doesn't a Dark Mark is probably because she is either not talented enough to be accepted as a Half-Blood or not telented enough final.

​

Also, from a writer point of view, the hero is Harry so you need incompetent adults for him to be the hero. Some adults may be competent to play the role of mentor, but in Harry Potter case, Dumbledore and his Order of Phoenix play this role. And since Dumbledore is not part of the Ministry, you need them out of the picture, either by making them totally useless, or by giving them an antagonistic role (as Rowling does in Book 6 and 5 respectably).

** Not so much the Ministry as Fudge and Umbridge. The few times other Ministry officials are confronted, they act rationally. And it's not so much the lack of evidence as it is Fudge's personal history:

- In Book 1, Fudge was writing letters to Dumbledore "every morning," asking for advice.
- In Book 2, Fudge didn't want Dumbledore removed from Hogwarts. He thought Dumbledore was the best person to protect the students. (Not to mention perverting justice for political points.)
- In Book 3, Fudge himself seemed to believe that Voldemort was still out there (probably on Dumbledore's word). In the Three Broomsticks scene, he talks about Sirius helping Voldemort return to power as if it were something that could actually happen.

And yet, when Dumbledore tells him Voldemort is back, with some evidence that should really be looked after by the DMLE, Fudge turns his back on all of that. He reacts with denial out of obvious panic. (Having Barty Jr Kissed has to be panic because it wasn't a rational move whether Voldemort was back or not.) Then, he gets it into his head that Dumbledore, a man who was his closest advisor and /turned down the Minister post multiple times/, is after his job. And he undertakes unprecedented interference with Hogwarts to shut Dumbledore down.

Okay, I suppose not wanting to hear the truth is not lack of intelligence in the conventional sense, and he wasn't malicious in the sense of wanting to help Voldemort, but it was absolutely willful ignorance and corruption on his part and proto-fascism on Umbridge's part.

The Ministry doesn't /want/ to believe that he's back, and their response is to slander the kid who's basically the Messiah, and /at worst/ is being manipulated by either remnant Death Eaters or Dumbledore himself. Then there's Umbridge, who has official Ministry backing on a bunch of policies to directly remove the ability of Hogwarts students to learn to defend themselves from threats that have nothing to do with Voldemort at all. Like, boggarts didn't vanish overnight. They still need to learn those spells.

** You forget that Fudge allowed Dementors to kiss Barty Crouch Jr., who could serve as a key witness to Voldemort's revival. By giving him Verisaterum, his testimonial would have been unquestionable. And still they acted in the most stupid way. Not to mention all the slander in The Prophet and so against Harry and Dumbledore during Order of the Phoenix.

*** Crouch's Veritaserum testimony would not be unquestionable. Veritaserum only forces him to say what he believes is true--he could be crazy, or tricked by someone else. Even if you believe his testimony, he meets Pettigrew and a deformed demon baby claiming to be Voldemort, who gives him orders. That's not ironclad proof--how does anyone know that the baby really was Voldemort, other than Crouch's belief?

**** The dark marks got darker/started acting up after Voldemort regained a body (the homunculus baby thing). Probably Crouch Jr's Dark mark was getting darker so then when he met Voldemort, and also Voldemort could cast spells from his homunculus body, he believed him.

​

However, a fanfic in which that baby thing is NOT actually Voldemort but some entity pretending to be would be awesome.

**** But his testimony could serve as a start point to start a more complex investigation on it based on the locations described by him, the people involved (not only Pettegrew, but also the other death eaters, who could be under an exhaustive interrogation), the dissapeared Ministry employee whereabouts (sorry but I don't remember her name right now), etc. You can't deny that losing his testimony was one of the most stupid Fudge's decisions.

** I think umbridge helps with this malicious feeling. The ministry not believing that voldemort is back from the dead is understandable, as far as they know magic can't do that, the only witness is a teenager.

But to have umbridge come in, to shut down the idea that voldemort is back (to avoid panic I guess) is where it becomes malicious. We all know how awful umbridge is, plus the daily prophet trying to discredit harry and Dumbledore.

** The Wizarding World is a society, and like every society it has a power structure or power dynamics that can easily topple or shift. Not necessarily are they stupid or malicious, they're just scared shitless. If the government is scared, the people would panic too. There would be chaos. People don't know what to believe. Harry being young and maligned by the media (depending on who's writing the article in the Daily Prophet) would really result in different opinions about him which makes people unsure about him. The ministry wants to be blind and prolong the calm before the storm.

** I feel the concepts OP mentioned are a common trope for writing the Ministry, as it's easy to fall under these parameters. Sometimes I read these stories and they stretch the boundaries so far that I question the legitimacy of the situation---like twisting a character's personality to seem more superhuman-stupid than is necessary.

Here's one story I like that doesn't stretch to far in either direction (that you mentioned): [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11946284/1/Lone-Traveler-The-Greatest-Minister-in-History][Lone Traveler: The Greatest Minister in History (FFN 11946284)]]

** Not believing Voldemort was back wasn't the issue. As loathe as I am to admit it, the word of a slightly traumatized 14 year old is worth very little. It was hushing up the affair, the summary execution, and frankly the libelous attacks that were unforgivable. For all the hate people have for Umbridge, Fudge was also a criminal too.

** *points at canon*

Seriously, it is canon and that's why people normally run with it (unless it's a "competent ministry" AU or a "different minister" AU)

In canon the ministry throws innocent people in jail without a trial (twice that we know of!), doesn't investigate things propperly (the graveyard thing and Sirius Black...kiss on sight order and all that!), doesn't look into Hogwarts (I doubt nobody told their parents about students getting petrified! Seriously, in a world with a competent ministry there would have been aurors, creature experts etc. at Hogwarts after the first petrification!), is lead by incompetent people (Fudge, Umbridge!) who accept bribes and smear people (full Wizengamot trial of Harry, Daily Prophet smear campaign etc.) and, the biggest black marks:

- Spies in the Ministry (there's no veritaserum questioning of all ministry personal after spies (Rookwood) are found even in the Unspeakables (who are researchers but also probably spies for the ministry))

- most of the ministry (those who didn't leave/disappear/die!) go along with Voldemort's rule

​

So, in conclusion: That's kind of how the ministry is and unless you write a total AU, you kind of have to write them this way! Not to mention having the government against Harry makes for good story-telling (it's a great obstacle to overcome or work around!)

** I think mostly it comes down to Dumbledore. Sure they wanted proof and they thought he was getting old and maybe senile, but he's an Uber smart, Uber powerful wizard who has rarely been wrong (that's how people act and by his own admission that he's rarely wrong) and they just kind of go "well that's inconvenient and scary to believe you, so we'll say you're lying and want to take over instead". They should know someone who is as intelligent, calculating, and wise as Dumbledore is either going to be sure of something or sure enough to back Harry.
