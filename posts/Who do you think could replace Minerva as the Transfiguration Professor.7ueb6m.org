** Sticking with known characters and trying to adhere to canon, I'd say the most likely candidates for the year immediately after the war are lesser known Order characters like Hestia Jones or Dedalus Diggle. People skilled enough to survive the war, and in good graces with the new government/school leadership.

Otherwise, I'd just say McGonnagall continued to hold the position concurrent to being headmistress until it was able to be filled.

Same goes for DADA, probably one of the lesser known Order members.
