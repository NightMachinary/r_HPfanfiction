In Psychology classes humans are shown to misremember events because of misinformation affecting their memory, encoding failure, and encoding incorrectly, among other things. This shows how fragile human memories are, and why eyewitnesses are always taken serious in court. This brings me to the point that human memory has to be drastically different from Wizard memory because of this.

Wizards have Occlumency, Legilimency, Pensives, and Veritaserum, which all revolve around the memory. Through the uses of Pensives, one only has to bring forth a memory in order to have it shown in the pensive perfectly without any error whatsoever. This is similar with Legilimency, as it is the raiding of the human memory, and it is always shown to be very vivid in those memories. Along with that, without the influence of Occlumency, Veritaserum makes the person tell the complete truth. (Besides the fact that Pensives give like a 360 view, allowing the viewer to see what even the person who had the memory couldn't see at that time, or at least that is what it feels like when the memories are being described.)

Because of this, it can really be shown that Wizard memory is really different from human memory. Since it is so different, I think that the fanon use of Legilimency, Pensives, and Veritaserum on muggles needs to be different that when used on Wizards because of how different their minds are. I feel like if you use Legilimency, you should only be able to have parts of the memory found, or maybe even misremembered events in the brain because that mis-remembered/informed events are thought to overwrite the original memory. I haven't found a single fanfiction that actually explores this difference in the mindset, and I feel like it would really be interesting. Just the frustration the wizards would have because of this I feel like would also be interesting because of the death eaters and their trials and violence against muggles.


** All I know along those lines is a story which posited that at the core of anti-Muggle prejudice among wizards was the belief --- based on all this and on Muggles' inability to see Dementors --- that Muggles do not in fact possess souls. Very chilling idea.

That being said, I rather reckon that this is all a result of souls existing in the /Harry Potter/ universe. There exists a memory of the soul, which is aperfectly reliable and detailed account of an individual's life. Muggles and wizards both have it --- I'm assuming Muggles have souls too, of course --- but only wizards are able to /interact/ with those memories via the likes of Pensieve, whereas Muggles can only recover the true and complete memory of their lifetime upon death and into the Afterlife (as per the old "life flashing before your eyes" cliché; it'd be fitting for /Harry Potter/ magic, wouldn't it, to incorporate another bit of old folklore like this?).

However, that doesn't mean that wizards --- or at least, wizards who are not accomplished Occlumenses --- have a different mindset on a day-to-day basis. Unless they're currently dealing with mind magic, they use their brain's unreliable, organic memory, like everyone else.

*** I understand what you mean, but what I was trying to question is whether or not mind magic itself would affect muggles differently than it would affect the wizards, not that regular wizard's minds are much better than muggle's minds. Since there isn't much use of veritaserum in canon, we don't know if it can give reliable results or not, so I'm just guessing that it does force them to give a completely truthful answer.

** *obliviates a muggle*\\
muggle: -subconsciously comes up with a believable memory to replace the lost one-\\
wizard: See? They're below us.

*legilimizes a muggle*\\
muggle: -thoughts are like a web, interconnected through various emotions and past experiences-\\
wizard: See? Still below us.\\
(snape in the background: ....the mind is not a book to be read, mr potter)

*uses veritaserum on a muggle*\\
muggle: -answers the same question differently each time depending on the wording because beliefs and opinions are highly suggestible and we can make ourselves believe anything, hello, cognitive dissonance?-\\
wizard: what the fuck

*goes into the pensive memory of a muggle*\\
muggle: -twelve different versions of the event happening at once, highly dependent on what whoever said last-\\
wizard: w h a t t h e f u c k

​

It's my own personal opinion that canon wizard brains defy all reason or known psychological basis. This could also explain why they shit their robes before muggles invented toilets

** I do remember a fic (don't remember which) where Snape teaches Occlumency to Harry and Hermione, and he touches on this topic a bit. When they're viewing Harry's and Hermione's version of the same memory, the objects on a table are different, and Snape explains how memory is fallible and their brains were just filling out information they didn't have with information they assumed (neither of them remembered what was actually on that table) so one of the principles of Occlumency and using Pensieves was having an organized mind to differentiate what's true from what your brain is making up.

Honestly, that's my favorite way to deal with mind magic. My headcanon is that Pensive memories aren't actually accurate, at least not in the whole 360° super detailed account of things. Magic just helps fill out the blanks. Maybe it just makes stuff up, or if you're good at Divination, you can divine missing details using your own memories as some sort of anchor. Either way, to me it's not a physical, wizards-have-better/different-brains-than-muggles thing, but rather a magic-helps-you-do-muggle-stuff-but-better thing.

And Occlumency is, like, Advanced Meditation.

** How do we know that whatever is shown in pensieves is without error? For all we know, they can just reproduce major details of a memory (like speech, important objects or major actors) truthfully, but leave everything else (surroundings, people in the background, etc) templateable for viewer's subconscious to fill in the details. Exactly like we all remember things. You remember people in the scene, what they said, and everything else important, but you template everything else. So if you were say talking about horcruxes with Tom Riddle 40 years ago, you would remember *who* you were talking with, *what* you were talking about, *where*, how they looked, etc; but not necessarily all the details of the door or wall next to you. So memory extraction thingamajig would extract what you remember, and leave everything else for viewer to fill in the details.

** Your theory is built upon a -probably- false assumption. Wizards can view memories, thoughts and even force someone to tell the truth, but that does not automatically mean that, what they get is not influenced or even completely based on a false information, which somehow made its way into the mind of the magical they're dealing with.

** I did read a fic recently that said Pensieves are so astonishing because they use both mind and time magic. The 360° perfect memory of events is because the Pensieve uses time magic to recreate the memory, instead of relying on an imperfect human brain.

Also, setting aside actual magic, I don't see anything in canon to suggest that wizards don't subconsciously change their minds the way IRL people do. We certainly see them reinterpretting the past based on new information - public opinion of Harry changes at the drop of a hat.
