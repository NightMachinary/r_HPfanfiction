  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

**** I would argue that Emperor isn't a good romance story, not because the romance is a background element, but because when it does show up, it's not particularly nuanced. The fact that they took a long time to get married is irrelevant in the face of the fact that they were pretty much described as the OTP since the very first chapter where they show up together.

Tl;dr - the Harry/OC pairing in Emperor isn't well written. Rather like Vin/Elend in Mistborn.

***** I love Mistborn but Vin/Elend never sat well with me.

At first I liked it, and then the entirety of the second book happened.
