I'm currently reading it and even though it's not one of the best fics I've ever read I really like it and find it quite refreshing. What do you all have against it ?

Serious question. I'm actually wondering :)

linkffn(Harry Crow)


** I don't even know where to start.

Its by robst. That means Harry is a Gary-Stu and Hermione the ultimate and most perfect and most beautiful and bestestest damsel that must be protected at all costs, ever. One wants to vomit. And don'T forget that they get freakin bonded to each other at the age of twelve, because /fuck free choice and love/, amirite?

Then that awful Goblin culture "worldbuilding".

It also has that scene where Harry confront the headmaster at the Sorting and just... ugh.

Of course, Harry can /never/ do wrong. Any act of brutality or amorality is explained away because reasons.

I just... Read the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HarryCrow][TVTropes site]]. It explains it best.

...I'm OK with that. I don't think that makes me a bad person. Sometimes I want an overdose of sugar. Doesn't mean I want it all the time or that that makes it a good story, either. I guess I'm saying, "I am large, I contain multitudes" and I'm glad there's something out there for everyone even if I don't care for particular things myself.

*EDIT: Side note, I think robst also gets more hate because he's a popular author. I mean there are plenty of fics out there like what robst writes, but he gets a lot of flack because he's more well known and because you expect popular fics to be, you know, pretty good. I have similar feelings about HPMOR. It's worshipped as pretty much the best fanfic ever on some sites, and I just don't understand why, which only fuels my hatred for it.

****** It also doesn't help that robst is one of the most popular authors for H/Hr pairings. While the shipping wars are not near as bad now that time has passed since the books ended, fans of H/Hr having a popular author backing them up flocked to robst docs, while those who didn't like H/Hr had another reason to not like robst fics.

FWIW, my first exposure to fanfiction was robst. And since I liked H/Hr I read all robst's fics. Now, well, in my opinion at least, robst's first fics were just not good at all for the reasons listed above. However, robst has improved over time and more recent fics like You're My Density or Don't look Back In Anger are not bad. Not great necessarily, honestly bland to me, but to each their own. At the very least the tendency to make Ron a Death Eater is gone.

***** Eh, I can see why people like HPMOR though. It's genuinely entertaining in places and the ending is clever.

Harry Crow, on the other hand, is banal, whitewashed garbage. It shits all over JK Rowling's characters, turning them into the flimsiest of strawmen. It does an even greater disservice to Harry and Hermione, who, in the original books, were nuanced characters with flaws and agency.

And don't get me started on FFN's other favourite fics. Poison Pen, Lord of Caer Azkaban, DPSW... I try to keep an open mind, but when I open these stories and see legions of enthusiastic reviews, I lose a little bit of faith in humanity.

****** I feel a lot of the stories in the first few favorites pages are there in a kind of loop. People search for stories and find those. They often get reviews and ratings which propel them on. I also don't understand why there is so much hate to be honest when in comes to many of them. Many people find problems with them from writing styles, grammar, random plot devices, and the list goes on. I think many readers get irritated and angry about what they feel is a slight against them when in comes to the Potterverse. It's reached so many people who have and continue to love it. People feel a type of ownership over how the different characters should be portrayed. Personally I love most of the stories on the favorites page because I enjoy the different ideas and for lack of a better word stories that people have to share. I almost enjoy the act of storytelling more than the story itself and for me fanfiction is a great way for people to do so. Now I agree with a point that is made that authors generally use this platform to grow as an author, but in my opinion they don't have to. It's the love of storytelling that often leads to stories being made. One doesn't have to like a story for it to be good, or even a best seller. Opening a can of worms I point to twilight and 50 shades. They aren't really for me now, but I was a little girl once who loved the idea of romance and drama. Twilight had that to a degree. No it's not hard hitting or even all that scary, but for its target audience it did well. I have to say for me I think one of the reasons robst gets so much flack is because he is so widely known, but in the other hand if there wasn't an audience who enjoyed it he wouldn't be. An argument could be made that people just don't know better, but opinions don't have to make sense. I know for myself as I have grown up my taste in stories in general and fanfiction as a whole has changed. I no longer read the wish fulfillment stories where voldemort and the dursleys get their just desserts. It wasn't that long ago that I was a teen myself and could relate all to well to the idea of the world against me and how it would be so nice if the playing field was just a little bit more even. I'm more pragmatic now, but the point still stands that I can relate to why some stories are popular even if now I find them boring and bit lacking. Back to robst he generally sticks to a certain type of story and it works. People argue all the time about him, but if he didn't have a following we probably wouldn't be talking about him. The same goes for HPMOR for that matter.

I don't really understand where I was trying to go with this. I'm sick just looking around reddit. Oh and just because I can I love rorschach's blot's stories. Many don't make sense, but I love them anyways. I think I love them more because they don't make sense

******* I've enjoyed fics that are horribly written (e.g. Travel Secrets, Basilisk Born). And I can acknowledge good storytelling, even if it's not my type of story. (For instance, I'm not a fan of jbern or joe, but they seem at the very least to be decent writers.)

But the fics I criticised fail to meet a basic standard of readability. Harry Crow attracts particular ire (haven't read anything else by robst), because it fails as a piece of writing is /so many ways/. Cardboard characters, no plot, saccharine writing, and just about everything is a twisted, childish parody of canon.

**** Pretty much. A Gary Stu (Mary Sue for females) is a "perfect" character --- they are smart, good looking, rich, etc. They never make mistakes (and therefore can't learn from their mistakes --- reducing possibilities for character growth). Everything goes well for them. They rarely ever suffer during the story. Villains who may be portrayed as competent or powerful suddenly act like idiots (the proverbial "idiot ball") when it comes to these characters. Things of that nature.

In Harry Crow, Dumbledore is shown as some big manipulator but acts like a total moron when it comes to Harry. Voldemort, supposedly a powerful dark lord, is no threat at all. Also, Harry and Hermione are more or less perfect. They don't have any major character flaws. The whole fic is essentially a boy running roughshod over adults who are supposed to be competent villains.

**** Let me put it that way, then:

Most if not all of robst's stories have the same issues plaguing them; they are all essentially “guilty pleasure” stories with the same overused and badly used nonsensical plot devices time and again. They aren't stories that one can't enjoy, no, but they are stories that show that he isn't getting perceivably better as an author because of what feels to be lack of actual desire to get better and with every next piece getting released this is making people's---authors' who do strive to get better with every word they write---opinions of him lower and lower. His Harry never actually has to expend any effort to achieve anything whatsoever (which eliminates tension and makes it kind of boring, in my personal opinion; this is also what being a “Gary Stu” means, by the way) and both he and Hermione are always “Perfect Human Beings™” and always perfect for each other and it is just ... droll, and unrealistic in the same way Harlequin stories are unrealistic (if you've never actually gotten your hand on one of them then I will say this: they are a waste of paper if you want something that isn't unrealistic nonsense).

The problem is with robst. It's just that, as his probably most famous piece, “Harry Crow” has become a flag of a kind that is getting targeted instead of its author. The story is ... well, it isn't /fine/, but it is /readable/. It is a robst story, though, and some people are simply fed up with robst's ... history as an author.

PS. And yes, I know he is not the worst author ever, and he does improve to some degree (an author whose writing stays the same over the years would be a horror). However, he is quite an example of one who actually is known and whose popularity rose higher than their quality, and with that his seeming lack of desire to get better can easily annoy people. Though I wouldn't be surprised if at least some people let their bias mark anything he writes as worse than it is (it isn't good, but it's not troll-grade stuff either).

** Others have already mentioned a lot of the problems but for me the biggest is that (like every other robst story) there's no challenge for the protagonists.

Every time anything happens that might cause the slightest problem for Harry he just swats it aside, or the ridiculously pro-Harry adults do it for him. For instance, the story spends ages setting up [[/spoiler][Lestrange/Rookwood escaping and preparing to attack then it's over in moments]]. Same with the final battle.

Robst has a lot of great ideas in his stories but they're lost amongst reams of self-congratulatory dialogue between his flawless heroes and cartoonishly-bad antagonists. Harry Crow is the perfect example of this. I remember following it as it was being written. The first few chapters were actually pretty enjoyable but then it went on for about half a million words too many.

** I'll say that personally I enjoy Robst's fics, but I'm also well read enough to know his writing isn't the best. There's a difference between liking/enjoying something and it being good in quality. Sometimes I just want to turn my inner hypercritical side off and just enjoy something. Robst is good for that. It's also why I love big dumb action movies.

Other times I do want to be mentally engaged and stimulated, and I'll read something more layered with real character development. In FF I'll cite Couer Al'Aran as a truly good author. He writes in the RWBY fandom, but always tries to write realistic characters and continually improves his writing over time.

I'll bring up the comparison of big blockbuster movies like Avengers versus something like Ghost in the Shell (the original, not the new one). One brings up real points about philosophy and metaphysics, and the other has one-liners and kick-punching. They're both entertaining, one just has much more substance than the other.

** I have read and enjoyed Robst's fics, but fully admit they are very flawed for all of the reasons already mentioned by other posters.

Another thing that kind of bothers me about them is that his writing style feels really old fashioned to me. I have no idea how old Robst is, and I could be very wrong, but I'd be incredibly surprised to learn that he wasn't at least in his 50s. There's sort of a "look at these crazy young kids" vibe I get from his fics. The older characters, like Hermione's parents, get the same treatment so I am inclined to think he's much older than them too.

** It was one of the first stories I read.

Good parts:

- it is long

- it updated pretty regularly before it finished

- there are comparatively very few spelling and grammar errors

- robst is a Brit, so there aren't any britpicking issues

Bad parts:

- the protagonists were leveled up, but not the antagonists, which removes a lot of plot tension

- the stories provide examples of some tropes that aren't popular - Lord Potter/Black/Gryffindor/Jesus/Goku Harry, incompetently evil Dumbledore and Weasleys, magical cores

I try to take a nuanced view on his work, specifically that it is clearly flawed yet nowhere near the worst out there. However there has sometimes been a circle jerk in this sub of who can insult the story (and those who genuinely enjoy it) the most.

OP, if you genuinely enjoy it, more power to you, even if your tastes don't neatly align with everyone else's.

**** Equating a fic's quality to in ranking in favorites and reviews is always a fallacy. Popularity has /nothing/, I repeat, /nothing/ to do with how good a fic is. The numbers alone never tell the full story. The number tend to propagate themselves. Like, a story that's on the first page for most reviews is going to have a lot more than the ones after that, because people (incorrectly) use that sorting as some sort of metric, so something like Nightmare of Futures Past has a ton of favorites because it's been #1 forever, so people are more naturally drawn to it. And some stories just have a cult following, like Harry Crow and MoR. They tend to be amongst people's first exposure to the fandom, and that skews things.

I can see it from both sides. I have 18 stories posted, so I know better than most how much reviews and favorites actually mean. My most popular story has nearly 2 million views, and 2700 favorites, and it's a piece of dog shit. Then, look at something like "By the Divining Light" which has a paltry 600 favorites, and is in the conversation for the best story in the fandom.

As for the "study", it's just the frequency of threads exactly like this one. I've been reading and writing fanfiction for awhile. Less than some, more than most, sure, but it's always the same stuff that gets brought up.

Ultimately, it doesn't really matter, as people are free to get whatever enjoyment they want from whatever fic they want, but it does bother me when fics like Harry Crow are put up on a pedestal they really don't deserve while there are many fics that go unsung.

** I haven't read Harry Crow as I find it way too long. However, I have read some of robst's works before and know that he adheres to typical formula in his stories I have read. My main problem is that his characters all have the same voice - there's no distinction, which is irritating. Also, all of the action/mystery he poses in his works are settled within a chapter or two (of what I have read of him).

To me, his stories cater to a vocal Harry/Hermione crowd who feel slighted JK Rowling didn't put them together in canon. Therefore, they enjoy his works immensely because he is a hardcore Harmony shipper. I'm actually reading his new story, To Fill a Coward's Grave, and the comments there...well, let's just say I avoid them at all costs.

** It and Methods of Rationality have the same problems tbh. Both are equally bad in my sight.

**** Yeah, the author tried really hard to be a Pseudo-Intellectual, to the point where you could feel the copy-paste Wikipedia from most of the excerpts on 'Science'. It's the over-complication of Magic, that I hate in both stories, they try wayyyy too hard to make Magic seem like this exact precise science, despite canon saying that you can cast spells without some of those 'requirements'.

***** ... Isn't the author an actual scientist? I may not like his writing, but as far as I know, he knows what he's talking about.

****** Definitely not. A (very drunk) quantum physicist reviewed HPMOR chapter by chapter a while back. Every second one of Harry's jargon-filled rants had holes viciously picked in them.

**** my memory might be off here but one thing that I think was from MoR was the fact that all the major plotlines from the first three books ended up being resolved before Christmas of the first year.

*** Nah. See upthread. In Crow, the protagonists are levelled up and the antagonists have a serious case of stupidity. In MoR, everybody is levelled up and it was an explicit goal of the author that nobody be carrying the Idiot Ball.

**** Except, while that sounds good in theory, the author is essentially redoing canon with a bunch of terrible plot points added in the mix. Eleven Year Old super-genius aside, the story doesn't add anything to the mix, only further complicates magic for the sake of complicating it. They both do the same thing wrong, just in different ways.
