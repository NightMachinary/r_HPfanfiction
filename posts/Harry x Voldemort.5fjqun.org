the pairing was Female harry x Female voldemort thats all i remeber from it


** That pairing is rarer than Harry/Morgana...

Do you remember anything else from the story? Oftentimes the pairing itself will not rejuvenate anyone's memories.

** The only femslash HPLV I've ever come across is the Magical Girls AU by RenderedReversed.

linkao3(1520126;3254939)

I've never read them, as I'm not interested in either magical girls nor femslash in general, but I love her other stuff, so I assume it's pretty good. I have no idea if it's the fic you're looking for, so just in case. *throws it out there*

  In which Harry and Tom are both very much female, very much attracted to each other, and very much costume-wearing, weapon-toting, badass magical girls. And this is a story of how they got there.

  In which Harry, newly graduated card wielder, ends up with Tom Riddle, Evil Card Mistress of the Century, as her terrible arch-nemesis... in both senses of the word, considering the fact that they don't make very good enemies.It isn't helping that their decks aren't the only things heating up the battle field, ifyouknowwhatImean.

*** I don't know what you're ship or favourite thing in fanfiction is but would you like it if on everyone of your posts or on posts of things that you find interesting I wrote a "No"?

If you don't like HarryxVoldemort then thats fine. No one is forcing you to read it. However, what you're doing is childish and immature. There is no need to hate on someone for liking something else.

**** Thank you!

Everyone has different tastes, and this subreddit is to actually help people like OP, who are in search of less-than-common fic to find their missing stories, or new ones.\\
If someone doesn't like, there's a nice back button to go back. HELL, there's even a downvote button if you want to be slightly petty.

***** Well it's not remotely funny. In fact it could be classified as harassment. Unless the two of you have talked it over somehow? Because when you're playing a joke on someone, if they don't find it funny or you don't have their consent, it's plain old bullying.

Edit: Regarding your previous comment, I have just looked through his recent posts and you only commented "No" once before, so don't tell me you do this 'every' time.
