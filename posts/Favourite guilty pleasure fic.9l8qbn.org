For DP&SW, only the early chapters. It's still guilty, but no longer a pleasure - the author hasn't wrriten a Harry centric chapter in a long time, and seems to spend all his time these days writing interludes.

** I don't really have a specific fic in mind, but a whole genre. I will always have a soft spot for super!Harry and Noble!Harry fics because that's what was in vogue around the time I started reading fanfiction. I don't read it as much as I used to, but it's the genre I always return to to center myself. They have a lot of tropes that people seem to HATE these days, but even now, I genuinely like.

** The question gets harder over the years, because sometimes I lose track of what I enjoyed ironically vs. what I started to enjoy genuinely.

Stuff like this still kinda tickles my buttons even though it's kinda terrible:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5233819/1/Betrayal]])

There's plenty of other bash/mock fics that I know aren't good, but they feed my inner devil.

Another fic that comes to mind is

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10669760/1/Don-t-look-back-in-Anger]])

Myrddin Emrys Returns by General Obi-Wan Kenobi SIYE, can you say Broken? I can and so can this story cause Harry too is Broken to all fuck. So fucking OP it's barely funny but it is

The Power of the Mind by Landstradd, I shouldn't like this story this much but I do, Harry's mix of insanity and intelligence is refreshing to me, he and everyone else knows he is a few screws loose but it only works to his benefit

Appetite for Destruction by The Devil's Left Eye, It's dumb its to action packs to the point where the Plot is just set dressing for action scenes rather than Action driving plot forward... Fuck tho it's good action
