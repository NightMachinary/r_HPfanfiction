*** Rule 34 buddy.

But yeah, it would probably fit better a sibling/best-friends/partners-in-crime relationship where they are close, confiding with each other about their problems, offering mutual support when needed and even causing some mischief together, like Tonks infiltrating Hogwarts to take Harry for a night out in town to cheer him up about Umbridge and he giving her council about her relationship with Remus, maybe they even brainstorm the best ways of teaching the DA.

***** Yup, personally I kind of prefer to read about her and Harry just hanging out instead of having a romantic relationship and she seems like totally the kind of person to both listen patiently to a friend's problems over hot chocolate offering suggestions and to sneak on Umbridge's (or Snape's for that matter) room while she sleeps to make her drink polyjuice locked in to a centaur just on principle.

Eh, rule 34 is one of the rules of internet, an old joke that still shows up from time to time though there are many different sets of them.

Rule 34: If it exists there is porn of it. No exceptions.

Rule 35:If no porn can be found about it currently it is going to be made.

**** Fleur was 20 and Bill was 26 when they started dating. If you'd like to follow the half your age plus seven rule, that still works out. Even if you don't care about that rule age gaps are less of an issue as people get older.

Lupin was 35 and Tonks was 23 when Tonks was pining after him. It doesn't pass the rule and even without that, there are more than a few people that are uncomfortable with the Remus/Tonks relationship. Even though the age gap is a little uncomfortable for Remus and Tonks, they are both consenting adults. Harry is a child in OotP and that's significantly more relevant than age gaps. Any 23 year old that can look at a 15 year old and say yes, I'd get romantically involved with this person right now has issues.

******* You have to go by the world in-story. In a song of ice and fire Daenarys is married off at 13 and while her case in particular is forced in that world in-story marriage and all it implies is ok at that age. In the real world 17/18 to 24 is still squicky and would definitely have overtones of the older person taking advantage of the younger. But in-story its not only fine but its somehow feasible the advantage taking is reversed. In that world love potions that can make someone ignore their SO to pursue someone they've never talked to (Ron/Lavander/Romilda) are not only legal but can be bought at you local prank shop. Krum(above age) is never even questioned about Hermione(under aged) when that heated love triangle story got printed in the national paper. So we already have examples of huge age difference being ok and rape (implied attempted regular and implied possible statutory) being completely ignored and/or ok in this world I dont see how combining the two would be too much in this fucked up world.

also so i dont completely ignore this point of yours, Remus was much more concerned about his woe is me, I'm a monster who could never have a relationship shtick. the other characters (who weren't annoyingly fatalistic people who were looking for any excuse to avoid possibly being happy and hoped one stuck) didnt care, not even super judgey Molly.

******** "You have to go by the world in-story."

Funnily enough I don't actually have to do that. This request exists in the real world, this conversation exists in the real world, the author of Harry Potter exists in the real world, and the authors of fanfiction exist in the real world. So I feel like using real world standards to say that relationships between adults and children are not appropriate is the right way to go.

Hermione and Krum were 15 and 18, not really a major concern even in the real world and protected by Romeo and Juliet laws in most states even.

Regardless of them, or Remus!Tonks, or Bill!Fleur, or love potions or anything else, my point stands. Nothing in universe says relationships between adults and children are appropriate. You are the one saying that. You are the one arguing that it would be accepted with no evidence to support that claim other than love potions are messed up but accepted, so this other messed up thing should be accepted too. That's a false equivalence.

**** The gap isn't as important as both being consenting adults. Fleur/Bill and Lupin/Tonks were adults more than capable of making their own decisions about what to do with their bodies and who they wanted to spend their lives with.

Harry in this situation would be a 15yo child so him having a crush on her would be normal, she being interested in him, having a relationship or whatever would not be ok, even if the age gap is the same or smaller then others.

*** I recall this fic, but cannot for the life of me remember it.

As for age gaps, in my view it's more about life experience than actual age, which is why Tonks and Harry doesn't bother me as much. There are times when a smaller age gap would bother me more than a larger one, depending on details. Tonks is immature for her age to a degree, and after all the shit Harry's done, he's mature for his age in some ways.

It'd definitely require some work, but I can see it. It's definitely questionable in real life, however, due to a lot of reasons.
