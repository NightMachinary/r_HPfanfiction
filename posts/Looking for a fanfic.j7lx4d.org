Hi,

I was just wondering if anyone has ever read a fanfic about Harry getting placed into the Tri-Tournament under a 4th school that ends up being real and then they come to Hogwarts, get their professors to train him and then he transfers there after the tournament?

I just thought that would make a cool fanfic and wasn't sure if something similar had been done before.

Thanks!


** I would read that!

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alternate Tournament by twistyguru) is kind of like that, although the school he's entered under doesn't really exist until Harry is chosen.

There was another story that I can't find right now, in which Harry gets the goblins to sponsor his entry into the Tournament, since he can't represent Hogwarts.

  The Goblet of Fire creates a binding magical contract, not only on the student but the school...so what school is Harry representing? Harry gets a new Headmistress who's practically perfect, and the Tournament gets the Guru treatment! Xover, imp. Slash!
