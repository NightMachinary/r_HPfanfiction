Presenting [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230151/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hermetic-Arts][*/Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts/*]].

Recently, a friend of mine from college read the pitch/treatment I wrote previously about Harry Potter if he had developed a system of magic based on the tabletop RPGs which existed during 1991. He got in contact with me, and we spent a few days hammering out the details of the magical system; then, I gave him the creative liberty of tackling the story as he saw fit, and he came up with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230151/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hermetic-Arts][/Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts/]], which he sent to me to read and edit before he posted it up, effectively making me the co-writer.

** To be honest, I think your friend's story needs a lot of work. I was interested to see what a HP story using AD&D 2e mechanics would be like, but I was only able to make it through half of the chapter.

Among other things, at the bare minimum, it really needs another proof-read. Grammatical errors and typos abound.

A much more important problem is that there isn't even a hint of the AD&D 2e content in the chapter which is the premise upon which the story was ptiched. I clicked the link out of interest in seeing how that would work out - instead I got, well, I'm not sure what I got, but it wasn't what was advertised.

Harry throwing the F-word at Hagrid? Harry not being the least bit impressed with magic? Way out of character and doesn't make the least bit of sense.

Small point, but the phrase "Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts," should only ever be mentioned once, if at all, in a fic - not 15 times in a chapter that's barely 3000 words.

I'm sorry if that comes off kind of harsh - that's not my intention. But your friend really needs an editor.

A lot of the "typos" are dialect taken from books. What you consider to be grammatical errors, are eccentricities in how Harry thinks, which is how the writer chose to write it. Let's face it, people's thought streams do not care about grammar.

The intention was to establish the setting first. Furthermore, this is not a story where AD&D 2E's magic system is lifted wholesale; I read the entire PHB while doing research for the pitch, and though the book does provide tell you which spells need which components, the book never actually tells what any of those components detail. Furthermore, the tabletop RPG in the story description is in there so people wouldn't be thrown by it later, but the fact is, this story is going to build to it.

#+end_quote

It makes plenty of sense if you think about it and not demand everything go with your expectations. This is a kid who has spent the last three years of his life doing his own magic; magic isn't new to him, so why would he be impressed by it? As for why he's profane and foul-tempered, he's literally spent three years in the company of tabletop gamers, many of whom aren't exactly known for their social skills, and children are prone to picking up mannerisms from the people around them, particularly people they like. He didn't go with Hagrid because he thought he was being rescued, or because he wanted to learn about magic (he already knows magic, he's been exploring it on his own for three years), he left because he saw the situation between Hagrid and his relatives would likely escalate if he did not defuse it and thought getting rid of Hagrid would be for the best.

I asked, and it's used like that intentionally. The writer is implying that Harry is not becoming attached to Hagrid, doing so through the use distancing language. Harry is mocking Hagrid for his overstuffed title every time he thinks of him in such a way.

If you don't like he way Harry feels about Hagrid now, you may want to stop reading before the next chapter; Harry is not kind of Hagrid, and deconstructs his behavior in a way that's extremely unflattering towards him. In fact, the way he sees wizards is extremely unflattering in general, because, as somebody who grew up in the company of mundane people, all the idiosyncrasies of magical people are frankly weird and backwards.

I don't find you harsh at all. It's an opinion, and everybody has one. Like the way Harry seems to be behaving.

That's not what I was talking about. Having Hagrid talk like Hagrid is fine. I meant misplaced commas, run-on sentences, and poor word choice. For example, the second sentence in the story is rather unwieldy. It basically boils down to, "[Harry] regarded [Hagrid] in the same regard as one might [an idiot]." But it's too long and awkward and uses the same word (regarded/regard) twice.

If you want to go with that approach, okay. Normally, you want your first chapter to grab the reader's attention and get them interested and invested in the story. The summary should do this as well, but it has to be even more precise since it's so short. Instead, reading the summary and then reading the chapter felt like a bait-and-switch; I was lured in with the promise of HP and D&D, but instead I got Harry swearing at Hagrid with narry a d20 in sight.

Okay, /you're/ telling me that, but /the story/ didn't tell me that. It's okay to have Harry act differently from his canon portrayal, but the reader needs to know /why/ he's acting differently. The chapter gives no context for the change so it simply comes off as out of character.

That's the big problem. The fact that you need to explain why all these changes have taken place in a reddit post simply shows that the introductory chapter has failed to set up the character changes, the advertised plot hook, the setting, or the larger story.

If you want to establish that Harry's spent time with a bunch of foul-mouthed gamers, then maybe start things off with a Hogwarts owl arriving while Harry is in the middle of a game with his friends at the friendly local gaming store. Have them use that kind of language in the scene. And then, to show that Harry's already been using magic, and thus that walking into Diagon Alley wouldn't be quite so impressive to him, maybe he reacts out of surprise to the owl by casting Magic Missile. A simple scene like that would set up all the changes that have been added to the HP universe and allow the reader to actually buy into and follow what's going on.

As for the "Keeper of the Keys..." bit, if that's meant to be from Harry's point of view, it should be written that way. It would come across as Harry's thoughts if the chapter was written from a first-person perspective, but the author instead used third-person. The simple narration of actions doesn't necessarily come across as Harry's thoughts and opinions.

I think there's a good idea in there somewhere. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/]] has shown that HP and D&D can mix together remarkably well and tell some excellent stories, so I don't doubt that this idea could as well. But I really think it would benefit from some more time on the drawing board.

** Congratulations on taking this venture. It's brave to put your work out there, and you've already done the hard part. I don't think the comments were aiming to be mean, they are just pointing out that sometimes an editor separated from the work can catch errors and surpluses of commas than someone who has stared at the project too long.

** Constructive criticism, take it or leave it. The writing: This might be a bit more legible if the sentences weren't bogged down by excess information and clauses. The writing lacks a certain flow because of it, as readers, especially modern ones do not respond well to overly descriptive long sentences. Try to switch it up more in descriptive paragraphs when it comes to sentence length and cut down on unnecessary adjectives and repetitive language. As an example: there is no need to repeat Hargrid's title, as the distancing is already being done and shown by all of Harry's conversation with him.

The characterization: While I am sure there are reasons for why Harry is acting like a douchebaggy 18 year old, it hardly endears him to the reader. Which is an issue if he is the main character. That is not to say you cannot have an asshole main character, it is just a tad strange to have this kind of asshole and have him be 11. Which leads me to my final point: his speech patterns do not match up with what one expects of an 11 year old, nor what one would expect of a first time interaction with an unknown person of some authority. Even if said person is a bit of a buffoon.

I wish you both luck in finding the right voice and style of writing that works for you.

Things are presented in the way they are because it reflects on how Harry perceives the world. If you don't respond to it, that's not my problem; it just means you can't keep up with this version of Harry.

#+end_quote

There absolutely is a need to repeat Hagrid's title, because that's how Harry thinks of him. It is idiosyncratic to the character, the same way he never learns Ron Weasley's name, or keeps addressing several people by their surnames even after they tell him to call them by their given names.

#+end_quote

He's not supposed to be endearing; he's the type of protagonist where the only reason he'd be the protagonist is because the audience spends the most time with him. He's meant to be a terrible person, a dungeonpunk take on the original story.

#+end_quote

Clearly, you don't spend much time with 11-year-olds, then. I worked at a library for 9 years within walking distance to three schools, so let me tell you, children are major assholes, particularly around people they don't respect.

You really don't know people who just don't put up with crap, or very well-educated youths, do you?

We already have the right voice and style of writing. It's just not one you like.
