I have seen fics with stuff like elemental magic ect, but that doesnt fit well with how magic works in hp, I want fics with abilities that feel as natural as stuff like parseltongue and metamorphagi?? The closest I have come is the fic where Luna's creatures are a weird form of empathy (can't remember that fic tho).


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] ... the main heroine is an Empath (she can feel what others feel), and it is really well incorporated into HP universe, IMHO. It is not hereditary (she is a muggle-born), nobody knows how it happened.

** linkffn(I'm not a hero) has the Potter family magic as spellstealing, with Harry being able to sense magic off spells that are cast around him and being able to instantly use it himself. This includes other family magics, as in the end he literally beats Voldemort with his own family magic

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)
