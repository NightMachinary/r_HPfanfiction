  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

****** I have never argued that British magical society has a good justice system. Rather I have argued with people who say that British magical justice is bad when they justify that position for the wrong reasons or with an inappropriate level of intensity, or when their proposed solutions would be inadequate.

It is something that many people unfortunately fail to grasp - the idea that just because I am arguing against you it does not mean I disagree with your conclusions, broadly understood. Details are important. The way things are expressed and emphasised matters.

** I remember reading a story where Tom Riddle and his OC friend Erik were dumped in a well by older boys and left in there for two weeks. Tom ended up killing Erik after he tried to eat his hand. It was a disgusting scene. I can't remember the name of the story.

I also remember reading a story named Mirror on fictionhunt.com. I've never felt so moved after reading the last chapter, when Harry tried(and failed) to oblivate Cassiopeia. Sounds generic, but I've rarely been so captivated and engaged in a story. Pity the author deleted all her stories on fanfiction.net and changed her username. It's abandoned.

  Harry Potter, weathered wizarding warrior in his mid-twenties, finds himself in 1940. Albus is coming up with a theory, and an adolescent Tom Riddle, torn between feeling threatened and piqued, acquires a controversial mentor. Hallows, spell-making, horror, politics and witty banter, served with a Grindledore sidedish. Slow and slightly disturbing TR/HP. First chapters re-polished.

** It's a scene from A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro. It's during Snape's first years as a teacher when a Gryffindor student makes a reference to Deatheaters. It's a reference to Hamlet as well.

#+begin_quote
  Two more Gryffindor students were gone from Wednesday's first session, which contained sixth years from all houses. As Snape moved their former cauldron partners, another Gryffindor student said to a housemate, "I guess they couldn't stand the stench of eating death anymore."

  Snape turned slowly and quietly, his anger and bitterness now tightly controlled, his voice soft and caressing. "Have you ever considered, Gregson, the proper function of a maggot?" He stopped by the boy's station, leaning forward slightly, one hand on the desk, the other on the back of Gregson's chair. "We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your body becomes a very busy place in the grave." His voice now just audible in the silent room, Snape whispered, "We don't eat death, Gregson. Death eats us."

It has kind of a skeezy start (yay for underage harry potter banging a hot latina milf?), and then a bit of a slow buildup to the main show, but oh man does it take off. The 'finale' fight at the end was just awesome. High, but not overwhelmingly powered Harry vs a force of nature.
