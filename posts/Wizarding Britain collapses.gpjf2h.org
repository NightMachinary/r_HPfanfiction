I don't remember too much just that Dumbledore was evil and a pureblood supremacist and Harry and a few others left which somehow resulted in Wizarding Britain collapsing. I believe the last scene was of Dumbledore sealing himself into Hogwarts as it went into stasis.


** Pretty sure this is Wizard's fall.
