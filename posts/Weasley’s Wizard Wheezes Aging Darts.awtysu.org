So I had an idea come to mind where the Weasley's create aging darts, where you throw a dart at a dartboard and the space the dart hits is the number of years you age for 1 hour. (Eg. 5,10,15,30) Thought it would be an interesting concept to read.


** OotP.

Fred gives it ago: his dart lands on a 3. Nothing happens. Fred doesn't understand why it's working for everyone else but not him...

Two years later they figure it out.

(Disclaimer: ageing in HP doesn't actually work like this; it's not Divination.)
