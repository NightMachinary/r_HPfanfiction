Looking for any fanfictions where divination is actually important outside of the two prophecies. Thanks


** JBern wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4966520/1/The-Inner-Eye-of-Harry-Potter][The Inner Eye]] (abandoned) which I found enjoyable. Not everyone takes divination seriously, but Harry's never wrong.

** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7548963/1/Help-of-a-Seer][Help of a Seer]], which is HP/LL, and a seer takes a crucial role to the plot, making predictions about the war and who might die and survive.

It takes divination a lot seriously but it is REALLY different from HP canon , inherent elemental magic / non-soul bonds and magicals are genetically different from muggles.

If you have enought suspension of disbelief and you like non-canon world-settings it's really good.

Ps: Harry&Luna are seers , divination is an actually respectable and good subject.

** Harry Potter and the Arcana: "Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down?" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7437961/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Arcana]]
