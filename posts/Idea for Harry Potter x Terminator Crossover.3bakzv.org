It sounds weird, I know, but hear me out. My idea is that the Harry Potter timeline is moved forward a few years so that his 5th year takes place about 3 years before SkyNet goes online. After the dust-up in the Prophecy Room, wizards are cleaning up in there and find an ancient prophecy sphere hidden behind a section of wall or something. It was placed there by Merlin himself and foretells (in very vague terms) the rise of SkyNet and the nuclear destruction and winter that follows. The Muggleborns in the DoM figure out what it means and the Ministry strikes a deal with the Goblins to give Wizardkind shelter in their tunnels.

3 years pass as preparations are made by the wizards. The Trio and Dumbledore have spent the time tracking down and destroying the Horcruxes (Harry isn't one). They get them all except for Nagini. Voldemort and his Death Eaters are caught unaware by the Nuclear explosions and Voldemort is again disembodied. He eventually, somehow, manages to REPLACE SkyNet and begins to rule the world. I have no idea what part John Connor would play in this, if any.

I have no idea how to turn this into a story, so it would be great if someone could do it. I would definitely read it.


** Here are some other terminator prompts by category:

Serious/Dark: Apocalypse then

A wizard's attempt at embedding a soul into a machine goes horribly right. With a warning from the future, three weary and disillusioned souls struggle to stop the destructon to come and find themselves facing the one question they never asked: is it worth it?

Humor/crack: Time travel for tin cans

Good guy!Skynet AU, by the way. Magic and technology do not mix well-right up until they do. Question is, what is the student body supposed to do when a T-888 becomes the newest defence against the Dark Arts professor anyway, especially when his stated mission is to protect Harry Potter? And why would a killing machine from a future where they drove the human race to near extinction want to do so anyway?

Adventure:

On October 31st 1976, a naked man lands in a filthy alleyway in downtown London. He has twenty four hours to find his target-and kill her to stop humanity's greatest traitor from ever existing. He is from a desperate future, hunted by enemies greater than any other. And those enemies are already waiting for him. But what else is Harry Potter supposed to do?

Romance:

When Harry, Immortal Master of Death and part-time/casual Slayer of Dark Lords meets Cameron, Terminator Infiltrator Unit and dedicated Guardian of the Future Leader of Mankind, nobody in the Connor household expected sparks to fly quite like that. (Crack Omake: then again, nobody expected Cameron to fall pregnant either)

Horror:

A testament of twisted metal

When Tom Riddle found himself in the jungles of Indochina, little did he know just how it would affect who he eventually became. When Harry stumbled across Tom Riddle's will and a vial of Voldemort's memories, little did he know what he would discover. (Basically, the Terminators start killing off potential resistance fighters and/or their parents in the late '40's, leading to Voldemort becoming obsessed with them. Hunted by a relentless enemy in an alien jungle landscape, we get to see as the last vestiges of Tom Riddle finally die)

Mystery:

When Kingsley Shacklebolt is assassinated by what looks like a metal golem, the Auror corps sends their two best and brightest after the Dark Wizard responsible. Things, though, are not what they seem.
