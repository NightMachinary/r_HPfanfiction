I've read A Second Chance by Breanie ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12924292/1/A-Second-Chance]]) and I was hoping to read some more Sirius and Remus raise Harry fanfic. Also a fic that has harryginny pairing. Preferable to read on FanFiction.Net or Archive of Our Own. Please help me!


** I'll copy my reply to a similar request:

Here are some of my favourites:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]) - a very-well written Sirius raises Harry (post-PoA). One of my favourites.

linkff([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673549/1/The-name-is-Potter-Black]]) is one of the best imho; it also has a sequel. Although Harry is raised by Sirius and Lupin, the story starts from Harry's first year. Both Sirius and Remus are Hogwarts professors.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4431766/1/Harry-Black]])Harry is raised as Sirius' son in order to protect him from Voldemort and Death Eaters. James and Lily are alive, but they do not know that Harry is their son.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11986362/1/I-ll-Stay]]) is a short fic (20-30k), but definitely a must-read. The relationship between Harry and Sirius is very beautiful.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12262029/1/Heartbeat]]) is similar to the previous one (one-shot)

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12312217/1/Harry-s-New-Home]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12078305/3/A-Gift-of-Love]]) Both of them seem to be abandoned, but I still think they are worth reading.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/662406/1/Of-Western-Stars]])

This one does not really fit your request, but I hope you won't mind me adding it. A one-shot about Harry's birth from Sirius' POV. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243167/1/Fumbles-Up-Those-Stairs]])

If you read them, let me know what you think:)

  The bond between a Godfather and his Godson is a phenomenal one. Through the years, if there's anything that can be known with certainty, it's that Sirius Black will stay, no matter what, with his Godson. No slash, godfather-godson bonding fic. AU, Sirius doesn't die, and he raises Harry. T for slight language.

  Sirius saves young Harry from the abusive Dursley's clutches after a twist of fate secures his innocence from the Ministry. Follow Harry over the years as he grows up in a loving and happy wizarding home - how will this affect the future war? JK Rowling owns Harry Potter and all the characters! Enjoy!

  6 year old Harry Potter has nothing but a vague memory of being loved; of a life before he had been left at the hands of the Dursleys. One person hasn't forgotten, though, and when Sirius saves Harry from his abusive relatives, can he fix the damage done, and give Harry the life James and Lily wanted for him? WARNING-ABUSIVE DURSLEYS! Sirius never in Azkaban, Genius!Powerful!Harry.
