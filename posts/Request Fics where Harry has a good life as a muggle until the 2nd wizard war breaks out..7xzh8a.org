are there any HP fanfic where Harry has a fairly successful life in a muggle world but gets dragged into the second wizard world? I am tired of seeing trash fics that has "poor(financially) prostitute Harry suddenly is a savior" cliche or "Harry is abandoned by Dursleys and wizards somehow can't find him until now" cliche.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** I'm betaing a story which fits that description. Dumbledore hid Harry in the Muggle world. Harry was tutored but has no idea that there's an entire secret society. Tonks stumbles across him in a bar.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

You mean "destitute", not "prostitute", right? I can imagine both kinds of fics, though I'd rather not. O_O

*** No i do mean prostitute as in "an individual who gives sexual services in exchange of goods." Yes there are fics like that,and most of them are just bad attempts to ship HP/SS or HP/DM.

The only one I can think that is decent enough is Pretty Boy by Debstheslytherinfan.
