Now:

This could be a Harry time travels story

or a Harry who ends up going to an alternate universe. Depending on what he was wishing for exactly in the RoR.

Or maybe something else, like hallucinations, or however you want to make it be, for the changes (whatever they are) to happen.


** Not entirely in-line with the prompt, but I'm pretty surprised that, with all the fanfiction out there, nobody ever did some sort of lemon or lime fic where Harry wishes for something a hormonal teenage boy would likely wish for, or where he wishes girls would be interested in him for who he was as a person, as a response to the things Cho or Vane did.

There's pretty much infinite potential for abuse there, but I don't think I've ever seen one person do it. Though I hardly claim to have read everything there is. For a room that can give you nearly anything you ask for, nobody ever seems to want much beyond practice dummies and libraries with fireplaces.

Then again, one could just as easily make the argument that there's a million different entertaining uses of the /engorgio/ charm alone, and it's silly to presume people are just frenching each other in the broom closets.

*** As Harry got out of the Room of Requirements, he was startled by a sweet girly voice, "Oh Mr. Potter."

"Professor Umbridge, I-" he tried to explain, but she cut him off in a sing-song tone, "I'll see you tonight in my office for your detention."

For a brief moment Harry could have sworn he saw Professor Umbridge wink towards him but before he realized what just happened she had already walked past him.

"Oh, I guess some things never change," said Harry to himself.

**** The idea I had a long time ago is that Harry decided to 'misuse' the room a bit to spend intimate time with some of his friends who are witches, so he sneaks down there at night when everyone has gone to bed to have a bit of fun. The room gives him the scenarios he asks for: snogging Hermione in the library one stack away from a big crowd of people studying, him and Ginny undressing each other while on broomsticks, sharing a shower with Katie, Angelina, and Alicia after a Quidditch match, ect.

But (in my head), the limitation of the room is that it can't make people or accurate fakes of people. If you asked the room to give you, say, Lord Voldemort, the best you'd get is a statue, or some kind of highly realistic doll or immobile replica. So what happens is, the scenarios Harry conjures up to entertain himself translate into wet dreams of the witches he's imagining himself with. They dream the scenarios he creates. Or to put it another way, the room can't fake people, so it just inserts Harry into their minds while they're asleep, and manipulates their dreams to match the request that's been put to the room. So unknown to him, Harry is giving all the witches he's fantasizing about these dreams, that they remember when they wake up. You don't remember most of your dreams, and if you do, the details are always faded, but what the room is doing isn't really a dream, it's inserting a made-up situation created by magic (and containing Harry) into the same spot a dream would go, so you remember everything about it. It just feels like a really vivid dream.

I tentatively named the story Incubus, since an incubus is a male sex demon that comes to women while they sleep in their dreams, but I never wrote much of it, because I'm horrible at lemons.

What does surprise me, though, is that nobody really seems to have done this idea before or anything like it. There's so many things you could do with the room, but nobody ever uses it for anything interesting. Could you use it to fake people you know? Could you use it to have sex? What happens if you pace in front of the door and ask it "I need to have sex with So-And-So?" Can it produce alcohol? Or other forms of contraband? Can it provide a doorway to another location outside of the castle? Could a male student use it to circumvent the alarmed stairs on all the girl's dorms in the castle?

****** I would also assume it could, because I can't imagine a reason it could not. The room could open passageways all throughout the castle, to any location that was necessary for a door to exist, so I can't think of a reason why it could not be used to bypass security measures in the castle. The room might even be able to open a way to the Chamber of Secrets, and the fact the last book had Ron bullshitting parseltongue to get into the chamber instead of getting in via asking the room for a way into the Chamber of Secrets is just one more reason I don't believe Rowling really thought a lot of her plot points through. One of those things is a lot more reasonable a possibility than the other.

Mostly, I'm just thinking of ways that a teenage boy might be tempted to use the room's power to fulfill private fantasies or desires. How many of those could the room do? Could it be used to smuggle alcohol into the castle, or produce alcohol? Smuggle, probably yes, produce, maybe, I don't know if they ever tested whether or not it can flaunt Gamp's Laws. Can you use it to sneak into any of the girl's dorms in the school? I'd say yes, you could. If you asked the room to help you have sex with somebody, what would the room do or create? Can you use the room to fulfill fantasies?

******** So I just checked. Actually it totally could. Gamp's law says you can't make food out of nothing, because of something to do with nutrition, it isn't explained in direct detail. The elaboration we get is that you can't just make "good food" out of nothing.

However, you can:

- Summon food if you know where it is (obviously).
- Multiply food to stretch it out more or less indefinitely if you have at least a small starting amount of it (Doubling Charm, also possibly other similar spells).
- Engorgio works on food to make more/bigger food, and that's real food, not fake or empty food mass.

And in addition, things that are not very nutritious literally can just be outright created successfully: the examples given are sauces, potable water, and */wine/*. So it would seem as though alcohol is in fact an exception to Gamp's laws, which means even though the room cannot produce "good/nutritious food" out of nothing, it could easily make alcoholic beverages, because apparently whatever technical limitation applies to stop healthy food from being conjurable doesn't apply if you don't care about the nutrition.

Though this also raises a further question of, does that mean you could conjure chocolate and junk food that wouldn't make you fat, because it has no nutrition? Possibly. Another thing teenagers trying to abuse the room might care a great deal about.

********** That's another exception to Gamp's law. It's mentioned that you can "transform" food, and transformation is the subset of transfiguration that involves altering the physical features of a substance, such as turning falcons into cups or pincushions into porcupines. So in there's no reason you couldn't transfigure a rock or a desk into a chicken and then cook and eat the chicken. That does in fact work, it is explicitly stated it does.

#+begin_quote
  "/Your mother/ /can't produce food out of thin air, no one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can/ /Summon/ /it if you know where it is,/ *you can* *transform* *it*, /you can/ /increase the quantity/ /if you've already got some./"
#+end_quote

What we aren't sure about is conjurations. We know from spells like /Serpentsortia/ that you can conjure animals out of nothing. Could you kill and cook the birds produced by /Avis/? It's not explained. Maybe. Maybe not. Only one of Gamp's Laws was explained to us, and without all five, we don't know exactly what can and cannot be done.

One thing that's interesting is that there are international laws restricting and regulating what wizards are allowed to conjure. Which implies there are things you can conjure that wizarding society at large does not want you to. We don't know anything about that either, but we can make some educated guesses. It seems very possible to conjure or transfigure precious metals, like gold and silver, because we've seen Dumbledore and Voldemort do it. I would imagine doing so is a restricted practice to avoid destabilizing national and global economies. Wizarding communities might also refuse to use raw gold or silver as a currency for that reason, because they know it can, in fact, just be made. Thus the necessity for minted coins that cannot be duplicated. That's also a likely reason for why the goblins are always checking and double checking things like gemstones on their counters: I'd imagine crystal gems would be something else you could conjure or transfigure, so the goblins would logically be looking for counterfeits.

I'll say this. Transfiguration seems to be absurdly overpowered. Someone who has mastered transfiguration can just about do whatever they like, as long as they remembered to pack a ham sandwich in their pocket before they started.

*********** Well we're indirectly hinted at the fact that you cannot magically create love, only lust, so it was always my assumption that it's another exception. Also I don't think you can create life. Sure a desk turned into a pig might behave like a pig, but it's not an actual pig. Same with Avis and Serpentsortia... they are just embodiments of magic that behave like the said animals but are not real animals. Also if that were possible, there would be no need for Grindelwald or Voldemort to recruit actual people for their armies if they could just conjure them. Which leads me to my fourth assumption. You cannot create agency. Any wizard who gets good at casting the Imperius curse could build an army. Or in fact is not stopping Veela from building an army by enslaving people with their allure. Voldemort also can animate dead bodies to do his biddings. But I think that once they are under a mind controlling spell, people can't really do anything else other than what they're ordered... same with Inferi who are used for very basic tasks as dragging you under the water in the cave. If you want to effectively conquer the world you still need people to be able to make decisions and think for themselves and that's why Voldemort or Grindelwald still need actual willing supporters as opposed to an army of slaves. I have no assumption on what the fifth exception might be.

************ Not to be rude, but it doesn't really matter if you "think" life can't be created. It can be, and they do it constantly. What you want to believe was debunked in second year, Harry was able to talk to the snake that Malfoy created from nothing at the dueling club. If what /Serpentsortia/ conjures wasn't a real snake, just some 'thing' that looked very much like a snake, that wouldn't be possible.

A cup that's turned into a falcon becomes a real falcon. When you say "I think there's some abstract thing that makes it not a real falcon," that's fanon. You're just making that up.

It's magic. You're trying to apply some sort of science fiction rule, like clones don't ever come out quite right, we can't just make people, to fantasy. This isn't science fiction. It is magic.

** It is true most teenagers were dissatisfied with life. Mature enough to desire more freedom but not enough to be responsible adults they were stuck between trying to find themselves and obeying their parents and teachers. This was especially true of one Harry Potter who was currently moping around the Room of Requirement on a cold January evening of 1996. In a little over a year, he had been attacked by a dragon, grindylows, merpeople, skrewts, acromantula, dementors and to top it all off- Voldemort himself. As if that wasn't enough, he still felt responsible for Cedric's death, his friends had abandoned him over the summer and the press had slandered his name.

He had longed for the... normalcy of Hogwarts. As if a magic castle full of teenagers could ever be considered normal! And now not one, but two teachers were torturing him. Umbridge he could deal with, but Snape rifling through his memories was too much. In short, Harry was tired in a way that no sleep or rest could cure. He was tired of Angelina yelling at him during Quidditch practice, of Hermione forcing him to teach undisciplined children, of Dumbledore ignoring him.

But most of all he was tired of being so alone. Hermione always pushed him to do better at school with no thought of his feelings. And as much as he liked Ron the boy was not exactly emotionally mature. Sirius was next to useless as he was still a wanted criminal and in hiding. Remus and Hagrid had been on separate Order missions on the continent for months and neither had the time for him. Harry could turn neither to his friends nor to the adults for help.

Oh, how he wished he had one person on his side. Just one person to listen to him and support him instead of push him harder to see if he breaks. As he thought that he felt, more than heard a deep rumble and the torches' flames flickered. He barely had time to wonder if Hogwarts was protected against earthquakes and the rumbling had stopped. He was too tired to care at this point so he simply left for Gryffindor tower. It was already after curfew and the last thing he needed was more detentions.

The Gryffindor common room was empty by this time save for a lonely figure sitting close to the hearth. Paying little attention to someone studying late Harry made for the staircase to the boys' dormitories. The noise he made woke the girl which immediately turned her attention on him.

“Oh, Harry you're finally back. I must have fallen asleep waiting for you.” She seemed happy to see him for some reason. As she came closer, he saw her long red hair, blue eyes and slightly upturned nose. Her gentle features morphed from happiness to concern as she in turn inspected him. “You look terrible, sweetie. Has something happened?” She hugged him and Harry briefly froze before pulling away. He had no idea why this girl was talking to him as if they had known each other for years.

“Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?” he asked. The girl laughed merrily before replying.

“Oh, what's this?” she teased him “The great Harry Potter is embarrassed by his sister? There's no one around, silly. It's just us.” Her reply shocked him so much that for the first time in years Harry was left speechless. This caused the girl to worry even more as she dragged him to a sofa and made him sit.

“Merlin, you really don't recognize me, do you? It's me- Anna” she still hadn't let go of his hand. His empty gaze caused her worry to grow to fear “Did you hit your head on something? Were you hit by a spell? I'm taking you to madam Pomfrey” her determination finally got Harry out of his stupor. He could not let the nurse see his arm. She seemed to recognize the look on his face before he spoke. She sighed.

“Still scared of mediwitches, huh? Fine, at least let me look you over” As she drew her wand and pointed it at his face his Quidditch reflexes kicked in and he grabbed her hand. He didn't need strange girls pointing their wands at his face.

“You really are jumpy tonight.” There was no reproach in her tone “It's okay, sweetie, it's just me. Look at me, Harry” She placed the fingers of her other hand under his chin and gently lifted. “I'm not going to hurt you, Harry. I just want to cast a diagnostic charm on you.” Something in her eyes finally made him relent and he released her hand.

“Hmm, strange. You seem to be doing okay. Exhausted and a bit anemic, but no spell or curse damage.” Her brow furrowed as she pondered his state. “Please say something, you're really worrying me.”

“I don't have a sister” his voice was hoarse from disuse and shock.

“Well, that's a bit harsh, don't you think? I'm sitting right here. I'd get offended if you didn't look like the Hogwarts express had just run you over.” His revelation only caused her to hold his hand in both of hers.

“I'm sorry, but I don't know you. I don't have a sister.” He repeated again. “My parents are dead.”

“I know our parents are dead, silly. I'm two years older than you. Please tell me this is some sort of an elaborate prank so I can yell at you in peace.” Harry still remained silent. He knew he had no siblings and yet somewhere deep inside he felt he could trust the young woman in front of him. “Right, I want you to tell me everything that you did after your last class today” Harry wanted to get to the bottom of this so he obliged her.

“Well, I did my homework, then I went to dinner. After that, we had a DA meeting but we only practiced different types of shields. After the meeting I came here” he answered.

She contemplated this for a few seconds. “No, you didn't. I saw Ron and Hermione over an hour ago. They said you were still in the Room of Requirement.”

“Well, I was, but I didn't do anything. I just sat staring in the fire.” He replied. Now Anna was sure she was on the right track.

“Think, Harry. What exactly did you do there besides staring into the fire?” She wasn't giving up on this so he replied.

“I just... I just wished I wasn't so alone” He was looking at his knees now, his voice faltering. “That I had one person on my side”

Again, she seemed to recognize his mood. “You have me, sweetie. You always have” Gently, she cupped his face with her hands. He hesitated at first but finally gave way to the feeling deep inside him. Then she put his head on her lap. He could trust her.

“Shh, it's okay, Harry. We'll figure this out tomorrow. Rest now” As she stroked his hair his tears flowed freely. Perhaps he finally did have someone completely on his side. Even if he had probably broken several laws of magic to get there. He was too tired to think about magical impossibilities and soon fell asleep.

The End.

AU: Okay, so I thought about bringing Lilly back, but decided against it. It would open a lot of problems starting with resurrection and not to mention projecting mommy issues. I also didn't want the sister to be a copy of Lily so I gave Anna blue eyes. (Brown are too common and boring.) Harry is still the Boy-Who-Lived. The Room of Requirement either brought Harry to a parallel universe or brought Anna to Harry's. Or somehow warped time so James and Lily were older and had two children (The Room almost drained itself of magic in the process.) I think I like the second version better so Anna has memories of their parents who were alive in her universe. This gives us all sorts of options like her being off age and becoming Harry's guardian and protecting him from the other adults and so on and so on. But she knows their parents are dead, so never mind. Maybe in another version. But this is getting way too long for a reddit prompt, so I'll just stop here.

Edit: Thanks for the awards.

*** Harry sighed as the DA filtered out of the Room of Requirement, fiddling with the odd bone he found in the corner of the room. As much progress as everyone was making in their little illicit impromptu study group, he worried it wouldn't be enough. Between OWLs and the newly resurrected Dark Lord on the loose, they just didn't have the /time/ to truly prepare for what the world was going to throw at them.

/Voldemort has decades on me/ he thought to himself. /I wish I had more time/ -- and then he heard it.

/Then time you shall have, o Wizard mine./

He jumped in shock, and spun around.

“Who's there?” he said -- he had been certain the Room was empty. And then the words caught up with him.

“What do you mean, ‘time I shall have'?”

But he heard no more whispers, and when he checked the Marauder's Map, the Room was as empty as he had thought it would be. Spooked, he threw on his invisibility cloak and opened the door to leave when, quite unexpectedly, he bumped into someone. Someone who shouldn't have been there, since the hallway was empty on the map just a moment ago.

Someone who was wearing flamboyant purple robes that wouldn't look out of place on Albus Dumbledore. Someone who had the same face, the same kind eyes as Albus Dumbledore, but with half a century fewer wrinkles.

“Oh, bollocks,” Harry swore.

---

Harry got his Ahamkara wish, and now the Room of Requirement has opened up in 1943, where he is the same age as a young Tom Riddle. Plenty of time for him to train up to match him, if he just puts in the work. If only he would stop hearing whispers in the back of his mind, claiming to be his /Salvation./

**** Nice. I thought you were going to have the room trap Harry with all the books and training he could want until he was also 60, only to let him out and have no time passed outside. Alternatively, it could accelerate him so that the outside world seems to be frozen and he has time to do whatever he wants except interact with people. Both have interesting implications. Yet another alternatively, harry lives out the next 40 years and gets all the training and whatever he needs - works through all his emotional issues and everything - only to find he never left the RoR and it's all been in his head. Sort of a variation on the first idea.

** This could also be post DH and EWE, with Harry being a professor. Change some background that people were more affected by the war with many unable to continue to live normally.

This could mean that many became traumatized and just retreated into themselves, or to make it more morbid and cliche, have someone suicide or how they could not return to normalcy after two years of being in a battle state. Maybe with Hermione throwing herself into recovery and restructuring of the ministry and Ron becoming a hit wizard.
