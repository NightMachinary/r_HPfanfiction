** Lol I practically live in that subfandom now! Some of my favourite short founder-era fics are:

- Letters of the Four Founders by Iris Chmal. This is a short, super hilarious, sort-of romance (RR/SS) story told through a bunch of letters and diaries. linkffn(1608189)

- The Fat Lady by Belldere, a funny one-shot describing the origin of the Gryffindor-Slytherin rivalry and the portrait "Fat Lady". linkffn(9943175)

- Frozen Over by TheNextFolchart, which is also a funny one-shot. It features the origin of... well, you'll see :) linkffn(11436471)

- Some Strange Affliction by shadesofmidnightsun. This one-shot is THE fic that converted me to a GG/SS shipper. It focuses on the emotional developments of falling in love rather than physical admiration, and I think it totally deserves more attention. linkffn(11505141)

And then there are the longer founder stories like the ones by Izzyaro or Preciousann, but those are usually easier to find

  They will travel, hunt dangerous creatures, stop dark wizards, and seek knowledge wherever it is to be found. Godric doesn't need anything else and would never be foolish enough to seek it.

  Godric finds a clever way to keep Salazar out of his Common Room. This, unfortunately, leads to some unforeseen schoolwide animosity... for thousands of years... whoops.

** Can I suggest my own? A single not-very long one-shot so for, but there are similar things in the works for Rowena, Godric and Salazar at the moment as well as a much longer multi-chapter fic.

  Kind. Gentle. Caring. Pretty. All ways in which Helga Hufflepuff is remembered. Unfortunately, they are completely wrong.
