I'd like to request stories with Harry being friendly like C'est La Vie, where Harry has a couple of friends in all houses, and, like in Golden Path, where he is basically perfect and everyone is his friend. I don't mind if they're full of cliches. I just know I like to read Time Travel, Fix-it, Lord Potter (everyone seems to hate Lord Potter stories)... I don't mind bashing, slash, etc.

Is this considered guilty pleasure? wish-fulfillment? fluff? (help me please, i just don't know how to find this kind of stories)

I just had enough of the angst :/ I really like Harry having things under control, if that makes sense. BTW I dont really like crack fics.. soo...NO Oh God Not Again, seventh horrocrux, etc

Thanks guys!

** Love C'est La Vie! I still go back and reread it sometimes. Thanks for all the recommendations of similar fics. Please keep them coming!

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

**** Motivations fits your request pretty perfectly. Hope, Hogwarts' Dawn, White Knight Grey Queen and Blue Steel as well. His longer fics. They get kind of samey in that they're all super Harry (socially and powerfully) with great connections/support/friends. This Means War is probably his best known one, I'm not a fan. It's more light and has prank stuff going on.

And as stated, everything he wrote is good. And pretty much all his stories fit your criteria in one way or the other.

** Harry is perceived to be a girl by all witches, wizards and magical creatures, but is perceived as a boy by himself and muggles. Along the way Harry makes friends with people across houses and is generally friendly to all the students (with Malfoy being the major exception). Has the funniest Padma in all of fanfiction.
