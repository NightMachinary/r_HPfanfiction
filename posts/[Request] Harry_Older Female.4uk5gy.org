  complete: To protect Harry Professor McGonagall relives her teenage years. What seemed like a good idea at first is swiftly becoming a bad one. This is a rather twisted romantic adventure that is sure to please. I think. Read Please:

** I think the parameters of your request are a bit too broad. I mean, even Hermione is older than Harry, then Katie Bell, Cho Chang, Angelina and Alicia, Fleur, N. Tonks, Andromeda Tonks, Narcissa Malfoy, Bellatrix LeStrange, Mrs. Granger, Molly Weasley, Septima Vector, Sybill Trelawney, Poppy Pomfrey, Rosmerta, and that's just one generation up.

What's the optimal example, here?

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror) is a fantastic Harry/Tonks fic. The writing style is fun to read, the plot is compelling, and the characterisations are pretty realistic. Unfortunately, it's abandoned (and the author said that she has no intention of ever finishing it), but you'll still be able to get 40 lengthy chapters of enjoyment out of it.

  In his quest to stop Malfoy in his sixth year, Harry turns to an old friend for help. Along the way he finds new allies, a Horcrux, & someone to stand by his side. Alternate view of HBP. Rating for language & violence.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index#wiki_harry_.2F][Check the wiki.]]

e: I don't know why the hate. It is a valid suggestion. I don't know any good fics with Harry / Older Female, so I recommended checking the wiki. I didn't say it was the only recommendation.
