Creating this possible thread, because i'm curious. How would YOU get through the TWT, and for extra internet cookies how would you go through the known wizarding world if you were the bow/girl who lived if you had knowledge of the future of the wizarding world(which if your reading this you have probable read harry potter so no point in asking when you already have that knowledge.

Oh for the TWT question you are 100% muggle, but the HP universe has been moved to present.

Edit: for the sake of arguing i'm going to copy and paste one of my answers.

Say everyone has at least some magic in them explaining how a woman can lift a car off her baby. The cup takes ALL magic, and kills you since magic is connected to your soul(not too bad of a theory considering magic can interact with it already(ala hocruxes)). So either a chance against a dragon or insta death.

BTW the point of these questions is to ask what you would do in the situation i mean this is a world of magic logic is not exactly used much here.


** 100% muggle versus a dragon? Bazookas and a fire hose if there's a water main nearby.

And GWL-me would start replying to fan mail, putting out non-skeeter interviews, and making powerful allies to stand by me and vouch for my sanity when Voldemort returns.

Where do you get the bazooka? And If you can just wish for anything, why not something more useful like an Apache Helicopter or an A-10?

**** Take the Knights bus close to the next army base, accio a couple LAW-80s or Carl Gustavs (that's the British stock of that time), shrink them and that's it.

Alternatively, if the trace is an issue, use my invisibility cloak (I'm Harry, right?) to sneak a ferry ride to France and do the same there.

Now, attack helicopters are not easy to fly and there's not enough space for an A-10 to take off from (and you'd show up on the RAF radar screens, who wouldn't be very kind to an rouge strike plane bombing an abandoned castle.

However, if you'd have a squadron of Mi-24s during the Battle of Hogwarts the Death Eaters wouldn't make it past the treeline. 80mm rockets and 30mm shells would make quick work from anything that moves and your AT-6 missiles should easily take out the giants. You can do all that killing from a safe distance where no wizard could hit you. That might be completely overkill however, because a couple of well placed machine guns would have taken care of the final battle within 5 minutes without any losses on the light side.

***** As a note, literally all munitions on us army posts are stored in weapons safes, seperate from their respective munitions. I dont beleive british army munition storage would be much different, maybe worse because they have more strict rules on firearms.

The accio would either need to be strong enough to break the vault, and leave evidence of magic that would get you in trouble, or a simple household charm would end up failing and just making a mess of the inside of the safe. This is all assuming that the magic doesn't set the technology off the first time they interact.

******* Mind, i havent ever seen the munitions storage, just the rifle storage on base. So my experiences are based on that. Getting a rifle involves sneaking onto post, past the fences, past the locked door to the building and also past all the people in between. Best bet is to go on a weekend when nobody will be there to notice random doors opening. Walking past the first gate to the building will take at least an hour, going at a 15 minute mile pace. The army bases are big.

Next, you need to get past a bank vault type door. With the twisty thing and a combination code and key lock. I have no clue how helpful magic will be for this, because there may be digitial alarms that go off because of the magic, or in spite of it.

Then you just walk in, grab a rifle and the scope you want for it and walk out.

Then you have to do it all again to get munition for this rifle.

This requires intimate knowledge of where everything is kept, the ability to travel large distances un-noticed (eye sight apparition is acceptable, if you can keep it quiet) and very decent lock breaking capabilities.

Also, if you want the theft to go unnoticed you also need to find the paperwork stored that acknowledges what you stole. Assume three copies and that it is in at least two different buildings for each thing stolen. More copies if there is no digital version.

********* Yeah, probably, but it's much more likely that he would get caught in the act, or after the act happened if you didn't do it yourself.

Either he'd get caught trying to fix other people's paperwork, or he'd get caught because the paperwork doesn't match.

Assuming he takes the fall for stealing the weapons, you still have the statute to deal with because he'll be talking about mind control.

I was also basing these instructions off the assumption that unforgivables were off the table. imperio would make it easier, especially since you don't risk youself getting caught.

this all assumes you know who is /really/ in charge of munitions though. Humanity always has their clueless people in charge, and you might end up screwing yourself over hard if you choose the wrong guy.

******* Your best bet to get easy access rpgs is to go into an active warzone and steal it there. Peacetime weapons storage doesnt have the need for easy access to weapons in case of attack, and it is kept accordingly.

If i had magic, and the year was 2015, i could reasonably get an rpg from a us army base over the course of a month. I would've spending most of the month snooping around base figuring out where all the stuff was before i stole it. Paperwork, locks and also people to be thorough. Profficiency in lockpicking, understanding military inventory lists, obliviation and also invisibility are all required to get in and out without being caught.

** I would get through the tournament by walking away. The contract is "magically binding", but most stories I've read (and perhaps canon as well) imply that the consequence of breaking that kind of contract is the loss of your magic.

Well, it's not as though I have any magic to lose. So if the goal is to "get through" the tournament, i.e. survive for it's duration... just don't participate.

Kind of a cop-out answer, I know, but if you're going to try to force a muggle to compete in a wizarding tournament you should expect an unusual solution.

** Okay to not be an ass and answer your question.

Dragon I step in, fail and step out. No possible way for a muggle to beat a dragon with no super powers or weapons you wouldn't have access to in England. (No way can an American buy a hand gun or AR-15 in England on short notice.

I prey on Cedric's sence of fair play and get him to tell me the riddle (if I'm not coming in with knowledge of the tasks already). I max out a credit card and get Amazon to two ship me a scuba set. (I'm scuba certified so no worries about the bends).

The Maze. I step in and send up red Sparks via Roman candles, again if I have access to an AR-15 I think I could take most of the beasts but no way I'm risking my life for money and fame.

** I thought to help get the ball rolling a bit more i would put how i would deal with the TWT. With the dragon if i can bring something else since i don't have a wand (which knowing the arrogance of some wizards i can see happening) i would reasearch what could poison a dragon, and stuff that in some dragon meat(by dragon meat i mean what a dragon finds delicious) than just wait if no poison maybe high impact explosives or maybe an explosive mix which when ingested mixes than combusts. If i can't bring anything, and don't know about it i would just wait til it falls asleep which could take many hours than be very careful, and hope for the best.

For the lake if i knew about it before hand scuba tank+flippers+swimsuit+a gun that is effective underwater barring a gun harpoon launcher with as many harpoons as i can carry. If i didn't know beforehand go into the lake, stay under as long as i can, surface and than exit. I still particapated so should be safe.

In the last one. Compass, and maybe a book to wait it out. If I can't bring either still waiting it out, and hoping for the best.

TL;RD Basically wait and hope for the best.
