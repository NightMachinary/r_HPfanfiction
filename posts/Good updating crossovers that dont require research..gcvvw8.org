** I want to recommend linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow And The God-Emporerless Heathens) as the story is a crack fic and is brilliant. Unfortunately, Harry is a bit of a (clueless) mary sue, but eh.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

** Story: Prongs

Transforms for the most part. Briefly crosses with Twilight. It's a really good story.
