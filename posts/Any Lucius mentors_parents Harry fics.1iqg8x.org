I'm sure there's probably not that much out there, but I'm a little enamored with the idea of Lucius Malfoy mentoring/training/parenting Harry. I don't like character bashing. I just think it would be interesting if Lucius saw hidden potential in Harry and wanted to bring out Harry's inner Slytherin.


** They are out there, I know they are, I've read them, I just can't think of any of their titles.

** I enjoyed [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2027554/1/In-Blood-Only][In Blood Only]]. In it, Snape realizes he is Harry's father. Lucius mentors Harry a little without realizing who he is, though that is only a minor part of the story.

** Sacrafices Arc by Lightning on Wave. In it the Malfoys see Harry's potential and they become allies/second family to him. And Harry is in Slytherin. It starts with Saving Conner. There are eight books all together. It really is just an amazing fanfic, but really different from the original books in some ways.

*** I've read those! That's in line with what I'm looking for, but I was hoping for something with a bit more direct mentorship or parenting. It's really Narcissa and Snape who have a close relationship with Harry in the Sacrifices Arc.

**** That's true, but I felt like Lucius did in his own way care about him. Thus why he sought revenge for him. I can't think of another though :/ I am super excited that you already read those haha I love when other people have read the fanfics I have.
