It's a Harry seer au. He was born in the Tom Riddle timeline. Tom doesn't like him and pushes him down the stairs in their schooling years, which only expands his seeing capabilities to also see other realities and dimensions. He predicts Tom will die on a hogmeads trip by a llama and wears ugly sweaters. He is also has the divination teaching position, while Tom has the defense against the dark arts one.
