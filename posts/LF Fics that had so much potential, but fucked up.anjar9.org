**** Yes, you wouldn't miss much by jumping to Year 3.

I especially hate rehashing CoS plot, because that either assumes Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore or Idiot!UselessAdults!PlotDevice!Dumbledore. Both options are bad. Let's just consider this:

1) Dumbledore was very certain that Hagrid was framed.

2) Dumbledore had to know the ghost of the murder victim, Myrtle Elisabeth Warren, was haunting that particular bathroom.

3) Dumbledore could ask only a few basic questions to identify the true culprit and the entrance to CoS:

#+begin_quote
  "Please tell me Miss Warren, what actually happened before you died?"

  "I heard a boy hissing near that sink, and I went there looking. Then I saw a pairs of big yellow eyes, and I just died."
#+end_quote

This is not some highly sophisticated detective work, this is the most basic common sense. I even heard excuses that because she haunted a girl's bathroom, men could not go in to investigate. LOL, I mean what a fucking moron and negligent shit head do you have to be if you let such triviality impede a MURDER INVESTIGATION?

4) Now if Dumbledore asked and Myrtle absolutely refused to talk, multiple times even, then the canon plot had a little bit more excuse. But not by much, because the monster was called the SLYTHERIN'S MONSTER. What was Slytherin's symbol? A snake. What was Slytherin's specialty? Parselmouth. What was the King of Snake? The Basilisk! And what killed people without trace? The Basilisk!

See, the all wise and super intelligent Albus Dumbledore should at least be able to make this almost basic logic deduction, right?

5) Therefore, if the Dumbledore you are writing is not of the Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood type, you need to assume he knows it could be a Basilisk down there, and he would take immediate actions after the first attack, such as flooding the castle with roosters. However, Dumbledore would still have to find the entrance to CoS and a parselmouth to open it.

***** Dumbledore doesn't seem 100% certain that Hagrid was framed. Or maybe he was, up until Colin Creevey was brought in after being Petrified. This CoS scene is pretty direct in implying he knew it was Tom Riddle up to his shenanigans yet again, and possibly suspected it earlier. It makes him more and more neglectful, after Hagrid was taken to Azkaban, and he himself was sacked by the Board, with his only instructions being, "Help will be given to those who ask for it".

#+begin_quote
  ‘What does this mean, Albus?' Professor McGonagall asked urgently.

  ‘It means,' said Dumbledore, ‘that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.'

  Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.

  ‘But Albus ... surely ... who?'

  ‘The question is not who,' said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. ‘The question is, /how ...'/
#+end_quote

Lol, what the fuck, "Men can't get into the girl's bathroom to search" for the murder, because propriety trumps justice?

I'm sure wizards don't have more of a taboo in going into the witches' room than Muggles do. Sometimes I'm astounded by the level of convoluted headcanoning some people will do try and justify canon plot points. It's one thing to shout that HP is full of plot holes... and then there's trying to mentally handwave all minor plot inconsistencies or bad mathematics because doing otherwise would be tantamount to implying JKR could be mistaken in something.

its more about providing a cogent, in-universe explanations for the plot holes or inconsistencies in canon when youre writing fanfic.

******* I don't mind if people try to find rational explanations in a sensible way that fits the universe. Like, for example: Since wands choose their owners, no wizard would give away their matched wand by choice. Ron was given Charlie's old wand, and Charlie gave it away because it was never his wand, but a hand-me-down from another relative, and he bought a new one with his own money after graduating.

The ridiculous ones are trying to explain away the "Wizards simply relieved themselves where they stood" Pottermore information, by headcanoning that there are spells to keep poop and piss from running down you leg, and that robes became the most popular wizarding fashion to facilitate wizards' habit of shitting on the floor.

I think it's plausible that he, not being a Parselmouth himself was unable to open the chamber, and thus settled on trying to work things out from the other end and would have been trying to find and remove Tom.

Also, Dumbledore never doubted Hagrid. Giving him a job and trusting him with all that he does shows that beyond a doubt.

I don't know how you say it made him more neglectful though. We never know what Dumbledore is doing during the entirety of CoS, and it's entirely possible he was trying what he could to find, trap and eliminate Tom, and really, physically with a student in their personal belongings is a good hiding place, while Tom was being clever enough to avoid what he did when he controlled Ginny. (Now that I think about that, that is a fantastic fic idea too) I just think canon Dumbledore has shown his character to be truly good enough times that I would give him the benefit of the doubt.

Also, I just want to point out wizards were comfortable with going into the Women's room, as you say, which we can see from the quidditch changing stalls being co-ed and the prefect's bathroom, which wow, would be so fun now that I think about it.

  What was the King of Snake?
#+end_quote

A dragon, probably. But that's neither here nor there.

There's every possibility that Dumbledore just straight-up has limits on his power so long as he's just the Headmaster of Hogwarts. He can hire Hagrid on as staff, but he can't allow him to finish his classes. Not also that the canon explanation for the original Chamber opening was that Hagrid kept an Acromantula in the school, which he actually and absolutely did. Given that we don't know how long it takes for ghosts to come back, Myrtle could be relatively recent, so she'd not have been of much help in the original Chamber case. Note also that 'Big yellow eyes and hissing' are very much things that Acromantulas can display.

In Harry's second year, however, he probably /did/ talk to Myrtle. And in so doing, he probably figured out that it was a Horcrux behind all this, which means that he has to be extremely careful or else, for all he knows, Voldemort will come striding out of one of the House dorms having murdered everyone inside. He has little to no reason to believe that it's actually a monster, rather than just Voldemort trying to hide his activities. Voldemort can /definitely/ petrify people, and anything overt that Dumbledore does to stop him might cause him to escalate into outright killing. Voldemort literally infiltrated the school the previous year, why /wouldn't/ it be him again? Dumbledore is probably covertly monitoring the staff, the students, anyone with access to the grounds, and probably the House Elves, for all we know.

Does anyone even know before CoS that basilisks can paralyze you if you only see the reflection of their eyes? Do we know that they freeze ghosts? I'm pretty fucking certain that we don't know that seeing one /through/ a ghost will petrify you. From Dumbledore's perspective, Voldemort is trying to undermine his position at Hogwarts by nonlethally incapacitating students, with the implicit threat that if Dumbledore doesn't leave, people will start dying. So he leaves, but makes sure that his intelligent bird hangs around to keep an eye on things, with a weapon hidden in a hat. Assuming he's doing stuff behind the scenes, that's the most proactive he can be at the moment.

** For me personally 'Heroes Assemble! By Stargon1' and the reason why is why I dislike a lot of Potter/Superhero Crossovers and want some one to listen to this piece of advice once

The main character in this Case Harry Potter needs weight in his new world. In any Superhero comic, show, movie the heros life influences the world around him and that influence draws Villains to them. In HA like many Hero Harry stories, Harry shows up buys a house and gets a job and then does nothing the Other heroes can't do or Influence because it can 'mess up the storyline'. There is a Metric fuck ton of dumb Villains to be stripped out slung into the universe and have your Main Character carve his own path. You have all the ability to have She Hulk show up and Squirrel Girl but Harry alone fighting against The Executioner (of the Thor Comics) or Moonstone (usually a Captain Marvel/Ms. Marvel Villain) hell even Having Harry be forced to hunt down Greyback's old pack while they are trying to find a way to transform at will, perhaps he has to deal with a Dark Wizard that does war with Muggles by releasing dangerous Magical Creatures into Cities like a Troll or a Chimera or a Manticore everyone's favorite fictional cat a Nundu.

All ways to begin to make Harry a Seperate character that are never taken just so we can head further down the road of 'Harry helps the Silly Muggle Avengers'. There is a reason Iron Man doesn't show up in Thor's movies or why Black Widow is getting her own film. It's to show the characters stand on their own. How can someone be a Superhero and be relied upon if they never stand on their own. The More a writer keep Harry in a Crossover tethered to those who 'protect him' the more it feels like he infantiled.

I think the title was I Didn't Know They Were Seeds.

I absolutely loved the premise of one of his fics in which seventh year Harry, about to let Voldemort kill him, travels back to his fifth year body.

The feels. The beginning was absolutely beautiful. I loved the idea that Harry had anger issues, trust issues. He was human in ways I haven't seen in fanfiction in a very long time.

And then the story went to shit, it changed directions with no foregrounding, reverse bashed Luna, made Harry OOC, added elements that broke my suspension of disbelief.

I wanted to scream. I wished I had read the story halfway through and stopped. I wish I could erase the middle parts and the ending.
