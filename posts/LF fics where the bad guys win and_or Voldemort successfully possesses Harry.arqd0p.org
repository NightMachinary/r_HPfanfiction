I've read so many fics where the good side wins that now I've kinda become bored of it and wanna see how the Wizarding world would be if the dark actually won. It can include how the Order of the Phoenix fights back since it would be interesting to read how they'd fight if Voldemort did succeed in his war or taking over the Ministry. I've also been unable to find fics where Voldemort successfully possesses Harry so I thought to ask here.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

This is literally the most popular fic on this sub, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106).

--------------

Other fics in which the 'dark side' has won:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): Demon summoning Hermione keeps one of the Voldemort's horcruxes safe, but decides it's time for her to have some fun first.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out and offers to help Harry. Things got messy after that.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9541467/1/The-Heir-Of][The Heir Of]], linkffn(9541467): The bad guys won regardless who comes out ahead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]], linkffn(4356667): Harry let Voldemort build his 'Pureblood utopia' in Wizarding Britain. Very ironic outcome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853): Nobody knows that Voldemort is the ultimate winner.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** I'll just copy and paste from something I wrote the other day.

This is a six book series each about 60-80K words each. DO NOT READ THIS SERIES IF YOU ARE NOT TWISTED. This isn't dark. It isn't cringey, it isn't a damn Dark Lord Potter. Everytime you think the series has hit a low, you will find yourself giggling with joy at the new heights (depths?) It has reached. I have never given a warning for a story. I was introduced to this story by the recommender being incapable of finishing it.

Imagine a warning I could give. That's the warning for this. The only depth it didn't reach to was with single digits ages which was probably due to no chances arising. I give this story a standing ovation.
