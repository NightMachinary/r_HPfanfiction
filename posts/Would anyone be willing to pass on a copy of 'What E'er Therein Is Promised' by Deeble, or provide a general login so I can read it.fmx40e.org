Here's the link to the author's profile on Ashwinder: [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=459]]

There's a glitch handing out passwords for new Ashwinder users, so I'm not able to access it and I'd love to read it. Thank you to anyone who can help!


** See here to send them an email, it might still work [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/index.php]] good luck

** If anyone else is looking through reddit for an answer to this - I can confirm the Ashwinder mods are still responding to password requests (it took about a week for them to get back to me).

Also, these details work as a general logon:

Username: itbugsme PW: itbugsme

Happy reading!
