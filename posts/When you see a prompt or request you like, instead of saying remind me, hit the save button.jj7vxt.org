The save button, will save it, to your username, and once a few days or a week has passed, you can go back to your saved post, and see if anyone has posted anything.

It's just a shame, whenever you see a prompt or request you really like, and half of the comments, are remind me posts.

Edit: The remind me bot itself isn't something I have a issue with. The issue I have is when there's like 20 comments and a majority of them are remind me comments when one person can say remind me and the other people can hit that person's remind me post, so we aren't flooded with remind me comments.


** Problem with using the save button: there's a limit to how many you can save. I fell afoul of this and many posts I enjoyed are now lost to the ether to me.

I've taken to bookmarking in Chrome, I have a folder for fanfic links with several subfolders and one of them is now titled "forum posts" for this purpose alone.

** Just from the perspective of an inveterate lifehacker who uses a lot of various systems for keeping track of stuff, there is a /huge/ difference between a save function and a remind function. There is barely any overlap between them.

Saving something makes it available for reference. Ideally, a reference storage system has at least folders or tags so it's easy to sort through to find things. Even a search is du rigueur. Reddit's save feature has none of these, and so is in practical terms nearly useless. I use it for short term stashes of things I want to show my wife or look at with sound on when that's amenable. Anything beyond that it's a black hole into which things go to never be seen again.

A reminder gives you a notification in the future to prompt you to do something with it. If I don't have time right now to taskify a prompt (by adding it to my dedicated system for tracking such things) or if I want to see what transpires on the thread after some time has passed (waiting for it to 'ripen' as it were), a reminder is the ideal solution. Putting such a reminder on one of my external task notification apps will clutter them, and copying the reddit thread link into their title is generally how reddit threads are shared to those apps, which is ugly and uninformative. Having a reddit bot send me a message keeps the notification native to the relevant context and includes relevant context in an elegant way. This method is easy to use and unobtrusive and fits the use-case.

Also, it literally hurts no one. In fact, having someone ask to be reminded of one's thread is in my view a higher compliment than even an upvote or a lower-effort comment of "nice." I'm still puzzled as to why people don't like them. Having two on the same reddit that respond to the same trigger is annoying, but that's easily fixed. Do a poll to see which is preferred then use that one. Simple, unless I'm missing something. Which I could be.

You are, however, correct that people should be clicking the link in the original bot post to get the same reminder instead of summoning it again. Unless they want to be reminded at a different time, in which case have at it.

TLDR: the reddit save button does not serve the same function as the remind me bots, and should not be considered a replacement for them.

*** My biggest complaint about the remind me, button. Is that, you can have a really cool request or prompt, see 20 comments, get excited, and then half of them, are remind me posts. That's the thing, that irks me, about it.

Heck, one person can say remind me, that's fine, and others, can also hit, that remind button, they don't have to do, multiple remind me posts.

**** Yup, I'm with you there. I like how [[/r/askHistorians][r/askHistorians]] does it, where they auto post one remind me link at the top, and everyone just clicks that one. Reduces clutter to zero.

I wonder if you can do that based on the OP's flair? Like if it's flaired a prompt, the bot auto posts a remind me post for people to use?

***** I like this! I think many subs, including this one, would benefit a lot from just doing it that way.

I love the reminder bots. The save button is kind of just crap compared to the reminder bots, but it's also really annoying to have a dozen posts summoning the bot(s) instead of clicking the link in the first summons. A single auto post would keep threads from being cluttered while automatically letting us use the reminder bots.
