*** I think I read a fic like that years ago. It wasn't very good, though.

I like the idea of an all-girl Weasley family (except for Arthur).

  Voldemort knows the prophecy, when he is reborn following the 3rd task of the Triwizard Tournament he takes action to ensure that Harry is no longer a threat. AU. HPLL This story will be updated slowly so that I can finish my other stories.

  I feel Molly's relationship would be interesting for the same reasons. Possibly Ginny wouldn't need to sneak out to fly brooms, because her older siblings already won that battle.
#+end_quote

Was it ever said Molly wouldn't let Ginny fly brooms? The impression I got was her big brothers didn't want to play with a girl.

*** Since canon Weasleys named their sons after (British/Germanic) royalties, they would name their daughters that way too:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain][Anne]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine][Eleanor]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I][Elizabeth]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_of_Normandy][Emma]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Matilda][Matilda]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria][Victoria]]

--------------

Chronologically speaking, Ginevra/Guinevere would be the first, followed by Emma, Matilda, Eleanor, Elizabeth, Anne, and Victoria. Eleanor and Elizabeth would be the twins. Anne would then be this world's Ron.

So when canon Ginny wakes up in this new dimension, she becomes confused when Molly calls her Victoria. "But I'm Ginny, not some Victoria!"

"Oh here we go again, Vicky. You just can't stop pretending to be your favorite big sister!" Replied Molly bemusedly.

** It is an interesting subject but when I consider it a little I could not stop imagining the Weasley house, like the cartoon called "The Loud House" and for a few moments I put Ronald in place of Lincon and it really made me laugh, they think a semi crossover, with the Weasley family instead of the Loud?

Maybe Ginny instead of Lincon, but for some reason I find Ronald instead of Lincon funny and seeing what crazy things happen, does anyone find it interesting to expand on it?
