Yep, you heard me. Recurring jokes from your favorite fics? Because one thing that kills comedy is repetition but running gags work because of how they're cleverly implemented.

Mine: From Seventh Horcrux >! Harrymort thinks Hermione works for Unspeakables, and Ron is always the distraction. But it does call back sweetly in the finale!<

What are yours? It'd be cool if you can specify the story as well. I think the spoiler tag to use is =>!Your spoiler!<=


** harry and hedwig have a full, intelligible conversation even though hedwig can only do owl shit like flapping her wings or preening or barking or hooting

hedwig barks twice, hoots, and then preens her feathers

and harry is like "very interesting, but there are externalities inherent in magic which preclude a purely marxist analysis of the wizarding world"

#+begin_quote
  Hedwig is a very smart owl; none would dare deny that! So what is a very smart owl to do when she finds her human's living conditions unsatisfactory? Finding a new home is top of the list. Finding a mate for him is right after it. After all how is an owl supposed to justify having owlets if her human hasn't had children of his own yet? Very much a humor fic, no bashing of anyone.

Another great running gag is all the professors becoming addicted to fire whiskey because all the Weasleys, including Percy, decide that "rules" are more like "suggestions."

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
