** Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor

Though it is Dumbledore bash it is very interesting and Harry has the back of the ministry. He tries to change how the schools handle things but he gets attacked after only a week into the year but it is still in progress so we could see more with time. I love it!

Sorry no link, haven't figured out how to use it yet.

  Redo of my popular story. The Order of the Phoenix is sent a certain series which depict our heroes exploits. Reads like mysecretthought's 'Under a Watchful Eye' in which the characters respond to the books as they read without the actual book quotes being stated. Helps to have a copy or just be extremely familiar with the stories.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  Wizard lack common sense. Hermione had declared that in their first year at Hogwarts. Well, even after the war, with Voldemort dead, wizards refused to change the things that were important to prevent events that led to the war in the first place to repeat themselves. Time for Harry to make sure, at the right time and place, to teach them.
