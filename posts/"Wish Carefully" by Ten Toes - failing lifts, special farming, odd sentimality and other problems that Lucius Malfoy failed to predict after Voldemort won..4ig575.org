** This is one of my favorite one-shots. Just the right amount of darkness and irony.

** I like it very much. It fits the "Death Eaters are Nazis" theme in HP - nazis drove away the scientists who could have won the war for them, and the artists who helped shape Hollywood into the most influential cultural force of its time. And of course it fits the characters of Voldemort and his followers: Shortsighted and evil, and plainly delusional (HP canon clearly shows that blood does not matter where magic is concerned - the greatest wizards and witches of their generations are either muggelborns (Lily, Hermione) or half-bloods (Snape) or at least have close muggle relatives (Dumbledore). And HP canon also shows that blood purity will ultimately lead to ruin, as the Gaunts demonstrate.

*** Not trying to be a doubting Thomas, but do you have a source for Dumbledore has close muggle relatives? Cause I don't remember anything like that from the books and would love to know more cannon history about the Dumbledore family.

**** According to the wiki, his mother Kendra was a muggleborn, which would make Albus a half-blood like Harry.

** I have not read this story for a long, long time, but I can't say I liked it. It relied too heavily on extraneous premises alien to the Potterverse to make sense. I think it could have been much more interesting and less anvilicious if it kept closer to the canon universe. Otherwise it's just bashing.
