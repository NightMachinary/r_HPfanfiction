** Sounds interesting. I'll save it for later, but probably won't read it soon enough to give you much of an answer sorry.

** Thank you for finding this story! It was one of the first fanfics I ever read - back in 2001.

** Indeed! This definitely will always be one of the best HP fanfics out there. I read this way back around 15 years ago. Hahaha. My high school self back then thought this was legit canon that simply didn't make the cut. Lol. It was that awesome and believable. üëçüèª

I printed the whole thing and had it book bound cause I loved it so much and lent it out to fellow fans to share the love for the story.
