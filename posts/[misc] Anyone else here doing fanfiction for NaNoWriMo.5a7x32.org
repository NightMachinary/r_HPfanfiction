Hi all! I'll be rejoining the world of fanfiction via nano this year, and I'm hoping I'm not the only one doing so. :)

Personally, I've got something Snape-heavy coming along. I've long struggled with depression, anxiety, and PTSD-like symptoms, and he's always been an interesting channel for those - I'm looking for some realism in him dealing with it, without losing the feeling of the Harry Potter world, you know?

But enough about me. Are any of you going to be writing 50k in November? What's your strategy?


** I'm writing at least 24.7k this November because I gotta get my master thesis done.

My strategy: RedBull galore, standing up at 8am and going to sleep at exactly midnight to get those sweet sweet 8 hours of shut-eye. I'm fond of the brute-force, red-rimmed eyes approach.

** I'm going back to an old WIP for NaNo! I want to write at least 50k for it - it's only at around 200k at the moment, and at its completion it'll probably be around 500/600k.

I'm pretty excited to start writing properly fir it again, particularly since in the last few months I've been on a break from it, it's racked up an extra few hundred followers.

It's a Slytherin AU, and at the moment I'm in the middle of fourth year!

** Me! I'm finally getting really into my fanfic these days and I'm very excited about it. I, too, suffer from PTSD so I'm writing that into the fic for Harry post-war with actual therapy sessions. However, it will be Drarry so I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm very excited. It's been so cathartic for me thus far.

** I am! I have a fic pretty well outlined and it's looking like it'll be around 50k so hopefully I'm all set. If it isn't I'll probably write a few related oneshots, we'll see. It's a Dramione marriage law with a rather large twist on the usual (Draco & Hermione are not matched up - & there's no government mandated sex because yikes).

Are people posting as they write during the month or waiting until they can better edit??

Also if you're on tumblr & looking for friends we've got a tag going (#nanowriWOES) and you can follow me @hexmionegranger - though fair warning my blog is lots of Slytherdor rare pairs and the stuff I write doesn't seem to be what this sub generally reads or likes.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I'll be writing. I've already got a story that I'm ~30k words into, and I'll be aiming to add another 50k on top of it.

My strategy is to ignore my friends and other hobbies while also cutting down on sleep. (I jest, mostly. I don't want to lose any progress I've made with running, especially now that the weather's so perfect.)

** Although I wasn't going to attempt NaNo during what is peak season at work I have since been persuaded to give it a go. I'm also working on Snape heavy fic. (currently planned to be about 17 chapters of 4500k - 5000k words). Would you care to go chapter for chapter in a hard deadline word swap arrangement? I really need a good hard deadline to keep me getting words on the page.

*** That would actually be really, really awesome. I'm also pretty swamped (running student orgs, working, rehearsals for a play - oh, and class, I guess), so it'd be nice to have someone to hold me to it/someone to hold to their promises.

PM me and we'll figure out a system! :D

** I'm planning on it. Got the whole thing plotted out completely, which is a first for me when it comes to NaNo. Strategy is wake up, make a cup of coffee and write. As long as I don't open Firefox and Reddit, I think I'll be okay.
