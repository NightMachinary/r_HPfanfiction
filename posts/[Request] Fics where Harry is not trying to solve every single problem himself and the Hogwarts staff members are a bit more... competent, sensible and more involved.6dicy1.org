As I said in the title, I'm looking fics where school children are just school children, not magic masters and adults knows how to cast spells and not idiots and they do more sensible things. Especially professors or other professionals. It doesn't needs to be Harry centric fic.

It would be nice if it isn't slash and doesn't have canon!Ron/canon!Hermione pairing. And I have some ideas I would love ro read and any fic that has similar premises to those would be welcome:

 

After the 'defeat' of Voldemort by one year old Harry, Dumbledore tells the real identity of Voldemort to public and reveals he's actually a half blood. Because, why not? Maybe it's even taught at Hogwarts history class (where there is no binns).

 

Or perhaps instead of making everyone believe it was Harry who defeated Voldemort, Dumbledore tells that it was Lilly Potter or maybe James Potter who defeated him. As a result Lilly and James would become martys and Harry Potter would be just a boy whose parents were war heroes. He wouldn't be that famous. Instead, his parents would be.

 

Or maybe in first year, instead of simple traps that many student groups could overcome, professors puts some real effort to capture Voldemort. I mean, they could ward the staff meetings room or something and trap Quirrellmort there and stun him or something. (I know there were no 'wards' in canon but still... maybe some protection spells or charms or something?) Or they do something much more serious. We are talking about Voldemort.

Or maybe instead of dismissing Harry, staff shows support and this leads Harry to seek help of professors more in the future? For example in second year; instead of a second year student, staff members figures out it is a basilisk and Harry would ask the help of staff perhaps.

 

Or in fourth year, staff makes an announcement that Harry Potter isn't a willing champion and they tell Harry to just go to those challenges and wait a few minutes and then lose deliberately. He didn't had to win the tournament to keep his magic did he? Why try to win?

 

I'm sure you get the point. I'm looking for fics with sensible and competent Hogwarts staff members and other magical professionals and where Harry doesn't try to solve every problem himself (or with his teenage side-kicks) with his incredible amout of luck; where Harry doesn't say all the right things and solves every problem and he is not some godlike being (and doesn't have some sort of secret inheritance where he gets all sorts of powers and a huge harem when he's at certain age); there are no books lying around about extremely rare super magical powers that anyone reads them can learn them...

 

Yeah basically instead of Harry doing everything with his side-kicks, I'm looking for fics with more adults playing big roles. Instead of a marry sue or a garry stu, where there is a collective effort of adults in a believable way would be nice. And if they also makes mistakes etc and act more realistic it would be nicer. And if it's complete it would be double nice.

 

Also as a side request: Is there any Good!Slightly-Darker!Not-Manipulative!Dumbledore fics out there with badassery? Where he kills when necessary but not outright evil and not a bad man? Where he directly acts and uses his great magical power and skill more often against his foes? Maybe even uses dark spells to fight?

** I've written a few stories that may fit your request.

"Patron" is an AU, but it has

- competent Dumbledore who announces that Harry didn't want to partake in the Tournament (although Voldemort's minion only entered Harry as a distraction, so Dumbledore would be busy protecting the boy while the real plot to revive Voldemort could progress)

- Dumbledore acting ruthless towards Death Eaters, preferring to kill them rather than let them harm innocents. He hates killing, but he'd rather take that burden upon himself than saddle another with it. His brother is also very experienced, and involved in the fight against Voldemort

- The protections for the Philosopher's stone being so good (although whether the actual stone was there is another question), Voldemort couldn't get past them and tried another option to get it.

- More competent teachers. Hagrid was exonerated by Dumbledore shortly after he took over, finished Hogwarts and is the CoMC teacher and one of the best known experts for magical creatures. Lockhart is a famous author well-known for his works covering the adventures of his numerous friends all over the globe. In the process, he has become quite skilled at getting out of the trouble his friends tend to start. Remus kept his post since he wasn't outed as a werewolf (in fact, Dumbledore spread the rumour that Remus spends the nights of the full moon hunting the werewolf who killed his family, and helped that along with some deceptions)

- Sirius getting exonerated in third year, after sending a letter to Remus

- Fudge being a competent politician

- The DMLE being effective against Death Eaters, running undercover operations and stings.

I generally run Dumbledore as more ruthless against his enemies than in canon, and more competent. He's quite the puppet master in "The Dark Lord Never Died" as well, pitting Voldemort against Malfoy, and in "Divided and Entwined", where he struggles with Voldemort's political supporters while he supports the Muggleborn Resistance and leads his Order in a guerilla war. In "Uncle Quentin's Spy" he successfully foiled Umbridge early on, and kept the Ministry and the Watcher's Council from fighting each other instead of the Death Eaters.

#+end_quote

I can't recall exactly how this was done in Patron, but generally the problem with killing Death Eaters on the battlefield is that they wear masks, so the obvious counter is to start imperiusing the friends and families of good guys into wearing masks and attacking alongside the Death Eaters or even on their own. Yet I never seem to see this in fanfics.

***** I'm 10 or so chapters in now and the oft-referenced "Year of Discovery" has me...uh, confused. Slightly. On the one hand, 6th year is probably around the time students would be wanting to explore their sexuality, but on the other hand it sounds like a codified year where sleeping around is the norm? (And exhibitionism if the lake scene is any indication.)

I guess I'm mostly struggling to figure out if it'll be explicit or not. It's hard to tell with how much the story is already bucking most fanon concepts of wizarding society. (Right now I'm assuming yes based on how Sirius pranked Harry.)

** Well, not sure that this is the kind of fic you are looking for or if it even fits your request well but linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) does competent adults well while keeping Harry not super over powered. Harry does end up doing stuff and gets kidnapped quite often, but he has a decent support network and everyone is characterized well and things happen logically and realistically more or less.

It's a big AU where Voldemort won the first war and built a sort of wizard society that tends to work surprisingly well (even if is somewhat morally questionnable at times). Voldemort is definitely still somewhat psychopathic, but is also quite reasonable and sane. He often works in the background to further his own political goals and keep things running but he occasionally teaches magic to Harry and tries to minimize danger to him. Harry isn't famous in the beginning and only becomes known later as Voldemort gets him to be his protege and gets him involved in things. Snape, some of the Hogwarts staff, a few OC's and Remus and Sirius play a big role in keeping Harry safe and provide support when needed.

Dumbledore doesn't come in until later in the fic and is an antagonist. He is on the good side (at least from his perspective), not really manipulative and yet not afraid to do things to get what he needs done. Harry isn't really on his side though ( although he is not exactly on Voldemorts side either, this fic gets quite complicated)

But I have to admit there is significant number of readers who are overly attached to canon stations whether they make sense or not. Catering to those people may increase an author's popularity.

******* Yeah, I get that but it's still disappointing that a story with such an interesting premise(Arithmancer) turned out to be so lacklustre compared to the authors other stories.

***** I only read up to the end of year one, in which all the stations of canon have been visited, despite the differences in the beginning, and the Grangers going back on their word to hold to Dumbledore to his promises, despite fuck up #greaterthantwo.

I was even annoyed at the beginning by how hostile the Grangers seemed to be towards Dumbledore's actions, then they turn around and pull this limpwristed shit when it's obvious he's going to keep doing the same things? I closed it out and came to complain about it.

****** Dumbledore shined in Year 3, and La Panterra was helping out Voldemort in Year 4. She was one seriously evil badass.

In the sequel, more tough bad guys sought to join Voldemort and La Panterra.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** Respectfully, it's also crap.

It also doesn't fit the OP's request - by and large, Harry and co. are still required to do everything relevant. The adults basically sit around and talk about what Harry wants or is doing.

**** what are you talking about the adults hunt down all the horcrux, clear the name of sirius, hunt down all the death eaters and defeated the basilisk and quirrel. The story is mainly about the interaction between harry and his friends. Harry was even surprised when people assumed he will attempt to fight the basilisk
