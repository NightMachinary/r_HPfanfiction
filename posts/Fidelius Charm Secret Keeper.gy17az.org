I'm currently rereading a fic (We're in this Together by zugrian, linkffa(2039) ) which currently has a very cynical Harry and he lights into Sirius about how dumb magicals and his parents were for not being their own Secret Keeper. The author in a note at the end of that chapter pointed out that in canon Bill is the Secret keeper for Shell Cottage and Arthur is the Secret Keeper for the Burrow (DH), so obviouslyin canon there is no restriction for being the secret keeper for the property you reside in/own. So why wasn't either James or Lily the Secret Keeper for Godric's Hallow?

Obviously, in canon it couldn't be them because how could they be betrayed to Voldemort if they didn't pick a third party who could either be captured or was a Voldemort supporter to begin with.

So the question is - If you had James or Lily as the Secret Keeper at Godric's Hallow how would you have Voldemort gain access that Halloween night in order to kill them?


** If I were trying to make canon fit, I'd do some handwaving about how the Order continued to study and improve the Fidelius in the 10-12 years between the wars. So that in the first war, this newly invented/recently rediscovered charm had some complicated requirements for Secret Keeper that neither James nor Lily fit, but by the time the second war rolled around the charm had been improved to where anyone could be a Secret Keeper. Maybe Bill's the one who figured that out, I could see his job tomb raiding giving him plenty of experience in how protective charms work.

How to give Voldemort access if one of the Potters was the Secret Keeper? Easy. Make James the Secret Keeper, have Pettigrew lure him out on false pretences. Voldemort kills James; now everyone James told, including Pettigrew, is a new Secret Keeper. Pettigrew tells Voldemort the secret, Voldemort goes in and kills Lily just like canon.

*** That first point is a great explanation of why the difference exists between when james and lily had the fidelius cast and when Bill and arthur had it cast eg the spell was improved in the past 15 years.

The second point which works to take the story back to canon would suggest that if you truly want to keep the secret that the Fidelius was protecting safe the secret keeper can never leave the safety of the fidelius protected property.

**** Keeping the Secret Keeper inside would be workable. We've seen that the Secret can be written down so someone else can hand it out. However, it's still not impenetrable. Anyone trusted with the Secret could come in and kill the Secret Keeper. Which I think is the innate philosophy of the Fidelius charm - you have to whole heartedly trust another person with power over you.

** When Yaxley followed Hermione, Harry, and Ron through apparition, the secret was exposed to him. This means that each time Lily or James left the house (which they definitely /will/ want to do, as we've seen with quarantine), they would risk not only their lives, but their location. Granted, the Death Eater(s) who discover their location won't be able to blab, but you don't want your enemy knowing where you live, as then they could sneak attack. If it were me, I'd want the secret keeper to be someone who never visits the place, so can never give away its secret accidentally.

*** Do we get confirmation that Yaxley actually gains access to Grimmauld, though? It's been a long time since I read the books, but I believe Hermione just wasn't entirely sure Grimmauld was still a safe hideout. Did Yaxley actually learn the secret by travelling there with the trio, or is there the possibility that he could have been left there, staring at nothing where the house was supposed to be?

**** I assume so because they were the secret keepers and they brought another person to the secret. So maybe? IDK it's never made clear.

** Back to basics: the Fidelius works by taking a secret and hiding it in a soul. People focus a lot on where the secret ends up (the Secret Keeper) but I think you can make a lot more progress with making sense of the charm if you think about where the secret comes from.

The mechanism of the charm implies that secrets are found in souls and that the Fidelius works by /transferring/ a secret from its "natural" home (the soul of the "Secret Giver") and moving it somewhere else. By seeing the charm working as a transfer, two things become apparent:

1. Because you need access to the person whose soul the secret naturally is found within, you can't just cast the Fidelius on any piece of information you like. You're pretty much limited to hiding secrets which are within the Secret Giver's soul.

2. Because the basis of the Charm is a transfer, you cannot be your own secret keeper. But the definition of being your own secret keeper is not "residing in the hidden property", it is "receiving your own secret".

I would propose that the natural home of the secret of a property's location is the soul of the person who owns the property. This works quite well:

Grimmauld Place: Sirius Black would be the Secret Giver, Albus Dumbledore is the Secret Keeper and caster of the Charm.

Muriel's house (The Burrow is not under a Fidelius in DH; they move to Muriel's): Muriel would be the Secret Giver, Arthur is the Secret Keeper; Bill is likely the caster of the Charm.

Godric's Hollow: Lily and James are married, so jointly own the house, so are joint Secret Givers, meaning they cannot give the secret to each other. The transfer must be from the two of them to a third party. Pettigrew is the Secret Keeper. Lily likely cast the Charm.

Shell Cottage: Secret Giver is unknown. In the movies, Shell Cottage is said to belong to Muriel, but nothing is stated in the books as to its ownership. My inclination is to assume that someone other than Bill and Fleur owns it, at least at the time of DH, and that person is likely Muriel. So let's say Muriel is the Secret Giver; Bill is the Secret Keeper, and Bill cast the Charm.

** The same way that Harry got access to the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. Pettigrew steals a piece of parchment with the secret on it, and delivers it to old Voldy.

*** That had to be the dumbest thing in canon. You have a protected property that you can't gain access to unless you know the secret. And instead of doing that verbally with privacy charms or via a paper with several masking charms (ala the Marauder's map) they use an uncharmed piece of paper which can be stolen or lost.

** I always assumed that the Fidelius charm came in varying levels of power and the act of entrusting the secret to someone who could conceivably betray you made the charm stronger. It was a tremendous act of trust. If you chose to use the spell on yourself you would weaken the charm on some fundamental level that you wouldn't be able to see right away but would show up later. Like in DH when Hermione had to apparate the three of them into the forest because Yaxley (I think) tagged along and saw through the enchantments on Grimmauld place. That might not have been an issue if the charm was intact with only one secret keeper instead of everyone Dumbledore told now having that power.

** I have a possible explanation why the Potters did what they did.

If the potters were their own secret keepers, and hid there, who could visit them?

Sirius Remus and Peter... as the obvious people to be given the secret.

Now Alice or Frank or in fact anyone wants to visit. No can do.

The Potters were hiding but wanted their friends to be able to be added to the set of people in the know. They're 21 and well... not paranoid enough to live in a war against voldemort.

​

Number 12 Grimmauld place: order of phoenix, they have a secret keeper outside

And give people paper to add them to the set of people with access, because the order is a lot bigger than the Potter family, and Needs to be able to add Harry and Hermione and the Weasleys to the set of people in the know so it can be a safe house. Having safe houses nobody can use is pointless for the Order.

​

Shell Cottage: Bill & Fleur live there. They only need other Weasleys to visit, so Arthur is a good choice.

Vice versa: Bill is not with the other Weasleys, but safe anyway, so if the really need to , for example get a real healer in they can.

​

Now a Sufficient Paranoid James Potter would have been his own secret keeper.

James & Lily are therefore mostly trapped at Godrics hollow with baby Harry.

The rest of the Marauders can probably visit ( James probably isn't going to lock them out, he's James Potter.)

The only way Lily's friends can see her is if James gets regular visits by say, Sirius, acting as a courier to bring James out to add persons to the knowing set.

Actually some obvious risks to that.

Catch Sirius and imperio him and James comes out with Sirius and well, Harry has one less parent. How long can you live at a cottage without going out for groceries.
