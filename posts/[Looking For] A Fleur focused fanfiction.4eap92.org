Long story short, my Google-Fu sucks, and please does anyone else know what fanfic it is that I'm looking for?

It's a fanfiction from Fleur's point of view, and starts from her life as a child, and goes right through until the end of the series. I read it on DeviantArt, but searching there didn't help me.

Some key points I remember;

- Fleur's grandmother being a Veela. She would take Fleur to meet the other Veela, while she was still a child, and they would dance in the woods together. There was some conflict between Fleur's mother and her grandmother, if I remember correctly, about wanting to conceal her Veela side.
- Fleur being excelling at a subject while at Beauxbatons. The school had a lot of detail written about it, and I believe there was a picture in Fleur's bedroom that would make comments?
- Fleur's arrival at the Weasleys, and her treatment from Ginny and company, leaves her confused because she is trying to be open to the way that they do things.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
