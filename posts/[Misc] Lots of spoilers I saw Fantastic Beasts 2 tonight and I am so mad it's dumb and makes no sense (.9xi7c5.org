If you do like Newt and the beasts, nothing's stopping you from accepting their existence without accepting /Cursed Child/ or the third Dumbledore brother, y'know?

** I just assumed that Grindelwald was lying to Credence Barebone about that in an attempt to direct his obscurus at Albus.

Other things that bothered me:

- Worldless killing curse all over the place.
- Statute of secrecy? never heard of it!
- Let's fight /Fiendfire/ with a /Finite Incantatem!/
- Flamel's near mummified presentation dilutes the sacrifice he made at the end of book one.
- We have house elves, better build a robot that 'cleans things'
- Half-elf nanny? half elf!?
- I must send my child overseas to keep him safe, even though the Fedalious Charm works or he could just live in a box like ALL of Newts creatures. Or I could just kill Yusuf Kama, I did after all walk right into their house and Imperio one of them, duelist they ain't! Nope, not nearly circuitous for someone with a beard like mine.
- This is the only way we can get out of Britain! /Really! that's cool so it's a new form of magical transportation?/ No, it's a portkey what else!
- I must send my child overseas to keep him safe but I won't use the untraceable portkey established in the same movie! Circuity maintained!
- I must sacrifice myself for this one chance to shoot Grindlewald in the back! Better not use one of those wordless killing curses people have been handing out like candy all film!
- Better have like 3 flashbacks of a character explaining her whole life story!
- Better Kill that character in the dumbest way possible
- Better spend 5 minutes explaining everything out loud in case someone in the audience fell asleep
- Hey look at that, Earthbending!
- Woah, Queenie Goldstein is deeply unstable.
- So QUeenie reluctantly leaves Jacob Kowalski to go with Grindelwald... I bet that will upset her! Nope, she's seen hanging with GG 5 minutes later as if she's been in his inner circle this whole time.
- Gellert Grindelwald VAPE NATION CONFIRMED
- I must let everyone know of my upcoming seminar! Letter drop, I don't think so, I will cover all of Paris in tarps for some reason!
- It really should have been called FBWTFT: Grindlewald's speaking tour
- Hi I'm Nagini, I am deeply uncomfortable being in front of crowds because of my blood curse. Better join the literal freakshow. there's just no other way for me to survive on my own. If only magic were a thing.
- Hi I'm Nagini, a gratuitous throwback to the books you all loved, I'm not going to do anything in this movie... the tie-in should be enough right?
- Hi I'm Tina Goldstein, I just learned that my crush is engaged, I won't contact him at all over this totally out of character behaviour.
- Spell monitoring handcuffs... they don't break the established universe at all.

But the worse thing for me was the blood ritual between Albus and Gellert. Gone is the emotional struggle that Albus faces in seeing and fighting his one time love after all these years. All nuance Only to be replaced by...

I see your point, but it is the inexplicable truth that in real life many "freaks" did join circuses to professionally get gawked at. This is just the same thing in the Wizarding World. People are weird, I guess.

#+begin_quote
  Spell monitoring handcuffs... they don't break the established universe at all.
#+end_quote

Not as much as you'd think. I mean, yes, it's dumb. But it's not as improbable as it sounds. The big thing about the Wizarding World is that it doesn't have mass production, for the most part --- individual wizards who are good at crafting a certain type of artifacts are the only way to get them. So if the Ollivander of enchanted shackles rose and fell in the early 20th century wtihout an apprentice, it's not absurd that none could be found by the 1990's in Britain.

**** Well adding to your points. A few Aurors throw around killing curses (they are out to kill Credence and one of them is particularly vicious-someone that Newt seems to know and hate, he's also working for Grindelwald). In my opinion, it was never established that killing curses could not be silent and this is the movies-for some reason they have always used silent casting (they could be whispering anyway). Grindelwald doesn't cast one from memory.

What happened in the movie could easily have been erased from people's mind/been seen to not be a big deal. There's this bit where I think they travel into a magical parallel Paris and I'm not entirely sure how much of the events of the movie happen there.

Nagini is in fact in a freak show. Lupin finds it hard to live in the magical world, is it unbelievable that Nagini would have the same problem? It's definitely been established in the novels it's hard to live even with magic. There also missing the fact she's clearly been trapped there. Credence and her cause a ruckus to escape.

The shackles are a charm cast. I don't see how it breaks anything, it's likely a very complicated charm and only used sparingly, it's also consistent with canon considering we know they can monitor young wizards spells (actually we might finally have a source of how they do it!). The Head of the Department of Magical Law enforcement is the one that casts it. Where else would they have used them?

** Is it McGonagall or is it McGonagall's mother or aunt or something?

Regardless, she's already changed McGonagall's age once, originally she said in an interview she was around 70, which would have made her in school with Voldemort same as Hagrid. It's thought that she later realized this and didn't want that, so she changed it to make Minerva younger. But you still see it pop up in fanfiction a lot, the idea that they are around the same age and went to school at the same time, because some people got attached to the idea or never heard the retcon.

But this would make her WAY older, much closer to Dumbledore's age. She'd be in her nineties at least when Harry is in school. Which might fit more with the movie-verse's Maggie Smith portrayal, tbh. In the books, not so much, McGonagall still has black hair in those!

** I was always under the impression that the movies do not share continuity with the books. After all, each of the HP movies was an adaptation. PoA was not a sequel to CoS, it was an adaption of Book 3 just like CoS was an adaption of Book 2.

This movie /is/ a sequel to the last one as neither of them are adaptations of books. Instead they are their own continuity inspired by the books and based on the films.

**** Anytime a story changes mediums it's best to assume a different canon. I would argue that not only are the movies distinct from the books, but that they are distinct from each other (with each movie being, for the most part) a different writer and directors interpretation of the book it is based on.

The two Fantastic Beasts movies are further distinct in that they have no book counterparts. Think of the movies the same way you would think of comic book adaptations (probably the closest parallel given the number of books vs number of films). Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, and (shudder) Batman and Robin are their own distinct continuity apart from the comics. Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises are their own continuity apart from the comics and the previous films. Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League are their own continuity apart from the comics and any of the previous films.

None of those movies invalidated anything that came before it. They were simply different interpretations of the same material, molded to fit the story they were trying to tell, in the medium they were trying to tell it in.

***** That's easy to say for the HP movies (though I prefer the Wiki's way of seeing them as a retelling of the same events as the books, so that what doesn't contradict the books is canon, and the rest is not), but the /Fantastic Beasts/ films are /written by Rowling herself/. Unless she goes out of her way to say that she wrote them as being in a separate continuity (and I'll admit there's precedent for that sort of thing, such as Douglas Adams), it's pretty foolish to assume otherwise.

** I am deeply baffled. JK shall henceforth be known as Joke Rowling, because she just went full Ruin Johson. I think this movie might be the TLJ of Potterverse.

Short version: everything good in the movie came from the film crew. Everything bad came from Joke Rowling.

How do I begin to unpack this...

For a film named after Grindelwald, there wasn't a lot of Grindelwald in it. The saving grace is that when he was on screen, he owned it. I'm separating Johnny Depp the actor from Johnny Depp the person. He was great. Yates really showed Grindelwald's power on the screen. Also, what crimes? Yeah, I get it, he casually murders people, but that's just a basic villain thing that villains do. He spent the film househunting and on a hiring spree.

After the rapport they built in the first film, Tina sees a picture and unloads jealousy. She gets a boyfriend to seemingly spite Newt (?) even though he's an ocean away, starts calling him Mr. Scamander when they see each other again. She also gets kidnapped and basically does nothing in the film. Might as well have not been in it.

The above is less Tina's fault and pretty much entirely Joke's. Too many damn characters. Too much useless garbage. The whole Nagini thing. She does nothing in the film. Her only purpose is to be a tie-in into the original books. She should not have been in the film at all. That would also eliminate the entire circus bit, freeing up runtime for Queenie's corruption, which was rather interesting, but criminally underdeveloped and shoved into five minutes.

This is where I will use TLJ to make my point: Leta Lestrange is this movie's Amilyn Holdo. She shows up and dies in the same film, there's some hamfisted detail to give her "weight" before she's killed for a revenge boner for the Scamanders, I guess? Okay, now they have a personal stake in Grindelwald's defeat, but this could have been accomplished in a much better way. For example, Grindelwald challenges Newt to a duel after his escape to retake the Elder Wand's allegiance (this even doubles as a tie-in, see?), and perhaps kills a bunch of Newt's creatures or another character in the process. Hell, even use Leta here, if you really want to. Boom, Newt has a personal motivation.

I hate everything to do with the Lestrange nonsense. The dumb backstory. The baby-swap. The fact that they were going to America on a muggle ship, for some fucking reason. The clumsy exposition dump just before the finale. The Yusuf guy and his whole role in this. The prophecy. And the way it was written, acted, and put into the film. All of it is irredeemably stupid. Not to mention that Yusuf reduces Tina to The Girl Who Gets Kidnapped, and takes up more screentime with his dumb revenge plot that the audience has no stake in. What the hell, Joke Rowling? Where is the writer who crafted the mysteries of the first three Potter books?

The asshole auror with mood whiplash. "plz fight Grinderwald. no? okay, magic handcuffs, i dont like u"

The entire timeline is fucked simply by setting it in the 1920s. All JK had to do was move Grindelwald's rise up ~15 years and there is no 20 year gap between Grindelwald's coming out and Dumbledore's going to finally deal with him, which now has to be fixed with the blood pact. Otoh, I actually like the blood pact better than the possibility that Dumbledore would wait decades to fight Grindelwald because they hooked up one summer when they were teenagers.

I'll give the movie a pass and assume that Obliviation was employed on muggles who saw the boar-dragon-cat, but what was the deal with the black tarps? Not that it wasn't a cool visual, but was that also enchanted to be invisible to muggles? Although I'd actually be down with Grindelwald just shitting on the Statute, but we weren't shown anything to suggest that this had any effect at all.

The whole rally scene was great, down to the skullbong. Credit where credit is due.

Now time to shit on the director. Editing in those coolest scenes (the escape and the Fiendfyre) was fucked, I could't see a goddamn thing. At least the fire lit up the screen, but the escape was just horrible. The screen was almost entirely black, and then lightning flashes had me blinking and blinded. This movie is going to give some poor fucker an epileptic episode.

As much as I defended the wizard fashion in the other movies, I have to bash it in this one. Grindelwald, Nagini, Grindelwald's followers were fine. Even Newt had his coat. But the Ministry people and fucking Dumbledore just wore entirely muggle suits. I'm down with pants and a waistcoat, Albus, but goddamn, throw on a wizard cloak or something.

McGonagall was also in the movie for the sole purpose of being a tie-in. Fuck that.

I'm not leaning either way on Flamel. Too much other shit to rant about.

As for the twist. How in the fuck is there a third Dumbledore brother? That was so sloppy that I'm not sure Joke Rowling isn't gonna pull a "lol jk" in FB3.

Ultimately, the film is dragged down by Joke's insistence on shoving in references to the original books to the detriment of everything else: characters established in FB1, plot, and pacing.

It pains me to say it, but I don't like this movie. And I don't see my opinion of it improving tbh. In the broader picture, it just seems to continue the trend of everything after the original books being progressively bonkers.
