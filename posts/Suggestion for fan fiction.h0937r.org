Hi All,

I am an ardent fan of Harry Potter series and had read the books multiple times. Somehow I never found the urge to read fan fiction.

Recently I picked up "loose cannon" and I am loving it.

I have noted down the things which interest me in a fan fiction.

Can you kind souls help me find some great fanfiction please. I have tried looking through fanfiction.net but the huge varieties there scared me off.

1. It must have great writing.
2. I like post Hogwarts stories.
3. I do not like excessive romantic stories. Some kind of drama or crisis is needed to keep my interest going
4. I like quidditch too much
5. I like safe stories. Too much violence, gore, sex might turn me off.

Thank you for your time.


** I always suggest the series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]] as the best start in reading fanfiction. Start with linkao3(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) and go on (the previous stories are good as well, but his post-war stories are the best).

  Over fifty people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There are dozens of stories of loss, betrayal, heroism and sacrifice. These are some of those stories.

**** As I said, start with the Tales, continue with the Grave Days, and Hunters and Prey and I really like the stories with Lavender Brown. However, Northumbrian is true master of one-shots. “Summer of ‘97”, “The Badly Fitting Coat”, “Mistletoe Kisses”, stories of George and Angelina, etc. are all excellent in my opinion, and the best on the market.

*** I'll second Northumbrian; lots of good options there, and they're all interconnected. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is another decent starting point.

** OP, a few bits of advice since you seem new to fanfictions.

1. Always check if the fanfiction you're starting is complete. This is usually listed as "Status: Complete" on fanfiction.net. Then you can decide whether or not to read it. Few things hurt more than getting involved in a story and *unexpectedly* finding out it's incomplete and hasn't been updated in 4 years. This doesn't mean you shouldn't read incomplete stories. It means you should KNOW before you start reading that this story isn't finished so it doesn't hurt as much.

2. Before getting into fanfictions, I thought all of them were trash. After having read lots of them, I now know that only about 90% of them are trash. That is to say, for each good fanfiction out there, there are probably 9 utterly horrible ones. Don't be too disheartened if you have to drop a story that seemed very exciting at first but the quality has dropped to crap levels. You'll find another good one.

3. If you read a fanfiction that you enjoy, check out the other stories written by the same author. You are more likely to find good stories that way.
