Hey all!

I love fics that go through the emotions and aftermath of life after the war. Especially the longer ones. I've read quite a few but I notice most seem to stop before they get to the point of Ginny becoming pregnant and then giving birth and both her and Ginny raising them.

Not looking for any AU futures or anything, and I'd prefer it starting right after the war. Not sure if this full request exists out there.

Thanks! I appreciate this entire subreddit and have found some of my favorite fics through you guys.

*** Whole “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]]” series by Northumbrian is about family, and there are some explicit pregnancy and birth stories.

But there are some more stories where Harry as a parent has a significant role:

1. linkffn(6142629;6329597)

2. “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]]” series, where there is a very different Harry from what I expected, but very well written ineed.

3. linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) ... Harry and Ginny are very much in the background, but I love their parenting very much.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

#+begin_quote
  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

#+begin_quote
  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

** It has been a long time since I've read them but I'm fairly sure that little0birds stories include the raising of their children and they start shortly after the war

** Id recommend The Quietly series by stralightpeddler (if you dont mind Scorbus) and the It's Teatime series by frombluetored. I have also written several stories on the Potter family, on SIYE and ff.net.
