Reading the part of GoF where Hermione talks about getti g her teeth shrunk so she doesn't have to get braces.

I'm no dental expert but I pretty sure you get braces when your teeth are crooked not long. So any fics on that.


** linkffn(Message in a Bottle by Angry Hermione) - it's a small factor in a story with too many ideas that didn't go far (certainly not as far as intended), but it has some great scenes, including an excellent haunting.

** You can get braces to fix teeth that are too long. It's all a part of making your teeth look and work the best they can.
