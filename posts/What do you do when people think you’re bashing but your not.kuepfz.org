** It's the internet, some times you're going to get hateful comments. I got hateful comments on my fic because I had Harry be a girl.

You basically have two options. You can politely explain your point of view and hope they respond to someone being polite, or you can ignore them. Do whatever gives you the most peace of mind.

** Are the characters you're allegedly bashing well-rounded in your fic, or have you reduced them to caricatures?

By “well-rounded” I don't mean you need to depict them in all their nuances, but they should have at least some dimension, if only in the author's mind (i.e., yours).

If the bashed characters have at least some dimension, go ahead and disregard the review.

** I explain my POV, some people are very ‘bashing sensitive' but they don't have to read your story if they don't like it

eta: I actually put a note on my fics that I don't take kindly to concrit and flames, and people are thankfully abiding by that. There are still comments of ‘is this a bashing fic?' So that's when o do the above.

At the end of the day most people just want to read what they like, so I'm just clear on my perspective on the character and they can decide whether they'll stick around

**** I think sometimes people get caught up in the whole ‘the customer is always right' thing with fic but nah. You don't have to write things to satisfy every reader, just write your thing and they'll either read it or not. If someone is really out to be a little bitch about everything, that says more about them than about your writing or whatever

** Just write your story and ignore them. Some people can't distinguish between fictional characters and real life and get upset when someone writes them acting how they don't want to act.

**** People are going to hate on you no matter what. Look at how Ron-lovers act in this sub. They attack anyone that minutely criticizes him.

Ask yourself why you are writing - are you doing it for yourself, or for other people? If all you want is congratulations, you should probably just write a WBWL/manipulative!Dumbledore/mentor!Snape/angry!Harry that bashes half the characters in the story. I guarantee you'll get lots of favs/follows and you won't even need to proofread.

OR, you can write the story you envision, the one that you're interested and passionate about, and ignore the people that don't like it. If there is one thing that reading/writing fanfiction has taught me, it's that the vast majority of quality stories don't get the attention they deserve.

I moderate guest reviews (which was useful when I started promoting my fic on this sub - lots of disturbed people here), and if a reviewer posts multiple flames I will block them. Otherwise, I accept that the only person I am writing to 'please' is myself. I want to see my vision come to life; if no one reads my story, there's nothing I can do about that. But I would never try to excuse/change my stories to please other people - it won't work, and all you'll end up with is a shitty story and people that /still/ don't like you.

** Just ignore it

Some people think it's bashing when your character (especially if it's a favorite of theirs and/or regularly gets bashed) has flaws. I've encountered that. They get upset if the character isn't portrayed in a purely positive manner. Like I said, just ignore it. People always find something to gripe about
