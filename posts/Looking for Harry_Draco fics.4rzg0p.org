Specifically stories similar to turn by sara's girl or tempus fugit by stylophile. I just love the dynamics of their relationship.


** Have you read anymore by Saras girl? I particularly love linkffn(Reparations by saras_girl) and the sequel linkffn(Foundations), as well as linkao3(All Life is Yours to Miss) and linkao3(Salt on the Western Wind). Another big fave of mine not by saras girl is linkao3(Azoth)! I'll come back if I think of more!

Edit: gave me the wrong link for Reparations - let's try that again

  Professor Malfoy's world is contained, controlled, and as solitary as he can make it, but when an act of petty revenge goes horribly awry, he and his trusty six-legged friend are thrown into Hogwarts life at the deep end and must learn to live, love and let go.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

  Harry has had quite enough of sharing his mind with someone else, thankyouverymuch. A miscast Legilimecy spell says otherwise.(Fic from 2010 FF archive being uploaded here.)
