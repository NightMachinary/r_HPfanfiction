The basic story is that there is a small rare breed of dragon that exists and Harry has one (male) and Draco has another (female) and the two of them start hanging out even though they don't get along in the hopes that their dragons will mate.

Their dragons develop feelings for each other, and so do Draco and Harry.

I believe I read it on LJ.. From what I can remember the one shots were about 10k long and there were 5-7 written.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions
