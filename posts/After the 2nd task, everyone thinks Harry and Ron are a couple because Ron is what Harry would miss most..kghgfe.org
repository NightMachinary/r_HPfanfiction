*** I can't see that destroying their friendship. Everything they've been through? Esp with Ron being a dick earlier in the year. I mean, Harry survived second year when everyone thought he was the heir of Slytherin, and fourth year when half the school hates him. He's hardly going to bother with that. & I imagine Ron would be uncomfortable, but I can't see their friendship ending over it lol

Yeah, my amendment isn't exactly helping Harry's case here.

But that's the fucken papparazzi for you. They always put the worst spin on everything.
