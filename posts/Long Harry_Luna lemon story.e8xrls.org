Sorry bout asking so much for this but trying to find one myself has got tiring so any suggestions are appreciated :)


** Mad Snorckaks and Englishmen is a pretty long one, IIRC. You can find it on [[https://adultfanfiction.net][adultfanfictio]]n... I think it's still there.

*** It is also on AO3, in my opinion the much better site to read on:

Linkao3(10804995)

But I always avoided it because of the archive warning of "Rape/Non-Con". Is it applied wrongly here, simply because of BDSM? If yes I would give it a go, but if it actually applies correctly to the fic I think I will stay away. I don't particularly like reading about rape.

  After a night culminating in the Headmaster's murder, a distraught Harry is comforted by a dreamy Luna Lovegood. Is this the beginning of a strange and beautiful psycho-sexual obsessive friendship? We can only hope.

**** As with all cases of morbid curiosity, as far as I can tell that is in reference to something that happened to Luna before the story. Not with her and Harry, that's consensual but well, I only skimmed the first two chapters then noped out so umm, where was I going with this again...

***** Alright, thanks. I'll move it from my "nope" to my "maybe" list then. The comparison with the movie "Secretary" spiked my curiosity in the first place. I don't have a problem with BDSM and D/s if done well so I will just hope you noped out because you don't like that and not because it was badly written :D

EDIT: Nevermind. I just wanted to test it myself and read the first chapter. Now THAT is some very awkward writing. Back on the "nope" list it goes.

**** I read it a long time ago... But I think it was off-screen or something. I don't remember Harry raping Luna per se. IIRC it were some other students who took advantage of Luna before the story begins.

****** It's a good read later on. I feel the writer gets more comfortable as the story goes on but it is pretty intense later on but the stories abandoned so it doesn't really matter:p
