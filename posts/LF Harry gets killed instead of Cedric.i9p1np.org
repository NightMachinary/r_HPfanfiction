As the the title says, but instead of Harry dying. Voldemort killed his own horcrux and Harry wakes up either in the cemetery or in front of the spectators.


** It actually happens in linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel). Well, Cedric gets killed as well, but Harry gets shot with AK, and when he returns (after the Heavenly Transportation Center scene), he surprises Voldemort so much, he manages to get away with the Portkey.

#+begin_quote
  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.
