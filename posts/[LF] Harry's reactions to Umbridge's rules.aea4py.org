I believe it was a series of one-shots, but every time Umbridge would post a rule, Harry would do something. I remember one about no student should be write or speak in any language but English and Harry asked her how they were supposed to do magic since it was in Latin and another where he came into Great Hall naked because of a school uniform rule, and a third was where he refused to go to class because it broke the three or more students together rule.


** Hmm the naked thing is in linkffn(Groundhog Day by roarsarch's blot), dunno if this is the one you're looking for though.

  If his life at Hogwarts was going to be a living hell, then so was hers. She wouldn't know what hit her.
