linkffn(Rectifier) -in this one an AU Voldemort chooses a different path after Dumbledore confronts him with his first murders. He doesn't feel bad because he's a sociopath but he recognizes that it was wrong.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

#+begin_quote
  Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...

** I'm not sure I should recommend this since it's chock full of the worst H/Hr conceits of the sub-sub-genre (excused only a bit by being written in 2009: it was quite fashionable then), but there is part of this story that works through Riddle re-integrating his horcruxes. Caveat lector.

  Did you ever wonder why Death Eaters prefer to throw stunners at purebloods and more dangerous and deadly ones at half-bloods and muggle born? Why do Aurors only use non lethal curses even when faced with lethal ones? - Harry finds out. Chap 28 up! H/HR
