** I present to you the first paragraph of chapter 25 of Barnes Potter vs Harry Potter:

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore was now a woman as he had healed his wound and converted it into a woman part. He and Olivander were going to make wonderful babies he thought with a grin. Just then a sick looking Barnes came in no doubt a little queasy from drinking his man hood. Dumbledore was just about to command him to make love to him when there was a crash outside his office that awoke him with a startle. It was Olivander clutching his nose only his nose was gone and replaced by a lobster. "No the lobsternasalus hex" he shrieked. He tried to run but his leg was slow as he had cut off his real leg as punishment for being pure blood. Just then a large man it was Hagrid began attacking Olivander "yer a liar Dumbledore you could have gotten me a wand again after I was expelled" he said as he picked Olivander up like a baby and snapped his spine over his knee and launched him into orbit Olivander exploded in a shower of gore as he connected with the hard wall outside the ministry showering the muggles. "Hagrid you will forget this and make love to me"Dumbledore ordered throwing off his greasy cloak "Over me dead body" Hagrid roared as he saw Dumbledores new addition. He grabbed Dumbledore by the nose and twisted until he ripped the cartilage off his nose and pocketed it. Dumbledoe fainted and Hagrid threw him into an empty sack and beat the ground a few times breaking all his bones and making sure to feed Dumbleforks nose to Fluffy and Fang.

*** Oh my... here's the first paragraph of Chapter 26:

#+begin_quote
  Minister of Magic formerly known as Albus Dumbledore now known as Alice Dumbledore walked into Hogwarts with confidence. He had just gotten a pair of breast implants and his face was covered with makeup as he intended to make his move on Dean Thomas. Headmaster Black was confused when he demanded Dean Thomas be escorted to accompany him to the ministry. A few minutes later a confused Dean Thomas escorted Alice to the ministry. As soon as he landed in Dumbledore's office Dumbledore began ripping Dean's clothes off while Dean screamed that he had a girlfriend. Dean let out a blood curdling scream as Dumbledore began kissing his neck Dean took a swing at her and knocked half her teeth out. Dumbledore lay on the ground moaning while an enraged Dean took a potion knife and cut off Dumbledore's implants and threw them out the window landing on an unsuspecting Marge Dursley who immediately set up an appointment to install them.

** I don't know the name of the story, but it goes like this:

Harry sees his family vault and gets a whole load of cool shit. A couple of days later he almost gets killed. Then he gets whisked away to his way too large manor, where he meets:

3 house elfs

I don't know how many horses

A lot of birds

2 wolves

1 shapeshifter tiger that always follows him around

3 phoenixes that always follow him around

And he has a ring that lets him learn things 1000 times as fast. He then meets a portrait that teaches him how to fight with swords, lances (?), morning stars (?), maces (?) and other things. That's when I stopped reading.

Pretty much. Strangely, Harry sudden decision to 'take control' usually coincides with him becoming a overreacting, bullying wanker. And you mustn't forget that independence means shopping trips where Harry's silk shirt with mother of pearl buttons are described in loving detail.

Also known as what happens if Harry ingests a psychotropic while reading Alex Jone's InfoWars. It is over the top on purpose, and boy does it succeed. linkffn(The manifesting crisis by solartai)

#+begin_quote
  The New World Order could happen anytime and Harry would be caught unawares. Not anymore. When they came for him... well let's just say harry had bought a gun or five. He would go down in a blaze of glory before surrendering to those Satanist, socialist scum.

  The abomination raised its arm and tore the earth from its native orbit. Whether towards the sun or into deep space, Harry couldn't tell. Night became day, day became night. Over and over.

  Ron gave a yelp of fear and no betrayals.

  Suddenly Dumbledore appeared! "Accio, sun!" He bellowed with power and authority.

  Harry watched in awe as the wizened old motherfucker stabilized their orbit around the sun.

  "They fluoridated the water, Hermione! Fluoride is bad!" He could feel his eyes twisting in his skull. "9/11 was an inside job!" Urine started running down his legs.

  His eyes rolled back in their sockets and he began to chant the Mesopotamian alphabet.

  Procedure: magic spells will be used in conjunction with fresh puppy brains in order to form the most perfect, loyal, assistant who will never betray me.

  Results: at first I was confused as the subject exhibited no meaningful changes. However after a few minutes the subject dropped his pants and deficated on the floor. I must have yelled too loudly for he quickly turned and consumed the feces. That is a bug that needed to be worked out.

  Operation Arachnid Common household spiders collected in resource zone 77, the Hogwarts libary, were inserted into the frontal lobe. They quickly ate the decaying brain matter leftover from the previous operation, but the subject did not seem to get any more competent. I had a hypothesis that more spiders were needed, based on some stuff I read on the internet.

** +Harry Crow or HPMoR+

In all seriousness, I can remember the details of a story but not the title. It was about 3-4 years since I read it and even then I thought it was a bit... over the top. It was based on a manga or anime I think.

It goes with this:

- Harry gets rescued from the Dursleys by a renowned ninja.
- That ninja teaches him in his ways along with his other disciple.
- Harry becomes skilled in the arts of magical karate, magical duelling, fencing, duel wielding katanas. Etc. Etc.
- He arrives at Hogwarts in his fourth or fifth year.
- When he arrives he's portrayed as a Greek God in comparison to all the other men. Men and women literally fawn over him.
- He's far fitter than any other living male except his mentor and his mentor's other apprentice.
- Voldemort and Dumbledore are both pretty comically stupid in the fic, along with anyone in a position of authority.
- Harry is a major manwhore who goes around seducing all the women of Hogwarts, one at a time. Even the teachers.
- He knows the 37 steps of female satisfaction or whatever it was called and his favourite person to practise on is Tonks.
- He's able to take on a dragon single handedly with a decapitation curse.
- He goes around collecting bounties for targets to kill.
- I think at one point he ends up with seven contracts to kill Voldemort numbering well over 5 million galleons.
- He ends up seducing Bellatrix, Narcissa and several other female death eaters at one point.
- Fleur Delacour gets possessed by Voldemort and Voldemort is unused to the Veela so actually has sexual attraction which gets really weird, really fast.
- Harry knows weird rituals that can release Voldemort's possession.
- He effectively one shots Voldemort and all his death eaters when he confronts them.
- All the horcruxes get destroyed simultaneously as well.

I think I blanked out any meaningful character development because there was so little of it. But yeah, that was over the top as heck.

Or there's this other fic with H/Hr as a weirdish pairing.

- Harry gets abandoned by the Dursleys
- He joins a gang
- He kills people
- He keeps a gun on him at all times
- His accent reverts to Cockney for some reason
- He goes to Hogwarts in his first year and befriends Hermione.
- He shoots the troll to death with his handgun
- He shoots Malfoy multiple times in one year
- He shoots Slytherins multiple times in one year
- He shoots Quirell.
- Year two: Dumbledore confiscates his gun
- He goes around beating people up and stabbing them
- Malfoy is his favourite target
- Snape is also a target
- He gets his gun back
- Years 3-7: Gun gets confiscated along with knife and given back every now and then. He's shit at magic of any kind. He shoots Snape in the arse at one point. More of the same for the rest of his time at Hogwarts, I'm sure you get the idea.

** I don't remember the name of it but Harry was just so stupidly attractive he had women literally trying to rape him in the hall. This rape later happened with Harry cumming over 20 times in one long rapey night.

Colin took pictures on McGonnegals orders because Harry was independant now and that's so bad that his rape (that i'd like to again stress was not the result of any magical anything, just a dozen really horny hogwarts students) pictures are published.

**** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10364683/1/][*/Harry's Golden Nuggets/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2805563/Snaggledog][/Snaggledog/]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry takes charge of his fate and the war. He manipulates the wizarding world with revolts, scams and his own vast wealth, but even the best laid plans go awry. His mistake costs him more than he bargains for. Regardless, he is committed to making his crazy plan work. Begins after GoF - Some Dumbledore bashing.
