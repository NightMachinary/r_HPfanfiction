** linkffn(13041698) started about a year ago and is updating semi-regularly. It's a clever and funny take on a self-insert who /isn't/ a Mary Sue. She gets yanked into the Harry Potter world by a magic mirror and de-aged into an 11-year-old.

  I took a swig of pumpkin juice.

  Hmm... It's... kind of like every liquid pumpkin pie spice thing I've ever had before. So it's vile and shouldn't exist. I took a few more swigs and downed the whole bottle. Pie shouldn't come in liquid form. But at least I'm not thirsty anymore.

  I glanced down at the headlines. The Holly Head Harpies had just won the semi-finals. Good for them I guess. There was a sale on self scrubbing dish sponges. Some band called 'Charmed 4U' was playing a concert in London next week. A woman was in trouble at the Ministry for trying to illegally cross-breed pegasuses and unicorns. Well, that woman was just doing God's work as far as I'm concerned.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  After an accident, Harry wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but Tom Riddle has a habit of making himself Harry's problem.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb]] (this is my favourite AU series. Annerb's writing blows your heart to pieces, joins it back together again and makes you cry multiple times. Just loved it to bits, will never read it again untill it's complete though)(first two stories are complete, last one has one or two chapters left, which for some reason she hasn't written!) But it's complete in terms of plotlines etc

** My Top 3 Fics: copied from a comment I made a couple hours ago.

1. Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now. But I have to preface that the story looks to be abandoned after 600k words and two complete Hogwarts years. Started: 2006 Last Updated; August 2016.
2. Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore. Started: 2005 Last Updated: April this year.
3. Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco. Started: March this year. Last Updated: 12 and half hours ago.

Of the recently published works, probably the best. A take on fem!Harry that's not simply a canon retelling with different ships, with some brilliant worldbuilding on the side. Ongoing.
