all pairings are welcome as long as it isn't a slash and as far as writing quality is concerned, any above sub-par or decent is fine by me. This may sound odd but i preferred for the fics to be from FFN or A03(read all of salon kitty's work on AFF), i also prefer the male to be the dominant but it isn't a must.


** As BDSM is such a broad category, and can encompass all manner of things, I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for, but I read this one fairly recently and really enjoyed it. It's more about a realistic long-term BDSM relationship, with a dom slowly easing a beginner into BDSM. Uses rules, limits and safewords, and shows a very respectful, healthy BDSM relationship. Also a fair amount of romance. Neville/Hermione, male dom, everything consentual, between two adults. Marriage laws play a large part in the story, but not really in the conventional way.

** Here is an unfortunately incomplete story that ended up with a second author picking it up mid way and then the original author later starting a repost. It goes into a pretty in depth Master Slave relationship between Harry and Hermione. Sadly none of the versions have been finished. They are on ficwad but I feel they meet your desires and the fanfiction downloader can always grab them for you.

  Every other night, Harri (fem!Harry) and George would meet up in the Room of Requirement at 8pm. What happened from then on was pretty obvious.

I'm now at the beginning of chapter three, and it turns out the fidelius charm is breakable by the goblins.

  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.
