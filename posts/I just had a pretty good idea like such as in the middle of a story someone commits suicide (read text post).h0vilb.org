Such as Luna Lovegood, where she is secretly upset at the fact that people don't believe her creatures and how they don't like her attitude and of the things she sees as a seer, which she hides behind a happy mask. After which the mood comes depressing as everyone finds out, only to find that while all that was true she left them a message on how to defeat the evil of the story, because she cares about them even tho some didn't care for her


** I've read a few stories centering around Harry doing something outright suicidal, but none that centered on Luna.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso][/Recnac Transfaerso/]] - Due to years of abuse by the Dursleys, he has so little self worth, that when he learns that one of the few people who was kind to him is dying of cancer, he feels that the man's children need their daddy more than the world needs him, and uses magic to cure him, but by transferring it to himself. He spends the story getting sicker and sicker from it until he can no longer hide it from his friends.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][/Heart and Soul/]] - It's not exactly the same as being outright suicidal, but once Harry learns about the Horcrux in his head, he's convinced that he will need to die in order for Voldemort to be ultimately defeated.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6590860/1/The-death-of-Harry-Potter][/The death of Harry Potter/]] - Now this one just pissed me off. I don't mind bashing too much, and it was an interesting start to the story but, HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD It turns out that Harry faked his death in the most painful way possible for his friends

That said, I'm not sure you'll find very many people willing to write that. Luna's a fan favorite, and not many people enjoy seeing her suffer, not to mention that the subject alone makes people uncomfortable.
