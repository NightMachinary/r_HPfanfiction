** I don't think linkffn is working so I won't bother linking them: Prince of the Dark Kingdom, Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King, and the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels. There are loads of really long, good fanfics, but these are the good ones I remember that were particularly long and fleshed out.

** At the moment, linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories) and the two White Squirrel duologies ( linkffn(The Arithmancer)/linkffn(Lady Archimedes) and linkffn(The Accidental Animagus)/linkffn(Animagus at War) ) jump to mind.
