I'm looking to read any Harry/Daphne or Harry/Astoria fanfictions

A level of romance is preferred! Thanks


** Most of the better Harry/Astoria stories I've read are either incomplete or abandoned. Here are a bunch of Harry/Daphne stories that I particularly like:

â€‹

- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12849376/1/A-Marriage-of-Convenience][A Marriage of Convenience]]" involves a marriage contract and a crazy Ginny that causes trouble. HP/DG have a great relationship, but something is missing (teaser). linkffn(12849376)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12300252/1/From-Southampton-to-New-York-and-Beyond][From Southampton to New York and Beyond]]" sees Harry and Daphne meet on a cruise as they are both recovering from trauma. linkffn(12300252)
- I'm currently reading "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12155794/1/Honour-Thy-Blood][Honor Thy Blood]]", which has been pretty good. The version of Daphne in this story is not an Ice Queen, but is more of a supporting character, so it may not be what you are looking for. linkffn(12155794)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]]" occurs during 6th year and HP/DG work on a project together to defeat Voldemort. linkffn(13133746)
- "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19193497][to refuse the givens]]" takes place from 5th-7th year. Their bond begins over cigarettes and continues over art and literature. linkao3(19193497)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]]" features Draco helping Harry recover from his long-term alcohol induced stupor. Harry plays relationship chicken with Daphne. linkffn(6257522)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898815/1/Wheels-Within-Wheels-Part-1][Wheels Within Wheels]]" features a marriage contract between Harry and Daphne with them becoming a power couple. There are 3 separate fics covering roughly 20 years. The first one is linked here. linkffn(12898815)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12231363/1/Playing-Defense][Playing Defense]]"? This is an EWE with a Harry/Daphne Greengrass pairing. Both are professors at Hogwarts. His daughter with Ginny is a 7th year at Hogwarts and is trying to find Harry a date to Ginny's upcoming wedding. Everyone is on amicable terms. linkffn(12231363)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]]" (in progress) involves a wealthy HP attempting to rebuild the wizarding world the summer after the war. Daphne starts out as his lawyer. linkffn(13022013)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/1/The-Pureblood-Princess][The Pureblood Princess]]" is one of the more popular Harry/Daphne fics and includes Harry eventually leaving the wizarding world (though it happens really late in the story). The story takes place during 6th year and could be considered a slow burn story as well. linkffn(6943436)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/][Partners]]" is a well-written fic that I found incredibly enjoyable. Harry and Daphne get together in a unique way during the summer between 5th and 6th years when they were both going through significant issues. Romance, friendship, politics, and Voldemort ensues. linkffn(5012016)
- "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13304599/1/An-Ordinary-Magical-Couple][An Ordinary Magical Couple]]". The writing style and dialogue were crisp. The story follows the main canon story line to use as its underpinnings, though does not linger on or rehash all those plot points. Instead, it focuses on other hypothetical moments not highlighted in canon and weaves Daphne into Harry's life in an evolving relationship that is mostly kept hidden from others. linkffn(13304599)

  Harry is just this eleven-year-old trying to cope when Hagrid shows up. Daphne Greengrass is smart, plain, hardworking and a pureblood witch from a family of very modest means. They aren't rich or prominent among the wizarding social set, but they are full of guile and learn fast. Of course they're underestimated, until it is too late.

** Linkffn(8262940)

Harry / Daphne and kind of Astoria. Harry is a auror and Daphne is an expert manipulator. It follows a mystery, and the mystery is actually solid, even if it's obvious at times.Both characters are absolute asshole dickheads and are extremely flawed, which shows how human the story actually is. It's an overall excellent read and a singularly unique fic, different from the usual dynamic of the fluff you will see posted. Cannot recommend this enough.

*** I've read it till Chapter 5 and a lot of it has been just superfluous details about fixing up No. 12 Grimmauld Place with a little bit of dialogue sprinkled in between. And Daphne's personality is quite grating and insufferable.

Does it get better? The story's premise was interesting so I've stuck with it till now but if it's more of the same i.e. Daphne ordering Harry around (despite owing him more than she could ever repay him for in her lifetime) and Harry silently taking it (because his life has been a hellhole and this is his idea of normal)...it would perhaps be better to move on to a happier story.

**** Well, the time stay somewhat the same, and the focus on renovation and building maintenance never really disappears. I can clearly see that this isn't for everyone, but it tickles my fancy quite well!

***** Up to Chapter 12 now. It's gotten a bit better once I started skipping long sections of renovation and picking up the story bits from in between.

The author has a very curious way of writing. Mostly one line paragraphs almost as if writing a summary, but it's actually the full story. Sudden time/space jumps. Still, it's written well enough to maintain interest.
