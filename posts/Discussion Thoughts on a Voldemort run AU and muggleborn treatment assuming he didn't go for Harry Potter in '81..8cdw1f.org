I've been having little ideas run through my mind on how a Wizarding UK in the 90's would look with Voldemort having control of the Ministry (either as some sort of Overlord character or pulling a Minister's strings) and how the poor mudbloods would fair.

In my mind I'm seeing some it as some sort of 'Assimilation' caste system. Muggleborn sprogs removed when they show signs of magic. Sent to...camps maybe? Not Hogwarts but separated from their obliviated or murdered parents. Taught the basics of magic for a year or two to go on and live long and fulfilling lives as the scorned dregs of society and possible servants for the pureblooded elite. I must write it.

I've got ideas for the horror of it all (history does have many wonderful examples to draw from). BUT what would rebellion look like? I'd love some inspiration thrown my way. Has anything like this been done? I've only seen Post-Hogwarts years for Hermione and Weasley if Harry is defeated but nothing assuming Voldie is running the show from day one ad Harry is a non-issue. It'd probably be from Hermione's viewpoint if I could work it into a story.


** [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] , I'm pretty sure this is your cue.

Anyway...I'm not sure it would end well; if you have a pureblooded culture that knowingly and wilfully insulating themselves against muggle influences, that would make maintaining the Statute of Secrecy very difficult. Especially if you assume that they reject ties with the muggle Prime Minister and other members of the government.

(As a side note, I have to question just how MACUSA managed to keep magic from being revealed in the 175 years of Rappaport's Law prohibiting any intentional interaction between magical and non-magical.)

There's also the question of various magical creatures; how would they fare under a pro-pureblood culture? Would they resist and try to break the Statute of Secrecy as well? Would they end up being exterminated?

I mused a little on purebloods eventually destroying themselves, once. About how 'muggleborn' was a meaningless distinction, after they had gotten rid of all the mudbloods they'd start on the half-bloods for not being 'pure' enough, then the poorer pureblood families, etc, etc.

** It depends on whether Voldemort is actually buying into the "pureblood Ã¼ber alles" ideology, considers this a cultural and not racial question (so, muggleborns can be assimilated if they're removed from the muggle influence early enough), is simply using whatever pretext works to gain and keep power, or a mix of such choices.

I've written a story where Malfoy takes over Britain by faking Voldemort's survival in 1981, and he has the muggleborns removed from their families as soon as they are spotted, obliviated if needed, and raised as janissaries personally loyal to him while he is nominally pandering to pureblood bigots. Dumbledore took the remains of the Order into exile to France, but has preparing his return. And when Voldemort returns and Malfoy doesn't want to give up his power, Dumbledore sees his opportunity - and uses Ron and his brothers as well as Harry as his agents. Ron and his brothers go undercover in Britain, and Harry and Dumbledore start hunting Horcruxes.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) has a very similar vibe to what you're saying, although it has an immortal Salazar Slytherin in charge, a caste system in place, and Tom Riddle as a former military man and the current headmaster of Hogwarts. It updates slowly, but is so very worth reading!

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** Hm... While Riddle and his followers proclaim very extreme views about muggleborns, in real world such politics don't survive long. International society may tolerate them while they are playing in boundaries of their own country, but it can intervent if they try to go outside. In case of Magical world there is a very carefully guarded Statue of Secrecy.

Combining this together I can imagine that in long term Riddle's controlled government wouldn't apply any extreme measures to muggleborns. With mundane world becoming more complicated with each year, it's harder to hide all traces of a child (memory charm isn't enough) -- mass disappearances (or killings) will get attention of non-magical government that can lead to the SoS breaking, which is unacceptable.

I can think that muggleborns will be required to attend a school (or courses) in order to teach them magical control, then they are sworn to secrecy and excluded from Magical world. Everyone is happy.

As with Hitler that Riddle's fall can start with him trying to spread his influence outside of Britain. In this case other countries will take actions (start a magical war?) against him.
