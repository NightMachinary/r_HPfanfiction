Do not upvote. I'm thinking of expanding this into a longer story and I would like some feedback on if it would be worthwhile or not to expand the premise I just want thoughts and feedback if possible. I have posted this before but I have edited it since so I would just like some feedback on it if possible.

thank you

John Granger looked down at his third whiskey of the night, he was still trying to come to terms with fact his little girl had gone to war and won.

That his little girl had gone to war, And he hadn't been there To help her. Not because she didn't want his help but because she felt she had to protect him. His little girl , Hermione wasn't so little anymore was a Fierce young woman now . And she had Erased his memory of her And shipped him and his wife off to Australia “ to keep the safe” . Bloody Hell! He was her father , he was supposed to keep her safe, And yet his daughter , his brilliant, Studious, well read daughter had gone behind his back erased his memory and moved him to Australia so a mad man didn't murder them while she and her friends went hunting for the soul fragment of a resurrected wizard That didn't have a nose.

His little girl hadn't even bother to ask before she did it. John downed another whiskey, Hermione hadn't even bother to ask because she was his daughter, She was too damn much like him. She knew he wouldn't have agreed to go to Australia and hide while she fought a war , he would have Insisted on staying and fighting with her Anyway he could. They were too much alike, but too damn stubborn and too damn smart For their own good.

So Here John sat with his fifth whiskey in his hand, In the library of his oldest friend Charles Flinch-Fletchley. They had served together , gone to school together( The both of them old Etonians) , The both of them the fathers of magical children. Both the fathers of war heroes, both men on their fifth whiskey of the night. John because he had been 7000 miles away while his daughter stood her ground and Charles because he had fled to Italy with 30 other families Sheltered under some magic spell while his son fought with the rest of the DA.

Their children had gone from The school room to the battlefield in the Blink of an eye while they were Relegated to the sidelines. Powerless to defend them, Their children have become heroes, Without anyone consulting them. So they drank And came to terms with it. Their children were grown, battle-scared and standing on their own .

He and Charles drank to their own personal Victories The battles they had fought as young men and they drank to thank whatever higher power their was that their children had come out victorious in the end.

They drank and curses the fact their children Were their fathers sons and daughters. They didn't run from a fight, they cut the enemy down too stubborn to run and hide in the face of an Overwhelming Onslaught.

They drink and cursed themselves, They had raise their children to damn well. Pride gleaming in both of their eyes, They were too damn stubborn and too damn bright the next generation of their family lines. So Both men drank And raise their glasses high and drank to their children and their brilliant, stubborn minds. And both men tipped their glasses They knew their children would change the world one stone at a time.


** Very good premise, but the random capitalization really bugs me and ruined the flow of the story.

*** I don't understand why he does it. Like, capitalisation in english is dead easy. Big at the beginning of sentences, for names, and for important, specialized or emphasized terms. Everything else is small.

**** Worst thing is, that's not capitalisation in english, that's capitalisation in general - which means even if his primary language isn't english, he's doing a mistake that he shouldn't do because he learnt not to eons ago.

***** I said English because German, my first language, capitalizes nouns and some pronouns and adverbs as well, which gets real clusterfucky real quick. Here's a bit of dialogue in German using correct capitalisation for instance:

/"Heinrich, du alte Sau. Was tust du denn heute, an diesem schönen Tag? Bist du auch so Einer, der immer alles zerstören muss?"/

/"Joachim, halt deinen Mund. Ich wills einfach nicht mehr hören. Dein geplappere alle drei Sekunden bringt mich noch ins Irrenhaus."/

/"Willst du, dass ich dir eine runterhaue, wie ichs immer tate, als wir Kinder waren? Willst du einen Schlag auf den Kopf?"/

/"Nein, Joachim. Hau mich nicht, du Wahnsinniger. Es war ein Witz."/

Note how the capitalisation is very unlike English. But the OP doesn't capitalize like in German either.

****** I write most of the stuff I post using voice to test while I'm working on projects . Voice to text at least on my phone has a habit of capitalizing random words or letters. I did spend a significant part of my childhood on military bases in Germany though

****** Huh, I didn't know that. Then again, I think I remember German isn't a roman language, so that may be the reason.

** Keep going. Have some conversation in there - a father's angst detailing the fear for his little girl warring with his pride at the strong woman she became would fit in here. Pretty sure the other guy could commiserate.

And the drunker they get, the more emotional they become.

*** That's a very Prominent assumption within the fandom Dan and Emma are pretty much the defaults for Hermiones parents names but JK Rowling never actually gives their names in the books so it's an area that you can get a little creative with thankfully,

So at least for stories where I used Hermiones family I usually just call her parents John and Helen

In the books they're only called Mr. And Mrs. Granger
