Lily suggests it spontaneously the first time, and it's more of a joke than anything else when she mentions it. She's been watching Potter who broods silently and alone for once, over his charms essay in a corner of the common room while she halfheartedly listens to Alice who tells the story of her last date with Frank. And it's Alices' story that sparks the idea to be the one to get under Potters skin for once and to take /him/ by suprise.

And it's really just to tease Potter and not because he has been oddly quiet these last few weeks and really not because of the way his eyes squint underneath his glasses as he scribbles another few words onto the parchment - since she isn't interested in Potter, not at all - but when he ruffles his hair, too focused to even do it consciously, Lily asks him if he wants to meet up on the Hogwarts grounds tonight, the spot on the lake that everyone knows about.

And she laughs when Potter startles so much that he falls out of his chair and she is still grinning when he stares at her like deer in headlights.

But then he asks her if she's sure and his sincerity steals her breath away. Lily stares at him and it only takes a moment to think about it. After all Potter isn't obnoxious like he was last year and he helped that crying first year who was stuck in the vanishing step of the stairs when he didn't notice her watching; and she doesn't remember him asking her to go out once these last three months... So when she simply shrugs, (trying to appear nonchalant and ignoring the blush that creeps up her neck) his grin is almost blinding.

And Lily can't help to feel a little flutter inside when she looks at him, not really listening to Alice who squeals and babbles about how romantic a date under the full moon is but then Potter's expression falters and that catches her attention.

And the next words coming out of his mouth make no sense at all because, "Nah, sorry. Gotta walk my dog tonight!" is not what she expected.

Lily pretends to be alright but her voice is a little colder when she replies, "Didn't know you owned a dog Potter..." And she is not hurt at all when she turns her back and walks up the steps to the girls dormitory.

She doesn't see Potter's eyes following her, still in shock over his own words (He panicked, okay?!), but after a 15 minutes - during which she defenitely did not cry nor angrily thought about ways to curse the guy - how dare Potter to treat her like that! - she grows a bit suspicious.

Despite Potter not asking her to go out with him for some time now, she didn't think he'd never not jump at a chance to go on a date with her, and it's not arrogance making her think like that (she knows he's been watching her, still). She simply grows curious as to why the sudden change of mood occurred, once she's grown a bit calmer and thought about the situation. From that day on she keeps a closer eye on him.

It doesn't take her long to figure out more. Lily is not stupid and Remus is a fellow prefect after all. Besides, she's overheard Potter's little group call Remus, Moony often enough while she'd pretended not to listen - no she didn't stare at Potter while he laughed a ridiculous laugh - though it doesn't help that Potter parades around with a /black/ dog on the schoolgrounds, the day after he declined her offer, because it only adds to the mystery. But then three weeks pass and she is sure that Remus is a werewolf and that James and his friends somehow are involved in that.

So when the next full moon comes she asks him out again just to confirm her suspicion and this time it's his buddy Black who spits out half his drink over the house table while she casually speaks to James over her morning toast.

His excuse this time is almost as ridiculous as the first one, because honestly if James told her that he'd gotten detention she might have been inclined to believe him, if she hadn't already suspected something was going on. But when he utters something about having to polish his broomstick tonight - Sirius makes a choking noise (he really shouldn't have taken another sip of juice and what is the meaning of that glance he shares with Remus who barely holds back a smirk, despite the guilty expression in his eyes as he watches James' and her exchange) - Lily simply flicks her hair and says, "Another time maybe."

She pretends to ignore Potter, but takes satisfaction in the blush that spreads over his entire face when the implication of what he said hits him and he buries his face in his hands while Pettigrew pats his back sympathetically.

It's hard to avoid Potter during the next few weeks and to be honest she doesn't even try. Lily enjoys the teasing that has snuck it's way into their interactions. She likes to make Potter blush and speechless by using the same tactics he'd (unsuccessfully) used on her in the previous years. And that was the idea, wasn't it? To put James into a place where he is the surprised one for once.

(Lily even asks Sirius about a certain spell to prank Potter and if that does start a strange friendship who is there to call her out on it?)

But soon the teasing turns into friendly banter and Lily finds herself looking forward to their small conversations on the corridors and then they sit next to each other in the common room and Lily doesn't even remember when "Potter" turned into "James".

That being said, as soon as James opens his mouth and tries to ask her out, she comes up with an excuse - and her's are way better than James' - and extracts herself from the situation.

There are a few close calls, and she almost wants to give in, but there is still a secret she needs to figure out (Where did James' dog disappear to? And what is Potter up to during the full moon, since Remus is obviously not approachable in that state)

But when she catches herself laughing at one of James stupid jokes more often than she'd like to admit and when she sees the way he is now, and how he treats others, her resolve crumbles bit by bit. She stumbles about a book about Animagi and the next time Sirius barks a laugh the way he does, she is sure that she knows how James got a pet so quickly.

And then she can't take it any longer. They are sitting in the library together, just the two of them. And this time when she asks James to go on a date with her, it is genuine.

Lily bites her lip trying to hide her smile as she watches James recover from the shock once again and she holds her breath, waiting for an answer. And then James utters something about how he promised Sirius to count his socks that night and her expression seems tell him everything because he stumbles out of his chair and Lily watches him leave the library, her heart aching painfully while she questions if she was wrong all along.

She is still there half a hour later, trying not show how hurt she is because who can she blame if not herself after everything, when Remus slides in the chair opposite to her, with a serious expression on his face. He asks her if she knows. Her hurt turns into confusion and then into a laugh, when she realizes that of all things, she was the one to forget the reason that started it all.

Tonight's a full moon.

After Lily confirms Remus' suspicion, the conversation that follows is long and earnest and in the end Lily even manages to wrestle a smile out of the other boy. She doesn't think that she has convinced Remus completely that her opinion of him hasn't changed - that she doesn't think that he's a Monster, but she'll take what she can get for now.

Afterwards she goes to look for James (Remus mentioned the Quidditch pitch) and indeed finds him on the bleachers watching the Hufflepuffs train.

She asks him again if he wants to go out on a Date and when James tries to tell her about his promise to Sirius regarding his socks, Lily thinks she might be a bit in love. When Lily clarifies that she doesn't mind waiting for the next Hogsmeade weekend, James kisses her.

*** I am glad. My original idea was that Lily would wanna go on a date under the full moon because it's "romantic" and James comes up with more ridiculous excuses every time to turn her down. And after a whily Lily already knows about Remus being a werewolf and all and keeping the charade up because she thinks it's funny

  Lily suggests it spontaneously the first time, and it's more of a joke than anything else when she asks Potter to go on a Date with her. But him turning her down is not what she expected. ----Alternatively, James being really bad at coming up with excuses while he is under pressure.
