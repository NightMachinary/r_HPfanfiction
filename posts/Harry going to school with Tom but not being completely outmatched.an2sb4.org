I've read or tried to read several fics where somehow Harry ends up going to Hogwarts in the past, and is in the same year as Tom Riddle. In every one of them, Tom is just far /better/ than Harry is. Smarter, more skilled, more charismatic, and he just runs circles around Harry. Hell, I've seen one or two where Harry seems more terrified of young Tom than he canonically was of Voldemort.

So I'm looking for fics where this doesn't happen. Maybe Tom has to be careful to plot around Harry because he found out the hard way that Harry is a far superior duelist at that age. Maybe young Tom isn't evil and Harry is incredibly surprised to find that they become genuine friends. Maybe Harry exposes Tom for attempting to murder Myrtle (or succeeding), and Tom gets his wand snapped and/or sent to azkaban. Could be any number of things.

Does anyone have any recommendations?


** It's been a while since I read this---I'm not even sure if it was completed yet at the time, actually---but I remember linkffn(The Unwinding Golden Thread by Carnivorous Muffin) had them as equals to some extent. However, I should mention that I don't remember the timeline lasting a particularly long time...

  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership. fem!Harry

  What is it about you? Teddy thought. He looked away, then quickly back again. Billy wasn't like anything or anyone he'd ever known. He wasn't like anything or anyone he'd ever thought he wanted. He was...wholly new, unexpected. Baffling and oddly frightening. Teddy wet his lips, studying Billy's sharp features. It wasn't often he had the chance to do this---to just observe Billy without drawing the full weight of his attention.His nose was a little too long. His ears were too big. He was the kind of skinny that other kids made fun of, all gangly limbs and extended trunk. His brown hair stuck up in untamed spikes, too chaotic to be deliberate. He was so pale his angular face almost glowed in the darkness of the planetarium.His skin was a living canvas beneath undulating waves of light.Or: Sequel to Teenage Wasteland.

  “What I find absolutely fascinating,” Riddle said as he stalked closer. “is you.” He backed Harry up until the cool wall of the common room was brushing against him. “Do you know why?”

  “No. And I'll be honest here, Riddle, I don't particularly care.”

  The taller boy grinned at him, small yet infinitely amused. “That. Right there.” One hand rose and brushed some of Harry's fringe from his face. “Nathan Ciro is a spineless little boy too afraid of his own shadow to dare even glance in my direction. But you...”

  He leaned closer. “You look at me like you want to stab me.” After an accident, Auror Harry Potter wakes up in the body of fourteen year old Nathan Ciro, a tormented Slytherin who recently tried to end his own life. His return to Hogwarts causes quite the stir through the staff and students, especially when they realise he is not the same boy as before. He tries to keep his head down, but with the keen eyes of Tom Riddle hounding him through the halls, Harry finds himself unwillingly drawn into a dangerous game with an equally dangerous boy.
