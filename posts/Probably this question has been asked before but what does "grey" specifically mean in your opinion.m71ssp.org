I'll be the first to admit I never read a "grey!"<insert character name here> but it's mostly related to the fact that I don't understand the term. We have in canon the term of dark magic which is used to harm others. I would assume that it's light counterpart is something meant to heal such as the "Episkey" spell. So what is grey magic supposed to be? Spells that are usually used for personal convenience but don't affect others? Say the summoning charm or the severing charm?


** "Grey" typically means you are willing to use dark magic for good causes. Which is pretty much the canonical Order of the Phoenix - see Dumbledore authorising Harry to counter-curse anyone who attacks them in HBP, or Lupin encouraging Harry to kill in DH. But in fanon the Order is often turned into a pacifist organisation as a contrast to indy!Harry's hard pragmatism.

** In this context, a gray character is someone on the good side with questionable morals; has a by any means necessary approach or a bad guy who does some good, I guess.

Dumbledore, Sirius and Barty Crouch Sr. are gray characters. I guess you can say Hermione and DH Harry are gray, too.

*** Interesting take on Barty Sr. He was technically on the side of good, yet he seems just as power hungry as some of the Death Eaters. I can't remember which character said it, (Sirius?) but it's mentioned some thought his measures were just as harsh as the other side, after he authorized the use of deadly force. An under-utilized character in fanfics imo.

** I think I haven't quite caught the memo myself because I have seen it done in different ways. But as far as I know there is this idea of a light/grey/dark magical core and some spells fall in different categories. With a dark core it's easier to learn dark spells, grey is a close second and light spells are the hardest. And so on and so on...

I have seen several explanations for the nature behind it, personally I don't like that trope anyway. When I see grey!Wizard I think of morally grey and not really about magical cores.

** IMO it is not really anything to do with magic. If Harry joins with, tries to replace or just is generally morally similar to Voldemort and his Death Eaters then that is often described as dark!Harry in reference to 'Dark Lord' and perhaps 'Dark Magic'. If you want to make Harry obviously morally dubious while not going that far then that became 'grey!Harry'. Bare in mind that it isn't just individual actions, but general worldview, so a Harry contemptuous of muggles, but just wants isolation over genocide, or with the (depressingly common) 'rapey' harem may be described as grey. Think of it as antihero, does bad things for an acceptable end goal.

In story it is often used to describe a 'middle ground' third 'faction' between Dumbledore's 'Light' and the Death Eaters' 'Dark', so I often associate 'grey' with at least a bit of Dumbledore bashing and Indy!Harry.

Bare in mind that a combination of further flanderisation on top of canon to make the ideologies distinct as well as the worryingly wonky moral compass of certain parts of the ff community mean that there is very little constancy in what is described as 'light', 'grey' or 'dark', so I would use it as a rough guide to the writer's intentions rather than a gospel for the actual content.

** I don't think there is 'grey magic', just people who use both 'white' magic and 'dark' magic.

So it is categorized as 'grey! Harry', for example, since he use all kinds of magic... Although the concept of white magic itself is also strange, it seems to me that most of the characters in canon are grey wizards and witches.

From what I notice, grey!Harry is more about him being ruthless and merciless, and it doesn't have much to do with the kind of magic he practices.

** In general terms, I've mostly seen/understood it as "Dark" is Voldemort and his followers... everyone calls Dumbledore "Leader of the Light"... so, if someone doesn't mostly (or totally) look to one of them as leader, they might be described as "Grey"... neither part of the Dark faction or Light faction.

I've seen lots of political stuff involving the Wizengamot and who votes under what voting block included in there at times to muddy the waters or clear them according to your taste. Then, it's often described as "grey" or "neutral" families (or faction).

And, just to further confuse the issue, there are the stories that do break it down as Dark Magic vs. Light Magic... where the Killing Curse (for example) requires you to delve into the evil part of your emotions and/or soul in order to cast it and therefore making it the DARKEST of Soul Magics... whereas, the Patronous uses "Sunshine, Butterflies, and Lollypops" and all the good parts of you to be cast and therefore is Light Magic. So, if someone uses lots of Dark Magic they eventually become twisted and evil due to the corruption... and Light Magic users should have almost no corruption. This makes a "Grey" wizard someone who uses those spells that aren't totally Dark or Light equally and without any particular "Evil" or "Good" leanings. Kind of a balance between two extremes.

** A Grey Dumbledore would be an actual Greater Good Dumbledore. Maybe he keeps most of his canon actions, but "Voldemort is back and Cornelius won't listen, though I hate to kill, it's for the Greater Good" and proceeds to kill all of the Death Eaters that are in Azkaban before Voldemort breaks them out, and sequesters the Dementors somewhere to starve them like totally happened post-War as they aren't really around after the war.

** Gray magic, to me. Means the following:

Magic anyone can learn and use, which would include the Hogwarts curriculum.

Can a dark lord cast Episkey? Yes. Can Dumbledore cast the banishing charm? Yes.

Grey magic is neutral, it's neither evil nor is it good. It's just /magic/

The patronus charm, widely lauded as the lightest of light spells, is grey magic because anyone sufficiently powerful with the right emotional triggers can cast it, but it's most often light users due to dark magic having drastic effects on a persons psyche, including the development of sociopathic tendencies and addiction. Voldemort could theoretically cast a patronus, but is he likely to have a happy enough memory to do so? No.

Grey magic is also a reflection of a persons magical alignment, true neutral if you will. Most often children are considered magically grey until they're old enough to start casting, in which case they naturally start finding some spells easier than others, which colors their magic accordingly.

Some people are just naturally more or less capable of casting certain magic. Dark wizards are not always necessarily evil, they just have an easier time casting the darker magic. Just as light wizards are not necessarily good, they just have an easier time casting lighter magic.

The unforgivables, for example. Are *technically* grey magic, as they're entirely *intent* based. Harry manages to successfully cast the cruciatus curse in canon after all. However, just because they're grey magic does not mean they aren't Dark magic (notice the capital letter, big difference). The unforgivables are the darkest magic in canon because of what they are, even if they're grey aligned spells. It's confusing.

*** Sure there needs to be certain intent behind the spells which would put them in either the light, grey and dark category. However stripping one of their free will and inducing pain definitely have no potential good reasoning to them. Painlessly killing someone has its own aspects to be debated.

They're evil magic, but they are grey because again, theoretically anyone with sufficient power and intent could cast them.

** Yeah, I don't remember ‘Light magic' being a thing in canon. In canon there's just general magic and the Dark Arts, if Light or Grey magic exists then it's not mentioned.

I think that's why it's a popular concept in fanfiction, because the author has so much creative agency. If they want to portray Dark magic as good then they can talk about how it's a definition imposed by the Ministry that outlaws all the magic that's too powerful that they don't understand, like blood magic. In dark Harry fics there tends to be a line like “magic can't be inherently bad, it's the intent behind it. You could kill someone with Wingardium Leviosa by floating them off a cliff!”

Personally I'd class Dark magic as “created with the intent to harm” and Light magic as “created with the intent to heal”. Both are powered by emotions (e.g. Crucio vs the Patronus) so grey magic would be magic where you don't need emotion to create the spell.

** I always think of the Dragonlance setting when thinking about 'grey'. A pendulum naturally swings between lawful good and chaotic evil in balance. To much chaos and you have lawlessness, anarchy, murder in the streets. To much Law and you get stifling microlaws that are inflexible. Intolerance, no creativity (think: prequel Jedi Order). Canonically, Fudge was not evil, just a self serving idiot.

** Most of the time, at least in fics, being "Grey" is more about a political opinion than about Magic. Sometimes, you can see a "good" character using Dark Magic, making him Grey (usually an Indy! Harry), but most of the time, the term is used to describe a "3rd side" in the war, who is neither against the Dark (Voldemort and the Blood Purist), or the Light (represented by a Fanon Dumbledore who somehow became extremely pacifist and/or power hungry). Some would argue that not being against a side that want to do a genocide is almost as bad as supporting them, but yeah it works in fanon.

The term is also kinda associated with the Greengrasses in fanon (so Daphne can be a bitchy Pureblood Princess while still being "datable" by a good Harry).

** "Grey Magic" means that I should probably close the fic unless there is an extremely compelling reason not to, such as a personal recommendation by someone whose opinion I respect, a long track record, or that it's parody or crack. The same goes for "Light Magic", actually.

This is because there is a 90% chance that the author is about to start bashing or degrading Harry's canon friends, Dumbledore, and/or the Order of the Phoenix, in favour of their edgy anti-hero protagonist, who is typically an OC ironically named "Harry Potter".

In other words, what [[/u/Taure]] said.
