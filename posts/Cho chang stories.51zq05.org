I've just finished reading the autumn swan and found it very enjoyable. Does anyone know any other good stories on Cho chang ? - they don't have to be about her and harry I just enjoy reading about her character.

I prefer stories that are set in hogwarts and not in the future ect

Thanks

  Cho cried and she survived Pansy Parkinson's cruel jabs about a dead boy. She wept and she passed all her classes, kept up with Quidditch, watched fairweather friends scatter in the cold wind. She got very good at wordlessly summoning tissues and she joined the DA against her parents' wishes.

  They had told her to behave, begged her, ordered her, as the threatening darknesses of the world clung close even inside Hogwarts, and Cho walked out to the little pub in Hogsmeade and wrote her name down on Hermione's list.

  I hope someone in the DA told Cho that she ought to have been in Gryffindor.

  I hope she laughed at them, hard.

  Integrity. Truth. Honor. Dedication. These were the tenets of her House, of the blue and the bronze, the eagle called raven (called nerd, called stuck-up, called so many things that were not their names). Bravery was only one way to be a hero.

**** Everything by that author is really good! I even like the AU "what ifs?" even though I'm not a fan of AU.

** I'm currently working on inserting Cho into A Glance Askance, but I've had to delve into a literal truckload of research involving Chinese Buddhism, Imperial Chinese history, the Triads and many other subjects. It's been fun writing it, and I'll post a link here when I finally get it finished.

**** It is and it isn't. I'm still wrangling with a Ginny/Draco story that involves St. Mungo's and other concepts. I should have something up soon. Keep your fingers crossed and your wand on you.
