all i remember is one small part (at the end?)

one of the characters (sirius black? female char?) is trying to find this remote mythical school (in the mountains?) they train battle-mages/war-wizards...? its almost impossible to find and there is a good chance you wont be alive to graduate i think harry graduated from there (after the war? during?)

i know its not much but its all i got

not Miranda Flairgold's trilogy
