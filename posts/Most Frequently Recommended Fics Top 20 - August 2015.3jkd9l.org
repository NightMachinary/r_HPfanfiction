Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.                     |

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.              |

The resulting understanding between Harry and Snape is critical to destroying Voldemort and leads to an offer of adoption. Covers year seven and Auror training. Sequel is Revolution.                                                                                                                                            |

With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.                                                                                                                                                      |

Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze. |

*** As great and long as it is wordcount-wise, it's only 5 chapters. The most loyal and diligent reviewer will probably only have given it 5 reviews total so far. If it had been broken up into more chapters, I'm sure it would have way more reviews.

That just goes to show, don't judge a story by the number of reviews!

**** You're right. The number of favorites is generally a better indication of its popularity. /The Changeling/ has only 161 favs though, so it is still massively underrated.

(In comparison, Harry Crow has 13,272 favs, which is 82 times the same for The Changeling. I hate this world.)
