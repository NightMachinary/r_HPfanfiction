Hey Potterheads, I've been trying to find this fic again for the better part of a month. Don't remember anything, except that Hermione and Voldemort kill each other in the Three Broomsticks (Perhaps Hogs Head?), and afterward there's a wave of magical children that are named Hermione.

Anyone know what I'm talking about? I'm fairly certain I found the fic here originally, but I can't find it again and I'm going craaaazy. Thanks in advance!!

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE
