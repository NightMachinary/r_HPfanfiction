I think this was the same did where the trio became SUPER paranoid and for example, preemptively destroyed the acromantulas. Charlie try to get Harry to help the dragon get over her trauma. It was pretty crack-y if I remember correctly

And thanks to [[/u/Leafyeyes417][u/Leafyeyes417]] for the comment that helped me remember exactly which fic this was.

  All they wanted was a normal school year and now they're willing to fight for it. An alternative take on the Trio's fourth year.

** I read this one too, but can't remember the name. I know he traumatized the dragon due to the fact he covered himself in armor and looked exactly like what killed the dragons mother.

At the start of the fic the paranoid trio decide to check the CoS and kill another basilisk. McGonagall starts to get twitchy watching the trio plotting and starts to come up with harebrained plots to figure out what they are up to, with Sinistra amused on the side about it. The was an old secret war vet in a shop down in hogsmede that sold the trio + luna(?) + other champions of TWT items (like specially treated robes for first task, spearguns for second task) and taught them to fight.

Lol hope the extra info helps you find it ðŸ˜‚

** Was it called something like "If you want peace, prepare for war"? I think i remember something like it but a quick look through my bookmarks doesn't turn up a link.

EDIT: Didn't see someone already linked it, I'm on mobile and missed the other comment.
