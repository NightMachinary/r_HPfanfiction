** To me, the Veil is a portal, a door if you would. It leads to the afterlife, which we don't exactly know what it is or what it entail as a plane of existence.

The portal is there because, as everything in the DoM, wizards don't undertand Death as a concept too well, and they seek to study it. How they do so is unclear, but the fact that there are steps around it makes me think scholars (or rather, Unspeakables) gather around to either watch through the veil if it ever moves, or, more likely, to /hear/ what is being said through it. As we see in OoTP, both Harry and Luna (who actually have witnessed Death and understand what it implies) hear low, ununderstandable whispers when near it. It would appear that these are the Dead talking, from whichever plane of existence they now reside in, inviting the living to join them, as according to this wiki passage:

#+begin_quote
  Though the living could have the strangest feeling that there was someone standing right behind the Veil on the other side of the archway, their words are inaudible except for "faint whispering and murmuring noises" coming from the other side of the Veil. When the living person tries to communicate, the dead try harder and their whispering and murmuring becomes louder. If those who hear the whispering stare at the archway long enough, they shortly become entranced and mesmerised by it, believing it had a kind of beauty about (old though it was), unknowingly walking towards it, intrigued by the gently rippling Veil, and feeling a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it.

** Quite literally death. The Veil of death is a portal to the Dead, and only the Dead may pass. As with any other portal to the afterlife, it is a door that swings only one way. Any who pass through it can never return, and any who attempt to retrieve something from beyond it are themselves doomed.

Unless, of course, you were Death, or the Master of Death. I actually thought this was where Deathly Hallows was going for a bit: once you become the Master of Death and unite the Hallows, you may pass beyond the Veil, and you may also return. It's an interesting idea that possessing the cloak, stone, and wand could allow you to venture into the Land of the Dead and call forth its secrets, for the dead have many things that mortals will never see.

** For me, It converts the person who enters into pure magic to allow them to be reborn while those who died away from it has their last moments and strongest memories caught, replaying forever as their magic is slowly reclaimed by the universe to be reapportioned.

** I always pictured the Veil as the magical's guillotine. You throw someone through it and the victim is then just... deleted from existence. No body, no soul, no magic lingers behind. Super clean.

But as with most things in the Department of Mysteries, I really use those artifacts how I need them in a story. So, depending on story, the Veil is a portal to another world, the portal to the afterlife or just the entrance to Persephone's closet, where she stores the more extravagant knickers for Hades. I also have a drabble where it doesn't kill, but make the one going through invisible, untraceable and walk-through - so effectively dead for everybody else, but not really dead.

*** Well erasing the soul sounds horrifying considering the Magicals seem to have at least some concept of the after-life.

** I still love the idea of the DoM we see as being a total front, and the real DoM is actually through the veil. Totally crack, but I enjoy it.
