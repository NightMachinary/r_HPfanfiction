I'd really like to see some characterization of young harry, but haven't been able to find any good ones on my own. Whether it be a harry-is-rescued-from-the-Dursleys trope, a de-aging fic, or even just a character study of his life growing up w the dursleys, I'd really like to see some baby harry! Rec me any you loved, please, or even just some guilty pleasure objectively bad ones that were fun to read (I'm trash and not sorry for it!)

(Side note I read one several years ago that I vaguely remember liking, where he ran away from home and met Hermione when they were like seven??? And her parents took him in? And he was maybe a kitten animagus???)


** The one you're thinking of is linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) I believe.

The series starting with linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) starts when Harry is 7 or 8 I think.

I don't remember if Harry gets a lot of screen time in linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them), but most of it takes place when Harry and Hermione are 2.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1277][Mine]] by Gillian (and the longer sequels) is my favorite kid!Harry fic. It's a Snape is Harry's bio dad (no infidelity) and rescues him from the Dursleys. I like this fic because the author clearly knows how five years old act and speak. I think it's rare to find a kid in a fic who acts appropriately to their age.

** linkffn(The Best Revenge) has Snape sort of raise Harry and I really love the way Harry is written. He actually feels like a kid, not an eleven-year-old politician (which, as much as I like The Accidental Animagus, happens sometimes).

If you don't mind slash, linkao3(Away Childish Things) has de-aged Harry, as in de-aged to his ten-year-old self from body to memories. I haven't finished it but it deals with his abuse/neglect at the hands of the Dursleys in a heartwrenching way.

** I assume you want stories of a Harry who's too young for Hogwarts for most of the story. If you want stories where he only STARTS out young but goes into Hogwarts, I can give you another list. :)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8707789/][Six, Revisited]] by Warviben. De-aging. I especially love the scene where Harry and Snape are skulking down the halls of Hogwarts and little Harry is trying to tip-toe the whole way because they're sneaking but he gets tired because "This is a very long sneak," and goes into a stream-of-consciousness discussion.
