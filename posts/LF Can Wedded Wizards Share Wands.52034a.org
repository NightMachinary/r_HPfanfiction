Does anyone know of a fanfic that explains wizard weddings ? Or the bond that spouses share? Any theories?

I was talking with some friends and it came up, can spouses share wands?


** Sure, Ollivander says to Harry in DH that any wizard can channel magic through anything, but that a harmonious bond between wizard and wand make for really good magic. I think what your really asking is if you marry some one will their wand treat you the same way as the original owner, and to that I say no it will treat you like any other person who picks it up. If you have a similar personality it might work better. After all closer than husband and wife is father and son, and Frank Longbottom's wand didn't work very well for Neville.

I can't say I know of any fics that talk about this though.

*** My thoughts are closer to the soul bond fics, but you're right.

**** Every soul bond fic I've ever read still acknowledges people as two different witches and wizards.

  As he measured, he said, â€˜Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand.'

** There's a long, long fic that's MM/AD, and I seem to remember a sub-plot about their being able to use one another's wands. I don't remember whether they ever get married, but I seem to remember that there's some sense that they are "soulmates" or something because they can share wands with no trouble. (There are several sequels, outtakes, etc., so if you like it, it will take you a while to read through it all.)

*** I really like this pairing, even if canon shot it all to hell. Minerva was the only one up until the end to call him Albus. (I think it was in book two, and the way they danced at the Yule Ball made it headcanon for me anyways.)

** So you want to suport HHr? As Hermione used alohomora with Harry's wand in PS.

*** No, actually not a huge fanof cannon Harry/ cannon Hermione. I've read a bunch of soul bond fics and I was interested in how that would effect their wands. Additionally, I don't know much about magical marriages.
