I'm wanting to delve into Occlumency for a future fix and I wondered what you enjoy and what you hate about the subject.

Specifically it's Snape teaching my main character how to use Occlumency so if that changes things....


** Less: mindscapes, walls, barriers.

More: emotional control, mental self-discipline.

** I like to imagine Legilimency as less straight up 'mind reading', and more the ability to puck out surface-level thoughts. More skilled practitioners can subtlety influence their target's thoughts by way of associations. That is, you are thinking of a horse, which lives on a farm surrounded by fences, which are made of trees, which make up the Forest of Dean, where your friends are hiding.

Occlumency would then be the ability to avoid such thought chains, by presenting no such thought for an attacker to latch onto, and remaining focused on your clear mind regardless of any external influence.

Just my thoughts, anyway; I figure it's a bit more interesting than the standard mind palace, etc.

** I read it as magical dissociation. I don't like how fics usually present it as something that's easy and has no mental cost.

And I think legilimency is strongly tied to emotions too - you have to evoke, say, anger in yourself to see anger in another. That will also help the occlumens if they can manipulate their own emotions so the right memories show at the right time.

*** U\pet_genius and I were discussing Occlumency in another thread so I am just going to copy my post from there.

A person who is hurt repeatedly mentally, emotionally or physically and who is essentially taught this behaviour is acceptable (by the lack of challenge to it) and will not stop, must find a way to cope with the pain, whether that is emotional, physical and/or mental. Disassociating from it is the likely outcome. Thereby making someone better suited to mastering it than others.

I do see precisely why Snape would be a natural occlumens and it fits with how he tries to teach Harry to discipline himself in order to perform occlumency.

I recall JKR addressing a fan's disgruntlement that Draco could master occlumency when Harry couldn't. JKR explained why (and I agreed with her) that Draco would be much better at shutting off his feelings than Harry. Draco was brought up in an upper class and very traditional background. He would be taught to keep his emotions to himself from a young age. He'd have been taught to behave in a certain way, all prim and proper and where there is an order to everything, a hierarchy...you do as you are told and don't whine. Keep your objections to oneself and don't wear your emotions on your face, as otherwise you leave yourself open to attack

I am very interested in occlumency and believe it does tie strongly to defending oneself against the dark arts generally speaking.

ETA Snape gets frustrated easily with people who have less talent than him or who he perceives not to be applying themselves. So that could affect how he treats your main character.

I would also be interested in reading your fic..

***** 1. All it takes is one person in charge to determine something is bad for it to be banned. And the Wizarding Shee- I mean world will believe them. OR~ Some idiot abused the hell out of it in a way that tainted it, so they made it all illegal. OR~ It could be banned because it was meshed into a mind magics ban. I can see the British Wizarding world banning a whole school of magic wholesale for the sole reason about half of it can be used for evil.
2. I see the Purebloods handing it down anyway regardless of the ban. Draco having to learn from Bellatrix? Draco is lazy as fuck. He wants everything handed to him or for his father to fix things. The first real time he has to do something where there is consequences otherwise? He fell apart. Looking at you book 6.

And I see there being a book of it in ravenclaw tower. They probably practice it for their educational needs.

****** Can't really think of any way to abuse mental enhancements in such a way that they would be banned. I could see it if they were dangerous to learn though, or if they had side effects. A carpet ban on mind magic seems very unlikely - Dumbledore is a legilimens, obliviation is the pillar on which their secrecy is built, charms and potions that mess with your mind are made available to teenagers.

Fair enough on Draco, my argument was more geared towards the pseudo-aristocracy the pureblood wizards style themselves after.

Dumbledore is literally seen by most of the Wizarding world as a pinnacle of morality, and despite some questionable decisions he's still a pretty good person all told.

** Based off of how Snape (badly) explained it, I very much see Occlumency being rooted in shutting down your emotions (which would also explain why Harry "Heart on My Sleeve" Potter was so damn terrible at it).

I've done the "shutting off emotions" thing during some periods of extreme depression, and it's very very BAD for you.

I wish a fic would explore it in that aspect. I'm writing a fic now where I'll eventually go into that, but I'd like to see someone else's take on Occlumency being something that functions as a defense, but it's actually bad for you in the long run if you use it too much.

** There are no occlumancy shields. It's all mental discipline. Opponent wants you to think of a thing, you dont' think of that thing. That's occlumency. Low level skill means thinking of nothing or a specific thing to prevent them from finding what they want. Expert level is not thinking of the very specific things, so it appears you're not occluding your mind at all. Legilimancy isn't mind reading. It's remembering things they're remembering, or thinking the things they're thinking.

** Occlumency in most fics is just plain delusional. You cant keep something fixed in your mind for more than 12 seconds (8 if you take into account newer studies) How the hell are you going to remember the 2467 dragons protecting a mental castle in perfect detail?

Also it is the Same problem with the "blank" mind approach You can never have an empty mind unless you are in deep dreamless sleep or some similar state (which is mutually exclusive to being conscious)

In my opinion Occlumency would be the total opposite of what most authors now claim. Instead of having mental "defenses" ( i once read one Harry had a Death star inside his mind /rolls eyes/) I would gather that in order to defend from attack there could be two options:

1. Mind illusion (master level): The occlumens shows the attacker exactly what he wants to see. He has to have a perfect picture of what he wants to show and be able to hold it. The image has to be in perfect detail, which ironically it should be imperfect. You can't remember every single detail of every memory (unless you have eidetic memory which i couldnt begin to understand - and its also not Harry's case).

2. Misdirection: start thinking rapidly of things that have no meaning at all, numbers, letters stories, whatever. This approach was shown in KOTOR II when Atton Rand explains how he tricked Jedi (called Mental Pazaak [[https://youtu.be/4mokhjML3C0]]) this is the most believable for me since he has to be doing actively.

Bottom line, unless occlumency is a spell that could be held like a normal charm, and cast with the wand, having a passive defense should be impossible

The third approach I could understand was one that described it as a kind of "curtain" that was even visible. It would be Something like a metamorphmagus who wolds his/her form indefinitely or an animagus. But its still nothing like the usual "mind castle" approach.

*** One aspect that I think is important to consider is that occlumency /is/ a magical art - although it is presented more like a mental regimen in a lot of fics. Constructing a mental landscape with the help of magic does not strike me as particularly strange, when magic can routinely violate much of the basics of reality.

That being said, the hyper-detailed mental mindscapes are ridiculous (or the defenses with dragons or whatnot). But with effort and magic, making your mind manifest like a garden or lake or even a familiar location seems fair enough to me. This /is/ a universe where the space between life and death is pictured based on the person experiencing it - why shouldn't the mind manifest the same way? Also, thematically it can play well with the 'memory palace' way of memorizing by associating specific memories with a familiar location.

For the blank mind approach, I much prefer the 'concentrate on something specific that isn't what they want' approach myself. Eg, if someone is using legilimency, maybe you start focusing on counting and focusing all your energy on it, or reciting a given phrase.

Not to say that your approach is invalid - just that in fanfiction, I think it's equally valid as the others :)

I like the idea of better memory and cognitive function. But I also think it requires constant maintenance. Like meditation every night.

This would make it so you have short term memory, long term memory, and occlumency sorted memory index.

** I've wondered if Occlumency might actually come with a hidden cost. Specifically, it doesn't just protect against Legilimency and the like, it protects against *anything* that might potentially influence your thoughts/feelings/etc.. This includes new ideas and information. Thus, the more you use Occlumency, the more ossified your thinking becomes, and you increasingly lose the ability to change your mind or consider other perspectives. Once you make a plan, you'll follow it to whatever end no matter what happens or how the situation changes.

Consider the the canon's most prominent Occlumens: Severus Snape perceives Harry as James Potter come again, a spoiled, entitled little prince, and nothing he sees - even Harry's memories of his "childhood" - is able to shift that. Dumbledore's and Riddle's adherence to stupid plans could also be due in part to this effect.
