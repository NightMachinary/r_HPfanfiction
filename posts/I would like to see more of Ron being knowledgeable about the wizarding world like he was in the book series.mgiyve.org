I mean he warned Harry how books are different from the ones in the muggle's world!


** Yeah, I'd like to read this.

I'd also like a scene where Hermione tries to follow something she read in a book and it doesn't go accordingly at all. Then Ron says something along the lines of, "Do muggles do literally everything like it is in their books?"

****** Most of HP characters are so flawed but never got called out on it, on the contrary they are considered the epitome of goodness which so weird lol

** I like him in "How to Succeed At Dark Wizardry Without Really Trying" for this - Harry and Hermione often treat things as nonsensical (eg Divination) and Ron is there knowing the reason for it, but not feeling the need to correct them, and just getting on with things.

** I think having Ron be knowledgeable about the practical side of things from the Wizarding World would definitely be a plus - however, I'd push back on the implication that it's the way he is in the book series. Hermione is the author mouthpiece for when information needs to be presented - outside of a few early examples, Ron doesn't fill that role even when it comes to the wizarding world.

So really, you're looking for fanfiction that /expands/ Ron's role in that regard, not one that emulates the books. Just a small quibble ;)
