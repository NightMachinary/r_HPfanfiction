** Jesus Christ that'd be a morbid story wouldn't it?

**** Dumbledore would know that Snape is responsible. Lily would know who was secret keeper.

Story you are looking for would be one those were snape is not the kid who gives everyone with working instincts bad vibes. One that was without any reason bullied by marauders who potioneered lily and drove snape in the waiting arms of voldemort. It would be oc snape, lily, marauders etc.

This is canon. The rest however, is indeed speculative (and unlikely).

****** There definitely was a reason. A shitty teenager formed reason, but still a reason nonetheless.

  Severus got his wish when Voldemort decided to stun Lily instead of killing her. With her husband and son dead, what is there for her in this world? And without Lily's sacrifice, will there be any hope for the wizarding world? AU

** While not /unrealistic/ (I can see SS as a likely rebound, especially if the rest of the Marauders vanishes/get themselves into Azkaban), it makes for a rather morbid plot, and -- unless they're able to give each other /full disclosure/ and forgiveness in the end -- a very unhealthy relationship longterm.
