New book series by Wizarding world idea: Heir of Salazar (Heir to Salazar) Takes place in America's school for witchcraft and wizardy: Ilvermorny. The main character is POC dark skin messy black hair blue eyes and bi (I based him off of Korra and dark skin harry fan art i sometimes see) alot of POC and LGBT representation since its America which is diverse in culture and race. Alot of the first year muggle borns would have to deal with the steampunk design buildings and medieval (1600 for pilgrims) living style. The main villan is unknown for a super long time like palpatine but the story is about corruption in the different wizarding world governments. The main Villan is extremly rich and powerful (Bill Gates style) and is using his wealth to buy the different governments through black mail bribe, or greed. It doesnt matter how but they're under his control. The ones not under their control is Ministry of Magic:Bulgaria, America, Brazil. (Any choice would be fine it doesnt matter which government is under their control except America. First half of the series would be trying to prevent them from taking control of their government. Next their would be something strange occuring with the Salazar wand's tree out side of the school (I dont know what is happening yet) the Antagonist in control of the wizarding world's Government is a direct decendent of Morganne Syre. And related to Tom Marvolo Riddle and decendent of Salazar Slytherin. They are a sociopath and have been obssesed with the dark arts which led them to studie every dark wizard before them. And why they failed. He now knows how to succeed in world conquest and to purify the wizarding world. He has 1 Horocrux. He had his followers steal or retrive a copy of "Secrets of the darkest arts" from somewhere (either from Hermione or Hogwarts if its still there) Harry Potter doesnt appeat but is named drop. But Hermione does appear as Minister of Magic.


** Every idea can be good depending on how good the writing is. There are a lot of pieces of fiction that I would judge negatively reading a summary that I actually do enjoy.

Having said that; I don't think it's a good idea to make your villain related to Voldemort or Salazar Slytherin. It could work written well enough, but some ideas are so hard to pull of that they're better left alone.

And you would have to really think out why it's an young Ilvermorny student that has to stop your villain. What's sets him apart that he can actively combat a villain that seemingly has already toppled multiple governments? Especially when Hermione is right there and smart enough to notice an billionaire being in control of 99% of all magical communities. I'd keep it localised so that you don't run into the problem of readers asking why Hermione and Harry are doing nothing.

The steampunk setting sounds cool, BI POC main charachter sounds cool also. Have fun and good luck!

*** Very good points. But the reason i want to make the villab the heir to Salazar is because Tom wasnt his last decendent. There is a line of Salazar's decendents still living in America and i wanted to do a think like the skywalker saga where the main villan of the saga is always palpatine. So i thought. What if the main villan of the wizarding world is Salazar and his decendents

**** Wouldn't redemption arc for seemingly unreedimable family be more interesting? Rey was Palpatine afterall Heaping all hate on one family is kinda tacky. Wouldn't making someone unexpected a villain better? Like descendant of Godric or Helga?

***** No really. The Salazar family in my view point should never be redeemed. They're prejudice and murderers. It would be nice to finally end thst family blood line once and for all

** The plot and main ideas sound very interesting - love diverse setting - if a bit too similar to original (mainly villain - sociopath, dark magic obsession, horkrux) or Mary sue (what Salazar tree in Illvermory)

What would make or break it is your personal writing style, pacing of the story, Mysteries and reveals in good places, good grammar etc.
