So I am kinda new to reading fanfic and can be picky. What advice would you give for finding what I like. I know how to navigate AO3 pretty well and know of the major platforms. My major question is how to google for what I like better and what smaller sites are there that I might not know about?


** Another thing that i do (especially on fanfiction.net) is if I like a story i read i will check out the authors that the story author likes to see if one of their stories peeks my interest. I do the same think by looking at the story author's list of stories they like.

So i use the tags/communities to find that initial story or two and if I like that story I then check out the rest of that author's stories and then start to check out the authors and stories that the initial author liked.

** There used to be a lot more specific repositories for certain kinds of fic, and some here and there are still up and runningish (like Potions & Snitches for Severitus or Snape & Harry mentor fics), but it really just depends on what you're looking for.
