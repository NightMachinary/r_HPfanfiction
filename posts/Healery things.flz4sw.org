I'm looking for fics involving Magical Healing - potions or spellcasting. I'm mildly inspired to this by the Dykstra Shuffle scene in The Live I've Lived (link below is to chapter 17 of that fic - ie. the chapter that happens in - so be warned of being spoiled if you haven't read the fic), but yeah. I'd like to see any fics involving Magical Healing as a semi-present thing that's more than just "Episkey!" for a broken nose. Can be about actual healers, a hospital, Harry apprenticing with Madam Pomfrey, someone knowing a child in need of healing and discussing their treatments with a doctor, providing potions for healing, etc. Just anything that features healing in some decent bulk.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** linkao3(diagnosis by MaidenMotherCrone) Very enjoyable depiction of healing magic, think Grey's Anatomy but with Tomarry in st. Mungo's. Even if you won't be into the relationship aspect I'd recommend it for the healing magic, discussions of magical diseases and creatures alone.

  Harry Potter is screwed.With a penchant for Firewhiskey and late-night parties, he had no idea that he would find a handsome man in his bed the next morning, when he wakes up; already late for his first day at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies as a Healer trainee. He also had no idea that his mom's ex-boyfriend would have an axe to grind, the most eager girl would follow him around like she'd been hit with a Permanent Sticking Charm, or that the handsome man in his bed that morning was his boss, Tom Marvolo Riddle, Head of Spell Damage.Like I said, Harry Potter is screwed.

*** Sounds interesting - and eh, so long as the relationship works in the story and isn't just Death Eater and Victim weirdness, I can get into it/get past it. :)

I'm assuming it's a full AU from the summary (and not Britpicked from the 'mom' :D) as Voldemort being a Department Head in a Magical Hospital seems a mite weird. Thanks for the rec!

Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

  Something is wrong with Draco's heart. Harry is his healer, but no amount of magic is enough to cure him. Maybe there is something darker at play here. Will Harry be able to figure it out? Will he finally leave his abusive relationship? Will he be able to save the man he's falling in love with?

*** Dimension healing sounds fun. I do like a good Dimension-Hopper fic. Not sure about the other one, but I'll add it to the list to try a chapter or so. Thanks for the recs!

** Linkao3(basilisk eyes by Hegemone) this fic is huge, complicated and emotionally challenging but also the only fic I know that has acknowledged physical and mental disabilities in magical world. It's not only Harry being deaf or mute or blind (as in this case), there are several other young and old people with impairments. Very detailed process of magical therapy etc. Fantastic fic but not an easy one

  As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom . . . some gets in his eyes.
