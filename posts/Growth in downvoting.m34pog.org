Has anyone else noticed a growth in downvoting? I've just seen someone receive 12 downvotes because they disagreed with a comment on the importance of secondary school maths in tertiary education. I didn't see any disrespect or insult to the original poster, just a disagreement. My understanding is that this isn't what a downvote is for. Disagreement is supposed to be ok, I thought, insults or disrespect are not. Only the latter should be downvoted. Am I wrong?


** Not really... downvoting is kind of used for both... though it is most common that disagreement will be reflected by "not upvoting" instead of just downright downvoting. I guess is kind of like trying to have the opinion that you agree with the most be the one with the most upvotes, like a sort of democratic rating of every opinion sort of thing. It's just the way it is, in this post and all around reddit and all around the internet wherever voting exists.

*** I see.... I hate it though because enough downvotes and the comments are hidden so then the whole post can become one where there is only agreement shown like an echo chamber. I often upvote posts I actually disagree with because I think the expressed view is interesting even though I have reservations. I upvoted the anti-maths post for example, mainly because I felt sorry for the poster but also because they made a point that I thought was reasonable - even though overall I support maths

** I find that the fan bases tend to be more downvoted than other subs. Sometimes I really need to take a step back because it's sad to see people being downvoted just because they asked a question (usually the question is fairly innocent, sometimes it's badly phrased, an unpopular opinion, or just been asked about every other week) or similar. It just seems really petty.

I tend to reserve my downvotes for those who are assholes, who have absolutely no tact and don't know when to drop a subject. It's pretty rare that I give more than 5 downvotes a week unless I'm in a certain sub and seen a certain troll deliberately baiting others with their viewpoints.

** Lol yeah. There was a request for stories with a Slytherin Harry who wasn't friends with Hermione and someone suggested OP write it. Given that such stories are rare and scarce, it was a little ridiculous for them to be downvoted 26 times.

*** Obviously I don't know the entire context, but that sure sounds like an unhelpful comment that does not contribute to the discussion, which is exactly what you're "supposed" to downvote.

*** Ouch! If I was downvoted 26 times I'd probably leave this subreddit

** Downvoting is supposed to be used in situations where a comment adds nothing relevant to the discussion. Instead, people use the downvote button as a "dislike" button. Misusing the downvote button is a trend in all of reddit (although there are some subs that skew very nice in general). It happens because some people think the button is meant to be a dislike button.
