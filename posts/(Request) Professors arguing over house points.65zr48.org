Snape: "Potter! 20 points from Gryffindor!"

McGonagall: "20 points to Gryffindor"

"20 points from Gryffindor"

"20 points to Gryffindor, I can do this all day Severus."


** Just because we didn't see it, doesn't mean it didn't happen

A favourite fic of mine is "the professors point of view" - very slow to update but captures the relationship between Minerva and Severus (and the others) brilliantly

** I doubt the professors would directly undo each others' point changes, since it would undermine their authority. Rather, they might find excuses to give or take points later for something different. Like in book 5, when "Professor Sprout awarded Gryffindor twenty points when Harry passed her a watering can" to counter Umbridge.
