Are there any good fics out there where instead of Harry being sent back in time to do Hogwarts all over again, it is Draco? A Draco who is remorseful for his actions, and gets the chance to start over again?

  Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. First step: befriend Potter.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.

** There's The Mirror of Ecidyrue, which is up to part 6 (each story is a year). I really enjoyed the first one but got put off in the second because it felt like the author forgot that in his mind Draco was still 19. But I could have been being unfair so I'm suggesting it anyway.

  All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.
