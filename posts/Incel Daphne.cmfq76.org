** "Well", Voldemort said, "the ritual only specifies that the sacrifice has to be a virgin. So I guess it'd work."

** What? So like a Daphne that has a shitty personality because of which the opposite gender does not like her? Which in turn makes her hate them and herself, resulting in her posting angry things on the internet about how all males are just here to be f****d and how they should be lucky if she ever shows them even the slightest bit of attention? Never realizing that it is her shitty personality that is causing her to be, and die alone?

That kind of Incel? Because that is the usual definition these days.

**** Huh, doubt there is anything like that. The Incels that write fanfiction usually insert themselves into the main character, resulting most often in Harem fics with a super!Harry that has the charisma of Keanu Reeves and the equipment of Long Dong Silver.

** Pardon me if I'm out of the loop, but do female incels even exist? Because this is literally the first time I've heard of them.

  A slightly more vindictive, studious Harry. A slightly more stubborn Hermione. A complete destruction of fanon!Daphne.
