I bet no-one's ever sent Firenze back in time before as the start to a Peggy Sue fanfic.

Unfortunately, there's not many events to build on involving Firenze in canon; he saves Harry from Voldemort once, later reappears as a divination teacher, and stays in the background for the rest of the series.

Still, a case could be made for him coming back. You could say that he comes from a Cursed-Child style bad future, or that he foresaw that after the Voldemort war, something worse was coming and Magical Britain was too damaged to stop it, or et-cetera.

One inventive thing that could be done with him; a character who doesn't use a wand. He'd have to rely on his powers of divination, with the occasional potion and ritual, and if he got into a duel, a bow and arrows.

And also, the story could include stuff on rights of non-humans.


** I could see something interesting being done with Firenze if it was in a Nozdormu like fashion. He foresees some great cataclysmic event involving himself, and does everything in his power to prevent that from happening, yet in the end, he meddling with the timeline is ultimately the cause of that event.

** Now that I think about it I don't think I've seen an Umbridge time travel fic. It probably has been done though.

***** Mmm. Perhaps this time-travelling Umbridge could be a good soul who hates the depths of corruption that her other selves have sunk to.
