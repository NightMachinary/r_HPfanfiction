** If I could give some advice:

- Don't tell people that your story will suck, that you think it will suck, or that you're not sure where you're taking the plot (this often happens in stories where the author says it might suck).

- Try to not simply insert the character as a fourth member of the trio (whether that be the main trio or Ginny, Neville, and Luna) who tags along for the canon adventures. If possible, try to switch things up instead of going strictly canon.

- Spellcheck as much as you can, even if it's just pasting your chapter into Microsoft Word or Grammarly before moving it over to the site.

- It's preferable to prioritise Fanfiction(dot)net, AO3, and perhaps Wattpad over other sites for your stories.

- Some people might prefer that you 'Britpick' your writing whenever you can, though it's OK if the occasional Americanism or two shows up as well. Just make sure the characters don't use $$$ in the UK or use expressions like 'dime a dozen' often.

- Don't get intimidated by flaming/troll/destructive-criticism reviews. It's almost impossible to avoid them, especially on FFNet (AO3 allows you to disable comments, at least).

- If possible, try to have at least 2000 to 3000 words per chapter.

- Make sure to check your spacing (especially between paragraphs) prior to publishing your chapters, as I know certain sites can sometimes mess up the formatting (especially when copying over from Google Docs).

- Try not to overuse exclamation marks and italics in the writing. They tend to stand out or are more effective when used sparingly.

- Don't overdo flashbacks. Use them sparingly and keep them short. The same goes for dream sequences.

- Don't be scared of tropes. Yes, some are 'bad' and people get tired of seeing them, but it's impossible to write a story without using tropes (because doing so is a trope in itself). For example, if you want to use the Lords and Ladies thing, then fine, though I'd suggest seeing where other fics often go wrong with them.

- If you boost the 'good guys' (i.e., your OC has incredible talent, etc.), then try to give some improvements to the other side as well (which is often not done in super-powerful-main-character stories). It doesn't have to be exactly level between all sides, but some readers do tend to get tired of seeing the same-old incredible OC who faces little to no challenges.

- Enjoy the story, and don't feel pressured to update your fic in order to please your readers, especially if you're too busy.

** First off: no one gets to be a good writer without being a bad writer first. It takes time and practice, just like playing an instrument! Keep going.

Secondly, just because something seems boring or terrible to you about your writing, doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad. You've read it 100 times so it's going sound bad. Keep going, and write anyway.

Thirdly, confidence is key. Don't tell yourself and other people that your writing is bad, or you might start to believe it and become discouraged. You'll never become a better writer if you sabotage yourself with doubts. So keep writing!

Lastly, even if the story sucks or it never gets published, so still wrote the damn thing. You were vulnerable and shared a bit of the largeness in your soul with the world. That takes a lot of guts and should be commended. You should be proud of your accomplishment. For your next story, keep writing, and it will be better than the first!
