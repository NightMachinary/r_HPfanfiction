Like if a Blast-ended Skrewt started attacking a group of people, Harry, instead of panicking, gets excited and runs towards the beast to kill it.

/With blood splattered on his hands and face, he starts laughing like a madman while casually strolling away from the butchered beast, leaving behind the terrified and stunned bystanders./

Not psychopathic or evil per say, but getting a tad bit too excited/weird. Harry is pretty intimidating and powerful when fighting.

For example: Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) - Harry slaughters the creatures in the 3rd task and lies down on the grass laughing. Spectators are just watching on, stunned. He's also pretty powerful in this fic.


** Dude, the fic you want is Linkffn(Circular Reasoning by Swimdraconian). It is EXACTLY what you're looking for. Just read the first chapter and you'll understand what I mean. Seriously. Read it.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
