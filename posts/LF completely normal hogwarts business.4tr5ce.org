Hey, I'm having trouble finding one genre of fan fiction: the kind that is absolutely normal book stuff, just /more/ of it.

My favorite stuff in the series is the classes and the jokes people make and the interpersonal relationships of the students of Hogwarts. I love the day to day.

Is there any fanfiction that does for a Harry Potter book what the Extended Editions do for The Lord of the Rings films? That is to say, same Harry Potter series we know and love, but with more conversations and pointless details and stuff that has nothing to do with the plot?


** linkffn(3124159)

This seems to be what you want, although focusing on the Minerva McGonagall and the faculty, rather than any of the students.

Well written and funny.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

*** In addition to "Slice of Life", make sure to look for "Missing Moments" fics, which basically try to pencil in the things JK omitted. You might also have more luck on livejournal or any of the older sites than on fanfiction.net, because it seems to be a waning genre.

If you like R/Hr, I would be remiss to not recommend linkffn(Biscuits: A Love Story by Pinky Brown) and linkffn(Six Foot of Ginger Idiot by Pinky Brown)

Good luck!

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway, miraculously still alive. Even so, the question of how remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

** I'd recommend linkffn(11923164) for a platonic relationship between Luna and Snape. I think they did a good job writing both characters and the details were interesting. It's also rare to read them together.

I recommend linkffn(8461800) for a Colin Creevey missing moment. It's sad.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
