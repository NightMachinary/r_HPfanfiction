Hello, I'm looking for a Harry Potter/Hobbit crossover story. There are really only 2 scenes I remember and I'm not even sure they are from the same story. One is Harry figures out how to make a basic pipe bomb out of different things in Erabor and gets Smaug to swallow it. Dragons may be armored on the outside, but the inside is a different story. The other one is during the Battle of the Five Army's he takes Gandalf's staff and the Arkenstone (which I believe he thought was actually a Silmarillion) and uses it to just grow a forest to kill all the orcs and such. I know in the second story Harry was reincarnated a female hobbit, and I think it was the same in the first story as well. Any help would be awesome in finding these or this story!


** I'm pretty sure those are two different stories, but the second one is Fate be Changed by Araceil. The author has taken it down from ffn, but you may be able to find a copy on a fic archiving website.
