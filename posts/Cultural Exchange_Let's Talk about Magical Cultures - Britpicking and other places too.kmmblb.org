So, we haven't had a good Britpicking thread in a while and I've seen the topic come up a few times over the last couple of weeks. Figured it might be good to have another 'Q&A with the Brits' thread for people to ask questions and provide information about whatever people wanna know.

Also thought it might be fun to extend this thread out to other cultures too! Do you wanna set a fic in Magical France and have questions about the setting? Or Magical America? Or Magical Mali or wherever else! Then please, ask! Even if nobody here is from that place, maybe we know some stuff or can point you in the right direction. :)

Let's get some cultural exchanges going, people. :)


** If anybody has a fic involving India I would be more than happy to help with the setting and would love to check it out.

*** A fic set in India would be amazing. The potential is huge - ritual magic, Vedic magic (See: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvaveda#Contents][Atharva Veda]]), Sanskrit used in runes and fanonical Warding and so on...

I'm struggling to come up with the main premise tho.

Muggle mexicans mostly wear sombreros in rural areas or typical folk music dances. They are great to cover from the sun.

Again, mostly in rural areas, but some cities use them for typical folk dances though they are different kind of sombreros. Rural sombreros are more practical. Sombreros in the southeast, near Cancun, are usually smaller. Sombreros in the north are more inspired on texas cowboy hats. Even in some cities people would wear them indoor or at night for dancing at regional concerts.

That being said there is a difference between the Provos and the IRA that belonged to the Republic, involving Michael Collins, De Valera etc. Irish rebel songs like Oro 'Se do bheatha abhaile and Come Out ye Black and Tans are pretty popular singing.

I always imagined Seamus as being from the Republic.

** One thing I would really like to see is a realistic portrayal of how world events shaped magical cultures outside of Europe. If we assume that by the times of the books, outside of maybe a few tribes the muggle and magical world have separated, then why did that happen, when and what does that make the magical country look like.

Take the US. The European Statute of Secrecy was at the end of the 17th century, about the time that large-scale emigration from Britain to the US started. Given by this point the societies are separate, and Magical Britain already seems to be scattered small communities with minimal government oversight, then none of the reasons Europeans moved to the US seem valid for magicals. They don't have to worry about muggle religious conflicts or wars or the Irish potato famine. Bare in mind that in canon the magicals seemed to completely ignore both the World Wars. So unless you come up with your own justification, most white magicals in the US must have come from a few generations worth of muggleborn.

In contrast the magical Native Americans would have had a far better survival rate than their muggle cousins, even if they had stayed with them and suffered through the same pandemics and genocides. So logically the magical world in the area of muggle USA should be mostly dominated by Native Americans and muggleborn or recently muggleborn immigrant descendants. Then you have were magical Africans able to avoid slavery and transport to the US, or was the slave trade muggle and magical. While much of this can be chosen by the author as there are no right or wrong answers, especially when the personal preferences of influential figures can change things, there is far more depth and 'what-if' than Rowling has in her 'same as our world but magical' approach.

** Can I ask about the word "pavement?"

I wanted to use the word "sidewalk," but I had a suspicion in the back of my mind that that's a North American word. Google told me that in British English, the word is "pavement." But to an American, "pavement" is the surface of the street (or any paved area).

In British English, does "pavement" only mean "the path beside the street on which people walk?" Is there another word for "surface of the street," or pavement in the American sense?

(I ended up completely rewriting that section of the story because I knew using the word "sidewalk" was wrong, but in my American mind "pavement" seemed to say the opposite of what I wanted to say. And I suspect it would have been a problem for my American readers too!)

*** Pavement is the word we use for the Pedestrian footpath that runs parallel to the road.You can also just call it the path. People will get what you mean. The surface of the road is called the ‘Tarmac' at least where I'm from (Glasgow, Scotland) because it was, at least historically made of Tarmacadam. Nowadays, any macadamised material is used as far as I know. It may not be actually Tarmac but it's still called that.

So for instance, if someone has a crash or other accident and is flung clear of the vehicle, and hits the road, we say they either ‘hit the tarmac' or they just ‘hit the road'. If at speed it can be ‘He hit the Tarmac at x mph and slid, fuckin' nothin' left o' him by the end o' it'.

*** Yep! Pavement = Sidewalk! Used exactly the same way - it's the paved side of the road that folks walk on. Interesting tidbit - sidewalk is actually the older term and you'll find it in Shakespeare and other similarly aged works. It was part of the language the traveled before the languages split to British English and American English!

*** Pavement is indeed the British version of Sidewalk, yeah. Sidewalk is very American-sounding, even if it isn't American itself.

In terms of the 'surface of the street', it'd depend on the material. There's a lot more variety in what our roads are made of (since they've been built, rebuilt, removed, added to, and maintained in one form or another for centuries), so we have a lot more variety in how we refer to them. We might have cobbles (the floor of Diagon in the movies) or tarmac (the bitty-looking black sludge that most roads are lined with, but it's also used generally for most paved roads) or a few other things as well that I forget atm (I think 'slabs' or 'paving' for big paving stones was popular at one point, but I'm not sure if I'm imagining that or not). Hell, there are specific names for types of country roads as well. Also, the little glowy reflectors in the centre lines of bigger roads are called 'Cats Eyes'. Not sure what they might be called in the US (or if they even exist) but they're a thing here.

If you're saying it in a "Walk on the pavement, not in the street, you utter moron" sense, it'd definitely be pavement regardless of material, though I have heard some mothers in my northern town yelling "Stay at the side of the road" at their children as well.

**** I'm not sure I've ever seen concrete paving slabs used in making roads. As part of my N5 Geography, we had to take a trip down south to Malhamdale, mostly to visit Limestone features, also filming location of DH, but we got to visit a quarry, on a blasting day no less, which produced Millstone Grit, which they put in a lot of the road surfaces. They tends to mix in aggregate materials these days. Makes the surface harder wearing

** There is something I'd like to address. I've seen a lot of authors refer to ‘Europe' as crowded. Its really not. The populations across Europe are dense. Densely populated into relatively few cities, but rurality is very easy to find and you don't actually have to go far. Take Scotland, ~70% of the population lives in the Central Belt, around Glasgow and Edinburgh. I live on the west coast, and I can drive for half an hour from my house and be in the arse end of nowhere. Hell, I can walk 15 minutes from my house, and be in miles of vast hills and moorland that will kill you if given the chance. The vast majority of the Gàidhealtachd (Highlands) and Southern Uplands are deserted. It's similar in Ireland, Wales and the Nordic Countries.

I've noticed a lot of assumption that Europe and the US are roughly equivalent (The old "I'm going to Europe!" telling you absolutely nothing useful thing :D) and the same underlying stuff applies. Like that idea that it's normal-ish in the US to go drive three hours for a special event (a concert or a family get-together or a camp-out or whatever) without necessarily leaving the state, but in Europe, driving three hours is pretty much enough to get you to a new country.

When it comes to travel times up here, they can be long, not because the distance is long, but because the Infrastructure doesn't support high speed travel. This is where it gets complicated. Nobody wants a Motorway built over the A82, it would ruin the ecology and the way of life for the people up there, but they want infrastructure links.\\
