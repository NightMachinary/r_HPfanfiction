Does anyone know of any stories that feature a ghost James or ghost Lily? I'm imagining Lily "waking up" as a ghost a few years after her death, then finding Harry and haunting Petunia because she hasn't been treating Harry very well. Anyone seen a story like that (not necessarily that story line, but with ghost!Lily/James)?
