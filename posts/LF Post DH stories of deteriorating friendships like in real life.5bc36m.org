It's not unbelievable to say one of the Trio would (immaturely) begin to resent the others when the time they spend with each other is diminished due to a pairing in the group. Any character driven stories where this kind of thing happens? It could even be slash (though I'll still skip explicit scenes) where Hermione is rather pissed that Ron and Harry are too busy with each other to make time for her, among other issues, or it could simply be growing up and growing apart.

Really, I just need to read stories of people growing apart and any(if at all) resentment for it. You know, life stuff.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]]) fits the bill, IIRC.

*** I'm reading this now, or rather slogging through it, and I absolutely detest the characterization of Harry. He's a hot-headed, marauder-worshipping, apologistic fucking idiot. It's actually funny.

** Not a big fan of this as both Harry and Daphne seem like awful people but it does feature the trio growing apart. Ron and Hermione are too busy for Harry. linkffn(6257522)

** Well, linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) doesn't have resentment, but definitely the trio's relationship falling apart.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** That's a fairly big part of the plot in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4787480][Golden Age]]. It's one of the best Hufflepuff-centric stories I've read and the slash is really mild and not propelling the plot at all. Linkao3(4787480)

  The Celtic druids once made a decision that kept magic in abundance in Britannia, but they couldn't account for the technological advances Muggles would make centuries later. Now magic is dying on the isles, and this is not a dark lord that Harry can fight. OR: Harry Potter doesn't save the world this time, but he does get a lot of hugs.
