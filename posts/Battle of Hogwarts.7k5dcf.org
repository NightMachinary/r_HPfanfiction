We've seen the power of house elves when Dobby beat Lucius at the end of CoS. If Hogwarts has a large amount of them would they have been able to drastically change the result of the Battle if they'd been ordered to defend the castle?


** I'm not sure that it matters that they were ordered, but the House Elves /did/ come out to defend the castle.

#+begin_quote
  The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the Entrance Hall, screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head, the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din: â€˜Fight! Fight! Fight for my master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of brave Regulus! Fight!' They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice.

*** But they didn't fight like Dobby. No magically smashing Death Eaters around. Just slashing at their ankles and shins. Hordes of elves curbstomping the Death Eaters would have derailed the plot, I guess.

**** The interesting thing about that is that it never happens ever again in canon. Even in places where being OP wouldn't have mattered. For instance, Kreacher bashes Mudungus with a pan (which is super hilarious).

Dobby, on the other hand, under no orders from anybody whatsoever, was enchanting objects, blocking off presumably super powerful enchantments (Platform 9^{3/4} ), and then banishing Lucius.

Almost makes you wonder if Dobby was just special.

******* The same reason why no one bothered to apparate to Russia, exchange golden coins for weapons and man the walls with machine guns. It would make the entire struggle pointless if you can just blast the bad guys from 500 yards away, be it with house-elf magic or AK-47s.

***** I definitely believe Dobby was a magical prodigy by elvish standards (I mean Snape-level, and he could have reached Dumbledore heights with a wand had he lived). Not that he had powers others didn't have in theory, but he was a /much/ better caster than others.

***** Well, he was "different" in his desire to be the master of his own destiny. He could have been neurologically atypical for a house elf. Or they could be so conditioned by the generations of persecution that followed using magic against Wizards that in the heat of the moment it just didn't occur to them.

***** My headcanon is that House Elves can't use magic against humans, but for Dubby it was personal. When he saw that Lucius Malfoy was going to attack Harry, the one human that treated Dobby nicely and with respect; something that Dobby wasn't used to his emotions likely got the better of him and before he could think things through ended up attacking Lucius Malfoy with magic, of course there's no evidence to support that it's illegal for a House Elf to use magic against a human, that's just my personal headcanon there.

**** It's never canonically stated that House-Elves "unlock" abilities that help them carry out orders.

The closest thing to that would be when Kreacher explains that he apparated back home "because Master told him to". But it's not as if he couldn't otherwise disapparate, it was just that his desire to fulfill the order overcame his distress of the potion guarding the horcrux.

** Hmm...well, I wouldn't say they're exceptionally powerful; not necessarily more powerful than a regular wizard, and I think a combat-trained wizard could stand against them pretty well.

But house-elves have the advantage of being able to Apparate around Hogwarts where nobody else can, and they can bring others with them; they could help a lot in moving innocents and injured people out of danger, defenders to more advantageous positions, and team up to pick off any attackers who end up on their own.

Of course, it wouldn't necessarily be ethical to order them to defend the castle; in Deathly Hallows when the battle takes place, Ron actually remembers about the house-elves and considers that they should be ordered to evacuate, not fight. That said, the elves do burst in in the second part of the fight, packing steak knives and cleavers to boot, and they definitely help to overwhelm the Death Eaters then.

*** Correct me if I'm wrong as it's been several years since I last read the canon novels but wouldn't the anti-apparition charms/wards have collapsed after Voldemort and co. broke through Hogwarts' protective enchantments?

I feel as if though Dobby, perhaps due to plot reasons, was given better treatment in regards to magical proficiency than other house-elves (a plot point I'm focusing on in a fic I've been planning to write) and shouldn't be used as a baseline for other house-elves.

**** That's a fair point; we don't see Kreacher doing much in the way of useful magic. And when the elves attack in the end of Deathly Hallows, they use melee weapons instead of magical attacks.

***** I've had this really strange fan-theory for a while now revolving around house-elves and where they came from. I was originally going to write my entire theory but that would have taken quite some time so long story short, I actually believe that house-elves (or at least the majority of them) are the progeny of ancient dark wizards who were condemned to a life of servitude in order to atone for their many sins. Whatever the case may be, I firmly believe that house-elves were artificially made as what creature would possibly evolve in such a way as to be tied to another in such a subservient and inescapable role.

Much like other things in the HP universe, most spells and branches of magic were created quite some time ago. There must have been occasions where a wizard was able to escape imprisonment much like Sirius did thanks to his animagus abilities. No prison is ever truly inescapable. Thus, it would only make sense for ancient wizards to devise a new way to punish those like Voldemort and what better way but to disfigure them and turn them into creatures of servitude? I would like to think of Dobby as a recently turned house-elf who thanks to his former prowess in magic as a wizard, is able to fight off the curse much like how Harry fights off the imperio. This contributes to Dobby not only acting erratic, but it also accounts for his magical prowess.

** Now that I think of it, the house elves really should have made a big difference. From what we know of their magic, they could have decisively won if they'd just used it instead of waiting until the end of the battle to rush the Death Eaters with knives and cleavers.

*** You're thinking like a Muggle. Stop.

Seriously though. Most wizards overlook houselves, even better people like McGonagall. It's people like Harry, Hermione, and Dumbledore that notice them.

From the elves' point of view, their masters are fighting each other. It's only when Kreacher arrives to galvanize them into protecting Hogwarts that they realize that they are allowed to fight.

** If I recall correctly, Dobby didn't so much beat Malfoy as blindside him. From what I remember we never saw a 'fair' fight between house elf and wizard. I don't know if I count the example you cited as convincing enough for me to deem house elves powerful in a combat sense. It is undeniable that their magic is slightly different and effective but is it effective due to power or the fact they're always overlooked?

** My thoughts are that since house elves serve wizards/witches it might be hard for them to defend with real elf magic because it may cause serious harm to a wizard/witch . I'd like to think that it took time for Kreacher to rally the the elves together. They also only used knives to attack ankles and shins of Death Eaters (I am assuming non lethal areas). Even though Dobby was extremely loyal to Harry he only meant to stop Lucius, and Bellatrix as well later on, and not cause serious harm to them (Even though I think most of us would have loved to see the little guy getting rid of her permanently). Just a thought.
