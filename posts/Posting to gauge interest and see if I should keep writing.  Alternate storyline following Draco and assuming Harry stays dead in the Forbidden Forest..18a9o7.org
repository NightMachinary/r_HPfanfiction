Draco sat alone in a small alcove along the staircase leading up to the top of the astronomy tower. He could hear the hustle and chatter of the people below, working to move the bodies of the dead inside and rebuild some of the broken defensive charms. “Pointless” he felt. The dead are dead and there were so many holes broken in the defenses that they'd be better off working on an offensive strategy than building up a wall that could be taken down in an instant.

For Draco, though, this was not where his focus was. He was watching the tree line of the forbidden forest and calculating. He put himself in Potter's shoes and calculated his options. Would he give in the Dark Lord's demand and sacrifice himself for his friends? Draco thought he would. Potter was very weak when it came to his friends, and if he didn't sacrifice himself than the Dark Lord would catch up to him eventually.

Draco put the odds on Potter making the sacrifice and put that aside in his mind, shifting focus to the Dark Lord. He hated the man, but refused to let that cloud his mind. The Dark Lord was the best he knew when he came to strategy and calculation. And yet the Dark Lord had his own emotional weakness, the opposite of Potter's. The Dark Lord was prone to his own rage; and was often not in control. At this point though, Draco couldn't see this weakness coming into play. The Dark Lord was in control, no matter Potter's choice. Right now Draco could not see a realistic way in which the Dark Lord could lose this battle. He had the tactical advantage, and the power. One rarely loses in that situation, especially not one as powerful as Him.

Someone was coming up the stairs, Draco kept one eye on the tree line as he watched a couple of Ravenclaws, Michael Corner and a boy he didn't know the name of, go by on their way to the top of the tower. Draco gripped his mother's wand tightly inside his cloak, ready to defend himself should they decide to attack. If they wanted to pick a fight with him, he could probably taken them, but he'd rather not fight anyone right now. Even if he won others would hear, and upon seeing him having taken down a couple Ravenclaws he'd be finished. His only immunity right now was that he had not retreated to the forest with the rest of the Dark Lord's followers and that that Potter had chosen to save him from the Room of Requirement. The two Ravenclaws gave him a suspicious look as they passed but did nothing, Draco relaxed and went back to calculating.

Potter had saved him, that was a mark against him for the Dark Lord, as was his failure to retreat to the forest. He would not likely be killed for this after the Dark Lord had won, but he may be tortured... again. Draco focused on his mother and father. The entire Malfoy family had been tortured again and again by the Dark Lord in their home. For mistakes they made, for wrong answers they gave, or simply because the Dark Lord needed to relieve some stress and did so by torturing one of them. Experiencing the white hot pain for the Cruciatus Curse time and again in no way made it any easier the next time, and seeing his mother be tortured while he sat uselessly by was even worse. The pain was great, and the hatred for the Dark Lord ran deep. He was thankful that he had learned occlumency, it was the only way to hide his true feelings around the Dark Lord. Draco wanted him dead, but could not calculate any situations which put the odds in his favor. The Dark Lord was more powerful than him, constantly surrounded by allies, and to build the hate it took to complete the killing curse he'd have to break his disciplined occlumency; and there was no way the Dark Lord couldn't feel that coming. He was constantly in everyone else's minds, all around him, searching for a hint of disloyalty. And then there was Nagini.

The Dark Lord's snake was different, and everyone who had been in their presence together knew that very well. Draco could feel that something was off about Nagini right from the beginning, but it was the kind of thing that no one could put their finger on. Unnatural, was the only way to put it. The Dark Lord spoke to the snake in its language, which no one else could understand. And it was a project Draco started months ago, for his own sake. It was a way to slake the rebellious desires he held for the Dark Lord without openly defying Him. Draco began trying to understand parseltongue.

Draco would pay close attention to every conversation Nagini and the Dark Lord had around him, and later on his own pull his own memory into his father's pensieve for review. Painstaking as it was to decipher the differences in hisses, Draco would write down every version he could and then translate them using a book he stole from his father's study. Draco would write and compare with the memory over and over again until what he had translate made sense in the context of the memory. Hours and hours he had spent working with the same feverish work ethic he had used to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts the year before and eventually he had cracked the code, able to distinguish between the syllables as he heard them and able to translate them pretty quickly later on. He was nearly at the point of being able to understand the language as he heard it. It was a rebellious project that sustained his desire to fight the Dark Lord without risking his life in doing so. What he found, however, was disheartening.

The Dark Lord called the snake words that could be translated in a few different ways, “my blood”, “my descendent”, “my child”, “a part of me” and so forth. For the longest time Draco had translated this to mean “my blood”, as the Dark Lord identified himself so strongly with snakes and loved this snake in particular; that it made sense he would call it “my blood”. But why this snake? It had to be more. The more Draco had calculated the more he knew that to be true. He figured, with almost absolute certainty, that the Dark Lord had somehow shared his soul with his snake. The Dark Lord had once said to the snake that He “could not die, as long as you live”. Draco thought about what this could mean for weeks. The Dark Lord was not exactly poetic, and rarely spoke in metaphor. Especially to Nagini, who he spoke openly and directly to. Having the confidence that none of His followers could understand them, the Dark Lord never spoke in code to the snake. Draco was as confident as he could be without the Dark Lord telling him Himself: He had shared His soul with the snake Nagini and would not be killed as long as the snake didn't die as well.

Draco watched the tree line and brooded over this unfortunate fact. Even if he were able to somehow find advantage over the Dark Lord by careful planning or element of surprise, He would find a way to be reborn again. This too, was in Draco's calculations. He did not like being on the side of the Dark Lord, he loathed it and he loathed the Dark Lord himself; but he saw no logical options otherwise. The Dark Lord could not lose. Potter would die just as Dumbledore did, and the Dark Lord would rise to complete and total power. He may not like it, but those were the odds. So unless Potter found some way to kill the Dark Lord in the forbidden forest, or at least the snake, he was resigned to rejoin his parents and the Dark Lord. His family may not be held in the highest of honor, and he may be tortured for his lack of complete loyalty, but they would all survive. And a pureblood family in the Dark Lord's reign was much better off than many, at least.

Draco again clenched his mother's wand as a flash of green light illuminated some trees off in the distance. A few moments of darkness was followed by dozens of spells fired into the air. He allowed his cold gray eyes to linger for a few moments on the darkness of the trees. A death and a celebration. The Dark Lord and his followers would be heading to the castle and Draco would be expected to rejoin them. With a hardened resolve Draco sighed and left his alcove, descending the stairs of the astronomy tower to rejoin the master he loathed; and to survive to fight another day.


** I like it very much. It's an intriguing idea. If I had a suggestion to make, it would be that you're narrating a huge, interesting part of the story (Draco teaching himself to understand parseltongue--a monumental task, practically impossible, I imagine). I wonder whether that might even be fleshed out through several chapters, after using the scene of Draco in the tower as a prologue?

I've worked as an editor, so I tend to spout ideas and suggestions. Feel free to ignore me, but as I said, I think you've got several interesting chapters/a good story arc buried right here and turned into exposition. Why not use it rather than tell us about it?
