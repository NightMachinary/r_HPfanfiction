So looking for some fics where Harry is fairly powerful but not like, trope filled ones with wild diagon alley trips where he is lord of hogwarts and such. Like, a well written story where Harry is a powerful character. 40k+ words a must(but more the merrier), I don't mind completed or regularly updated but pls no abandoned. Recently read Dance with Death and Casting Shadows. Also read Prince of Syltherin.


** Blindness by AngelaStarCat is a fic like that. Harry is blind so the wizards think he can't do magic but he can and he's super powerful. Like he can kill people by looking at them powerful. Definitely recommend

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

** Linkffn(A New Better Life by Ulltima101) it's my own story. I'm wrapping up first year right now maybe 2 chapters left ending the story at maybe 60K words or so.

Harry is powerful more so than his peers and even Dumbledore and Voldemort point it out to him.

My posting schedule alternates week by week. One week I write My Hero Academia and the other I write Harry Potter. Before i finish the Harry Potter story I'm planning on going back and fixing all the little mistakes so when the story does finish it will be completely done.

  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione. Smartish!Harry, Grey!Harry, (multiple normal relationships Harry ) Good!Dumbledore, Rival!Draco. Adult content later
