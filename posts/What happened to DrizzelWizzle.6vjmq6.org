***** yh but he even says i'll update as usual in his last chapter whcih was posted last july. I honestly don't get why someone who was already ping fanfcition as a hobby on the side would suddenly stop after this much effort. his profile hasn't been updated in a year and someone in the reviews thinks hes dead. does any1 know. it's such a good series and so long

****** Again, Life happens. Fanfiction is a hobby. Sometimes you just can't continue. Maybe he lost passion in writing, maybe he got into an accident, maybe he changed work location/hours. If you don't pay him, you can't blame him.

** I've really enjoyed that series and am bummed that it hasn't been updated in a long time. But sometimes things come up. I still am glad to have read what the author already wrote.
