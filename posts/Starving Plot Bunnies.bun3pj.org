I'm sure other people have the same problem as I do in that my plot bunnies are starving. I have about a half dozen plots that I think have wonderful potential that I would love to see progress past the few chapters I have of them, but I'm just not getting anywhere. I've been sitting on some of these for years now.

Sometimes I feel like I should release them into the world as prompts to see what others could make of them, but I also feel possessive of them you know? Like what if I release it as a prompt and no one cares about my idea, or they do it badly. What do you guys do when you have a plot idea that you worry you personally can't ever do justice too?


** Oh, wow, that sounds incredibly familiar. I'm the same way. I haven't done this myself yet, but have you considered just posting a few of the longer ones or the better ones? Maybe with people's feedback and interested readers, or just the mild pressure of holding yourself to an update schedule, you'll get inspired to continue.

Alternatively, maybe if you release the prompts and see someone execute one poorly, you'll get angry enough to finish your version out of spite lol

** I know a few people post what they have as a series on AO3. Maybe you could do something like that if you're comfortable making them public.

You might get someone asking to take an idea and run with it or someone might comment something that makes you write 10,000 words in a week.

** It's quite common for people to put their Plot Bunnies in collections for others to peruse. I myself have three such collections on FFN, one for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10280808/1/Little-Whinging-Pet-Shop][HP concepts]], one for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9854265/1/Konoha-s-Pet-Shop][Naruto concepts]] and a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11003041/1/Plot-Bunny-Ranch][Miscellaneous Folder]] (mainly Worm).

I can also direct you to a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Konoha-s-Magical-Pet-Store/111879/99/1/1/0/0/0/0/][collection]] for HP and Naruto Plot Bunny collections.

As for the utility of the folders, a few of the one-shots have been adopted by others and I have also managed to expand a few of them enough that they are proper stories.

It's also satisfying to get a concept nailed down enough that the potential for future expansion is no longer a pipe dream.

** If you ever want someone to bounce ideas off of without making them public, feel free to DM me. I promise I am a very poor writer and will not be stealing from anyone, but perhaps another perspective could be helpful.

** Try to clarify the difference between plot and idea. An idea might be, Daphne Greengrass took NEWT history of magic and post war finds herself the country's foremost expert on goblin rebellions so is asked to clear up the mess between Harry and Gringotts by the Ministry.

I think it's a fun idea but, how does it go? Does Daphne say yes, why would she say yes? Does it all work out in the end? Perhaps she's doing it because she wants to brag to Pansy. I need conflict, stories are about conflict, it doesn't have to be saving the world level but I need people opposing my protagonist to make things interesting. Daphne and Pansy being gossips and finding out why Harry did what he did is bad for Harry but can she do her job for the ministry without knowing?

Now I need to give my characters motives, they need to work in their own best interests and have the conflicts between their motives form the meat of the story. Between the ministry offer, potential gossip, maybe even selling the story to the Prophet I have given motive to Daphne to take the job. Harry wants all the mess over as soon as possible. The Ministry want their hero's name cleared. Gringotts wants Harry's head. The Prophet wants all the news it can get. Hopefully you can see how the story could work but I still haven't decided how it's actually going to happen, what am I working towards?

Perhaps to help me there I need to pick a theme. Love conquers all, something about friends maybe, be careful when you fight monsters you don't become on etc. I always felt the series ended too cleanly, I want compromise and reconciliation as a part of my story. The world has changed and I want my characters to change too. I also want a bit of a mess, the war will have left signs and I want them there.

How to tie it all together now? How does my ending look? Does Daphne get Harry away from Gringotts, yes but compromise and reconciliation. Harry will become a curse breaker for Gringotts for a period of no less than ten years. Does Daphne get her gossip? Compromise and reconciliation no but she gets Harry himself. Pure blood Slytherin and Harry Potter showing the world that they can move on from the past. It. Does the Ministry get what they want? Ish, Harry isn't in danger but he can't work for them.

Now, I could start writing I suppose or I could work out a few key moments, plan a few scenes built a timeline or one of a hundred other planning devices. Some people plan more than others. Some find plans stifling, too much planning kills their creativity. I often over plan but I means I always know what I could write if I just sat down and did it. If in doubt build your character's motivations and background, what do they want out of every situation and how to they go about getting it? Are they direct, sneaky, blunt, dishonest etc. What would it take for them to change and grow?

*** Completely agree, but I have conceptualized it a bit differently (and [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][I wrote]] about it), and I think there is never enough written about it.

There is a difference between plot and exposition. There are zillion of stories on FFnet, AO3 etc. with just exposition without any plot. “Dudley's daughter turns out to be a witch” is the one. There are two chapters of it, in the first one Dudley and his loving wife find out (BTW, why always a daughter, I have never found a story where they would have a son?), Dudley has something close to a cardiac arrest, in the second chapter Harry is called first time in ten years to save the day, and there is no third chapter. BTW, why are parents of magical child always loving? Why there are not that many divorced or fighting couples as parents (McGonagall coming to the house in between flying utensils)? One thing I like about otherwise frustrating in many aspects linkffn(7211094) is that Dudley is divorced and his kids in Hogwarts have to navigate between two quite fighting parents.

That could be a good exposition, but what is the plot of the story? OK, so Daisy Dursley (nothing against flowerly names, I like that) gets to Hogwarts, and then what? *THIS* is the place where actual story is supposed to start, because now The Big Bad Wolf should turn up and she has to find out she has to fight (perhaps not literally) for Her Prize (what is it?). Only now the rubber meets the proverbial road and we will found what the author writes about. Except in zillion of cases the author never got there. Sad.

  Harry and Dudley learn about their muggle grandparents, and the struggles they faced while facing challenges of their own. Rated M for serious issues.
