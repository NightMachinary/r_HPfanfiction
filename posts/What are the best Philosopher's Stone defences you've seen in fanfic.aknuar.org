I feel like there's a lot of room for imagination and badassery here, rather than sticking to the canon rooms. What have you seen?


** A Fidelius on a box within Dumbledore's office with Dumbledore as the secret keeper. There should be no better defence than that.

It was never implemented, but the lack of such measures is quite often a "proof" for Dumbledore setting up a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.

*** I don't know about a confrontation with Harry, but it was definitely a trap for Voldemort, the fact is he would never have gotten past the mirror if he was alone, and Dumbledore would have been able to face him in person. The other obstacles were to keep up appearances, and in Fluffy's case keep children out (the vulnerability to music is clearly not common knowledge, since neither Quirrel nor Riddle knew it and they apparently couldn't just go look it up in the library), note that when the trio enter the room they have little trouble escaping.

**** I think it was linkffn(Dodging prison and stealing witches) where it was used. Just remember an awful lot of fidelius use with a fairly complicated theory behind it. And the fidelius was also heavily used in getting to the stone

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9264843/1/Harry-Tano][Harry Tano]], the rooms are still generally canon (the first room is an illusion of a collapsing ceiling instead of Fluffy), but they're located in the South-west Tower instead of the Third Floor, with the rooms going up vertically and the Mirror in the top room.

How this differs is not the rooms themselves, but the way that the two separate groups approach the tasks simultaneously. The first group (including Quirrel) go up through the rooms with liberal usage of the Bombarda charm (/the universal door-unlocker and obstacle remover/). In the flame-room, they use it so that instead of one going through the flames to reach the stairs, they go through the ceiling.

The second group fly to the topmost window (using non-broom transportation to avoid the anti-broom Ward) and simply steal the mirror (and the stone within) while the first group are ascending through the rooms.

** My personal favourite isn't the most exciting or challenging example, but Professor Snape's challenge room in HPMOR is a pretty effective stalling method.

To pass through the room (maybe the dark flames were still there) one had to brew a relatively simple potion that required long pauses between added ingredients. All of the necessary tools and ingredients are in the room along with a recipe for the required potion.

A first-year could probably do it. Voldemort could probably do it in his /sleep/, but Voldemort can't do it any faster than a first-year student.

If a bad guy decides to blitz through the gauntlet of traps and wishes escape with his prize before Dumbles returns from his Wizengamot duties, this room gives any available teachers time respond to any alarms or wards that have been tripped.

** Haven't seen it, but what about "Give a full year of decent Defense Against the Dark Arts classes AND don't try to murder/maim/torture a single student".

At best he defends the stone and at worst he gets a good teacher for once.

  This is designed to start after chapter 102 of Eliezer Yudkowsky's "Harry Potter and the methods of rationality" (google hpmor). It was written by a fan waiting impatiently (but constructively) for the story to be finished. Read it before this. As usual, characters are owned by Rowling or Yudkowsky. Update: added vignette at end.
