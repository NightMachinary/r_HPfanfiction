And what do you like about them?


** I dont have a suggestion, but I'd love to see one where Harry becomes a Vampire and pretty much acts like Alucard from the Hellsing Ultimate Abridged series. Just joking around and pissing people off :P

*** I'd take Harry using his newfound powers just to mess with people over endless angst and edginess any day.

** I haven't read too many vampire fics but my faves are:

Drown in my shallow heart. Decently written, features a super rare pair (Arthur/Bellatrix). Arthur becomes a vampire.

Absolute best fic I've read where vampires are a prominent feature is Red Amber. It's a hard boiled mystery thriller. One of my favourite genres and one of my favourite fics. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/Red-Amber]])
