Sure, not telling Dumbledore (or even the ministry) about the Horcruxies and the number of them was a major dick move, but I can kind of understand it from his perspective -he thoughtlessly taught magical Hittler how to become immortal, to say nothing about teaching dark arts to a student, this is bond to came back to bite him later. And I guess his networking goes against the whole proposal of the books that “/anyone can be great/”, but it doesn't really seem such a bad thing. Honestly I kind of liked his character, don't really understand why so many don't.


** He's just like many other characters in the books - deeply flawed in realistic ways. Unfortunately for him, the flaws he has are ones that the sort of people who inhabit places like reddit see as far less forgivable than the flaws of characters like Ron and Hermione.

He's avaricious, he collects influence like its money, and he enjoys using that influence to benefit people he has chosen. One of his greatest pleasures in life is seeing someone succeed and being able to say "I made that happen". He's the very definition of "its who you know that matters".

He didn't report Tom Riddle's interest in horcruxes because he was blinded by what he saw - a potentially crowning glory in his career. A muggle born (or so it seemed) who was hugely magically talented, fantastically intelligent, charismatic, good looking, truly cunning, deeply ambitious. Slughorn will have seen that and decided that Tom was destined for great things, high position in the Ministry, and that Slughorn would be the one to get him there. Slughorn was looking 30 or 40 years into the future and seeing Minister Riddle being sworn into office with Horace Slughorn in the front row of the audience.

*** Slughorn would have become a successful venture capitalist in real world. What he had been doing is basically what those professors at Ivy League universities are doing. Of course, there is a key difference here, in that Slughorn was applying this method to secondary school children/teenagers, while our professors are promoting promising graduate level students well into their 20s.

Unfortunately, there were no universities or post secondary educational institutions in Wizarding Britain.

*** I don't care about his networking or even that he told Riddle about the Horcruxes (even if it was not the really smart). Networking is often important so with him it's better to get into his good grace if it can help later. It's not a big sacrifice. Telling Tom with how Tom was isn't a big mistake either. It lacks foresight but their relation seemed to have been cultivated by Tom for quite some time.

No the big problem is that he's a coward and to afraid to own his mistakes. If he had told earlier about the Horcruxes maybe someone could have done something. And if not well too bad but I understand the mistrust in the Ministry (because of infiltrated Death Eaters or their overall incompetence) but lying to Dumbledore? Just because of the shame? Is it so much more important that all the bodies piling? I wouldn't judge him by what he did before but what he didn't later.

But despite this I like the character. He's not the worse. Stupid and self-centered on this point but not too horrible. Dumbledore may be too much about the bigger picture but Slughorn clearly isn't enough. He's the embodiment of the sentence that more or less says that "evil flourishes when good men to nothing". In the end he's more of an ostrich than a walrus.

**** Yeah, as I said he's a deeply, realistically flawed character. If you went to many university professors and told them that their favourite student had become a mass murdering terrorist who had deeply infiltrated the government with his followers, and they realised that the student had once upon a time revealed to them some secret plan about their rise to power that they hadn't understood until now...I imagine many of them might do the cowardly thing as well.

  slughirn is hated because Rowling wrote him to be our token 'good' Slytherin. To prove the point taht not all Slytherins are evil. However, rather than making him more good, she just made him less evil.
#+end_quote

I think that interpretation is plausible, but I don't think that's really what Rowling is going for, tbh. Slughorn is very much shown as a "not good" person from the start. The guy is found hiding in the home of Muggles and refuses to help out at Hogwarts' until Dumbledore "bribes" him with Harry.

He's a coward, he's ambitious, obsequious, material, etc. He's not "evil," but he's never really portrayed as a good person.

**** I don't know about aiding and treason

He didn't know who Riddle truly was, he didn't know he was evil and would really use that Knowledge. He only saw a brillant student, eager to learn. It is not bad to teach and learn about evil things. It's how you protect yourself from that in the first place, and from who would use it.

Slughorn unforgivable flaw, IMO is that he put his reputation above everything else and didn't share what he knew. I get he was ashamed and felt guilty, but he was a coward here. When the most he risked was his standing. Not even his life.

**** I don't think I would go as far as calling what Slughorn did "treason". Technically, the only thing he did was answer the hypothetical questions asked by a brillant student (questions of doubtful nature but Riddle had a believable story). Riddle already knew about Horcruxes and how to do them when he first approached him (pretty sure he had already done at least the diary, potentially the ring too), and the whole conversation can be summed up by "Doing one Horcruxe is bad, it hurt the soul, doing several would be so terrible I refuse to even think about it".

Slughorn is a coward because he left his guilt stop him from giving Dumbledore very important information, but I still wouldn't call it treason, far from it.

****** 2 days ago, you tried to tell me that Sirius should have been hailed a hero if he had murdered a man in broad daylight in front of muggles even though he is the prime suspect in the Death of the Potters (as Voldemort lieutenant and spy), even though with Peter dead, there would be no one else alive to corrobore his story. And now you want to put Slughorn in front of a jury for treason because he never told anyone about an information he suspected (not knew, suspected). We clearly do not have the same vision of canon.

First, Riddle being Voldemort may be an open secret, but it's a secret nonetheless. There are no official, legal link between the 2 of them, so you can't accuse someone of treason because he didn't mention a conversation he had with Tom Riddle when asked about Voldemort, not to mention nobody probably never asked him any question about Voldemort.

Second, Slughorn didn't "know" that Voldemort made Horcruxes. He may have suspected it (especially after his conversation with him), but Voldemort may have chosen another way toward immortality, or even not be immortal at all (most of the population thought he was really dead until his return in GoF). Even Dumbledore didn't confirm that Voldemort made Horcruxes until Harry showed him the destroyed diary in CoS. Magical world or not, you don't have to go to the authorities for any assumptions you made, and authorities can't accuse you of anything because you didn't go to them with these assumptions.

Third, Tom Riddle asking Slughorn about the possibility of 7 Horcruxes does not mean he made 7. Voldemort "pushed the boundaries of magic" with his multiples Horcruxes, before him, Slughorn opinion (which concorde with the one of the scholars) was "Doing one Horcruxe is already bad, but doing several is crazy, the wizard would die".

​

Slughorn was a coward, but none of the things he did was technically illegal. If you start accusing him of treason just because of this one action, you would probably end up with more wizards inside Azkaban than outside.

******* I'm not saying that Slughorn should be hung as a traitor, but what he did came very close to the definition of treason (at least the British one). Because you have to admit, Slughorn had to know who Voldemort was (the reason for the faked memory), and that, by 1995/6, he must have concluded that Voldemort had made some. Which made his knowledge crucial intelligence. And withholding that certainly fits the following bit of English law (from the 16th century, still in effect today and certainly within the SoS time frame)

#+begin_quote
  adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid and comfort
#+end_quote

Giving the Sovereign's enemies (the Ministry/Minister in the case of the magical world) aid by withholding war winning information certainly fits what Slughorn did. And that's legally treason (although there's a long list of people more in need of sentencing than Slughorn).

** He didn't teach Riddle anything actually. Riddle knew how to make Horcruxes and only needed a second opinion. And while suspicious, Slughorn never could confirm that Riddle was making Horcruxes. As far as the information from the story goes, Dumbledore was more interested in hearing Riddle say the number than whatever Slughorn said.

Also I didn't realize that Slughorn gets so much hate but my best guess is that it's related to the fact that we see him through Harry's perspective (which is somewhat influenced by Dumbledore's warning at the end of chapter 4). Harry is neutral at best towards him, and annoyed by his vanity at the worst.

But overall he doesn't seem like a bad human.

I did see a discussion, where one writer asked, “Who should I ship him with in my story?” and the response was generally “Ew!” That's probably plain old fat-shaming. If he were thin and handsome, people would be shipping him with everyone.

*** I don't doubt the principle of your point regarding pairings, but I wouldn't call it fat shaming. I don't think I've ever heard anyone make fun of or "shame" Slughorn for being fat.

On a micro-scale, if an author doesn't write slash, we won't bash them for being homophobic. It's not their taste and there are plenty of slash fics in the wild, besides. On a macro-scale, if no fanfic authors were into writing slash, we wouldn't say that community was homophobic. Just none of the people writing the material are gay or, at the very least, don't like writing about gay pairings.

It just turns out that the (apparent) majority of fanfic writers don't want to write smut/romance fics with fat characters. That doesn't mean Slughorn is being fat shamed, just that no one who's into that kind of thing has written about it, yet.

** What exactly /did/ he teach Tom, though? He just confirmed to him some vague, very basic notions about Horcruxes that Tom already would have read in any place that mentioned the term. Maybe the book scene is more large and I just forget (in which case please correct me), but from what I recall, he never gives Tom any detailed account about Horcruxes or how to make them.

From his perspective, it was only a student that looks like Merlin 2.0 and which comes from an outcast and alien background compared to other wizards ask questions about an obscure and banned branch of magic. As a teacher, he was probably thrilled to see such a deep level of knowledge in someone so young.

Maybe I forgot a major, major scene, but if not, imo people make a way bigger deal about Slughorn's involvement in this. Sure, the major dick move was keeping silent once it became clear to him that Tom had pretty practical interests in the subject.

i don't really get the hate for the networking thing either. He may have been more prone to pick Purebloods, but the guy shows through the series that he values talent more than social standing in his Slug Club members.

But yeah, I agree that Slughorn gets way more hate than he deserves. Yes, he was an asshole for not reporting to Dumbledore years later when it seems obvious that Voldemort probably made 7 Horcruxes. Especially during the time period where Voldemort was vanquished.

But he's not that bad of a character, and bashing him is a bit much

**** The thing is, Slughorn horn knew. Up until Tom asked about Horcruxes Slughorn could be forgiven for being caught up in the charming persona Tom had crafted, as everyone else was caught up in it too. When Tom asked about the Horcrux that narrative was gone. No one just has a casual passing interest in a Horcrux. When Tom asked about 7 in particular, Slughorns reaction is very telling. Saying its bad enough to plan on murdering even one person.

Slughorn, for all his faults, is very intelligent. At that moment he knew that Tom was going to make murder people. Whether he stuck with 7 or not, Tom was open to murder.

Tom of course played him, offered him the out. "This is all hypothetical of course." Bullshit, and Slughorn knew it. But he had a choice, tell someone, take action, watch Tom like Dumbledore did, /or/ accept the lie and go back to influence peddling, enjoy his crystallized pineapple and favors.

With generosity towards Slughorn you could say that the had nothing to gain and everything to lose by bringing this knowledge forward. What would the Aurors do on the gut feeling of a professor that a popular student was going to kill people? Likely nothing. What would they do to the adult professor that a student felt comfortable enough discussing the Dark Arts with to ask about Horcruxes? Slughorn could have potentially been tossed into Azkaban with nothing to show for it. Then when Tom dropped off the face of the earth he probably felt relief. When Voldemort showed up their was no proof that it was Tom. Once again Slughorn is intelligent, so I'm sure he had serious suspicions. But it was easier and less risky to not say anything. Tom may have changed his mind about Horcruxes, and the authorities obviously knew he was willing to kill. What could Slughorn offer? Then Voldemort vanished and didn't return. Proof that Slughorn was innocent. Until he came back.

This is where being generous towards Slughorn ends. Give him 5th year to be in denial about it, but by the time of the Ministry Battle he knew for sure. He should have given the memory to Dumbledore as soon as Dumbledore asked. It wasn't like Albus was going to advertise Slughorns culpability or throw him in Azkaban. He wasn't even going to stop him from teaching or collecting students. He was safe at Hogwarts and he had knowledge that was vitally important to ending Voldemort. He just didn't want people to /think badly of him/.

** Slughorn is a perfect example for "If rich old white man likes you for his arbitrary reasons, and you are nice to him, then you will have it much easier in life."

And the problem with that is generally, that it concentrates power (rather than distributing it). Just to give one in-canon example: to the first meeting in the train compartment, he invites those, whose relatives are already successful.

In short: he gives opportunities to his favorites, opportunities that are arbitrarily unavailable to most.

And then there is the fact that he's a low-key racist, too:

*** I get this, but at the same time it bothers me because Lupin does something similar and it's totally glossed over. Beyond the information of V trying to make 7, Dumbledore has already figured everything out by the time V comes back. Prior to that, Slughorn had no way of knowing V actually made Horcruxes. Especially when we consider that V took years to really become a problem. He was asked the question in like '45 and most of what we know about the war happened in the 70's so over 20 years later. I suspect Slughorn had put the conversation out of his mind until Dumbledore brought it up pre HBP. At that point yes he should have told the truth, but again Lupin does something similar and gets no hate for it.

When I refer to Lupin I'm talking about how he refused to tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an animagus even after Sirius had snuck into the castle twice. Everyone is concerned about how he's managing it and he doesn't tell Dumbledore because he's ashamed of breaking Dumbledore's trust when he was a kid. It worked out fine because Sirius was innocent, but Lupin had no way of knowing. Sirius could have killed a bunch of students if he was so inclined. Slughorn on the other hand gets roasted for not repeating a hypothetical conversation he had over 20 years previously.

*** But Dumbledore already KNEW he was using Horcruxes. He just didn't know how many, and even then, it's only broadly "confirmed" that he's even using more than one. In the memory, he only talks about how 7 is a magical number, that doesn't mean he's even using 7.

** There is also the fact that he used to invite kids to parties and stuff which also leads onto the point that many fanfics refer to him as some kind of child predator.

*** Honestly I think this one was blown way over the top. The “kids” we saw were all around fifteen or older, I certainly don't remember any first or second year at the party, in an age where they were more likely to actually /want/ his council in how to get there dream position in life and to start networking. I think he have less chance of being a pedophile than Snape (not saying he was, just that it is more probable considering that he went and joined Voldemort's merry band of bigoted psychos).

** He's the embodiment of favouritism and nepotism, all about who you know.\\
Now that could be overlooked if he was otherwise a good person, but he's not, he's a coward and a liar.\\
He breaks into muggle homes to hide, he lies to Dumbledore's face about Riddle's Horcruxes.

And there's just no real good guy moments mixed in there to make up for any of his flaws.
