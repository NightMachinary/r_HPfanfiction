I just finished a depressing ass fanfic, nevermind my depressing ass life in general, and I would love something to make me feel a little better. Just NO MALE SLASH


** My best fluff examples aren't from HP, actually. But linkffn(Grow Young With Me) is very sweet.

**** I've been reading some Miraculous Ladybug fics recently; that fandom has a lot of fluff.

There's linkao3(How to Fake a Marriage), which doesn't have much to do with the main plot of the series, so is pretty accessible if you're not familiar with it. Lots of domestic interactions between partners who are very supportive of each other's lives and careers.

linkao3(Someone to Watch Over Me) has a nice depiction of Marinette overcoming her canonical tongue-tying to actually talk to her crush, because he's having a really hard time and needs her help. Their relationship grows from there. And gets complicated by her dual identities, because he's attracted to both and doesn't know they're the same girl. It's wholesome enough that I'm happy for my eight-year-old to read it.

And the author of How to Fake a Marriage has written about a hundred one-shots that are mostly pretty fluffy.

****** How to Fake a Marriage was the first one I ever read, and I had only a very limited exposure to the show. It's set several years after canon and doesn't have much to do with the canon story. The others, see what you think.

** Hmm... Should I?... Should I not?... Eh, why the hell not, it's me, and I have the flair for a reason.

I'm back at it again recommending Meaning Of One by Sovran: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54]]

It's a Hinny Soul-Bond fic, which is understandably a turn-off for some people, but as I've said on reddit dozens of times now, this fic is in my opinion the objective best fic out there.

For once I'm actually a bit hesitant to recommend this as it's not /all/ fluff, there are moments of harsh tension and angst.

But the fluff that is there is some of the sweetest and wholesome things I've read. Even remembering certain scenes makes me giddy. I think the best early example is a tickle fight that ends unexpectedly due to the Soul-Bond. Then there's Fred and George who are in top comedic form in this fic, so there will be some gut busters along the way.

Spoilers for when tense/angsty moments occur that don't appear in the original books: >! First Year Christmas Day, before Dobby is introduced and most of the last third of part two. !< In case you wanted to avoid those moments.
