** Love this fic. I think Abby is one of the best OCs I've read and I'm really excited to learn more about her character. I think Harry, Ron and Hermione have been aged properly without distorting their characters, and their interactions have been true to this. The relationship forming between Abby and Harry feels organic and real and hasn't been rushed. I think the timeline isn't very well established. I don't have the quotes but I'm pretty sure the fic begins in March and as some point its mentioned they've known each other 4 months and at that point it was May-ish.

My only real complaint is the kids are a bit too perfect. Losing a parent can certainly make kids grow up faster, and be more likely to respond to their remaining parents, but I think one scene where Harry has to yell at them for not listening would dispel this worry.

Also a bit concerned about the auror case that keeps getting brought up. It seems likely it will somehow tie into Ginny's death, which I think would be unfortunate. It's much better that she just died because of shit luck than something malicious. Also Tracey Davis is well done.

***** I haven't read those parts for a while (I started reading it about 3 months ago now), but that's just what my gut was telling me. We know there's something in Abby's past that the author hasn't revealed yet, so there's a possibility that subplot Will merge to the main plot through her past.

To me, it's pretty obvious the 2 plotlines will meet up, either in some way facilitating or hurting Abby and Harry's blossoming relationship, or to give a reason to tell Abby about the wizarding world (perhaps with the threat of obliviation included, if the investigation goes through her.)

** I'm a Harry/Ginny shipper, but I love this story. It's a nice nod to the pairing, but creates something new and beautiful out of a very sad story. I almost started crying on the bus when I read the flashback chapter. Just about broke my heart. Made me think about what would happen to my SO if I should die. I would hate for him to be sad and miserable forever. The story is definitely on my favorites.

** This is very much not my type of fanfic. It is pure fluff with a seeming self-insert OC. While I do enjoy a fluff piece now and then, there is usually at least /something/ else going on with it. In this story there's just a very slow progression of romance.

For instance Hope (jeconias), while also a mainly fluff/romance piece, there are other relevant plot pieces occurring like the big Quidditch tournament. In this fic there is a nebulous case which may or may not have some importance and Abby's checkered past or abusive boyfriend/husband. But if something hasn't developed in over 100k+ words, I'm not sure if it ever will or even if I'd want it to.

Preferences aside, it is well written, and the character interaction seems spot on. The pacing is off, but that's the only real complaint I have.

** I avoided this story like a plague at first.

I read through the first 3 chapters and found myself wondering why so many people would rave about what seems to be an obvious self-insert fluff fic.

I put it away for a while and ignored the many recs, still wondering how it was possible this could be so well recommended.

Then, it was recommended again when I asked for a NextGen fic that didn't focus on the kids and here comes this story again. Fine. I'll read it.

The impossible happened. I started at chapter 7 and kept reading...and reading...and reading. I realized I found a strange kinship in Harry's normalcy. No dastardly dark lords. Just doing shit at work and taking care of the kids. The dialogue, while extremely saccharine at points, wasn't overbearing and the characters were extremely canon compliant.

It was nice.

Which is about all I can say about this fic now that I've got to the end. As chapters 16 to 19 rolled around, I realized why I disliked it in the first place. True, it is highly recommended as a nice "slice of life" fic.

And people are right in a way.

Life is usually as boring as this fic.

** I /almost/ had the same gripe about the lack of magic as others, but it started to pick up. For me, a Harry Potter story without magic isn't really a Harry Potter story. You can write a romance without needing to use someone else's characters. In this case, we started to get glimpses of the auror office, some accidental magic, etc, which fixed the problem.

I really enjoyed the story. There are a few issues - Ginny's incident (trying to avoid spoilers) seemed a little contrived, for instance - but I can get past those and just enjoy it. The canon adults are done very well - aged up perfectly. Some else already mentioned the scene with Ron and the microwave, and that one tickled me too. I even liked Molly, and that's very rare for me.

The children were done well too. I thought some of their dialogue was a little too old for them, but for the most part it was cute and seemed real.

As for Abby, she can occasionally seem a little too ditzy for I get the impression that's a kind of defense mechanism. When we've seen her thoughts they've been a lot more grounded.

I see a few comments on length. A story should be long enough to finish: no more, no less. Sometimes I read stuff hat has endless descriptions of characters walking around, musing about pointless stuff and only really trying to boost the word count. On the other hand, there are stories where the characters would be replaced by Lego characters for all the characterisation they have. This story has to fill us in on a tragic event, let us know what's happened since, introduce a new character and make us care about them... and then have a plot of its own. I think it's paced just about right. But then I always have a soft spot for slower stories - Vitam Paramus is a particular favourite.

I've added it to my follow list, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what happens.

If some of the plot threads hovering in the background (Abby's questionable past, innocent man in jail) connect soon then I bet it will become VERY good. I'm looking forward to that. It would be cool to see a fic that goes from sappy love story to mystery/action, rather than the other way around.

** There is something about the way the words were woven in this one that is both brilliant and rare. Say what you want about how plain the plot is and you would be right, but that's just one cog in the wheel. When I started reading it about 8 months ago I basically stumbled upon it and had no expectations from the story, what I needed was to really take my mind off things. And in those bittersweet words and in those brilliant kids there was such a 'feel good' vibe that was instantly uplifting and I have been enamoured with this one ever since. But then again it's easy to see how it might not be what one seeks in a fanfiction.

** Okay, first book club entry I've stuck with (almost). I really like the kids and the older character scenes as standalones. They've definitely grown up. I don't think this is spoiling, but the scene with the microwave and Ron is classic, got me laughing. I could easily return to this and read a single chapter on its own if I'm in the mood for a fast fanfic fix.

The timing's a little off from canon, which threw me off a little but then again that's not the most dramatic change so not really a biggie. I feel like there's a lot of dialogue and inner thoughts, which is fine and well-written in a vacuum, but so much makes it really off balance for me.

Abby reads like a pleasant weirdo. Sort of like a watered down less-whimsical muggle-quirky Luna. She's a good OC.

My biggest gripe is the length. Now I love a short fic, which I'm thinking is probably not the general fanfic reader's preference, and this fic is a little too sprawl-y for me.

I really dislike that there's very little magic in this. Maybe I've scrolled past it (an indication of it getting too long for me), but I'm pretty sure there are entire chapters with no mention of wands and spells, and if it is there are times when it's minor or just in passing (floo, herbology properties of plants, Harry sitting at his desk playing with his wand while bored - yes, yes, I know).

Personally, I find that a nice break. I like a character-focused slice of life fic that doesn't feel the need to focus on [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][magic]] and saving the +world+ +Britain+ magical Britain. 99% of fics do that to a greater or lesser degree. In fact I think it would be weird if the author tried to constantly call attention to [[http://i.imgur.com/YsbKHg1.gif][magic]]. The story is about characters as adults going about their lives. They're no longer in school learning about magic. Magic is just another part of normal life for them now.

**** Precisely because magic is another part of normal life for them is why I find the absence jarring. I don't mean grand spell-waving which saves the world and turning buttons into dragons, but stuff that was present in the series as more run-of-the-mill use. Mrs. Weasley uses a lot of household charms in the books introducing us to the concept of quotidian magic. The characters can refill a drink, float objects behind them, I mean Harry's first instinct in one chapter is to go walk to get his son a soft toy, and only summons it after the kid is basically in tears about him leaving the room.

Yeah, though Harry was raised as a muggle. Even though magic's become normal for him, his first instinct for simple tasks may still be to do them without magic.

** I just read this over the weekend and really enjoyed it. I found the characterizations of Harry and the rest of the adults really well done. It was a light and fun read, although it touches on some heavier topics and Ginny's death broke my heart.

The author doesn't seem to have a good grip on the ages / dates that the story takes place. I write a lot of next-gen so it stood out to me that Teddy, James, Albus and Lily are much older than they should be in 2009. For Albus and Rose to go to school in 2017, they would have been born c. 2006 and Lily and Hugo would be born about two years later. Ginny, in this story, died in November 2006. In 2009, Teddy should be 11, Lily should be 1(ish), Albus should be 3(ish) and James should be 4/5. If the author were to say the birthdates were AU for Harrry's kids it would be fine, but Teddy still shouldn't be 13.

I want to be upfront that this clearly isn't the story for me. I cannot get into it at all. It's all dialogue. Abby is the clumsy, endearingly annoying, eyelash batting, only issues exist to make her cuter, sensitive fixer upper and it just sticks in my craw. The story, the writing, the characters are all insubstantial and thin to me. I can't care about the characters, the romance, or what tragedy happened to Ginny.

But, that's okay because people like different things and it's great that they've found something they enjoy.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** I've strongly enjoyed the fic, the flashback to Ginny's death seemed unnecessary and could have been done better. But that is literally my only criticism with it. Wish it was done!

Trying to find some others similar to it.

** I loved this fic... I was surprised that Abby felt so REAL... I kinda dont like the children characters tho. They just felt... artificial like they werent real. Also, a part of me feels like there should be one person who well... talked to Harry about it. Hermoine only does it during the story, three years later? that seems... bull to me.

**** umm... what?. The thing about Grow Young with me, is that I think it is more of an internal battle thing than an external one... unless a new chapter showed something I missed

** This is so different than what I normally read. I am strongly /not/ a Harry/Ginny shipper and I really never read fics with major OCs. But this is great. It stomped on my heart repeatedly, but I still felt hopeful. And I felt like the family dynamic was realistic. The kids still act out and Harry still responds like a parent.

This is also the best I've liked something that references a positive Harry/Ginny relationship in a long time. I stopped reading that pairing years ago, and now I normally can't stand it, but this time, even though it is only peripheral, I really felt it and actually believed it.

** Grow Young with me - suprisingly, one I didn't run across before.

In all honesty, not bad at all - if I were a HPGW shipper and I thought Harry would turn into a morose asshole.

Otherwise, a nice read.
