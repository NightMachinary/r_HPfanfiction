So in a lot of fanfictions Authors have Harry going back into the Chamber of Secrets, however they most often times have him take his broom, or more rarely have Fawkes get him out. Yet Dobby could always take him in and out of the chambers. Which I could understand Harry not thinking like that perhaps, so I mostly ignore it in most fics. But this one I am reading tonight literally has Snape summon two House-Elves into the chamber to harvest the dead basilisk. And still every single person, including Dumbledore (Dumbledore, Snape, Remus, Sirius, and the normal Gryffindor squad are there) brought brooms. It just makes me scratch my head. Especially given that we know Fawkes can just burst-into-flames-make-albus-disappear in Hogwarts. It always stumped me that authors work around the obvious to make Harry (And sometimes a lot of others) take brooms down pipes that twist and turn, and miraculously the brooms, not one of them! break or get injured in some way.

The other one is more of a theory of mine, I may not have all the information needed on this one. So a lot of the Death Eaters escaped Azkaban by saying they were imperius'd. This should to me be an obvious lie, why? Okay, so Voldemort from what we can gather, obviously sees or at least pretends to portray that having his mark is a thing to be proud of, an *honor*, something that one must earn, through his own merit or their parents, or by agreeing to do a request. Or by proving themselves in some way. I gather this by how Voldemort, his Death Eaters and the student-Death Eaters talk about it. It's not something I think that would be given to someone who was merely under a curse to do their bidding because they were too influential and powerful to kill and that Voldemort had use of, but knew would never join him willingly. Because why else wouldn't you blackmail them? Perhaps there is no dirt, another reason to use imperius. But those people I don't think would get the mark because they haven't *earned the honor and privilege of doing so by doing his bidding and showing their loyalty with their own free will*. Not to mention, to be imperius'd outside of battle or whatever, implies once more that Voldemort wants them alive for some reason to do his bidding. I do not think these people, who were imperius'd, would be marked. The danger of them being found out before completing the task assigned to them would be too high.

The autonomy is stripped away, they wouldn't even be able to escape or anything if caught. Voldemort obviously doesn't care for their lives, but if he's going through the trouble of keeping them alive to do his bidding he wouldn't want his plans to be discovered. And obviously he could control them without being near them if he was having so many imperius'd. So all he'd had to do is tell them to come to him, or use a portkey, or have a true Death Eater fetch them or check in on them and their progress or whatever.

I honestly don't see how 'i have the mark but i was imperius'd to do his bidding' held up at all.


** The mark wasn't a publicly known thing at all during the First War. So, it's easy to say you're Imperiused and leave it at that. Dumbledore knows about the mark only after Voldemort's fall because of Snape.

*** OH that's right, now that you said that I remember this being discussed ages ago about whether the mark was known or not. That makes much more sense to me now, thanks! Though I don't get how they were so freakin' ignorant did they not fucking search the prisoners and realize they all have the same gd tattoo and they were all DE so that they may just maybe, have something to do with one another? They should be more competent. Muggles know to search prisoners.

Ministry idiots. -shakes fist-

I'm not sure that any Death Eaters were caught, prior to Voldemort's fall. That was the whole point of why everyone feared them so much: no one had any idea who they were, to the point that the Potters were willing to believe Lupin was one.

******** Hagrid in the first book said loads of people came out of trances. That is to say, there really where people who were under the imperius. Its mocked as a defence in a lot of fan fiction but we don't know the ratio of really imperiused to those doing stuff of their own free will. We also know that the dark mark faded after Voldemort fell. Sirius revealed in book 4 he had no idea why Karkaroff was showing Snape something on his arm. When Karkaroff gives evidence he makes a point to say Voldemort operated in secrecy and he didn't know many of the other Death Eaters. Not even Bellatrix shows the mark when she's been dragged away. I believe its possible that it faded entirely until he regained at least some strength.

Personally I doubt it. It's always been my belief that part of why Dumbledore was so certain Sir Tom was still around was that he had observed (on the person of Snape) that the Dark Mark /hadn't/ quite faded.

********** Its a point about /how/ distinct the mark was when Voldemort possessed no body. It could have been some indistinct scar, the kind most people wouldn't even notice after a month or two.

Besides which, wizards and witches seemed to wear robes practically all the time. I doubt you see their limbs regularly.

Not normally, but to be fair, Azkaban prisoners /are/ stripped of their robes and made to wear prison uniforms. (Though it might be the Dementors who handle that, and /they/ might've known about the Mark all along and never told the wizards... it would be in-character for them, to be honest.)

**** Don't question these things. If the ministry had any kind of competency in investigation and trials the whole book series wouldn't exist. They and Dumbledore are some of Voldemort's biggest supporters in that regard.

The amount of opportunities these people let fly by them is criminal. The DEs are in complete disarray after the miraculous defeat of Voldemort and the "good guys" learn not even the bare basics about the DE's organization structure, where their money comes from, magical tattoos, Voldemort's ambitions about immortaility (which he likes to brag about) or frankly anything of actual worth.

They need food, clothes, potions, they need to pay leads and spys, acquire old tomes of forbidden Dark Magic that Voldemort requires. They need to provide for their families while also paying off corrupt Aurors and other Ministry officials. Of course they need money.

Some people around here push the idea that Magical Society should be some kind of post-scarcity society and while I can follow some of the arguments (just conjure whatever you need except food) the society portrayed in canon is clearly not post-scarcity and very focused on money and economical castes.

******* The Death Eaters aren't a ranked army. They live on their own like regular people, and are only called for battles and raids by Voldemort. They have their own jobs (or fortunes, in Malfoy's case). Food and clothes would be handled by each individual Death Eater entirely regardless of their Death Eater activites; same for "providing for their families". Death Eaters don't get /paid/ for being Death Eaters...!

I don't know if "old tomes of forbidden Dark Magic" were a common enough requirement that it'd be a general concern in the Death Eater budget. For one thing, I don't think there are that many in the world; second, Voldemort would be more inclined to steal them than pay for them; and finally, most such books that would be of interest to him would have already been available to it through the Black Library.

Spies and bribes are a better point, but I'm firmly of the opinion that in such cases, there's not really a mystery of where the money's coming from --- Voldemort demands a sack of gold from the Malfoys or the Blacks, they comply because they don't want to get Cruciated, end of story.

That is fanon. The only book in we know they have is Nature's Nobility, a book about purebloods.

But I also doubt that they spent any significant time reading books(even old ones),\\
thats what Voldemort was doing before he started the war.

There aren't really any smart/clever characters in it. [And don't anyone dare to say Dumbledore.

** Well I think that elf side-along 'popping' is entirely fanon. Otherwise, Dobby could have simply popped everyone away during the Malfoy manor escape.\\
Did Kreachur bring Regulus in Voldemort's cave by 'popping' him? I don't think it was the case. Otherwise, he could have popped back with him and sougth medical attention.

Also, we can say that Fawke's side-along 'flaming' is reserved to his companion/bonded, and perhaps is even aided by the power of Dumbledore himself. As far as I can recall, this theory is canon since no one elese in the books is ever transported in that fashion. Also, Dumbledore only uses it in the most dire of situations, so perhaps it is very draining to the phoenix. After all, the only way Fawkes can help during the fight against Voldemort after flaming in, is by taking an Avada to the face to defend his companion. We could imagine that in other cirumstances he could have been more active, like during the fight against the Basilisk.

So, the answer to the first mystery is that the various creature side-alonging everyone and their mother to everywhere, even the most warded places on earth, are simply not canon and ridiculous.

That /is not a thing/, goddammit. There's no magical bond. Fawkes is just Dumbledore's pet. They're very close, but there's nothing inherently magical about having a pet Phoenix.

**** Up to interpretation, especially since a phoenix is hardly a normal pet to have and it is ambiguous what becomes of fawkes after Dumbledore's death.

But that is what the slash is for, here, my intention was to use "companion" to denote a close pet and 'bonded' to refer to a potential 'familiar' kind of bond. Note that I wasn't trying to suggest a sort of silly soul bond or something like that here but more something of a magical bond (like a sort of contract) that would allow certain powers to be used by both bonded. 'Flaming' could be a power unlocked by such a bond using the magic of both the pet and the human and allowing side-along. But we don't know how Fawkes left after Dumbledore's death, so we can't have any indication of whether or not he was still capable of it.

Admittedly, these are all speculations and closer to headcanon interogations than anything else. In fact, according to Pottermore canon, there is no such thing as a familiar in the world of Harry Potter [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/familiars]]

And anyway I admit that the whole point I was trying to make would easily be explained by the fact that a phoenix simply would not flame away with anyone and will only do it for a very good friend, the same way fawkes doesn't just spend his time crying on anyone with a bruise in the castle.

So, good point :) .

*** Yes wards would matter, but Hogwarts house-elves would be already attuned to the wards. Even before Dobby was a Hogwarts elf he kept popping into Hogwarts. So obviously they can override Hogwarts wards as well.

This whole 'lets throw our bodies with these brooms down long pipes tat twist and turn and the brooms come out just fine' bs is one thing that really irritates me irrationally. I'm just going to write a fic where harry breaks his firebolt for doing this. That'll make me feel better. I'll even have it done HBP after Sirius died.
