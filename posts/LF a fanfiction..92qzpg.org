(fanfic spoilers ahead) I'm looking for a story I read a while ago in which;

Harry decides to disappear in order to hide the hallows.

Hermione find him and they become lovers.

Blaise Zabini is part of some sort of syndicate.

A dying Shacklebolt uses the Incarcerous spell on Hermione and Blaises uses the confusing to strangle her.

Harry who entered the veil of death in order to return the hallows to death, comes out just in time to return her soul.

He comes out of the veil in a younger body.

Any help will be greatly appreciated, thank you.

****** Well this request sounds more action packed or something while the other one OP was asking for a slice of life fic that had almost no action in it
