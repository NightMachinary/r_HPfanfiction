So when a relatively new, non-pureblood Head of House Dumbledore grants his heir Albus THREE middle names, the prestigious purebloods of high standing vow to put the little upstart child in his place.


** Another idea could be that pure-blood families start competing with the children's name lengths, spiralling in a few years to the level of

** I had a fun little chat with my sister and something like this came up. I thought it was kinda funny, this is pretty much what we came up with.

"Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore"

"Wait he has /three/ middle names? Seems a bit... pretentious, no?"

"You know I heard a rumour that he made one of them up."

"No!"

"Yep, Albus Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. /hmm not long enough he thought/ so he gave him self another."

"And Percival was probably the most 'noble' name he could think of!"

"My thoughts /exactly"/

*** Honestly, if any of them were made up I would have said it was Brian. It is just so muggle and may have been done in an attempt to distance himself from his earlier plans with Gellert on muggle domination.

Especially as Percival was his father's name, so that is almost a given. I mean almost all male characters from what we know haave their father's name as middle name (Sirius *Orion*, Harry *James,* William *Arthur*, etc.).

***** Yes, but I didn't expect that, after all you did say that it just came up in conversation. ;) I honestly only thought about Dumbledore's name in response to your comment.

I've never thought about that before though I did hear the made-up name theory before. I admit though that I didn't like it. For me it was /"clear"/ that J.K.R only made that name so overly long to sound overly pretentious and give it gravitas.

Even read once a fanfic where it was adressed and the solution was that Wulfric and Brian came from apprenticeships. Brian was Alchemy and IIRC Wulfric from Transfiguration or in that vein.

****** I like the apprenticeship thing, that's actually kinda interesting.

ALSO the best part about Dumbles having three middle names is the dramatic pause he gets to and does make in the movies.

******* Yes, that dramatic pause does fit Dumbledore to a tee.

If you want to read the fic I mean it is called Defiance by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8526641/The-BlackStaff-and-NightMarE][The BlackStaff and NightMarE]] though it is currently being rewritten, so the rewrite may not have that included.

Haven't read it in a while, but I do remember it being tropey with lordships and powerful!Harry so it may not be your cup of tea.

The name thing comes up in Chapter 28 the first time.

** How is the CHILD the upstart because of how his parent named him? Wouldn't that make the PARENT the upstart? Now, if little Albus actually had only one middle name, and in a way of overcompensating he gave himself two more and insisted he always had them, then he'd be the upstart.

***** I think in Harry's case was more the fact that he survived the Darkest Lord which implied that he had unusual magic to live through an unblockable, irreversible curse (how they knew that Voldemort got around to cast it... don't ask me). According to Hagrid, no one really knew what happened to Voldemort that night except that he disappeared. Some thought he was dead, some thought he went into hiding and was biding his time (also kind of stupid considering he was winning the war), some thought that he lost his powers.
