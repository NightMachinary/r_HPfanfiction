Just curious.


** Parselmouths are more common than we think, but no one talks about it because of the stigma.

Let's look at what happens when Harry is outed. Everyone /knows/ about them, yet Voldemort is the only living person in England they ever talk about being one. That seems...wrong. Let's see what they can do.

Talk to snakes.

That's it. Wooo, scary. There is no canon evil "Parselmagic", that's all fanon. And usually /bad/ fanon.

There is still something wrong with this picture. Everyone, even little kids, knows what it means to talk to snakes. Maybe because of Voldemort, and other dark wizards, but they still know the exact details. Something is keeping the knowledge alive, enough that kids are taught to be afraid of people who talk to snakes. It is a big. Deal.

Ron freaks out when Harry might have entered a contest without telling him, but he's totally okay with the snake thing. Like, /instantly/ okay with it. Not even a thought. /Literally no one else/ has this reaction. Except for maybe Hermione. She is more taken aback than Ron about the whole thing, even though she likewise says it is nonsense pretty much right away.

Why are Ron and the other Weasleys the only ones who don't buy this "Parselmouth = evil wizard" thing for even a microsecond when everyone else is losing their minds?

Why indeed. Not even the often-stupid gossip follower Molly Weasley ever gives Harry a hard time about it. Odd.

--------------

The plot thickens after reading the whole series. This all centers around the only thing other than talking to a snake that ever matters. The Chamber of Secrets.

Now, not even Dumbledore can open up the CoS -- he didn't remove the dangerous corpse or do any research on it in canon -- yet /Ron/ tries to sound like a snake for a few minutes and opens it up straight away in DH, so they can get a fang?

And there's more. Volde-shade can't, or at least doesn't, open the CoS in the first book when he's possessing a teacher. Instead of a huge-ass snake, he uses a troll to distract everyone. But the diary Horcrux opens it in the second year immediately -- no problem. So why wait? Because he needed a real Parselmouth host, maybe? Because he couldn't speak snake as an undead shade, or as a spirit fragment in a book?

The conclusion is clear.

*Ginny and Ron Weasley are Parselmouths*. Perhaps, /all/ of the Weasleys are. Or maybe the Prewetts and at least some of Molly's kids. It isn't clear.

Might be why Malfoy the Elder targeted Ginny specifically. He knew they were Parselmouths, that /she/ was one. Maybe he tested her somehow, to see her reaction, before planting the diary.

Maybe he even considered this in the first place because he knew the Prewett brothers were -- which is why they were targeted in the war -- and that the diary needed a Parselmouth host to open the CoS. He could have targetted Hermione easily -- after all, she's just a Muggleborn, and a known bookworm.

But he chose a witch who, we are later told, really should have known better, having grown up in a magical family, with a father who handled dangerous enchanted things for a living. For some reason, /she/ was the correct target to sow chaos in advance of a vote for Muggle protection laws, not the Muggleborn friend of Harry Potter.

--------------

This leads to other interesting side theories.

It is nice to think Lily was a Parselmouth and Snape know, or something like that, but it doesn't add up. But there is someone else who fits much, much better.

Look at this group of tight friends, the Marauders. All of the them had a special attribute, a special little secret about them. Sirius was (briefly) secretly the Black family white sheep and was actually a good and responsible person; Remus had his secret furry little problem that was found out; and Peter was secretly a coward who wanted to do better. That secret was revealed all too late.

But what was James, that he fit in so well? He was from an old family, his parents had him very late in life and died soon after he graduated. Tragic, but not that mysterious. Everyone else in the Marauders had a secret. What was James'? And maybe, just maybe, one should ask: what did Lily find out about him that changed her mind so drastically?

*James Potter was a Parselmouth, as was his son.*

*** I agree with your idea of Harry inheriting the ability to speak Parseltongue from James. My head-canon is that the Slytherin line mixed with the Peverell line before the Peverells split and eventually became the Gaunts and Potters.

Other head-canons:

*Full veelas are born to a female veela and a male muggle. That is the only way for them to keep up their population in my opinion.

*That the permanent resident of a building cannot be made the secret keeper or said building. This would explain why James or Lily were not the secret keeper themselves.

*Half-bloods seem to be the most magically powerful. Albus Dumbledore, Tom Riddle, Severus Snape, and Harry Potter are good examples of this. They also seem to have an easier time using the Dark Arts. Minerva McGonagall using the Imperius Curse on Amycus Carrow despite not being a Dark Witch and Harry Potter using Snape's Sectumsempra curse without even knowing the effects, Using the Imperius Curse without any prior practice, and being able to successfully cast the Cruciatus Curse on his third attempt (Bellatrix in OotP, attempt on Snape in HBP after he killed Dumbledore, Amycus Carrow in DH).

*The Potters were not included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight because either a recent Lord or Lady Potter (I don't necessarily agree with the whole Lordship idea that so many authors use, but it was the easiest way to explain it and I'm strapped for time) were illegitimate with almost definite Pure-blood ancestry, but there was enough doubt for Cantankerus Nott to exclude them from the list. This would explain why they were not included, but Dorea Potter was not blasted off the Black Family Tapestry.

I'll add more later.

A common justification for this that I have read and rather like is that the purebloods really /are/ concentrating their magic and improving their bloodline by having purely magical lineages, but some other factor, likely inbreeding, is weakening the magic. Therefor, a strong pureblood bloodline, with an influx of new blood from a muggleborn has the potential to produce very powerful children.

One version of it that I recently read (can't remember which fic) is that the inbreeding is deleterious to their physical health, so they have to waste magic just keeping themselves alive, so "weak" purebloods actually have lots of magic, but most of it is not available for active spell casting.

Also, I'm pretty keen on removing word of god and epilogue from canon. I enjoyed the epilogue and sometimes agree with JKR's sentiments, but it's often too restrictive for Fanfics and boring.

**** Oh, this bit of headcanon is going in my fanfic. Big time.

As you say, some canon is better than other. In my view, it goes (from strongest, most useful canon for fanfic to least): first three books, next three books, written WoG during original publishing timeframe (newsletter stuff and any clarifications), all interview WoGs, extra website stuff, all additional supplementary books or new novels, DH, the stuff added in the movies.

I think an author is in a certain mindset when writing, and stuff they come up with after the fact simply isn't serving the same purpose. See: George Lucas.

This means JKR's latest stuff about Hermione/Ron is less important to me than the original written material -- however much that hurts because of my shipping registry. But I think it keeps things closer to the author's original ideas that way.

That's just for weaving new headcanon. When going AU, of course, go /crazy/.

Meh. Word of god, sure, but not an interesting one. And one that is never backed up by ever being a plot point or discussed by anyone in the story.

That's why it is headcanon. It /could/ be true, regardless of what was actually written or not written on the subject. There is a crack in the narrative and it /could/ fit.

I'm not suggesting that Harry was really an alien, or that Voldemort was really a good person who was screwed over by EvilDumbledore, or something completely AU like that.

  ...and he never had the true ability anyway, it seems actual Parselmouths can speak it whenever they want and *not just when looking at snakes*. So he didn't inherit the ability.

What? Oh, yeah, which is why there were snakes carved on everything activated by Parceltongue passwords in direct contravention of logical security -- because Voldemort and goddamn Salazar fucking Slytherin needed to be reminded how to open those doors, not because it helped them use their abilities.

No, wait. Nevermind. I recognize this fun-killing madness. Go somewhere else and discuss how many positive adjectives were used to describe Ginny, or why JKR saying Hermione/Ron was a mistake isn't /really/ something that changes the context of canon, or something.

** I have many (over 50) files with ruminations on topics of how things work in the Potter world, but most of it is half-written musings rather than presentable complete arguments or stories.

Where is your interest focused for this?

EDIT: an example of something close to presentable

Ruminations - Brooms that fly

As with anything, this is all conjecture.

956 A.D.

It all started with a wizard milliner/thatcher named Orton who wanted his rye stalks to stand up straight and tall. [brief tale about country farmers, jealousy and magic- he couldn't cast magic for the competition, so he mucked with the plant. His rye always looked short and limp compared to his wheat-growing competitors, and they teased him that his bread was just as bitter as he was.]

So, once he had them oriented, the stalks knew to aim their tips to the heavens and their roots straight towards the ground. As a strange by-product, he discovered that harvesting the stalks was easier- as if the plants weighed almost nothing. Inspired, he reapplied himself to their cultivation, eventually developing stalks that would lift off the ground the second they were scythed from their anchors in the dirt.

It was his son, William, who made the next discovery- in the process of binding a particularly lifty bundle of stalks, he found that the collection began to float up towards the rafters. When he jumped to grab onto this bundle, his weight drew them down, but then a curious thing happened- the stalks seemed to draw upon Will's own magic, and the boy and bundle burst up through the thatched roof. The boy clung on for dear life, but that only seemed to accelerate their ascent.

He was bewildered, but still a boy- once the panic passed, he found great fun in lurching about, this way and that, hundreds of feet in the air. After separating several of the stalks, his own weight and the lessened aggregate lifting effect brought him back to the ground.

[add in hijinks around night floating and haunting people and bombing enemies with frogs]

He didn't tell his father about his adventure- not immediately. Instead he carefully collected the bundles into many, much smaller sheafs, in order to prevent the lifting effect from becoming an issue in getting their wares to market.

A few weeks later, the boy had a revelation while staring at his clumsy but attractive cousin Myrtle. As it was raining, they were working closely together in the portion of the barn that still had a roof. Will was separating hot ashes from a young dragon's manure into a brass vase, to later be mixed into their fertilizer. Myrtle was churning butter and teasing William by making all sorts of suggestive and indecent noises while working the dash pole. The girl would often get entangled with just about anything, possibly due to a lingering childhood jinx that caused her hair and ribbons to wrap around nearby objects like a climbing vine. On this occasion...

Myrtle turned in concern when her stern was burned by the wyvern urn, and upturned her churner.

William set aside his moment of poetic inspiration for another sort of revelation. He exclaimed, "If the lift is anchored at the base, I could grasp the handle and the whole thing would tip forward!" (...or something to that effect- he said it in Old Saxon or Welsh or something).

William used the butter churner as a base and drilled holes into it so his toes could interleave with the stalk heads to feed them magic. He anchored the dash pole to the lid with pegs, gaining him a footrest in the bargain. When he first flew the flying churn-top, he found that he would need to rest back to an upright position and step around the base in order to reverse direction. The shaft as well needed to be quite long to afford him more options in changing his pitch, though he couldn't shimmy too far up the pole or his toes would lose their connection to the lifting stalks.

It took months to years of tinkering to work out the selection of stalks for optimal lift quality and find better ways to join and bind them in order to balance the flight, but this was the first example of what became our modern flying broomstick.

Will and his father showed off the invention at market, where it drew much head-scratching from the serious-minded hedge wizards and farmers. Their children were much more enthused, as were a quartet of German merchants. They asked many questions and eventually left with knowledge of Orton's Straight-growth Charm.

Orton's lifting rye had no success as a thatching material though- it all tended to lift up and separate, leaving gaps in the thatch rather than settling in to provide proper shelter. The grain didn't taste any better, either.

Years later, the German merchants had cultivated their own lifting plants, using wand-quality woods for both the shaft and twigs. They had discovered how to make the shaft from a horizontal branch in order to get a lifting body with perpendicular bias and leverage the twigs to control thrust and direction, thus advanced the technology of the flying pole into its more modern broomstick form. Wandlore is a factor here, as it was much easier to control via enchantment than physically adjusting the twigs.

[][]

Rumor suggests that Baba Yaga used Orton's Straight-growth Charm on a stalagmite forming in a limestone cave that eventually became the pestle in her flying mortar-&-pestle. Yaga is also known as the first and only witch to permanently change herself into a hag so that she'd always have strong nails and teeth, so we don't discount the looney coming up with such a scheme. Rumor also suggests that her plan to make a narrow shaft of stone self-levitating was not done for the sake of a flying device, but that's a tale for an older and less-scrupled audience.

** On the Origin of the Hogwarts Express

"Why do we hafta take this stupid train trip, anyway?"

"Long ago, four magical people of extraordinary skill and vision came together and built the greatest library of magical knowledge since the destruction of Alexandria..."

Before [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=711922&postcount=3668][Pottermore nerfed it]], I had a notion that there used to be a pilgrimage of those young people being collected to receive their magical education. It was done yearly, but the students wouldn't normally return home until they had reached a skill level that could keep their powers in check and enough sense to prevent others from controlling them. So every year after the harvest, the professors would travel to the places where stories of remarkable children were being told, found out who had the gift and 'bought' them from their parents for the next five years (apprenticeships in the muggle world operated the same way).

Later on the walking pilgrimage became a caravan. As it had evolved, people had taken note of the friendships being forged during the often difficult journey, and it grew into a part of the Hogwarts experience just as much as being Sorted or casting your first flawless spell.

Some purebloods might have wanted to skip the arduous journey, but the wiser ones knew that alliances are forged under conditions of shared hardship.

After the Statutes were implemented, the Ministry took note that the pilgrimage/caravan was getting a bit too conspicuous. At first they used a mix of quick travel methods, but the purebloods didn't want to subsidize muggleborns by paying for their Floo powder or portkeys. A ship was contemplated, but the first test voyage was beset by storms (likely induced by the young passengers' discomfort, which shows that accidental magic doesn't always act for the benefit of its creator). Suffice to say, the ship plan sank.

Thus, when the implementation of rail lines came about, the Wizarding world was only too happy to leverage it for their own needs

** The wizarding world is /tiny/.

There are only thirteen schools, of which the "big three" are Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons... but of those, only eight are for general education. The rest are specialized schools like the Academy of Broom Flying and the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts.

The interpretation where Hogwarts has a student population of over 1000 students falls apart quickly when you think of the working conditions of the professors - you'd end up with 100 hour work weeks for the heads of houses - Minerva and Slughorn are around 70 and 70-110 in canon, I don't think that 10 hours for sleeping, eating, showering with no weekends off is realistic for them. Much more realistic is a 250-300 students at a given time. Considering that we know of about 10 students a house a year, that just about fits.

That means that in the wizarding world there is a maximum of 2400 children between the ages of 11-17. Assuming that the percent of those are half than those for the muggle population (though that is extremely liberal), we can extrapolate that the entire wizard population of the world has a maximum population of around 60000 people - more realistically half that. This explains why such a small group of people (the Death Eaters) could cause such havoc, and why the Battle of Hogwarts with the 150 fatalities was such a huge thing. One out of 400 up to one out of every two hundred wizards /in the world/ died during that battle.

The Voldemort wars were at least as significant to wizards as WWI and WWII are to us.

Further, we are led to believe that spell crafting is dangerous, so i dont think that there would be such a large number of spells that there appears to be in canon.

**** Well, you have to consider that there were wizards for over 2000 years, with life spans and quality of life far better than muggles for most of that time. Hogwarts may very well have the largest library in the world, after all it is the most important academic institute of the past thousand years.

***** Considering the long life-span and the (apparent) small number of children per family, it would seem like the total number of magicals that have existed over the last 2000 years is still not that large of a number.

***** Wizards are also likely to have a much better developed tradition of literacy. Per capita, more wizards write books than muggles.

Also, the ability to magically preserve books makes it so that hogwarts can have just about every book ever written, aside from the ones intentionally excluded.

*** i also feel like the other professors would be some how 'aligned' with a house and help with some of the associated 'house duties'. we never see them because no one takes them, but can't you see Professor Babbling helping out with the Ravenclaws? Or Vector with the Gryffindors? Especially Sinistra since she only teaches once a week.

It's also on the harddrive of a computer that I watched its plug short in the socket and refuse to turn on again. I have so much data (pictures, videos, fics) that is located no where else that I am terrified to even try and fix it for fear that the harddrive is dead and its permanently lost (barring a $500-1500 bit scanning or whatever they call pulling the disk out and running it through an expensive machine).

***** Sorry to hear about the HDD. If you have access to another computer with USB, just get one of these (or any other compatible 2.5" laptop HDD dock):

[[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153066][Thermaltake BlacX N0028USU External Hard Drive SATA Enclosure Docking Station 2.5" & 3.5" USB 2.0]]

Look for an online instruction set for how to remove the HDD from your laptop, gently plug it into the dock (which hooks up via USB to a working computer), and it should just register as an external USB drive.

You can do this on a borrowed system or a library computer (if USB connections are allowed). Find and copy off your files to another USB drive or an internal HDD and use a free cloud service to store the files if at all possible.

I use [[https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive][Amazon Cloud]] and [[https://drive.google.com/][Google Drive]]. These need some setup, and need to be installed on the computer in question, but they can be run from a friend's computer to upload, then simply logged out of and uninstalled afterward while preserving the online copies. You can then clean up your friend's computer without risking losing your data. There are also really cheap USB stick drives in the low GB range you can buy or borrow from a friend.

I've done this all before and it is really, really easy. If the HDD still works, this will work. It takes a few hours to "get" cloud storage, but it is free and there are tutorials to walk you through it. And it means never losing files again to computer failures.

It doesn't get you your computer back, but it does retrieve those files for less than $50. And if it doesn't work, for some reason, you haven't damaged anything and can just put the laptop HDD back in.

If you show a friend how this works, they might even buy the device for themselves and let you use it in exchange for the lesson in data retrieval and backup.

Good luck.

** It is not possible for someone under imperious to cast Avada Kedavra, Crucio, Expecto Patronus, or any spell that require a strong emotional component. Under the imperious, you feel "a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable happiness." Casting any of the above spells is simply incompatible with the feelings under the imperio. If the person under the imperio would manage the feelings required for those spells, it would break the control imperio exerts (presumably before the spell is actually cast, but not necessarily). (The patronus does require happy feelings, but of a "positive" type. Not just the mindless happyness that the imperio gives.)

From HPMOR: the secret on how to create a fidilius charm was put under the fidilius charm shortly after it was discovered. (Obviously not canon, as fidilius is still known ...)

--------------

Three or four hundred years after Hogwarts was founded became the beginning of the British Magical world's golden age. This was because of the Hogwarts house system, specifically the Ravenclaw house.

The Ravenclaw house encouraged knowledge. And now there was a new central location for research and scholarships. All which spurred inventions, etc. However, after several hundred years, all of the "low hanging" fruits of research were uncovered.

But it is the way of things that radical new ideas are never easily accepted, and so Ravenclaw house eventual becomes more about grades than amount discovery. The

This is part of why the magical world is stuck in the past. They are trying to hold onto their golden age.

** I just think that if Eileen Prince had left Tobias Snape that Severus would be just as snarky as canon but would look and act a lot more healthy. A lot of what he is today-snarky greasy anti-social git with sallow skin- could have been remedied with a nicer childhood. Granted, it would have meant he would not have met Lily until school but he also could have avoided most of the Marauder's mechinations because he didn't look as poor and weak [this is assuming that Eileen had gone back to her family and they accepted her but she sounds like a competent brewer so really she could have gotten a job as a Potions Mistress or started her own business or something]. This prevents a lot of the plot of canon from happening even going so far as maybe having Snape not joining the Death Eaters and hearing the prophecy. Sure maybe someone else heard it and told Voldemort [and Voldemort kills the Potters and then takes over the world] but it's not Snape.....

whelp I have fanfiction to write.

*** It's used in fanfiction to make the abuse by the Dursley's appear even more vicious- the idea that Harry didn't know his name was Harry until he went to school at 5, being called 'freak' or 'boy' up until then. This references known real-world abuse scenarios like the one in the biography 'A Boy Called It'.

Vernon actually did use Harry's name once or twice in PS, and I'm guessing that Dudley would have referred to him as "Harry" (i.e., "Mum, Harry took my toy!").
