I remember a fic in where the summary said something like: "In where Harry's cupboard has a light bulb" or something like that.

I guess I'm looking for interesting "Butterfly effect/for want of a nail" fics, but where the inicial change Is small, but the consecuences are far larger.

Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.

Eh, that's not really the only divergence. Lord Voldemort had hundreds of Horcruxes, and Harry wasn't one of them. Dumbledore had to sacrifice his own brother by refusing a ransom demand. Sirius Black was evil after all, and forced Peter Pettigrew to take on his appearance (because Peter was a Metamorphmagus) and go to Azkaban in his place. And probably dozens of other little things. Above all, lots of people's personalities are quite different, altering the whole tone of the story.

He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.

#+end_quote

The most famous one I can think of is linkffn(On the way to greatness) Everything is canon up to the sorting, but instead of listening to Harry, the Hat simply sorts him as Slytherin. Sadly incomplete.

This is more of a "single change to the world" rather than to Harry, but in linkffn(Magical Relations) Dudley becomes a wizard too. Keeps the whimsy of the original works, though it doesn't go past the summer before Harry's 6th year.

** Mastermind Hunting by Louis IX (I don't know how to add the story link)

Anyway the Dursleys accept Harry and adopt him because Dudley dies in chid birth because of a drunk surgeon. They treat him like a son and accept his magic eventually having more kids. Because they accept him Harry learns to control his magic and when he uses it publicly to save his you ger brother the secret services get onto him. Harry and his family travel the world on the run from the government and Harry further develops his magic. The story is something 600k long and is complete with no sequal required. I thought it flowed nicely and while Harry is powerful it sorta makes sense. Definitely would recommend.
