Okay, I'm the first to admit that I have NEVER liked Sirius Black. He's my least favorite character, and I think it's because he was too foolhardy, rash, and just all-over a bad influence on Harry.

So, you can imagine I don't read fanfics that center around him, I've never liked the time travel fics where Hermione ends up with him and honestly I've never really enjoyed any Marauder-based fics time travel or otherwise.

I read Debt of Time over the course of 3 days. It's amazing. It is incredibly well-written, the characterization and development is incredible, and...guess what...it's a hermione/sirius time travel fic. It's the first one I've ever read that I've enjoyed.

Please. Read it. Even if you don't like the pairings or even the main plot, try it out.

** Also, OP, if you haven't read it yet I HIGHLY recommend linkffn(One Hundred and Sixty Nine by Mrs J's Soup)! I read it before DoT and just fell in love with the pairing and concept - it's also a great "balm" in a lot of ways after DoT, because this time Hermione actually CAN change things.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** I kind of liked that she couldn't, because that's usually what the time travel fics are about. It was a nice change to read one that was more centered on happiness, recovery from the war, making good friends and less on destroy voldemort from the very beginning or doesn't even mention it.

**** That's a good point! Definitely the whole "live your life" thing is such a huge part of DoT. Still, I would recommend 169 - it's just a great story and there really aren't a ton of great stories with this pairing or concept. Definitely worth it! (And even still, she can't save /everyone/, and I kind of like that too).

*** Right? I found the entire thing to be moving along at a reasonable pace, with the plot rarely straying if at all and kept everyone in character or showed the development of the character. And it's incredibly long and I loved that haha.

I actually just pulled that one up myself and am on the first chapter.

** I'm a current beta for another of her stories, and this is the first story of hers I read.

For those wondering, this story was written awhile ago, and is currently being edited with a team of betas and reposted. The FFN version is edited for M, while the NC-17 version is being cross-posted to AO3 at linka03(Debt of Time by Shayalonnie). Her current plan is to finish posting the complete story around November to both sites.

** I had been avoiding the fic for so long because I wasn't a fan of the pairing and I thought that the story would be full of cliches and poor writing due to the summary. I decided to try it a few months ago and was hooked. The plot is really nice, and it had me guessing the resolution throughout the arcs. It's a well-planned story with realistic depictions of teenage/young adult romance, which I found refreshing. I really liked how there was foreshadowing and references to events in the beginning of the story.

I found some similarities between this fic and linkffn(Pride of Time) in the beginning, but both branch apart in the romance pairings and themes.

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

** Even with the time travel I just can't read this kind of pairings, in my mind I can't help but image a 30ish year old Sirius/Remus/Snape and a 13 year old Hermione... Stuff of nightmares..

*** Yes, that's generally my issue but for some reason this did not do that. So, maybe give it a try? I hate Sirius/Hermione but for some reason it works, and she did a really good job connecting a lot of future plots lines and plausible explanations for a lot of things. She did a good job with characterization between the young marauders and the old.
