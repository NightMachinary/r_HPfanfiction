Harry had felt it more than once in his life. Or death he supposed This time like every other he came to in the cupboard under the stairs with his Uncle Banging on the door shouting for him to wake up and fetch the morning paper for him.

This was his 7th time waking up like this , Each lifecycle having been more disastrous than the last This last time round Ron had accidentally killed him trying to help him evade filch in their first year. Harry had fallen off a fourth floor landing and just kept plummeting until he hit the stone floor below. It had been rather painfully but at least a tad bit more interesting then being bitten by a spider a seven and having an allergic reaction or the catastrophe with Cedric and the astronomy tower. In his second life.

Harry got up out of his cot under the stairs and stretched as he entered the hallway to get the morning paper of the strangest reason he was craving he was craving the horrible half burnt eggs his aunt made on Wednesday when they were late for church at st. James.

Death made him ravenous for the strangest things.

I thought church was Sundays and special holidays.

**** Do you think the Durselys, the epitome of English xenophobia, would be practicing roman catholics? At best they would be nominally Anglican and only go to church for Christmas and Easter

***** Probably not, just stating the one day a year that I know church is always offered on a Wednesday. I suppose Christmas sometimes falls on Wednesdays too.
