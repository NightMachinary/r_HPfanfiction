I love reading the slow burning sexual tension between characters, but get really disappointed when after all that lead-up it ends in a single kiss or something. Doesn't necessarily need to be anything sexual (especially not if underage characters), but a big, dramatic climax in their relationship towards the end is what I'm looking for (no pun intended). Mid-long stories preferred.

I definitely would prefer the story set at Hogwarts, any era is fine, preferably between characters who are at least 14-15 if not older by the time romance comes into play (though if the story begins with them as children, that's fine.) If an adult character is involved, both parties should be at least 17 (adult under Wizarding laws). Would prefer to avoid scenes of rape and gratuitous violence.

My favourite characters to read are Hermione, Luna, Harry, Tom Riddle and Lily Evans, and I usually prefer M/F relationships, but I'm up for pretty much any character/pairing. AU is fine, so long as it's set at Hogwarts, or similar, but would prefer characters to be more or less IC.

Edit: Towards the medium side of medium-long is what I'm looking for. As great as the 1,000,000 word stories you guys have been suggesting sound, I'm not sure I have the time to commit to reading something that's as long as the original series, unless it is actually the original series. So long as there's like 10-20 chapters of flirtiness and tension before the relationship really progresses, that's slow enough for me. Could deal with less than that, even.


** Linkffn(4098039)

Harry and Potter and the Fifth Element, recently completed with over a million words. It's really really slow but also well written. Romance is also a major part of the story. H/Hr

******* I am also positive that he was described as blonde in books, films and all other canon sources, with unremarkable grey eyes and a fairly average, slender build. He was neither particularly popular amongst his peers, male or female, nor particularly smart or well-read, and, though his prejudice goes as deep as any wizard's ever has, preferred Harry Potter as a victim over Hermione Granger or Ron Weasley, throwing only occasional half-arsed jabs at the two of them.

However, the majority of fanfiction writers will insist that he has gorgeous, flowing silvery platinum locks, eyes as deep and blue as the ocean, and abdominal muscles that can clearly be seen rippling through his semi-transparent shirt. He is, in their eyes, a positive God of sex, having bedded half the women in Hogwarts and then some, and is constantly surrounded by a band of loyal followers that far extends beyond Crabbe and Goyle. His academic prowess is rivaled only by that of his arch nemesis, target of the majority of his bullying, the stunning but bookish beauty Hermione Granger, who will no doubt convince him that muggles aren't so bad with her clever retorts and sizzling curves.

I blame Tom Felton for imprinting that image in most fanfiction writers' minds.

Yes, I know exactly what you're on about and I've read enough of that to wonder exactly if they're writing about the small time bully and wannabe big guy Draco or some daydream they've had about Tom Felton.

By the way, that was one hell of a good summary of how the majority of Draco/Hermione is written. I applaud you. XD

******** While I agree with the whole unremarkable looks aspect, I could still see Draco being a charming bastard. Sure, Harry hated his guts, but it's not like Harry made that much of an effort to get to know Slytherins or people who would view them more neutrally. Also, while I don't think Draco and Hermione were necessarily academic rivals, it seemed to me that successfully fixing the vanishing cabinet was evidence of some above average intelligence in his part.

********* While I can see it potentially happening, Draco pulling a few charming moves and upgrading to better friends, attracting the attention of one or two girls, it very much annoys me when fanfiction states it as though it's such an obvious thing, as though he's always been surrounded by a fawning harem of gorgeous women, and he barely ever associated with Crabbe and Goyle, always opting for the company of cooler, more interesting characters like Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass, when there's no evidence of him even associating with these people in canon.

My belief is that Draco probably wasn't very popular amongst his classmates, Slytherin or otherwise. He was a self-important bully, openly bigoted, loudmouthed, and generally not a nice guy. Even amongst those who did hold with his ideologies of pure-blooded supremacy, they probably didn't want to spend all their time talking about it, or be associated with someone who was so vocal about it. He cheated and bribed his way onto the Quidditch team and then promptly lost most every match, which can't have made him popular amongst Quidditch players or fans. In his first year he lost his house 50 points in one night, which probably didn't win him many points either.

I think Draco had a lot in common with his Aunt, in that he took things way too far, got unnecessarily obsessive, and the people around him, even those who agreed, seldom wanted to deal with the consequences. Unfortunately, Draco seems to lack the strength to back it up, or prefers to run to bigger, badder players for help, so rather than coming off as crazy and fearsome, he's simply annoying and weak.

As for his academic prowess, I'm by no means suggesting that he was stupid. Most likely, he rests a little above average in terms of intelligence. However, Draco comes from a privileged background, and has come to expect everything to be handed to him throughout life. I doubt he would have put much effort into his studies, and probably wouldn't have been above bribing and cheating his way to better grades. Certainly, we never saw him achieve anything spectacular in his schoolwork; despite potions being cited as his best subject, he wasn't part of the Slug Club, and never really excelled at any other subject, just coasted along with good enough grades to get by. Though he showed he was adept at casting advanced, and particularly dark spells when he wished, he seems to simply have not taken enough interest in his school work to really have bothered.

As for the vanishing cabinet, though we can ascertain that it was tricky, we have no idea how advanced the magic used actually was, and it did take him nearly a year. I'd hasten a bet that even Crabbe and Goyle would have somehow found a way to get the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in that time scheme, if Voldemort was breathing down their necks.

I don't know, they just have this quality about them that makes them feel soft and dreamy but also harsh and realistic, and the characters... just wow.
