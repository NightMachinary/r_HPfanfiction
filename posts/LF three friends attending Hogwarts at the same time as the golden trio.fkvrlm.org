Looking to reread a series about three friends slightly older then the golden trio, at Hogwarts while Harry and co. Are there. First story starts out with the three (not the golden trio)visiting a Muggle pub in the village one of them lives in while not at Hogwarts. I believe the three characters are all In Slytherin, but non are blood purists or sympathetic to the death eaters.


** linkffn(Latet Anguis In Herba) is the first of two

#+begin_quote
  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

*** More than 2 - I think there are 8 in the same arc. 4 with the Slytherins (which I still need to read) and then the excellent next-gen Stygian Trilogy, which takes place in the same canon-compliant continuity. Plus around 10 chapters of a sequel to the trilogy.
