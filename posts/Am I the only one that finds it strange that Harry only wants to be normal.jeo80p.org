He grew up surrounded by the Dursleys who were so obsessed with being normal that they abused him because they thought he wasn't. I just don't understand how he is obsessed with being 'Just Harry' a normal kid, when he grew up being treated like a slave by people who considered themselves normal.


** Harry doesn't want to be 'normal'. He doesn't like being famous because of something that happened to him as a baby. I don't think he minds people recognising him for his own achievements - he's happy to be known as a good Seeker, for example.

He just doesn't like being 'the Boy-Who-Lived' because it reminds him that his parents were murdered and he had to grow up with muggles who hate magic and don't seem to like him overly much either.

I think his main issue is that he doesn't want anyone to put him on a pedestal, he doesn't want to be seen as some sort of messianic figure because in his own mind he's just doing what anyone else would do in his situation. I think in many ways Harry sees himself as just an ordinary bloke forced to do strange things, but everyone else sees him as an extraordinary figure on the level of ancient heroes and mythological figures.

** The Dursley's are "normal" for muggle standards, and Harry wants to be "wizard" normal, like Ron. Being a wizard is already un-Dursley-ish, so that's enough for Harry. He just doesn't want to be considered "weird" or "special" amongst wizards.

** He went from being "not normal" with the Dursleys (and many of the people around them, due to all the rumours the Dursleys started and his weird clothes) to "not normal" in the wizarding world. I don't think he wants to be what the Dursleys consider normal, but just wants to be a normal person in the wizarding world. I mean, would you enjoy everyone staring at you all the time?

** I don't think Harry was obsessed with being normal. I think fan fiction is obsessed with exaggerating the sentiment. If he was obsessed with anything it was not being like Voldemort and, even then, he accepts the similarities in the end.

By the by "Just Harry" is part of a line from the Sorcerer's Stone movie and has been taken out of context. The actual line goes something like "I can't be a wizard. I'm just Harry."

Edit: I can't spell

** Abused kids rarely want to stand out because they've had it reinforced that attention always leads to something bad happening.

You can try to read it as "ah hah, now the obsession with the appearance of normality is on the other foot, ironically" but it's really just him trying to avoid attention that's always been negative. He'd literally rather deal with another troll than have to face everyone in the hall suddenly looking at him, regardless of why they're doing it, because in his mind it's /always/ negative.

It's not unlike how Harry goes from getting in trouble for upstaging Dudley at school (which, I know, not that hard) and thus being at least a moderately okay student, to perpetually trying to hide his academics behind /Ron's/ as soon as he gets to Hogwarts, no matter how excited he was to learn magic. He's afraid of being rejected if he does better, because that's what he's been shown will happen.

And while Ron's not the best student, half his problem is being given a worn-out non-matched wand and having never set foot inside an actual school with curriculum before being shipped to Hogwarts and expected to independently research and write essays with no further instruction. Harry has neither of those problems holding him back, the only excuse for him to do just as poorly is because he's /trying/ to.

** That's precisely why. At a subconcious level, Harry still seeks their approval. Some kids would want to be as far from "normal" as possible yes, but Harry is not one of them.

Then there's Hogwarts, Harry finds out he's a Wizard. Great. Then he finds out he's famous, some people want to worship him, others would happily see him dead. There's even an undead asshole specifically gunning for Harry. Not so great. Even as a Wizard he stands out. If he were "normal" none of this would happen(to him). If he were normal, chances are he'd have his parents, more siblings, his godfather, etc. I for one can't blame him.

** It's not strange, for Harry to want to be normal, he grew up with the Dursley's, after all. And they strived for being normal (which in turn, made them not normal)

Plus, year after year, at Hogwarts, crazy stuff happened, that no one should go through. It'd make sense, he'd want some normalcy in his life.

** I think you're misinterpreting the "just Harry" line. Harry went from being "that delinquent who everyone hates because we said so" to "all hail the great hyphenated title, glorious champion who definitely isn't an abused child". Nobody sees him as himself, just what they think he should be.
