A fanfiction I read a while ago, where the magic and dueling where described almost like air disturbances? No spells, as far as I remember, and I think it took place during the tri-wis, with a duelling tournament instead of it, I think. The dueling/fighting was the main focus, all the characters had different styles. Simply can't remember the name or author, any help appreciated :-) !

Edit: I seem to have flair'ed wrong, I apologize. First Reddit post, wasn't 100% sure what I was/am doing.
