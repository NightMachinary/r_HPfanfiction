Not the other way around.


** Ignoring the moral and philosophical arguments here. Your best bet to finding something of that nature is to search for it on AO3.

Just be warned that AO3 doesn't really have much in the way of content moderation. So you're very likely to come across a large range of disturbing things in doing so.

*** That's why I was asking here, I've tried that already. You are indeed correct in that. I'm not going to go out of my way to read through hundreds of fic's on ‘that' list just to find what I was looking for, no matter my apathy to some more amorale fiction. I was hoping someone on this wonderful subreddit would already know of one.

Mores the pity. Oh well.

**** But since they are minors all throughout canon, including the appearance of love potions at age 16, it is at best a /risky/ request.

***** I ‘do' also feel the need to point out that 17 is the ‘of age point' in Magical Britain. I don't know weather that's Canon or Fanon, but it ‘is' generally accepted as fact. So, we're talking on the same vain as poeple in the US that are 20 drinking alcohol. The ‘of age point' is 21 is America. And let's be honest, sixteen year old's have sex in the real world which vague regularity. Who's to say they don't also in Fiction.

****** It's actually 16. Most of Europe has an age of consent between 14 and 16.

*** Ah. I didn't mean with kids. Given, it's still likely rape anyways, which means now I need to think about ‘other' things fanfic has desensitized me too. But still, fiction will be fiction; I don't subscribe to restrictions on what I should or shouldn't allow myself to read. I read all kinds of mild and all kinds of super messed up things, and I suppose I'm better for it, rather than to stay in the dark.

That isn't to say I ‘get off' on this kind of thing. Not by a long shot infact, I just don't find it as disturbing as I probably would, if I wasn't over 1k fic's into the rabbit hole that is FFN, and I didn't hold the mindset I do regarding fiction.

When looking for a fic like my request, I found literally dozens of fic's were Harry is the one under the love potion. Apparently the community is fine with making stories on that premise. All I wanted to know was if anyone had ever reversed the roles. Is harry raping hermione REALLY all that much worse than hermione raping harry? -to use your terminology.

Given, love potion ‘would be' rape in our world, if it did indeed force you into the act, against your sober will; but that isn't strictly to say it necessarily is in every iteration of the Potter-verse. Maybe the potion isn't all that powerful, maybe it doesn't control you, or it can't create love, simply expanding apon love that is already present. Or maybe it just changes what one would conside attractive, lust instead of love.

Hopefully, no right minded individual would force themselves on someone just because of their looks, but again, we live in a world where that already exists. Is it so strange to assume it would also exist in fiction?

To sum it up though, I suppose, I don't want to get into a philosophical discussion over weather on not rape is ‘okay'. No, in a real world set IT IS NOT. You won't get any argument from me on that. But No, I'm looking at the depths of deprivations of Fiction. Where ‘real world rules' only apply at the discretion of the writer, and the feelings of the characters don't matter, because they don't actually exist.

So, to reiterate: Does anyone know if there's a fanfic out there where Hermione gets dosed with Love Potion, and Harry takes advantage?

(I will leave the considerations over weather or not harry was the one to give it to her, or if he was dosed too, to you)

***** Oh god. I forgot about that. It ‘probably' didn't occur to me at the time, but it was three months ago so who knows, and also it's ‘fiction' so who cares. People write all kinds of F'd up stuff, and I see enough requests for forced!DM/HG to know it's not going to go away.

For the record, I think Draco/Hermione is discussing, but who am I to tell people what to write or read; I just won't read it, myself.
