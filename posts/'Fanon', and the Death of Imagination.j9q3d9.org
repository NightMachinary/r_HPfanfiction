This may be an unpopular opinion, but I dislike the mere idea of fanon, and even head-canon causes me some level of minor annoyance when I see people talk about it.

Don't get me wrong, I love world-building that moves beyond canon. A story that really puts effort into making the world of Harry Potter larger than it was in the books, or more alive, will always have my support. The problems come when some idea becomes large enough that it starts to be treated as canon-adjacent.

Ice-Queen Daphne, Arithmantic Spell Creation, Runic Wards, Mental Landscape Occlumency, Honourable Warrior Goblins, Lordships of the Wizengamot, and so many more.

None of these ideas are bad. In fact, I suspect the reason why they became so popular was that people found the possibilities presented by them to be really interesting. The problem is that Ice-Queen Daphne is not /more/ interesting than every other possible characterization for her character. Where is lazy rebellious Daphne? Where is childish, spoilt Daphne? Where is actually bitchy and unpleasant Daphne? Where is slightly dense, but generally a good person Daphne?

They all had to die so that the Ice Queen could rule.

The same is true of all the tired old tropes. They can be fun, they can be interesting, but they are not /so/ interesting that it is worth throwing away all the other possibilities just so we can have more of the same.

So much of the time I feel like I'm reading paint-by-numbers in fic form. The writing may be technically strong, but every part of the story is something I've seen before, and it makes me sad. There's still so much that remains unexplored.

But maybe that's just me. I wonder what others think about this. Do you want creativity from the stories that you read, or do you crave the comfort of the familiar?

I guess my response would be that I want both, depending on my mood. The problem is that when I /do/ go out looking for a story with an interesting, fun, or unique take on the world, I almost always fail to find it.


** I don't mind fanon consistency, I just think tropes shouldn't be replacing characterization and plotting. If treading old ground, the writing needs to make it interesting and fresh.

**** If someone is writing clichés, that's not good writing. I don't care how poetic their prose is. Tension, characterization, plotting... Clichés are just poorly written tropes. Poetic prose doesn't make something well-written if it misses the mark on those other points. Don't cede the ground that they have technically good writing. 'Their sentences are pretty' is just lipstick on a pig.

*** Tropes ARE characterisation and plotting. That's literally what a trope is, it's a device used to do those things. Like, if you didn't have a characterisation trope, you couldn't even have a Hero or a Villain. Those are both 'tropes', by actual definition.

**** Tropes are devices to assist in characterization and plotting. They are not the characterization and plotting. Hero and villain are easily recognizable devices, which are then played upon by the writer. If they are not played upon, or the author just inserts various tropes without doing any narrative or character work, then it will be cliched. Of course, if you try to avoid tropes, it will also be a mess. Nobody is perfectly original, and that is fine.

**** I think this is a chicken and egg thing.

Tropes are efficient ways of describing characters and plot elements, but they should not be what defines a character, or plot element.

It is true that it's pretty much impossible to create a character who does not match some set of tropes, but that doesn't mean a writer should start at the tropes and use those to define the character. The end result will only really be the empty shell of a character.

Buildings are made of doors, windows, walls, etc, but you don't design a home by making a list of walls, windows and doors. You'd just end up with a pile of bricks, timber and glass. It's about how you arrange them and, importantly, it's about the spaces you create between them.

** I don't mind fanon/tropes (I even have a few I unequivocally adore) but I do mind when it isn't fleshed out. Example: I like Manipulative!Dumbledore but I don't like being told that he is manipulative (I honestly don't even want to see the word), I don't want a cheesy villain monologue or his eyes twinkling menacingly while he is hoarding Harry's 25 gringotts vaults. I like when a writer treats a trope as if the reader has never come across it before, giving it a place in the broader story.

*** We need a full Crackfic where Dumbledore snaps, decides to become a Villain, then realises he basically has no idea how to do that? So, he starts asking the Muggleborns for their favourite villains (because Wizarding Media is all 'Dark Lord this' and 'Dark Lord that' and that's a little bit close to home for him.)

Then the story is just Dumbledore trying out villain cliches and tropes and jotting down notes into some kind of manual for each. Mostly because I love the idea of a playful, humourous Dumbledore trying to pretend to be Dick Dastardly for a day. :D

*** Another approach is to treat the given fanon as a running joke. In A Wand for Skitter, Skitter consider Blaise's fearing his mom offering him a drink to mean "not all fears have obvious meaning", while in Harry Is A Dragon and That's Okay, Blaise shows uncanny understanding of poisonous ingredients, have Bezoar in his pocket at all times, and even once brought bunch of mildly poisonous cupcakes for Harry to eat (who is widely known to be invulnerable) because he don't want his house elf eat them.

** I get your dislike for fanon and rereading the same formula but with maybe different situations, but I don't get it what you have against headcanon since that refers to a reader's interpretation and extrapolation of information that we get from canonical sources and accept it as the truth. For example my headcanon is that until Voldemort's rise Avada Kedavra was not that often used. Actually it's not even most Death Eaters' go to spell even though it could quickly and cleanly do the job (we get that from the books) because not everyone finds it so easy to kill and most people, no matter how dark, still want to maintain their soul intact. However, judging from the downvotes I got for saying this, it's clearly not a popular opinion with the folks around here.

** people wrote what they want to read. People write for different reasons, and a great many want to read really tropey stuff, because that's their comfort zone and they want to stay there.

But the hp fandom is huge and so many people have been writing fics for so long that there is a plethora of work out there. There are honestly so many great and unique fics in this fandom. I think you might just be looking in the wrong places, or you just have never experienced being in a fandom where there are like, seventeen fan-fictions written for the fandom. Ever.

I have been trying to put together a collection of some of the most unique odd ducks out there on ao3, but I suck at admin, so it's currently got like three fics in it I think.

In the end though, if you can't find what you're looking for the best bet is to write it and stop yelling about people not doing things that they're putting out there for free the way you want them to

*** I'd love to see your collection come to fruition, as I'd really love to believe that you're right. However, I have read many millions of words of fanfic, over many years, and I rather doubt that there is a huge, hidden store of wonderfully original stories that has gone beneath my notice.

Or, if there is, then it is so buried amongst the numberless fics that it might never see the light of day.

The thing about fanfiction is that a lot of its attraction is in its familiarity. You don't need to understand and invest in a new set of characters, like you do when reading a new original series. Thus, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that even within fanfiction circles the stories that garner the most attention (and, as a result, are easiest to find) are not necessarily the most original, but the ones that wrap their popular collection of tropes, story elements and borrowed world-building into the most grammatically inoffensive package.

there are also some ships or characters that will generally bring some newness and are less tropey, but you definitely have to be willing to read a lot of less unusual stuff to find the gold.

I read pretty much non stop because I'm stuck in bed pretty much all the time with my condition, and I would say I come across a truly different fic maybe once a fortnight?

So I agree. Let Voldemort do something completely different in order to cheat death. Really change it up!

** I'll explain it one sentence really. Tropes are popular for lazier writers who don't devote the time to explore the world building, of end up being used and explored upon for the plot. Examples of the former is in most Ice Queen stories. Examples of the latter can be found in Ashes of Chaos, and Prince of Slytherin. Both stories that have common "tropes" such as Wizengamot Lordships, but actually explore it further. There's a difference between saying there's such a thing as a lordship in your story, and not really exploring what it entails, compared to spending boatloads of time on it. This is where you hear the term "trope subversion" which is a big thing in stuff similar to that of Ashes of Chaos and Prince of Slytherin. Can a story be good with lazy writing? Yes, however it won't reach the sky like those that truly push their writing further and further.
