  With adulthood comes the realization that parents can't fix all. That there are dangers that are too big.This is the story of a war and the people who didn't want to fight in it but did anyway.

** Yes, one beautiful aspects of linkffn(7211094) is a May, house-elf reading Marx and dreaming about emancipation of the working class. Another interesting aspect of the story is that it tries to deal with families of all involved (mainly Evanses), which is kind of interesting point. Under normal circumstances people have their grandparents around: where are grandparents in the HP universe? Aside from Grans Longbottom and eventually Tonks, there are almost no older generations of ancestors in the HP universe than parents. Isn't it weird?

  Harry and Dudley learn about their muggle grandparents, and the struggles they faced while facing challenges of their own. Rated M for serious issues.

** [[https://snape-potter.dreamwidth.org/162365.html]] has Dimple the Socialist House Elf.

#+begin_quote
  "Elves in slavery aren't encouraged to better themselves," Dimple informed him, "and quite frankly, we do the 'Master mustn't be angry with Dimple! Dimple is a good elf!' crap in order to lull you all into a sense of false security. When the revolution comes, the Goblin wars will seem like a picnic in the park in comparison; or at least, they would, if we could be arsed to actually revolt."

  "Merlin," Harry said faintly. "I didn't realise you were a communist elf." Dimple shrugged.

  "A socialist, actually. I'm not impressed with the Muggle communist experiments, to be honest. But someone's got to run the country and elves seem in the main to be content to let wizards and witches do it. We have dreams of taking over the holiday islands of Lyonesse and Ys, but frankly, there's only so much time you can spend lazing on the beach eating ice cream or playing Wizarding bingo before your brain dissolves and leaks out of your ears."

  She pattered off back to the basement, humming something that sounded suspiciously like The Red Flag.

It does, alas, also include Snarry, which is a shame.
