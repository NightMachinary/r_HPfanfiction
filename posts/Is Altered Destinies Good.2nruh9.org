** It was fantastic for its time.

I think it's still excellent, but as with all things, age reduced its former glory.

Considering how some other fics of the time matured (think Unsung Hero), it's a marvelous relic of the past.

Sequel sucks though. Seriously, what was he thinking?

Also, it does get better over time. Not like ridiculously better, but there is improvement.

** Well I had something of the same issue - I made it 10 or so chapters in but stopped. Some of that at least is my fault for wanting a certain something (darker, grittier or something - just didn't seem all that much like Tom R jr. to me).

** The first 10 or so chapters are pretty bad, the story really picks up afterwords and becomes a lot less clich√©. The strength of the story is the WWII setting with the war against Grindelwald which doesn't start until a little ways into the story. Its aged quite a bit but I definitely think it's worth trudging through the first few chapters to read the rest.
