  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

  Response to DZ2's 'Harry, the Twice-Blessed Half-blood' challenge. Fem!Harry. There's back-story in the beginning but the main story's post-Hogwarts. Herakles Potter knew she was odd. Exactly how odd turned out to be far odder than she originally thought.

  Fem!Harry/Fem!Voldemort two-shot. Harriet couldn't save Ginny down in the Chamber of Secrets.

  #+begin_example
      I've been toying with the idea of a fem\!Voldemort for some time now\. I've seen it once or twice but mostly in crack fics, and I wanted to try writing something a bit more serious\. Tackling the issue of a female Dark Lord, considering that the structure of the magical world seems to be patriarchal, was a challenge I wanted to take\.You'll see that she's referred to as a "dark lord" or "master" but that'll be explained later on\. There are mentions of rape and explicit description of a sexual assault, so read at your own risk\.

** If you don't mind crossovers, here's one I like 'Black Sky' by Umei no Mai. It's a crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn, although it's mostly the HP world at the beginning.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

** Since fem!Harry and especially dark!Harry are OOC anyway, heres one I'd recommend. Princess of the Blacks and its sequels have Jennifer Black as a protagonist. I do like this OC a lot and the take on whats light and dark magic is refreshingly new. She basically takes on the role of Harry in this fic since its also a "Wrong Boy-Who-Lived story".

***** In the fandom, wizards always seem closer to a young adult age than they actually are, whether its kids seeming more adult (especially in pureblood families) or older wizards seeming younger. Just didnt really matter to me because I felt Persephone seemed like more of an adult due to her upbringing and how she perceives the people around her.
