I read fic where Harry is Dean's son and it was really interesting. Of course author changed timeline but you get the idea. Also I read fic Hermione/Dean and this is just amazing pairing!

Have you read something like that? Let me know! :)

This really cracked me up.

The premise is that Harry is off exploring new dimensions for the DoM and stumbled in the SPN universe. Sam and Dean immediately think he's some kind of demon god or something and it derails from there. I don't follow Supernatural but I enjoyed it all the same.

The following story about the same Harry stumbling in the MCU is also enjoyable.

** Can remember the name, but Harry was some super special animagnus, and Sam and Dean were the new Defense teachers.
