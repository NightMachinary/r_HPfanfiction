Hi guys! I know this topic has been asked on this reddit before, but I didn't really see any answers to it so I wanted to ask it again. I'm trying to write a fanfic involving WWW before and after the war. So, does anyone have any idea what their finances would look like? Like, how much would be a decent amount for them to be earning annually? Thanks! :)


** Despite what some fics tell you, don't go into 6-figure numbers. 1,000 galleons were enough for them to start, and that included a lot of potion ingredients and leasing a big space in the middle of Diagon Alley. Consider that you can buy a wand for 7 galleons, and unicorn hair, a very expensive ingredient, is worth 10 galleons for each hair, according to Slughorn. So their products shouldn't cost more than that, and a good half of them should be in sickles.

*** Single use stuff like individual Skiving Snackbox components (I can see them selling both pre-packed assortments and a pick-and-mix option for the troublemaker who wants to tailor their experience) or Ton Tongue Toffee might even be in Knuts.

The Weasleys grew up poor. They'd understand wanting to get bang for your buck from practical jokes. You can spend a LOT in that shop if you're really ambitious or have no self control...but for someone who has a simple little plan for exactly what kind of havoc they want to create, a well placed handful of small change never goes amiss either.

**** Yeah, I never considered perhaps mixing and matching various products to suit their needs. It's just difficult to place prices on these products especially since it feels like the prices can be all over the place at times (I think the Twins managed to earn like 26 galleons with Skiving Snackboxes selling to Hogwarts students in OOTP.) So thank you for the advice and comment! :)

***** If it helps, those would have been the prepacked assortment (more expensive), and Hogwarts in OotP would have been a great place to make money off the Snackboxes in particular - everyone has Umbridge to avoid!

*** I keep forgetting that unicorn hair costs more than a wand in the Harry Potter Universe! I always found that kind of strange, to be honest, considering that a wand is a wizard's 'universal tool' and far more important to them then perhaps a single-use unicorn hair. Thank you for the advice though! :)

**** Probably since wands are so important, you can't hike prices for them too much so that everyone can afford one. Maybe the Ministry covers half of the cost for the first years' wands for Ollivander or something.

Also, maybe you don't need the whole unicorn hair for the wand (it's probably quite long), so Ollivander can use one hair for multiple wands.

***** Yeah, I can see wands be subsidized to some extent considering tuition at Hogwarts is free according to J.K. Rowling! And true, it would make more sense from a business perspective too for the unicorn hair.

** Also consider that for 8ish months of the year their main customer base is away at boarding school. Maybe have them have something like a pop-up shop at Hogsmeade on the weekends students are allowed to go to the village

*** The business has more or less always had an owl post delivery service running from a catalogue. Before they got the physical premises on Diagon Alley, that was how they ran it - mail order out of their bedroom.

I'd be fascinated to see what kind of things they might have cooked up for younger children too. Everyone older than eleven might be away at school for eight months of the year, but what might a seven or eight year old want? What kind of toy or treat might someone buy a three year old?

Colour changing pencils? A bracelet with a built in Cushioning Charm that you could put on a toddler's wrist, so that whenever they inevitably do something stupid they bounce back up giggling (boing, boing, boing...) rather than hurting themselves and crying?

**** That bracelet certainly would have helped with poor Neville if he ended up being a Squib like his family all feared he would. (Still find it mildly disturbing that his great-uncle dropped him out the window to see if he could do magic.) But yeah, I feel like inventing products for smaller children would certainly have a huge market in the Wizarding World. Thanks for the advice! :)

***** You could have a lot of fun thinking up products.

- A teddy that can never get lost - No Tears Ted. The flipside of this is the *other* teddy, the one that occasionally turns into a spider :P

- Magical versions of those glow in the dark star stickers that we all had, so you can put stickers up all over your room.

- Temporary tattoos that move.

- Bubble-blowing mixture that makes bubbles in different colours, or bubbles that bounce, or one HUGE bubble that's big and strong enough to sit on.

- A toy “brew your own potions” kit, which either produces nothing but interesting bangs and smells or else makes simple sweets. Have you ever seen those kits that let kids make their own gummy worms and spiders and such? Like those.

******* Have some fun with it.

One Minute Moustache - grow truly fabulous facial hair!

Dragon Breath mints. Shaped like a dragon's tooth, eat one of these by mistake and your breath will smell worse than a Hungarian Horntail's backside!

An expanded range of canary creams. Why settle for a canary when you could poof into a parrot?

I wrote a Weasleys invention into my fic, and truth be told a lot of the plot relies on it...Memory Marbles. Pensieves are rare and priceless, so imagine how much money could be made if there was a cheaper, more accessible way to store and relive your favourite memory. They're small, so they can't have more than one memory on each marble in the way a Pensieve can, but it's a bit like a thumb drive. Have a bag full of them and pick your favourite.

(This is Molly Weasley's favourite WWW product, incidentally. It's the only one she wholeheartedly approves of)

...you could have a lot of fun just with that shop.

********* I needed a way for Harry to see someone else's memories that wasn't as hard to access as a Pensieve. The whole fic relies on that.

So I made one :)
