I can't remember all the details, but some highlights were that Fenrir kills Dolores, Pansy tricks Harry using a port key which sends him to snap, the Malfoy's stay with the Dursley's for a while and hate it, Lucious is in prison, Ginny and Harry fight a dragon while hunting for the horcruxes. I always considered it to be a rewrite of the 7th book and really enjoyed it.


** Probably the seventh horcrux by Melindaleo.
