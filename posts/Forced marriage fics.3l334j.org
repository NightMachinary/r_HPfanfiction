** Oddly enough forced marriage outside of Hermione/Draco or Snape marriage laws and accidental soul bonds is something I've never seen before. Do you think you could share some that you enjoyed?

#+begin_quote
  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.

** linkffn(the injunction by justcourbeau) that's Hermione/George with a handful of other ships. I read it recently and enjoyed it. I'll edit in some more later when I'm on my computer :)

Oh! How do you feel about soul bonds or mates? It doesn't exactly force marriage, but it's the same theme. I'll put two I liked at the very bottom.

Remus/Hermione: linkao3(of weddings and warfare) linkffn(a higher law by nynaeve80) linkffn(shared destinies by amightypenguin)

Severus/Hermione: linkffn(denial by little beloved) linkffn(his draught of delicate poison by subversa)

Hermione/Sirius: linkffn(I solemnly swear by hufflepuffpower93) linkffn(innocence by ceredwen) linkffn(necessary by the order by ladyseradereturns) linkffn(happily ever after by igobumpinthedark) linkffn(a hidden agenda by kia maro)

Hermione/Fred: linkffn(meant for each other by jamcreynolds) (I couldn't get through this one)

Soul Bond: linkffn(the debt of time by Shayalonnie)

Bond: linkffn(bond by Anna fugazzi)

Um. Yeah. I've read all of these, they're of varying quality (probably a preference thing more than actual good or bad). I really haven't seen many slash marriage law/breeding law fics, a lot of what I end up seeing there are bonds and/or mates.

      A little background: This story takes place in 1997\-98, the trio's seventh year\. This is therefore AU in which Dumbledore didn't die, and there was never an assignment for Malfoy to kill him\. Essentially what would happen if the Trio went to Hogwarts their seventh year and a marriage law sprang upâ€¦

          Not to worry, our dear Professor Lupin will be introduced very quickly\.

  A/U. At the end of war, the Wizengamot has passed a Marriage Law. The Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.

The Ministry won't tell them everything, hell, the Ministry doesn't even know everything.
