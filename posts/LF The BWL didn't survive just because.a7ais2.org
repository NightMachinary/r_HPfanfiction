Seriously, I doubt that Lilly and James were the only parents trying to shield their children from deatheaters (or other attacking wizards) in all of history! Seriously, there has to be more to Harry surviving! So give me fanfictions that look into this (bonus: If either (or both) of Harry's parents survived that night and made it very clear that Harry isn't some messiah! So he grows up without fame!)

As always: Please no slash and only well writen Harry/Ginny!

So, the stage is yours and thanks for all recommendations in advance :)

*** It is the fact that it is exceedingly few, not none. There is a subtle difference between improbable and impossible. Improbable means its probability is very very low but not equal to zero. Impossible means the probability is absolutely zero. This subtle difference should be visible in wizardkind's history.

I am not dissatisfied with Harry's survival but this sure does pop up in fanfiction from time to time.

**** The fact that Dumbledore and Voldemort both are able to identify what occurred, Dumbledore being able to do so without actually witnessing the event, shows that while it may be an extremely rare occurrence, it's not completely unique. They are familiar with the concept.

*** This... Though you forgot something. It also requires the person to willingly, and maybe meekly, accept death. James died trying to save his family, but that didn't help Lily much, why? Because James met Voldemort as a combatant, he intended to "hold him off" long enough for Lily and Harry to escape. Lily didn't have to die, Voldemort intended to spare her, but she didn't get out of the way, and begged Voldemort to kill her and not Harry. Most murderers in a situation where they are killing children have no intention of sparing the parents, and often parents will fight to protect their children. I think that is the difference.

â€‹

Also, while it is obviously rare, it can't be completely unique, Dumbledore was able to recognize what had happened right away (I believe he brings it up with this conversation with Snape that happened short after the Potter's death), and Voldemort was able to recognize what had happened after the fact (he talks about it in graveyard after he gets his body back). So while rather obviously a rare, and not commonly known phenomenon, it's not something that is unheard of by those more familiar with obscure magic/magical occurrences.

*** So essentially, it was because Voldemort violated the agreement between them.

Your logic is sound, but at the same time I can't help but think of that one robst fic where Harry defeats Voldemort through the magic of contracts.

** Lilly performing some sort of powerful magic to save her son seems to be a relatively common trope. It's the explanation for why Harry survived in the following fics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]] - Lilly and James engineered a trap that allowed themselves and their son to survive that night in Godric's Hollow. After the Goblet of Fire chooses its champions, 'Harry' finds out the truth of how it all happened. linkffn(4641394)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] - Harry meets his mother in an alternate universe in which she never got the chance to sacrifice herself for her son. She reveals that she had been developing a spell that would tie her soul to a strong protection for her child. linkffn(3401052)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] - Harry doesn't find out what his mother did until he receives some pensieve memories from the months before her death. linkffn(8163784)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] - The magic left by Lilly intervenes to save Harry's life while he is very young and living with the Dursleys. Much later Harry goes looking for his mother's research notes. linkffn(11762850)

** I don't have any good reqs, but I really like where your head is at.

I heard the theory that Harry's first canon death (the one that sends him to the train station scene) was a sacrifice like Lily's that crippled Voldemort's power against anyone /but/ Harry, and it got me thinking, looking past the awesome themes to smack some common sense on the whole boy-who-lived deal.

If you see the nursing room in Godric's Hollow as a crime scene; it contains two corpses and a reasonably upset baby. The first body is Tom Riddle and is partially exploded, bits of gore covering the walls. The second body is Lily Potter, a famously brilliant, compassionate and hot-tempered witch, dead from the Killing Curse. The baby is Harry Potter, who seems completely unharmed apart from a small magically reactive wound on his forehead.

How the hell do you come to the conclusion: "Obviously, the baby did it! he is the warrior of light!!11" and not "maybe the two adults in the room killed /each other/?"

*** Indeed, most of the wiz-world really consists dumbasses (they read one whiff of Rita Skeeter (note: I'd really like to know why people trust her when she's a gossip writer! Seriously, I don't trust tabloids - frankly if something is in a tabloid I am more likely to disregard it simply because it showed up there, despite the fact that it could be true) and suddenly someone is demented and dangerous, despite the fact that people know that said person has risked their life for others several times already -.-)...hell, maybe having awesome power makes you this way? I mean several science fiction writers bring this up, like in Babylon 5 where natural telepaths never evolve because they don't need technology to aid them in their survival (they don't need spears, bows, crossbows, guns etc. to hunt for example, because they can telepathically track prey and even immobilize said prey or compell it to come to them!)...
