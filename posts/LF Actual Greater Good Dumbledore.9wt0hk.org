Most people that put "Greater Good" in their fics have Dumbledore as either actually evil, making a powergrab, or some kind of bullshit agenda, and justify it in the AN's at the end with "Dumbledore is not Evil, he's a misguided Light Wizard" that actively plots the Death of a child in ways that Wile E Coyote would be willing to try on Road Runner if he heard about them.

I want to see a Dumbledore that ACTUALLY cares about the Greater Good. Like that fic where he gets all the Death Eaters in Azkaban given the Dementors Kiss, and the ones that got away with it killed by the Curse on the DADA position rather than some card carrying tool that feeds Harry love potions steals his money etc and "I only act for the Greater Good" like a deluded villain that thinks himself the hero.

Even if it happens after the First War at some point. Voldemort is revived? Dumbledore finally wakes up, reacts and decides to do something. Voldemort plans to break his followers out of Azkaban? Dumbledore finds a way to execute Bellatrix and co before Voldemort can free them. "They would cause harm to many. Killing them was for the Greater Good" Dementors going to join Voldemort? Dumbledore, off the books, does whatever is done at the end of Book 7 (There are no Dementors around post DH, someone must have got rid of them, sealed them, whatever happened) without Fudge or anyone realising. Things that make him seem utilitarian, as the "Greater Good" concept is supposed to be, rather than genuinely brain damaged.


** I think there's a reason this kind of Dumbledore is rare in fanfiction. If dumbledore is competent, good-aligned /and/ active, the burden of duty put unto Harry is lessened. Part of being canon Harry is to be /alone/ against Voldemort in so many ways.

** I had the exact same wish, so when I set out to write my own fanfic, I wanted to have /that/ kind of Dumbledore in it. I want him to make hard choices for the greater good as he believes it to be. While those decisions might not always pan out exactly as planned, his intentions are always good - even if people die as a result. It's one of my most important priorities with my fic.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** I never get this, it's implied Riddle was born evil thanks to the love potion, more importantly he's already torturing people before Dumbledore comes along, I really doubt him taking a different approach to his stolen objects would change much. As for Tom's school years, while Dumbledore didn't trust him he never really had any evidence of him doing anything wrong.

I suppose a more ruthless Dumbledore could have set a trap for him when he came to apply for the DADA job and killed him right there (though he already had horcruxes by then, so it wouldn't truly have finished him).

If you put someone like into intense therapy and treat them properly, they will not become insane mass murderer. And if you still think that they are that big of a danger to everyone, like literally the worst danger you can think of, you have to monitor them extremely closely.

With things like that, I'm kind of partial to the view that if you let them live, you're complicit in the crime of their existence. A creature that absolutely and utterly destroys souls in a universe where there is strongly suggestive evidence of existence beyond death? Destroying them by any means necessary is, if not morally obligatory, at least morally praiseworthy. /greatergood

**** That's one side of the argument. And I'm very sympathetic to it. But at the same time... you don't kill a nuclear scientist because he /could theoretically/ make a nuclear bomb. Dementors can go without ever Kissing anyone, and, under the Ministry deal, most of them did. If Dementors could be made to swear Unbreakable Vows never to Kiss anyone, or something similar, that would be a much preferable solution to killing them, I think.

******* I think the sentience of dementors can be disputed. They are classified as non-beings, magical manifestations of despair. Their main motivation is feeding on humans, there is no indication of social dynamics, culture or even personality between them. In the wizarding world, many inanimate objects can be granted some degree of, let's call it "processing power" with magic, without them being considered sentient.

Though things like magical portrait do indeed raise interesting questions on magical sentience.

**** It might indeed be Greater-Good-ish to destroy their kind, in the end, but it isn't quite so clear-cut a dilemma. I'm still very uncertain of the ethics of destroying an entire sentient species, even one as dangerous as Dementors. Especially since, no matter their leanings, they have proved that they can make long-lasting bargains with humans that preclude them from ever eating anyone's souls. And yes, the Azkaban Dementors violated their deal and instead made one with Voldemort, but A) they're not the only Dementors in the world, B) we don't know if /all/ the Dementors agreed or just a majority, and C) that was /hundreds of years/ after the deal was made; treaties between /human nations/ rarely last anywhere near that long.

***** Okay imagine this: Dementors are pure evil, misery, despair, hate, rot, grief. They revel in it. So committing "genocide" against them, (I prefer the term "pest removal"), wouldn't they revel in that? After all, it's terrible for them. But they love all things terrible, so actually they love it.

You're denying them that pleasure. How do you feel about that?

*** Pottermore says that post-DH, when Kingsley was MoM, "Azkaban was purged of dementors". It's unclear whether this means the dementors were killed or banished, so I guess there's leeway to do either depending on what a story needs.

Rowling also informed us that you can starve Dementors until they dissipate, so it's generally assumed that one is meant to put two and two together and the Dementors have ceased to be, shuffled off their amortal coil, gone off to meet their maker, and are now Ex-mentors.
