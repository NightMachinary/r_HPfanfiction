/He no longer wants war\/, I can't edit the title*

In other words, I want the trope where Harry comes back from the future to his own past and changes it, preferably siding with Voldemort. But, Voldemort still leads war (just a little more sane) and /doesn't/ suddenly decide that peace and love are the answer to everything.

Something like that one fic "Xerosis". It can be with or without slash, I don't really mind.
