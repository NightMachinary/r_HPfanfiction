** That's... Confusing as all hell. No matter how I look at it, it also looks like there are classes on Saturdays and I thought they only went M-F?

What page did you find this on?

Edit: I'm also not seeing the midnight astronomy on I think it was Wednesdays on there. Im pretty sure they had to take that first year. And maybe I need to reread but I thought first year potions was once I week?

*** I know, right? First year potions was double blocked on Friday (because I remember Harry went to Hagrid's after). I'm pretty sure this is nonsense, but where did it come from and why did it show up? I found it by searching for "First Year Schedule". From what I could gather...if you read it right side up, it goes Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday left-to-right. The last four days if you flip the table. It's the kind of random style JKR would have created, but it doesn't follow the book.

Maybe a movie prop?

**** That's entirely possible. Or something that was drawn up then scrapped?

***** I mean.. did you not see Xylomancy? From the wiki;

#+begin_quote
  This class is seen on Harry Potter's class timetable in the film version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. However, this cannot be considered canon, as it is not listed among his subjects in the book, and he would not take Divination until his third year.

****** I did, however I commented at midnight where I'm at, and decided to focus more on the times themselves and how ridiculous the setup looked than the "xylomancy" that I didn't feel like googling :) and it was part of why I asked the specific page so we could see if it was a movie prop or something else (for more context concerning its existence).

** Maybe its just me but this makes sense. While the classes don't add up to what is said in the books, and first year Gryffs shouldn't be able to take Xylomancy, but this is just a spiral schedule. While the days are there to offer some starting point, you just start at a point and go through the schedule. (Theoretically.... the way by using the day headings doesn't really add up so you just pick a point on the spiral and go through the entire thing. The only issue is when you get to the center where it says Sunday is a free day. Just skip over that bit.)
