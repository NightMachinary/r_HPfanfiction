Been lurking on FanFiction.Net for a while, and was looking for some good archive of our own fics to get me started on there, having trouble navigating the site


** I adore [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][Professor C. Binns: A Personal History]] it takes a character I would never have thought to be interested in and creates a fascinating story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5265569][Seven Names]] is a post-war Alternate Universe in which the war has played out very differently to canon. It's an interesting story, with a very well-concocted premise.

#+begin_quote
  Seventy three years after being forced out of the magical world, Sarah Jean Taylor is finally coming home. And there are quite a few people who want to talk to her.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] is, fair-warning, Draco/Harry, but I personally adore the storytelling. It's a sweet, humorous story that has a fascinating and well-executed premise-Harry never goes to Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
#+end_quote

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/830080][Registration]] one of my favourite light-hearted, humour stories.

#+begin_quote
  James roped Remus and Sirius into holding his place in line for registering Harry; when he defaults at the last minute, his friends are forced to pick Harry's name for him.

*** Delinquents on the run is pretty great and I normally avoid Harry/Draco like the plague

** Try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood]] by cambangst. I actually wrote a long review on this fic [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8iu981/recommendation_harry_potter_and_the_conspiracy_of/?st=JHSOJFDW&sh=b6083044&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][here]]. Basically, a really good murder mystery post-Hogwarts.

*** Technically it's not an AO3 exclusive (It is also on HPFF), still a fantastic story that I love.

** This ongoing fic is incredibly good, and while in the latest few parts have some slash elements they aren't forced and isn't quite that pronounced. Also has the best Tri Wizard Tournament I've ever read in a fic period.\\

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** C'est la vie by Cywscross is exclusive, IIRC. (dimentional travel!Harry)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224]]

I think Grey space by noaacat is too. (pre-Hogwarts!Harry)

** linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) I think is only on ao3. It is canon-compliant and follows Snape through Hogwarts and the first Voldemort war. The characterization is very well done.

  Severus Snape is going straight to hell. The people he calls his friends are helping him get there.
