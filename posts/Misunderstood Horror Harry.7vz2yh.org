Greetupings fellow fan fic enthusiasts. I am on the search for stories similar to linkffn(7779108), where in Harry gets summoned elsewhere, and everyone is terrified of him because of what was summoned (Master of Death in this case), but the man himself is actually quite nice and not an eldrich horror.

Please and thank you.

  In one world, an old man's life ends. In another, a foolish wizard performs a ritual and calls upon the Master of Death. And in both, there is a sound-a sound like an oncoming train. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.

  Harry Awakens from a 68 year coma which he went into after defeating Voldemort. Then he gets summoned... to buffyverse, everyone seems keen to calling him a big bad for some reason.
