#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** I remem there was one fanfiction where they both learn these alternate dimension spells. They would say the spell and it would basically cause massive damagr to their throats, because they were forcing their vocal chords to say something that is not within their capacity. It may have been denarian renegade but I'm not sure.

** There was a good one where Dumbledore anonymously wrote a book for Harry to find because he was bound by oaths not to help him directly.

*** I remember a fic like this too, and I'm curious to find it as well. Some added details are that it was an anti-ministry fic, as the ministry bound all of its employees under stricter and stricter oaths the further up they rise, which is why Dumbledore was so hamstrung.
