I JUST finished Chamber of secrets (again, lol) and the ending left me thinking. Dumbledore said that very few made the connection that Tom Riddle was Voldemort, since he was so unrecognisable after he came back from travelling, and if Harry hadn't intervened Ginny would be dead and a 16 year old Tom Riddle would be walking the earth again, basically unrecognisable. And if someone were to claim that Tom Riddle is Voldemort, they wouldn't have any way of proving it.

Is there a fic that explores this kind of scenario?


** "The Imposter Complex" linkffn(13275002). TMR does eventually get recognized as Voldemort but it's three quarters of the way in.

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

  Eliza Potter was abandoned in an orphanage by the Dursely's and so 11 years later she refuses to be the Light Golden girl everyone wants. Eliza Potter is more a force of nature than a girl and she refuses to let anything stand in her way to greatness, and that includes meddling old headmasters[starts in first year]
