**** That should be a thing in the writing thingamajig for May, if we have one (we're 12 days in already); pick a crack pairing and write a short snippet about it.

I, myself, am considering...oh, how about Hermione/Dachora?

** Ooh I have a few requests too, can I get

- Harry x Quirrel's Turban
- Harry x Slytherin's Statue
- Harry x a Horcrux
- Harry x the Magical Tent he travels in

Bonus requests:

- Sybill Trelawney x Anyone (no crackfics)
- Ron who is a weeaboo
- Hermione who acts like the average poster of /r9k/

Edit: You guys aren't taking the Horcrux request literally enough, I want to see Harry defending Tom Riddle's diary from manipulative!evil!Dumbledore's plots to murder it and then writing homoerotic poems in it.

*** There is at least one Harry/Horcrux story out there. Don't remember the name of it, tried to delete it from my memory. Harry was portrayed as creepy young and Horcrux Tom was watching him. It probably disappeared in the great LJ purge. Those early days before people cared about warning you.

**** There's actually a really good one with fem!Tom as well. I can't remember what it was called but it was fairly short with Slytherin!Harry and reasonable Dumbledore.

******* so like how do they communicate? does he wiggle his fingers under water while the fish flaps its fins or what because I am known as a bourgeois piece of shit, you know someone who can find words and meanings where none exist and I still can't figure out the communication.

so if there is no communication and it's not sexual at all how the fuck does this work
