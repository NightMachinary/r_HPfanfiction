We are almost in December! So I'm looking for a variety of fic recommendations. One-shots revolving around Christmas day, featuring any character - not necessarily at Hogwarts (can be a a collection of one-shots too). Medium to long fics set around Christmas/The Holiday season. Medium to long fics with a significant Christmas/Holiday chapter/set of chapters. Any fics which take place predominantly in the snow/winter time/cold.

Thanks!!!


** Thanks so far! Any non-Drarry fics come to mind?

*** Even if you never read/usually don't like Drarry, TURN is worth a shot. That is the one fic that a lot of the fandom can agree is great - even people who usually never read slash.

No one writes Christmas better than [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/Saras_Girl/pseuds/Saras_Girl][Saras_Girl]]. A few of her best Christmas fics are [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][TURN]], [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3114812][Helix]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1210501][All Must Draw Near]].

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/321639][Humbug (a Christmas Tale)]] is a Christmas Carol remake with Draco as Scrooge that is cute. I also liked [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2741090][The Mysteriously Appearing Mistletoe]] for a short Christmas fic.

  The mysteriously appearing, vindictive and mischievous mistletoe is forcing everybody in Hogwarts to kiss whomever it lands above. Nobody can figure out how to rid the school of the informally named 'M'am' but eventually the particular mistletoe falls on top of the heads of the schools old rivals, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. What happens next is anybody's guess!
