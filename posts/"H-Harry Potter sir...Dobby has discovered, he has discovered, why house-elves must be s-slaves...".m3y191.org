Harry leaned forward, watching Dobby with concern, as the house-elf wrung his hands anxiously.\\
"Would Harry Potter sir p-please bind Dobby again?" Dobby begged, his fear audible in his voice, "Dobby wants to b-be free, but house-elves must not, not be free."\\
"I don't understand." Harry admitted, "What's so bad about being free? You won't die without a master, we, meaning Hermione, checked thoroughly."\\
But Dobby shook his head, "No Harry Potter sir, it is being something much much worse..."\\
 \\
What did Dobby discover? What terrible threat to the world, or to elvenkind, justifies their entire race being enslaved? Is this knowledge something a Dark Lord could exploit to bring about chaos and destruction?\\
 \\
Suggestions (if you can't think of anything):\\
-The true elves were creatures with immense magical power but no altruism; after nearly destroying the world, they were bound and forced to work for others as punishment.\\
-House-elves are akin to the genie-in-the-lamp, except bound to houses instead of furniture. A free house-elf runs the risk of being found and bound (to, let's say, a wand) by an evil person, and forced to grant that person's wishes.\\
-Elves are fey who /must/ follow rules and punish those who break them. Leaving them free subjects them to the bizarre and inhuman laws of the fey courts, binding them to a household lets them obey that household/civilization's rules instead.


** I know there's one fic out there where Dobby reveals that the house-elves were bound to the wizards by the goblins to ensure that the house-elves would always have work to do, because a house-elf with nothing to do becomes bored, depressed, or both....and that's why Dementors exist.

*** Neat. I remember musing before (in my house-elves and prestige) thread that dementors might be house-elves; the idea being that elves might work in households in the first place to draw emotional energy (satisfaction, comfort, etc) off humans, and dementors are those elves twisted by being starved of everything except anger and despair.

**** In the fic in question, it wasn't that bored, depressed House-Elves became Dementors, it was that they */created/* the Dementors to see what would happen.

** My thought about house elves was always that they were domesticated at some point in the past (kind of like dogs). They craved the affection of humans and in return they would help around the house. Seems consistent with the fact that if you mistreat a hose-elf they will find loopholes in your orders so as to bring your downfall. Happened with Dobby, happened with Kreacher.

Edit: also seems that Dobby's lack of confidence actually comes from years of mistreatment (that's why he stutters and is so subservient even when freed) - kind of like how an abuse victim would behave. Kreacher who experienced love from the Blacks (except for Sirius) and house elves that appear in FB seem far more confident and talk to people that are not their masters as with equals.

** Ohh Ohh,

Hand up.

I know the answer to this one.

Dobby, like all house elves is a homonculus animated by a bound brownie. The brownie is a spirit of place but far too flighty and unreliable to use directly. The homonculus acts as a container, and stops the brownie evaporating. Being bound to humans generates their human-like personalities, as 'user interfaces' if you will to the brownie. Without being bound to family, Bobby's personality will slowly evaporate, becoming more and more brownie-like. Still bound by the Homonculus, but not capable of thought. (Arguing whether brownies think or not is a bit esoteric. They're autogenous spirits, and spirits in general are almost all weird like that. Demontors, as spirits of suffering are the least weird spirits.)

Just like unbreakable vows, the spells use to make the House-elf personality 'borrow' brain-cells from the bound humans. After all, magic's not sentient, and a homonculus is just a flesh golem). (Which is alos why you don't cast too many of unbreakable vows. And why house-elves get weird if they have weird masters.) ((And Hogwarts house-elves are a bit quiet and retiring (nice-20) because otherwise poor old Dumbledore is even more gaga than usual.))

** I remember years ago toying around with the idea that House Elves once used to be a type of Imp, and the being enslaved to serve Wizardkind in all manner of domestic duties was in responce to them causing all kinds of havok and mischief throughout the world.

*** Yes, they sound suspiciously like Brownies from old fairy tales. Aren't supposed to be seen when they're doing chores and household tasks, small domestic spirits dressed in rags and if you attempt to present a Brownie with clothing they will leave forever.

Also, when Brownies are angered they become malicious spirits called Boggarts. Origin story!

** Strange idea that I had for a Harry Potter crossover with Fate, House Elves are all descendants from muggles that were experimented on and given a few spells, that is the reason that they seem to have limited spells at their disposal but are able to bypass wards since they are ancient their magic. is stronger

** Okay I know I am late but here's my idea. The elves are warped, magically bound illithids enslaved as the last resort to prevent them from taking over and enslaving everyone on earth. When there is no wizard to power the bindings, their psionic abilities gradually begin to return.
