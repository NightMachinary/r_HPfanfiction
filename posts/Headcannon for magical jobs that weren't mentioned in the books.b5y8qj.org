What kind of magical jobs do you think there are in the wizarding world? Maybe a job where you apply protection spells to a house? Magical engineers?


** Whenever I need a type of magical job for a fic, I mostly look at lists of medieval jobs, tbh. There's a lot there that I don't think would fit, but it's a good source of inspiration just by dint of listing so many jobs that are needed to stock stores and let life run smoothly. Clock makers, toy makers, cobblers, bricklayers, seamstresses, weavers, blacksmiths, etc. Pretty much any object you could imagine being sold in Diagon Alley needs someone to make it, and just based on historical experience, it's no stretch of the imagination that some of the spells necessary for making these things are kept a trade secret.

And I also just really enjoy exploring apprenticeships to artisans.

*** Couldn't you just hire wizards to conjure building items for you? (I don't know how permanent they are)

**** I've got no idea how permanent things are in canon; it's been a while since I've read the books. As for building items, my headcanon goes like this: an average wizard can conjure bricks because they've seen bricks. They know what bricks are like. Getting the bricks is easy. They can't however make those bricks into brick wall that will stand well because they don't have experience with the mortar, support rebar (if there are any), the physics of putting it together in such a way that it'll stand when dry, etc. The same thing with metalwork: anyone who's seen a piece of wrought iron can conjure a length of it, but building a wrought iron fence or a fancy gate once they have the raw materials is so difficult that it's easier just to call in a professional.

You work long hard hours at the ministry the last thing you want to do when you get home is remember your schooling from a decade ago on how to remove a bogart

*** My headcannon is that lupin did something like that on the side. When doing the boggart lesson, he mentions he saw a boggart try to scare two people.

With his dad being an expert on magical creatures, it would def be some easy money.

**** It would make sense for a werewolf to have his own business like this. Whenever someone tries to hire him for the full moon, he could just explain that he's already booked that day. It makes so much sense, I had to come up with a headcanon for why Lupin didn't do this, since if he had, he wouldn't have been so poor.

The Lupin in my stories has the wolf trait of needing to be part of a pack, not as a leader, but a follower. He'd feel very uncomfortable running his own business. He just wants to work for someone else's business, which sucks, since bosses don't want to hire him.

The exterminator in my story is a werewolf too, but one with a more entrepreneurial spirit than Lupin. He was turned at age seventeen, not four, so he developed more of a human sense of independence than a wolf sense of interdependence.

***** I mean you could still be poor and be an exterminator if you just don't have enough clients.

I'm not sure I see the whole pack mentality with Lupin. JK Rowling said that he is disgusted by anything wolfish.

****** He's be very good at the job, so there would have to be something stopping him from being successful at it. I can just see the ads in the Prophet, and the wizarding wireless: “Doxies in your curtains? Troll in your dungeon? Floo-call Lupin Pest Control!”

Yeah, he's disgusted by anything wolfish, but he did run with a pack all through school, and not as pack leader. He's a natural follower. He even tried to join the pack Harry was leading in Deathly Hallows.

******* He would want to keep a low profile so that might lead to him taking the bare minimum clients. According to the 2016 ebook, he hid being a werewolf and wasnt even registered on the ministry database. People only knew after book 3 I think.

Having 3 close friends isn't really a pack. It's called having 3 close friends who you're also roommates with and have basically all your classes together.

If all the gryffindors of lupins year got turned into werewolves and then started breeding together and lived in some small area and hunted together I suppose you could call that a pack.

Jk rowling said herself that werewolves in her universe lived in "packs" which would include an actual community and family of wolves. Lupin only joined this "pack" for order of the phoenix spying in book 6.

** One I made up for Victoria Potter:

Chapter 14

#+begin_quote
  [Petunia] took in the visitors, noting their robes with a slight curl of her lip. "You're here to take her away, are you?"

  "With your permission," Mr Bones said, "I've cleared it with the Ministry of Magic, of course, and we've had a charm-mason lay down extra security. Nothing like what you've got here, but I understand it's been several years since the last---"

  "That sounds fine," Petunia interrupted, her voice strained, no doubt distressed from the sudden invasion of magic into her home. "Will you be leaving straight away?"
#+end_quote

Chapter 15

#+begin_quote
  When they weren't helping with the vegetables, the girls liked to explore, returning home each afternoon with flowers in their hair and scratches on their legs from the wild undergrowth. Victoria was developing a tan from all the time under the sun, and Susan's normally clear skin was coming out in freckles. Further and further they ventured, beyond the vegetable patches, past the fields where cows grazed and into the woods.

  It didn't take long before they encountered the edge of the Boneses' land. A low stone wall cut through the woods where the property ended, its surface a jigsaw of irregularly shaped rocks. Mr Bones had made them promise not to cross into the Muggle world, so they followed the path running alongside the wall, which led them in a giant semi-circle that would eventually take them back to the river.

  "They put this in over the summer," Susan explained as they walked, "we used to have a few wooden posts marking the boundary, but Dad said we had to get something more secure."

  She looked nervously at the wall. It didn't look very sturdy. "How does it work? The wall, I mean."

  Susan shrugged. "I'm not sure. There's spells on every stone, but I think different stones have different spells. I watched the charm-mason put it down; it took him weeks to finish."

** Depending on how separate the Wizarding World is from the Muggle one, I'd like to imagine that there are Magical farmers working on what Muggles think are unarable land; using magic to increase soil fertility, create sources of water, and altering the local terrain and weather to something more beneficial to growing crops and/or raising livestock.

** I had an idea for a fic where Harry becomes a Bloodborne styled Hunter and is sent to a monster infested Eastern Europe to clear out monster (like eldritch abominations) afflicted towns and cities and during one of her qudditch games Ginny is stuck in one of these cities with Harry while he trys to clear it out. This would be a fic where Voldemort was either dead all along or Dumbledore found his horcruxes on his own. Harry would never have gone to hogwarts and i am tempted to make him go to a Hunter School somewhere

** Not sure if this really counts, but I like to think there are are people who get by almost entirely without working, just by being good at magic. Why work a 9 to 5 when most of your cost of living can be overcome by wizardry?
