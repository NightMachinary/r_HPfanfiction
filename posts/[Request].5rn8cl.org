I have just finished my most recent batch on fic that I had found that looked good and I am looking for a few more recommendation from you guys if possible.

The #1 thing I really really want is complete or at the very least fics that are current being actively updated. I do like a series of fics that follow along similar to cannon in that they have multiple books following the same story line but I am happy for individual stories too. They do not necessary have to be split into 7 books, but I like ones that follow Harry through school years in a similar manor to how cannon does.

I particularly like AU/Timetravel fics but I am open to anything really. I really would like to avoid, if possible Harem/Harry, Super powered Harry and Evil Dumbledore (I dont mind him being fallible, or someone who can make mistakes but would really like him to not be actively evil lol). I am not too concerned about pairing (but for the love of all that is holy no Harem's please.


** If you like time travels and a similar plot line as in canon, then I highly recommend "Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
