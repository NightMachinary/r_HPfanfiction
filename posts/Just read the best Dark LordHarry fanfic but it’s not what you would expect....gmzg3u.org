“No Competition” by Evilgoddss

“What if the horcrux hadn't been as contained by the blood wards as Dumbledore had planned? But rather than influencing his personality, it darkened his aura - an aura already rather grey despite his innocent nature. Grey with the darkness of his parents traumatic deaths, grey with his status of last living primary heir of the Peverell line, a child of Death - and that made him something warm, adorable and endearing to the dark creatures from an early age.

Man, wouldn't that suck for any other wannabe Dark Lord.”

God, can I just say, this fanfic is absolutely beautiful, it like physically touched my soul with it's tooth-rotting fluffiness. I was hooked by the first chapter.

Unfortunately, it's not complete, and hasn't been for quite a while now. I'm not sure if it's abandoned or just on hiatus but it's got enough there for you to read without feeling too bad when it ends in a cliffhanger.

As for the characters, I adore them all, the OCs are hilarious, but it has quite a few of them so if you don't like OCs, this fic's probably not for you.

I love the cuddly, overprotective!dark creatures in this, magic just gravitates towards Harry like a moth to a flame. The Dursleys get what's coming to them and Petunia having a heart attack is hilarious.

What's also hilarious is the Death Eaters trying to tell Voldemort why he can't get control over the dark creatures again when he came back without getting crucioed.

While there are no Harry!centric pairings, or pairings that majorly affect the plot, there are background pairings but yeah, I'm rambling again and I just think you should read it, it's definitely worth it. :)

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
