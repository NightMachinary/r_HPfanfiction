"Peace is a lie. There is only Passion. Through Passion I gain Strength. Through Strength I gain Power. Through Power I gain Victory. Through Victory my chains are Broken. The Force shall free me."

That, it wouldn't necessarily have to be as corrupting/ malicious as in the movies but I like the idea of the struggle and power from emotions leading to strength, power and freedom.

I think it also goes well with young Voldemort, Crouch, Snape and possibly a dark Harry.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
