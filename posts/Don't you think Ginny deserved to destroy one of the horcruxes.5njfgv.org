** Rowling kinda screwed Ginny in the last book, at least in terms on not giving her the moment she was so keen on giving most other major characters. She really developed Ginny as a character for the sole purpose of HBP and then decided that's enough.

*** Which is really a shame, because she's a pretty damn good character. It's a bit odd to think my love of a character comes from like 40-50% fanfiction because JKR didn't give her enough screen time outside of HBP.

**** I'm not sure you read the last book because Neville straight up attempted to kill Nagini in front of Voldemort which would have caused Voldemort to kill him in a very painful way, but chaos broke out and Harry rejoined the fight which sidetracked Voldemort. I don't really think Bellatrix could have made him piss himself if the threat of pissing off Voldemort didn't.

** That would have been fitting and appropriate. Unfortunately, the author didn't care to flesh her out enough or include her enough to make that an option.

** Honestly? No. I don't think Ginny deserved to destroy a horcrux. I think that the only Horcrux that she had a claim to was the diary. She couldn't do so, yes the diary was draining her life force, but she attempted to flush it, and I would label that an attempt at destruction.

Harry says in Year 7 that Dumbledore taught him that when it comes to magic on this level, who does what matters. That is why Ron was tasked to destroy the locket. It also explains why Neville was to destroy the snake. Neville was a foil to Harry as much as Malfoy. Neville could have easily /been/ Harry. Neville suffered hardships, and was portrayed throughout the entire series as an average smuck. If he can destroy a horcrux, then by joe you can too!

How did Ginny suffer? Sure she was possessed by Voldemort. If you count imperius curses as a form of possession so were hundreds. Ginny is NOT special. That is why Harry and Ginny work. Ginny isnt special. Just like Harry isnt truly. Ginny is a girl who found her strength while a war went on around her. Harry is a guy who found his strength fighting for those he loved, even though he was helplessly outclassed. Two characters, who other than those traites that they share, are not special.

Harry only destroys one horcrux. The Diary. The Diadem is destroyed by a student losing themselves to Dark Magic, a parable of what Tom did. The Ring was destroyed by Dumbledore, Tom's greatest rival. The snake by Neville, the boy Tom thought wasnt a threat. Ron destroyed the locket, proving that Weaselys are more than just red heads while also renewing his bonds with Hermione and Harry. The cup is destroyed by both Ron and Hermione, a pureblood and a muggleborn. The symbolism there is obvious. And lastly... Voldemort himself destroys his last horcrux, while trying to ensure his own immortal rule. I don't see how Ginny could fit in here, except maybe for the locket, which makes no sense as she is at hogwarts attempting to hold down the resistance.

** No. If she were actually a major character in the series who was in on Voldemort's Horcruxes, sure. Ginny is literally a step away from being a Susan Bones/Daphne Greengrass style character where any fiction with her is really just writing a fandom approved OC. That's one of the biggest reasons people hated the epilogue pairing, Ginny's identity in a lot of peoples minds was just 'Ron's sister.'
