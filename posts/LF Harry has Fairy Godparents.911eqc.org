Harry's life was about as bad as Timmy Turner's, and Fanon playing up the Dursleys abuse, you could almost guarantee he gets Fairies. You could give him Cosmo and Wanda (And Poof), Wandissimo, Any of the cool Fairies. Cosmo and Wanda (And Poof) would be ideal, because Cosmo's idiocy adds humour (and danger) to it.


** Harry is the Chosen One, That no one understands, Aunt and Uncle and Vold-y always giving him commands. Vold-y: Die Potter!

Doom and Gloom down in his cupboard, Is broken instantly, By his magic little spiders who grant his every wish, Cuz in reality they are his Odd Parents, Fairly Odd Parents, Wanda: Wands and wings, Comso: Floaty Crowny things,

Odd Parents, Fairly Odd Parents, Really odd, magic rod, broomsticks, wizard or witch, Harry: Obtuse, pumpkin juice, green troll, quill and scroll Giant snake, birthday cake, golden snitch, Quidditch pitch.

Odd Parents, Fairly Odd Parents, It flips your lid when you are the kid, With Fairly Odd Parents,

Vold-y: Yeah right,

** ooh, you could have a plot/drama from The Rules saying that only muggle children can have Fairly Odd Parents. Since harry didn't know he was a wizard and he grew up with muggles, he was assigned Odd Parents in a misfile. When the Rules/Jordan find out that Harry is a wizard, they try to take his Odd Parents away from him.

Also, Harry trying to explain to voldemort that the killing curse didn't kill him as a baby because its against The Rules to use magic to kill someone. And Hermione being a know-it-all like she is to Luna, and being like: The Rules aren't a thing Harry, for the last time.

** God I'd totally read a fic with this premise if someone decided to write one. I think it could be really good.
