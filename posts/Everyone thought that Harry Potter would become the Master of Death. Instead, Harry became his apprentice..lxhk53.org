** I can remember reading quite a few crossovers with discworld featuring death that were fun.

on this idea, death in universe could have gotten bored and tired of his job so created the hallows with the intention of the one who collected them all ,replacing him and allowing him to retire.

  Yes, it's another "Voldemort meets Discworld's Death" one-shot. Written for the Spacebattles community, shouldn't be taken too seriously.

** "But you're Death! You're a great terrible skeleton, you tricked the Peverells to their, um, deaths..." Harry paused a moment to consider the crimes he'd just committed against sentence structure, then continued on, "you practically murdered them!"

I FIND YOUR DESCRIPTION OF ME TO BE BOTH VERY ACCURATE AND DEEPLY HURTFUL. I HAVE NEVER MURDERED ANYTHING, Death stopped a moment and seemed to contemplate, EXCEPT A CURRY, PERHAPS. Death's eyes glowed with a blue spark, cold as the end of stars, and in a voice as final as the shutting of a coffin asked, FANCY LUNCH?

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
