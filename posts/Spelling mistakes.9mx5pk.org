What are your least favorite spelling errors you see in fanfiction? Aside from the really obvious and irritating ones (there their they're, your you're, it's its its', et cetera), what are those errors (if any) that make you immediately close the fic?

Personally, the surprising amount of confusion between ‚Äúquiet‚Äù and ‚Äúquite‚Äù is one of them. Also ‚Äúcould of‚Äù vs. ‚Äúcould've‚Äù really get on my nerves.


** I've spoken of it before, but "Deloris" makes me want to tear my face off and rip it into tiny little pieces of yarglethatblargle face confetti.

*** Speaking as someone with dyslexia, sounding it out is how I figure out a lot of spellings.

That said, I check, double-check, and then triple-check each name (and spells and other words) before I use it, so I guess messing up at all is pretty bad.

**** I think the thing that gets me is that "Dolores" and "Deloris" sound different to my ear. The Lucius/Luscious, Ginevra/Ginerva (I blame Minerva McGonagall for that one) and even Lily/Lilly mixups I find far more palatable.

*** For me it's definitely Delores because I automatically think the author has never even read the books, just seen the films. My mind simply screams "illiterate dunderhead". Weirdly, it's quite a common mistake, but I've seen it happen in various fics where every subsequent mention of her name was spelled correct, just the first one not.

** Honestly, the tendency in summaries to mix up 'cannon' with which you shoot cannonballs and 'canon' which is the official books irks me more than anything else. It's not an insta-close, but it does make me mad. And it's so pervasive, /shudder/.

** I can usually forgive spelling mistakes, unless it's a characters name. I have stopped reading a fic before because the author couldn't spell names properly.

If an author can't be bothered doing the most basic research, I can't be bothered reading the fic!

The they're/there/their mixups and their cousins are super confusing for me, whose first language isn't English. Over time I've gotten used to it and I now understand what the author means without having to pause and read shit aloud, but arghh... more than a couple and I'm out.

*** I keep noticing that one more and more. I don't get it, because the two words aren't even homophones so how could people mix them up? Some fic authors make that mistake so consistently that it's a guessing game trying to figure out which word they meant in context.

Also loose and lose. They are in no way the same word.

Mcgonagal, Mcgonnagal, etc. At least spell the name of a ‚Äòcannon' character right. They ‚Äòcould of' just looked it up. And Luscious Malfoy. We get it. His hair is glorious. But he is not named after his luscious mane. And Ginevra is not spelt like Minerva.

And god yes I agree with quiet and quite

‚ÄòTheir' are ‚Äòdefinately' more and I'll ‚Äòprobaly' add to this list later

** u/Aet2991:
#+begin_quote
  what are those errors (if any) that make you immediately close the fic?
#+end_quote

I generally don't quit fics because of spelling errors, because honestly they happen to everyone and not all authors have betas to proofread their stuff.

When I do, it's because a mistake is frequent or implausible enough to be obviously not a typo but author's ignorance like -esk instead of -esque as suffix. Misspelled names also tend to irk me, because how the fuck can you even read seven books straight of professor McGonagall and still write McGonagle?

** "Irrelivant" is also an annoying one for me, "Stupify" is up there, and, even though it technically falls under the umbrella of grammar, comma splices and improper quotation formatting are /really/ irritating.

"to" vs. "too" always makes me want to punch my computer screen.

Honestly I feel like everyone should at least be somewhat familiar with [[https://joking-mr-feynman.tumblr.com/post/178529048224/a-fiction-writers-guide-to-english][these rules]] when writing; and not to disparage anyone who does try their hand at it, but it's just that it could be /so/ much better.
