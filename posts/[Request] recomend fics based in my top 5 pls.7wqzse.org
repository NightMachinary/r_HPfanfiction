linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality]])

PLS dont recommend

1-short fics (less than 100k words)

2-slash (pls just no)

3-Robst (ugh)


** For long, well-written Slytherin Harry that do a lot of worldbuilding off of canon, I'd recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series and linkffn(Harry Potter and The Accidental Horcrux) and its sequel.

For fics that focus heavily on expanding the capabilities of magic in a logical/technical way, I'd recommend linkffn(The Arithmancer) and its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes).

also, for what I understand in the aritmancer, Harry is a little bit of a waste of space, that is like a big let down for me

If you want Harry having a more active role, I'd suggest linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and its sequel linkffn(An Animagus At War), which are written by the same author as Arithmancer but have Harry and Hermione as dual protagonists.

** The tone of these fics reminds me of a couple fics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. The first couple of chapters I admit are quit dry but it picks up to be something of an epic later on.

linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

auto generated from user profiles that have all 5 in favourites, I've skimed through it, didn't look like there's (a lot of) slash. If you want it split by fandoms I can edit it, but the way they are sorted now is more relevant strictly speaking

***** my favorite list is a little bit of a mess from when I was new to FF and pretty much every "Bad Ass Harry" was a blast... I was pretty salty about canon Harry being pretty useless at the end. I still can't believe that he won the final fight with the wizards equivalent to a literal slap in the wrist

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
