******* How about a character mentioned but barely ever seen, like a Greengrass or Verity from the twins' shop - 'Is she an OC or an actual character? There's enough personality that she might be considered a character, but is that actual character or fanon buildup?'

*** Look, dude. It's okay to get a little silly. The main reason that I post here more than I do on DLP is to be silly for the fuck of it.
