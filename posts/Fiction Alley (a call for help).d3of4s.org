Hey everyone,

This is a call for help - I'm the owner/developer/operator of [[https://portkey-archive.org][portkey-archive.org]] and I'm on a wider mission to archive as much Harry Potter fanfiction (and fanfic in general!) as I can - it's horrible for all of us when these stories are lost.

Fiction Alley has sadly disappeared from the net - it's happened and bounced back a few times before, but it's been a while this time and I did not get the chance to archive it before it died.

I'd love to see if there's anything that can be done for Fiction Alley - to see if there's anything I can do to help to get it back online, or to see if there's anyone who has access to a backup from Fiction Alley's sites that could be used to run a similar archive to [[https://portkey-archive.org][portkey-archive.org]].

If anyone has anything to share, or can get me in contact with someone who might, please let me know!

edit: I know there was an attempt to get the content into AO3 via Open Doors, but that seems to have been quiet for about a year. If anyone knows more about that, I'd love to hear it too!

*** Hey,

Thanks for linking this. It's a great start but appears to be sadly missing all of the age restricted content :(

** I got a raw archive of =www.fictionally.org/authors/*= dating back to 2018-10-03, iirc it also includes age restricted content. Not entirely sure if it is a full copy though, about 3.4GB uncompressed.

I'll find a place to host it for you and send you a DM in ~6 hours.

** Check out Enchanting the Bookworm on Facebook. They've been busy collecting lost stories from the Hermione-centric sites that went down and have thousands of stories.
