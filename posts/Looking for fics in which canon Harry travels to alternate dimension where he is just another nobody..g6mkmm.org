Just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224]] (unfinished) and loved it. Looking for similar fanfictions. I don't really have any preferences but james and lily alive are a plus. I have also read other travel fics like A Black Comedy, Face Death in Hope, Messing with Time and Oh God Not Again and enjoyed them greatly.

Also, if you have any good time/dimension fiction which does has harry as BWL but is worth a read, feel free to share.


** He isn't a nobody here but he is the same old Harry in the shoes of an inspiring Dark Lord in that reality. Draco is a girl but the Draco from his current timeline also traveled with Harry and is playing his own Endgame as "her twin brother" or something. Is complicated at the moment. It is set during 5th year. Lily is alive in this timeline.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
