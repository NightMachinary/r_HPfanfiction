I'm looking for stories where Harry is thrown into rather unusual situations or scenarios, where he finally finds peace, happiness and/or fulfillment.

I've read quite a few happy ending stories, but they are all very similar in regards to how Harry finds happiness:

Harry becomes an Auror, Harry teaches at Hogwarts, Harry becomes a Healer, Harry marries the crush of the author.

Those stories are fine, but they are also nothing new.

But from time to time you stumble over really... weird post-Hogwarts stories.

Harry Potter gets permanentaly transformed into a dog. Harry helps muggle kids with cancer by joining the 'make a wish'-foundation. Harry starts producing intentionally absurd 'Boy-who-lived'-merchandise. Harry becomes an actor in the muggle world, who exclusively plays background-characters in fantasy movies. Harry takes on a new identity and becomes minion of a 'dark lord', but secretly sabotages him, until he grows bored. Harry starts an infomercial-show in the Wizarding Wireless Network, etc. etc.

Any suggestions that might fit this criteria?


** "The Sea King" - Harry Potter owns his own fishing boat.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry Potter put paid to Voldemort at Hogwarts; now it's nineteen years later and, as the diesels hammer on, a bushy-haired girl is still searching for The-Boy-Who-Walked-Away... Oneshot, Deadliest Catch crossover.

*** Thank you for subscribing to “shitty fanfiction ideas“-newsletter!

Did you know that the author fan-f-fan once started writing a Harry Potter/Witcher crossover, in which Geralt of Rivia came to the HP-verse without noticing a large difference, and as a result became Care for magical creatures professor at Hogwarts?

The fanfiction never was finished, because the realization that Madam Hooch with her white hair and yellow cat-eyes totally was a witcher as well threw the author into an existential crisis.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the soul gems by shedoc) - Harry is exiled from Britain, becomes a famous cursebreaker, and travels the world with his team who has become his new family. There is mpreg, but I think it's well done and there isn't slash (hints at a relationship in the past but no physical description of it).

Linkffn(Must Love Quidditch by dracosoftie) - Harry is a famous author using a pseudonym and finds love using an online dating site.

I think that's all I have... but I'll be watching this thread for some new stories to read!
