Basically the title


** Hehe I was just thinking about this yesterday, too lazy to write right now, but had following in my head:

#+begin_quote
  First task, Harry just lays down, back against the rock, Accios his favourite Quidditch Through the Ages (book fit for first years to everyones disappointment!) and just sits there, flipping through the pages. The dragon is far more distracted by the crowd that is getting louder and more annoyed by the boring show than quiet Harry who pays it no mind.

  Second task: Harry conjures a Floaty in the shape of a large Yellow Duck, and just paddles across the lake surface, playing with a rubrics cube which he acciod (only entertainment for the crowd is Harry's inability to solve it).

  Third task: He enters the maze, and sits promptly down at the entrance, and summons bunch of sheet paper and starts folding origami swans (they all look horrible, like crumpled and messy).

  Moody gets frustrated, then desperate, and tried to force Harry to compete even going so far as Imperio him. At which point Dumbledore intervenes and figures out something is very wrong with the cup, goes to get it himself, and returns half an hour later with captured Pettigrew and Stunned Baby Voldemort.

** I'm not sure if this counts, Harry doesn't refuse to compete, he just doesn't put any effort into it.

#+begin_quote
  [COMPLETE] Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but during the shouting match with Ron he realises that he doesn't actually have to risk his life and look like a fool in front of everyone - he really only needs to show up for each task and make a token effort. Single-point-of-departure fic, departing early in book 4. Some text borrowed from J.K. Rowling.

  Harry Potter has always loved magic, but when the cost may be his life he finds himself unwilling to pay.Or, Harry Potter is a little less brave in his fourth year, and decides that the Triwizard Tournament isn't worth risking his life.

  What would happen if Harry made two Vows? One he didn't enter the Tournament and one saying he never would participate unless he was under a spell or potion or was coerced? What would happen if Harry pointed out the war was between Slytherins and Gryffindor, not light and dark?

  Harry sees only one option when his name comes out of the cup - to escape where the contract can't follow; across borders where the Ministry's laws can't follow him. Where he goes changes him, and those who remained change too. Desperate measures implemented change how paths are walked for not just Harry but others too.

  What if Harry just walks away from Hogwarts and the magical contract that binds him to the Tri-Wizard Tournament? A single tiny change to canon and we have a short, coming of age drama that eventually turns into a short love story. Harmony was meant to be. Brief Dumbledore & Hogwarts students bash and humiliation.
