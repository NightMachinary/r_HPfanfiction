** I'm of the mind for you to write your stories how you want to write them. Who cares what others think about them. Some people will like how you approach such topics, some won't.

The problem I am seeing a lot these days that is starting to encroach on fanfiction is "my story must please everybody".

No story can please everyone. There will always be smaller or bigger numbers of people that hate every fic out there. There are always some or lots of people that love every fic out there. Trying to write a story that everyone is going to like is impossible.

If you try to avoid core topics to your stories because your afraid of what some people might say about it, then you are doing yourself and your stories a disservice

** You can always write the fic the way you want, including the topics you're worried about, and then let it sit for a while; sometimes getting some distance from your own writing can help clarify how you feel about it. And if possible, I'd recommend finding a beta reader - when I'm uncertain about how I've written something, a second opinion is invaluable.

If you're worried about getting negative feedback, I'd suggest posting on AO3, which has much better privacy options than FFN. You can chose to restrict your work to registered users and moderate comments, or even prevent anyone from commenting.

Finally, on a more general note, writing about heavy topics sensitively, like writing in general, is hard, and you might not do it perfectly. But it's also something that gets easier with practice, and I know I, at least, would /much/ rather have people tackle difficult subjects and occasionally get it wrong, than only ever have people write "safe" fiction.

** One advice I can give is, if you're worried that your current readers may get a negative impression because of those topics, you can always use a different username to post them. Even published authors have different pen names for different works when they feel like it :)

** I do not know you or your stories. You could be a masterful writer who explores these kind of situations and their consequences thoughtfully... or you could be a weirdo who's looking for incest porn and fucked up torture videos on the internet.

You're probably somewhere in the middle.

Whatever the case, the answer to your question is quite simple.

Do you like many reviews and can't stand people talking bad about something you do?

Then write around hard topics

Do you prefer a small but devoted set of followers, some of whom may be weirdos themselves, and couldn't care less about being insulted once in a while in a review?

Write about incest and torture all you want.

** If the title is true and you're "scared to write..." then don't.

If the post is true and you're "scared to post" then it depends on what exactly are you scared of

** Write what you want. Some fics out there have some seriously disturbing aspects yet are all the more interesting for it.

** Write what you want

Fanfiction would be boring if we only wrote about "safe" stuff

** I think the question to ask is why you want to write about these topics, and what type of story you want to write? You say that the stories wouldn't be the same without these topics, does that definitely mean that they wouldn't be as good? Or does it mean that they wouldn't have the tone you want? Remember that Game of Thrones has incest, torture, and unhealthy relationships and was very popular. It also wasn't for everyone and many people didn't watch, many of them because of those very same things.

In the end, you write what you want, for the reasons you want. Quality writing will out. If your execution is good, the people that are interested will enjoy it and the people that aren't won't. If its bad, then people will dislike it the way people dislike poorly written things and only the people who are specifically there for incest, torture, and unhealthy relationships will like it.

** u/Kellar21:
#+begin_quote
  So, I have a few WIPs and they contain some more... controversial topics. Incest pops up in a few of them, as does torture and very unhealthy relationships.
#+end_quote

Hmm, controversial, yeah...there`s this series of books, I don`t know if you heard about them, they are called The Chronicles of Ice and Fire, they have all of these things and more, and are wildly successful.

Write what you want, just make sure they are cohesive, and with good grammar and spelling, this, along with an interesting premise will make the story good.

Also, make sure these controversial things are truly important for the plot.

** Are you perhaps the author of the most splendid and glorious [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4413323/chapters/10023830?view_adult=true][^{A Big Happy Weasley Family}]] ? The man/lady who noped out of writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12628886/14/Dragon-Lily][^{Dragon Lily}]] ?

I think he went overboard worrying about what other people thought in regards to the latter fic; he even closed his account when he thought his friends/family had found his fics lol. I'd say just take a shot.

** Well, there is a pretty simple solution. Just don't post what you write. Thats what I do when I'm writing something that is morally questionable.

But, if you are set on it, I recomend finding someone to read the chapters before posting, to see if anything you wrote was 'over the line' as it were.
