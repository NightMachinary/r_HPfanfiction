She doesn't have to specifically be, like, actual evil. Fics like New Blood would count- she is willing to toe the line, do some rather dark shit, and has a deep seated revenge streak.

In general I just want fics of Hermione being a total badass and NOT a goody two shoes. She has shown a willingness to be absolutely ruthless in the books. I want that, magnified please.

Any Hogwarts house. Either completed or regularly and recently updated.

Thank you!

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

** I recently dig into the subs to find this exact requests (tho more focus on Harmony) and I'm excited to share it!

Briliant, But Scary linkffn(13413604) I really enjoyed this one. Dark Harmony with slightly naive Harry and mutually devoted Harmony, which I adore because I'm tired of seeing Hermione become the more invested one in this kind of stories.

Coven linkffn(12574292) Sisterhood with a dash of Blood Magic. Always like to see Hermione in a girl-friendship dynamic. I sincerely hope the fic is not abandoned and praying for new update.

Anti-Heroine linkao3(8132578). It's a long read and I think I was dead to the world the entire long weekend to finish it. Badass Hermione, dubious moral, and a lot of Hr/H/TR BDSM sex. Not every one's cup of tea but I can't wait for the next chapter.

I seconded Colubrina and cleotheo stories, although the latter's Persephone is so dark and angsts I haven't been able to read the latest chapters it in the last few years. I'll be reading some of a new ones recommended here as well!

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

  Hermione Granger is special. She has always known it, really, even before she received her letter. It was too bad that she had never met anyone as special as her, but she was hoping that would change now that she was going to Hogwarts. And she wasn't wrong, because the moment she laid eyes on Harry Potter she just knew he was very special indeed. Obsessive!Hr, Slytherin!HHr

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled. "And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

*** I've read her stuff before and enjoyed it! Love hate relationship with Green Girl. I really like it, but political 12 year olds? And then taking her in immediately even though she's muggleborn was weird. Death eaters are Nazis. "This is our special Jew. All others Jews are awful, but we've adopted this one." Like.

**** Yeah, I feel you. That part always made me wtf. Their logic made no sense. Slytherins were super romanticized and that majorly put me off. Still, I remember being very absorbed in it and so I still rec it when I see people asking for Slytherin Hermione or grey Hermione.

***** It's on my frequent rereads list. I enjoy the fic a lot if I dont think about it too much. I loved the aspect of "without Hernione, Harry was fucked". I loved her becoming incredible at potions without turning Snape into a totally new character. The plot twist was done fantastically. I adored Theo. I loved Narcissa and Lucius.

I totally get that. I try to do that more with fics but inevitably certain elements get to me too much and I can't help it. I don't remember a lot of what you said so maybe I should reread the fic!
