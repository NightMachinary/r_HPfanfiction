This post is obviously inspired by a similar post on the sub, but even that post falls prey to this insidious misconception. This is a really really common misconception, it's prevalent everywhere, and I hate it.

It's that being able to play chess (or at least play well) is synonymous to being smart. Take it from someone who is moderately good at chess- this couldn't be more untrue.

One subset of this I commonly see is that chess makes you good at strategy, or something like that. Prince of the Dark Kingdom, an excellent AU fic, has the most horrible description of chess I have ever seen, I almost stopped reading it. HPMoR also falls prey to this.

The post I talked about says that Ron couldn't be that stupid, especially given that he can play chess well. But here's the thing- your chess playing ability has no effect on your intelligence, or vice versa.

You can be the smartest person in the world and still be bad at chess, and the best chess player in the world, though he is incredibly good at chess, is no genius.

*The only thing your chess ability measures is your chess ability. Not intelligence or strategy or anything else. Chess is not a representation of war. It is a board game.*

But wait, you might say. Isn't chess hard? I tried to play chess and I lost. And I'm pretty smart. Surely more intelligence means you should be better at chess.

That is, of course, wrong. Chess is mainly a game of pattern recognition (I am of course vastly oversimplifying). The more you play and practice, the more patterns you know, and are able to recognize them faster and better. And so you are better at chess.

Certainly there is some minimum intelligence required to play chess, but that is just in learning the rules. Given that three year olds can do that, I don't think that's a very high bar.

So yeah. Ron can play chess well. That does not prevent him from being stupid - he isn't stupid of course, the movies did my boy dirty, but his chess ability is not any evidence in either direction.

Rant over.

If you have any questions about chess, I will happily answer them. Also check out [[/r/chessbeginners][r/chessbeginners]] and [[/r/chess][r/chess]]


** This is irrelevant, but now I want a stupid crack-fic where Ron Weasley decides to hone in on chess after his first year, and runs off to muggle London with the help of his muggle-obsessed father to try to become the next grandmaster over the following summer. He comes back during second year still being pretty Ron Weasley about everything. But maybe he throws chess pieces at Malfoy or something lol

** I suppose this really depends on how you define intelligence. Do you think people that are good at math are more intelligent?

Of course is silly to think all chess players are smart it is also silly not to recognise that a lot of chess players are smart. I don't think is purely a cultural assumption or social behaviour, it has to do with the abilities chess demands and develop.

You say it's only pattern recognition but pattern recognition and good memory are two of the biggest markers of high intelligence.

But if used in its common way, there's no proof that being good at chess means that one is intelligent, makes one intelligent, or is caused by being intelligent. They're just two markers that frequently but not always go together.

Now, absolute top-level chess players are almost invariably intelligent, or at least calculate variables very quickly. But nobody's saying that Ron's at that level. There's a HUGE difference between beating children at a game that you love and they tolerate vs. being a world grandmaster. So the debate, if such it is, about Ron's intelligence due to his being able to beat Harry, an abused orphan, at a game he had to TEACH Harry... shouldn't be a debate at all.

****** Yeah, I wouldn't use the "defense for a very valuable item" as a benchmark given that a) the teacher in question wasn't there (it was an automated system), b) in general ALL of the defenses sucked, and c) someone had already bludgeoned their way through.

The only trial that was difficult even for children was getting the key. Any half-competent upper-year would simply blow a hole in the door, use the broom provided for the key trial to fly over the chess set and past the troll, and then blow a hole in the wall next to the big flaming doorway. Those trials were intentionally weak, to the point that even first-years didn't have much trouble with them, so using them as a benchmark for skill is a bit disingenuous.

Also... Ron only won by SACRIFICING HIMSELF. It wasn't a one-on-one game. It was a one-on-three game that he technically lost.

But there is one thing that is made pretty clear in the book. Ron had a big disadvantage because he had to protect 4 pieces rather than just one (the King).

No, but I'm guessing that that makes you better than them at chess? 'Intelligent' and 'dumb' are both broad terms.

  Several research teams have tried to find out by administering various cognitive tests. Reviewing these studies in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science in 2011, the psychologists Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet concluded that tournament chess players score higher on tests of intelligence than do comparable nonplayers.

  In a paper this year in the journal Intelligence , the psychologists Alexander Burgoyne and David Hambrick analyzed the results of 19 studies, involving a total of nearly 1,800 chess players, that correlated IQ scores with skill ratings. They found that stronger chess players tend to score higher than weaker ones, and that this was especially true of newer players and younger players.

*** The main thing is we can't even ascertain that Ron is that good a chess player, we don't know McGonnagal's rating, and the only person he plays consistently that we know the results is Harry, who doesn't care too much about it.

We also rarely see Ron display strategic abilities that much in the series.

He seems to know a lot about Quidditch tactics though.

But the principles of chess hardly applies to the small unit tactics we see in the series, and the other more subtle aspects require more introspection than Ron has ever shown.

If anything the only one who seems to grasp those is Dumbledore.

He is the one who has the idea about using Wingardium Leviosa on the Troll;

he is the one who thinks about using magic to conjure fire against the Devil Snare;

he is the one who figures out that Harry has to use Parseltongue to open the chamber;

he is also the one who steps in front of Harry to defend him against Sirius Black while Harry is frozen by anger and Hermione by fear;

he is the one who tricks the Inquisitorial Squad so they get free and help to Harry and Hermione;

This is exactly the reason. A lot of people go into chess because they're smart and chess is a 'smart person game'.

In fact, this is exactly why I started playing originally. I thought I was pretty smart and I wanted to break other people's egos. But people who aren't conventionally 'smart' can be really good at chess too.

I don't have the time to go over your sources, but here's what I can say based on what you posted.

There are people smarter than me who are worse than me, and people stupider than me who are stronger than me. The most reliable predictor of chess strength is practice+play time. Not intelligence.

And chess strength is not a good predictor for intelligence. I'd be interested to see if there was a study comparing intelligence by chess rating. I find it highly doubtful that a higher rating is correlated at all with a higher intelligence.

** Chess certainly doesn't have any connection to being good at strategy and tactics. Napoleon, for example, was a very mediocre chess player, despite his interest in the game.

Chess is a game with a rigid structure of simple rules. One piece can move per turn. Each piece can only move in certain specified ways. You can see all your opponents pieces. At any given time, you know exactly what your options are and exactly what your opponent's options are. Everything is very straightforward and predictable

Actual warfare is far from straightforward and predictable, and there are no rules, beyond the laws of physics (people invent laws of war, but don't necessarily follow them). Instead of one move per turn, everything is happening at once. You can't even see all your own "pieces" correctly, let alone the whole state of the board. You cannot rely on your pieces achieving what you want, or even having the right capabilities at a given time. You can't rely on being able to communicate with them precisely, or them obeying the orders in precisely the way you want. The combat pieces have to be served by a whole logistical network. Instead of a flat, even surface, you're faced with a huge variety of terrain, fortifications, and weather conditions, which will have huge effects on the outcome. You may not be in ultimate control of all your pieces, some of which might belong to your allies. And so on, and so on. Modern militaries have developed sophisticated ways to deal with all of these, but even if you're lucky enough to have access to all that organisational infrastructure, it's an incredibly complex undertaking

** You're not wrong. But you're not right either. Generally chess players /are/ more intelligent. The game prizes the skills of memory, pattern recognition, imagination, and creativity (in formulating combined attacks). All mental skills, none physical, dexterous, vocal, empathic or charismatic. Hence people who tend to enjoy chess will also tend to be more mentally-oriented, by nature and nurture. (Conversely, people who enjoy boxing are more likely to be more physically-oriented.) And such people tend to be better strategists (within certain limitations but let's not go there...)

Also, you have to take Ron's chess in context: It could well be that JKR is making use of this common trope to signal that Ron is intelligent. This doesn't necessarily mean that JKR herself believes that chess-playing means you're smart. But it is what the average reader might think. Therefore it's quick writer's shorthand for "this guy is smart, in this way."

It's also well-balanced out by Ron being an average performer nearly everywhere else, and having the "emotional range of a teaspoon".

In my fanon I like to give Ron the role of the strategist whenever I can. It was his very unique contribution to the very first adventure, back in PS; it should be his unique contribution later as well. (As well as being the "heart" of the team. But that's another story...)

** I would definitely agree with you in chess not making Ron a master strategist by default. Also on chess making you "intelligent".

However... There are two things to consider.

1) Chess is not just any board game, as you put it. A chess master learns skills that a master hungry hungry hippos will not. There is some pattern recognition, I won't deny that. But do you know how many possible combinations can be? No one can memorize them all. So, why I wouldn't say chess makes you a master strategist, it does allow great practice in pattern recognition (unsurprisingly), awareness, planning (it's not just about recognizing pattern but on how you're going to counteract said patterns) and thinking ahead. It should also make you develop your intuitive skills.

2) There's a concept of multiple intelligences, and while chess might not develop your arithmetic ones, it can help you with logic and spacial thinking.

So in summary. It doesn't make Ron a master strategist. Chess doesn't translate nowhere near to exactly to real life. But it is a valuable skill that should give Ron a boost in awareness and intuition if he can recognize when to approach something as he approaches chess.

As I said in the post, I am vastly oversimplifying, because not everyone plays chess, or knows the rules of chess. Of course, most of the time you're not recognizing patterns but calculating moves, but the candidate moved you consider and calculate, and the possibilities of tactics you see are all pattern recognition.

As for how many possible combinations - there are only a finite number of tactical patterns in chess. Forks, pins and skewers, the Greek gift, zugzwang, desperados, attacks on f2/f7, interference, to name a few. Of course you can't memorize every possible tactic, but you can memorize every possible tactical pattern. And as you solve puzzles and play games, you recognize them better.

I disagree with you on chess improving intuition (non-chess intuition, that is). Special reasoning is known to be related to chess though, so I agree with you there.

** In fairness, it's not just the chess thing that makes people think Ron is clever in a strategic way. He also has an incredibly developed understanding of sports tactics (well ok one sport, but wizards do seem to only have the one) for someone his age. And don't forget the "good at chess ergo smart" trope doesn't come from him beating Harry. It comes from him beating McGonagall's giant chess set- a set she was so confident was unbeatable she uses it to defend a priceless artefact from Voldemort.

You say all chess is is pattern recognition and you're right, to an extent. But there's also space for human error, creativity, and switching of tactics. No one just plays an entire game of chess by using an existing tactic, plan, or pattern- because if you do that your opponent will twig what you're about and you'll lose. The tactics in chess come from recognising your opponents habits and weaknesses and using those to beat them. Ditto sport tactics. And guess what? These are transferable skills into strategic planning, policing, military exercises, political campaigns and so on, which is what most "King of Strategy Ron" fics focus on.

Being an excellent strategist doesn't make one book smart, or even traditional clever. No one would ever cast Ron Weasley as a nerd or an academic, no matter how much chess he plays. But strategy, seeing the larger picture? Yeah he can do that- and someone has to. Hermione is doubtlessly the "smart one" but she gets bogged down in minutiae, tiny detail, and is liable to be sidetracked by information that although very interesting is not pertinent- she wants to know everything, she's a traditional academic, and, speaking as a traditional academic, we are not the best at big picture, we get very focused on niche interests. Harry is also, probably, smarter than Ron. But Harry's intelligence is people skills. He can read people, he is reactive to situations and he thinks fast on his feet.

Basically, there are many kinds of "clever" and the trio all have different kinds of intelligence. Hermione is book smart, as evidenced by her love of books. Harry is instinct smart, as evidenced by his ability at Defence/combat magic and also how he either takes to things instantly (flying) or fails dramatically at them (occlusion). Ron /is/ strategy smart- evidenced by his understanding of games like chess and quidditch that rely on tactics, but also by, for example, his ability to gather evidence. When he walks away in DH, what does he do? Goes and ingratiates himself with Bill, to find more out re the Order, the War, and to be able to return with more information and sight of the bigger picture- tbh you could argue it was this lack of sight of a bigger picture, the blundering around blind, that pissed him off so much and yes, Horcrux exposure, but the Horcrux only magnifies what is already there...

Absolutely, he's not. As I said, no one in their right mind would cast Ron as a genius or even an all rounder. But he is clearly better than average at tactical things, and it's perfectly realistic in fic to develop that talent and have Ron able, with the right encouragement, to turn it to real world applications. Of course anyone who goes down the "he's smarter than Hermione because she can't play chess" route is, frankly, demented. But it's a sign that Ron has a specific type of intelligence, he definitely has a talent for something that involves thought, memory and recognition and the ability to use those things to his advantage.

Half the problem with the kind of fics you're rallying against are that they think there's only one type of intelligence- book smart- and because Ron has shown talent in something associated with clever he must be secretly book smart. And that is, as you rightly say, nonsense!

** For me personally, chess is one of the few times Rowling gave readers "evidence" of Ron's intelligence. Not saying that chess= super smart, but it's a shorthand thats easily understood in children's books. I remember vague mentions of him using strategy in Quidditch, when he was on the team. So, when I'm writing Ron I try to hone in on specific traits- chess, strategy, and growing up in the wizarding world. He most likely knows a lot of cultural issues that Harry and Hermione never even think about.

Like other commenters have mentioned, it's possible that Rowling is using chess to display Ron's intelligence early on. Although it does grate on me, that this characteristic is never developed. Chess and love of Quidditch tactics could have easily developed into traits more useful in a war. It seems like all the groundwork was laid, then never utilized.

Rowling uses Hermione's traits to help them prepare to go one the run, I was always quite disappointed that Ron didn't play a larger role in DH.

I'd love to read something cracky where chess and Quidditch strategy has nothing to do with it, he learned hit-and-run tactics by living with Fred and George. That's the true survival game.

  Because chess is for the smartest people, that means Ron shouldn't have been good at chess, while Hermione could become good at chess; because Ron is lazy and a dum dum and Hermione is hard working and the Brightest Witch of Her Age. Yes, that's an argument that I've seen.

Ron is a fictional character written to be flawed; he's not your ailing mother that you have to defend to the death from every ill word spoken.

I mean, JKR wrote Hermione to be a self-insert/Mary-Sue, and it's irritating to see Harmony shippers magnify that. She wrote Ron to be 'normal' and have several negative traits. You're still allowed to like him and accept his character as a whole, warts and all.

But problem is 99 % of the time I see this 'criticism', it is just borderline bashing or removing all context from any given situation to make Ron look worse than he is.

famous example? Ron leaving in DH.\\
Was he in the wrong for leaving? yes.\\
Did he 'abandon Harry and Hermione and leave them alone to face this task all on their own, being disloyal' like many like to claim? No, and anyone who says that needs to re-read the books and get their facts straight.

1) It was Harry who told him to go away.\\
2) Ron wanted to come back immediately, he literally just left before the influence of the horcrux disappeared and he tried to get back, but was stopped by Snatchers. It was basically the equivalent of leaving the room in a fit of anger to clear your head.

** I dunno man. My dad hit USCF GM back in the day and all his chess buddies are smart as hell. So were their spouses and children. Almost universally high achievers all around. I did decent at tournaments and chess clubs back in the day.

Anecdotes aren't data, correlation != causation, etc. but I'd say two things. The average non-chess nerd is usually terrible at chess, and it doesn't take much ability or intelligence to stomp 99.9% of the population. But to be good by chess nerd standards? Nah , you gotta be smart.

Granted. We don't know how Ron would fare at tournaments and being great at chess doesn't require you to be a polymath type person(my dad's language skills are garbage).

I definitely agree with you that skill is more indicative of how much you've studied chess, rather than how smart you are(assuming your play is disciplined). I also think there is also a a fairly low ceiling for people who aren't ‚Äòacademically gifted', let's say.

Hogwarts is small enough an utterly mediocre chess nerd would stomp. So hard to get a feel for Ron off of that as well.

** Chess has been used as a visual shorthand to show that a character is smart or strategic for decades at this point. So, I don't understand this inability to accept that people want to use this trope in their writing when it has been used by so many different mediums.

It actually makes sense when you look at how impressive Ron's chess match really was. Ron has to protect four pieces at all cost. He's handicapped in ways not normal in chess. These are stone pieces destroying other stone pieces. Ron had to believe that if his friends or himself got hit, they could possibly die. He also has to protect the king for obvious reasons.

Secondly, they are under time constraints as Voldemort is ahead of them and they want to stop him from getting the stone. Ron is under absolutely enormous pressure to win the game as quickly as possible while assuring that his friends or the king don't taking. If Ron gets taken to early, there's no hope at that point. He can't make mistakes, but can't take all day to make decisions. That's a tough game from any perspective.

Ron is not just beating up on Harry as some want to believe. He played an excellent game of chess at age 12.

So if I was a fanfiction author, and I want Ron to have those characteristics, there's evidence that I could go that way. (purely in a literary sense)

** It measures adaptability and creativeness in situations though, and Ron is a very adaptable dude. You can memorize a lot of the positions from the board using the engine(well since we are talking about the nineties then the book, since engines were popularized in the XXI century after all => and chess had a slightly different main-line in the last century than it is today though, cause people didn't have computers or engines to determine the best possible move in exact position at any given time, and that precise and that quick => and even the engine is sometimes bonkers and has a completely inhuman way of developing, hence why it's only good to look for broadening your horizons, but not to blindly follow it). Learning chess now is quicker than back then due to improvement of technology and easier access to material. And as a modern chess player, today mostly is thought that accurate moves = engine moves, but back in the nineties you still had to be a little more creative while studying. So if we use the timeline back then (since HP is set in the nineties, and neither Muggles or wizards didn't have an engine or anything computerlike to use). So, in a way, it meant more strategizing, adaptibility and creativity than pattern recognition, back then then now. That still doesn't mean Ron is a ultra mega giga god strategist, by any means

Adaptability is a trait most strategists use, cause they need to know their armies and field to certain extent on how to place formations and when. BUT that does not mean that every chess player is a good strategist. It takes creativity to use it the best possible way your adversary can't respond to gain board presence/to break even or even win(like not using the first best move, instead use the fifth or sixth or completely something entirely new to throw them off their rockers). As far as you probably know, Magnus makes some "unconventional" moves in his games(unconventional for an engine and the mainline).

Just playing with a defect start is really a hard thing to do, and Ron had a big minus in material (that being he couldn't use Harry, Hermione or the King to their full intent because losing either of them is bad, the latter being the main piece anyways, and he couldn't sacrifice Harry and Hermione). If you pull a game without being able to use the full extent of your bishop, rook and knight, you are surely a good player (now that you mention it I would like a chess mod where you select three figures where you can only sacrifice one and that only when it's mate #1, and if the other two get eaten before that, you lose the game).

** Yup, I agree. In actuality, chess is not really a good indication of intelligence past, well, being good at chess. Chess players might be self-selected for certain types of intelligence (after all, enjoying that type of game isn't /everyone's/ cup of tea), but it's not on its own a perfect indicator. Likewise for strategy - strategic thinking in chess will obviously be different from in other situations.

However, as visual shorthand/in our culture, being a good chess player has fallen into that 'intelligent' and 'strategic' bucket. If we see a character in a movie be an expert at chess, we (as the audience) can infer that they're meant to be smart and strategic - even if the work isn't directly saying that.

When it comes to Ron, I personally think that the interest in having him be smarter/more strategic is less of a 'this is how he was in-universe', and more of a 'what-if we made him be better at those things?', which is interesting to explore.

Chess is primarily a test of your ability to predict and problem solve. Being good at Chess means you can logically go "If I do this, then that might happen, so I should be prepared in case it does."

I don't know if Ron ever shows that ability outside of his chess games in book 1. He may only be good at that kind of thinking within a visual context (e.g. Chess or Checkers). But the relationship between Chess and Intelligence is there 'cause chess does measure your ability to predict.

** Apparently, I have an above-average IQ. Some of my behaviours (especially regarding social issues and cues) sometimes make me wonder if I'm actually on the Spectrum somewhere (a long story), or if my brain is just wired differently in a few areas.

Anyway, it's nothing too amazing like you'd expect on hearing that, but apparently it was enough to get me placed with like six other people I knew to do another, more complicated exam after I and the rest of my year-mates finished the normal exam.

I thought we were in trouble after they shuffled us into an unused classroom somewhere, lol.

I was also assigned to a Professor along with a few of that group that also taught the year below us, and we often had separate assignments from everyone else (freaking algebra when I was like 10, which I was shit at, haha) in our year, who were in the other class next door.

Apparently, I also unnerve people sometimes by being able to watch a movie or episode or something (or read a book) and 'map' how it's going to end very early on, including its plot-twists, et cetera, with reasonable accuracy based on what's shown at that point. I think it may be some sort of "pattern recognition" thing going on since a lot of books/movies/shows use a format that's pretty common (such as the Hero's Journey).

I'm like that with words in the English language, too (apparently that baffled my English teachers, when I was a kid, haha).

Art too was another odd thing: I used to colour in my workbooks (which annoyed the teachers) after finishing my assignments a lot earlier than my peers, and I liked to paint (really crude) landscape copies when I was like 4--8.

When I play RTS games, I'm a reactionary player to the other players' moves or the team-player that creates supporting attacks/moves to my allies' assaults, and that's how I often win, if I don't get the shit kicked out me first.

Now, you may think I'm bragging or something, or you may be confused why I'm giving a brief life-lesson about my past.

Here's the kicker: I know how to play chess. I know how the pieces move. I can think several moves ahead and anticipate what the other player would do if I do X, Y, and Z...

*But holy shit am I terrible at it.*

Seriously, I'm awful at it. I expect I would be at checkers or any other board game like it, too.

It's one reason why I cringe (trope aside) when I see Ron being a strategic mastermind, helping to win the war against Voldemort, in fiction... because he's average at chess?

Ron doesn't study because it bores him, but he obviously studies chess to an extreme degree. If he were more engaged in his classes, he'd be rivaling Hermione.

** I'd be surprised if logical ability doesn't help with inventing new strategies or maybe even recognizing the best strategy to use, and memory doesn't help with remembering strategies (either for your own use, or that you've seen the opponent employ) that you've memorized during a match.

But that doesn't mean everyone who is good at one is good at the other, this is true. It just might grant a small bonus to one's chess skill if one is smart... especially if one is figuring it out basically without training.

** I think the issue really lies in what is "smart" and what is "intelligent". As some people have pointed out before, a lot of Hermione's behaviour points more to studious than intelligent. I don't think she's stupid - I actually think she /is/ intelligent. But the fact that she does well in school doesn't = intelligence. This is true in the real world. Lots of "average" people do well in school because they work hard (plus multiple other factors, like they know how to ask for help, and there's supports in place, etc, etc).

The same for Ron. I honestly think he's smart. He does above average at school. He's not emotionally intelligent, but he's not exactly below average there for a boy of his age.

And being good at chess doesn't = being intelligent in many ways, /but/ it means you're either instinctively good at recognising patterns or you've put in a lot of work (or both). There's a reason why chess is part of the smart culture - because pattern recognition is an uncommon skill that can be incredibly useful. Does it mean you're intelligent in every way? No of course not. But there are few smart people who are "smart in every way."

It seems like a lot of Ron's chess ability comes down to having done it for years, and an enthusiasm for it that was presumably encouraged by his parents/family. But if he can use that skillset to defeat adults at age eleven, then yes, he is smart. Or lucky - but the two are often mistaken for each other in the real world as well.

** Well, in the first place I don't think Ron is an amazing chess player to begin with. He's good. That's all. Why is that not good enough, and he must be some super genius? He works fine without that.

Anyway, but that aside -- I don't think I'm entirely discarding the chess <--> intelligence link. Anyone who has an amazing talent and is proficient in something without much trying already at a young age is highly intelligent. Mozart for music, Gauss for mathematics, and people like Carlsen in chess. Those aren't average people. Anyone can't do what they do, even if they try their entire life.

But of course, that has nothing to do with chess in particular, and even less with strategy. No offence to him, but if there ever is a war here (let's hope not), I'd prefer an experienced general over Carlsen at the helm :P

There's zero evidence that Ron has "an amazing talent"; he's better than other 11-year-olds at a game he plays a lot and they don't. That's not amazing at all. It's to be expected. And since he does play a lot, you can't say "without much trying". He practices chess a lot, so he's better at chess than his peers. It's that simple.

** I'm pretty sure it needs some smarts to be really good at chess. Ron knows more than just the rules- they all know the rules. However I agree, that you don't need to be a genius. After all Ron plays a lot. He probably knows about a lot of common mistakes people make that he can Exploit, and technically he could just know a few good strategies by heart and hope that Harry who's a beginner doesn't know how to counter them.

I mean sometimes I can google a easy chess strategy and play it against my father who's a lot smarter than me. But since he doesn't know it (we don't play that much chess) he'll Fall for it. But then he knows about it and won't Fall for it again any time soon.

** I generally agree that chess =/= intelligence. HOWEVER, I do want to remark on a caveat.

The first is young kids. Chess is amazingly complex and young kids don't have the patience to learn deep theory yet, they're playing on intuition and some sort of pattern understanding and calculating if this/then that. No one teaches them that, it just clicks for some. Given that Ron is 11 and clearly experienced, we can assume he started playing pretty early on (and winning regularly, they're kids - otherwise you'd have quit by now). Now I'm not saying that kids who don't play chess at a young age are dumb, there's a ton of stuff that goes into who discovers chess. But I do argue that kids that start playing chess that young at a high enough level to best adults cannot be completely stupid. Adults have had time to learn these patterns, kids have not.

It gets trickier when transposing our experience as adults. Even if you're a smart adult - if you're new to chess you don't know the usual traps, etc. You don't know not to accept the poisoned pawn in the Najdorf. Your opponent can be dumb as a rock, but simply be a more studious chess aficionado and they'll likely beat you bloody over the board.

But chess ability is really just chess ability. That doesn't mean you don't learn some valuable things from it. Saccing your queen, but you have forced mate in 6? Doesn't matter, it still feels uncomfortable. Recall Ron immediately understanding during McGonagall's chess match that he's got to sacrifice himself to win and didn't even hesitate? People die and get hurt in war and it demands brutal sacrifices. That's the kind of understanding that I could buy Ron having or coming around to more quickly whereas Hermione would argue that there's got to be another way.

So sure, while we may not have causation - I do accept that Ron's chess ability could contribute to further character development, in line with my argument that based on the context of /when/ Ron began learning chess he cannot be that dull.

Huh? Is that actually something people feel o.O

I admit my chess skills deplorable because I'm playing once every blue moon, but, y'know, they are chess pieces (literally, not figuratively!). If it feels uncomfortable, that's because a powerful piece on the board is gone XD

Anyway, being able to sacrifice /people/ is actually not uncommon. All you need is distance; it gets harder if you have to look them in the eye. Even so, enough people also can do /that/. Whether that is a good thing I'll leave for everyone by themselves to decide ...

Some people, who are usually weak and don't understand that the goal is checkmate instead of having more pieces than your opponent.

Exactly. Anyone can order a nuke drop without blinking, but when there was an idea that the nuclear codes should be inside a person's heart, who the president would personally have to kill to nuke someone, everyone was much no-no
