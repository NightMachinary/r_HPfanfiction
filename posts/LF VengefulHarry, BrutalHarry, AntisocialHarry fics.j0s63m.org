*** there is nothing wrong with an edgy power fantasy as long as is done with finesse, the problem is that like 99% of power fantasy are so in your face that is hard to maintain the suspension of disbelief

**** That's my problem with power fantasy in general is that I don't find a 13 year old kid being one of the most powerful people alive all that entertaining. There stops being value in anything the mc achieves cause there was never really a question they wouldn't achieve it. As for “edgy” stories I find that they all fall into one of if not all of these categories the first being extreme child abuse, neglect of a child because said child literally makes themselves an outcast of the family she lets deny basic paternal instincts and treat them like that, the mc only being able of expressing their emotions on a extreme level of the spectrum, and a pity fest that goes on for so long it start at the second chapter and continues till the fanfiction is done. I gotta be honest with you I don't really understand why all that is so popular in fanfiction.

*** Not edgy as such. Apathetical yet vengeful Harry would be best way to describe it.
