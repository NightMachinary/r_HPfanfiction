Any information floating around? I know the site owner is notoriously difficult to get hold of :D


** The owner of HPfanficarchive passed away on March 27, 2020. As of this time, we aren't certain /what/ will be happening with the site. That is all the information I am aware of.

** Very sad it appears to be down. I know the forum site went down several weeks ago so I wonder if the domain expired.

I wish we could get an archive of it. TheWayBackMachine only goes until like October of last year :(

*** Unfortunately the last time I managed to set up an archive for HPFFA was Jan 2018. I try to keep the FFnet archives updated monthly just in case, but if HPFFA comes up again ill put it on high priority.

*** And even then it doesn't seem to work. If you accept the warning, all it says is that you don't have authority to access stories on the server. :(

** I was probably one of the last to cause it to be accessed before it went down. I commented on a post about dementors and in the comment linked to two stories on hpfanficarchive. Fanfictionbot returned one story A History of Azkaban by Nebkreb but it failed to return with the information from the story called Secrets by potter8668.

So whatever happened hpfanficarchive failed within a second or two between the the two requests. I'm not sure if there is any useful information that fanfictionbot records that could help the owner of hpfanficarchive figure out the timeline and what may have happened.
