** Tbh I never quite understood the angsty Harry that hates on everyone yet people still try to be friends with him. I mean even the best of friendships fall apart when a person indicates that they no longer want to be friends. It's understandable that you might not always have the best of days and a true friend will indeed try to comfort you. But if you act like that for prolonged time, then no matter how chosen one you are, no one will want to be friends with you,

  YES!

See, but, Harry's the popular kid, so everyone is just /dying/ to be his friend no matter how badly he treats people! Like those teen sitcoms where everyone sucks up to the cool kids to get "special" treatment in middle/high school.

**** I think the angstiest canon Harry was in OotP and he was quite alone. The only people who stood by him were Ron, Hermione and Sirius. And even then, he was snappy and upset but he wasn't like that all the time. He alternated towards his friends between likable Harry and shitty Harry (and Hermione always made a point to call him out when he was being unfairly shitty).

Quite reasonable reaction to fighting for your life, watching someone die, being denied information, and oh, carving lines into your hand.

****** Being angry about all of those is fair, but being shitty because of those towards the only people who still stand by you is not. Also I never quite understood why people make such a big deal out of carved lines in Harry's hand yet no one complains that the Carrows were punishing 11 year olds with the Cruciatus Curse... maybe because the story is not written from those poor kids' perspective. Also what about the first year Muggle-borns collected from the Hogwarts Express and sent to Azkaban? Why are you not crying about those yet your are crying about some stupid flesh wound.

Edit: whoever downvoted this is probably a cruel child abuser

******* Because you are mixing two things up. Systematic campaigns which are basically copied from the history of the Third Reich with Jews crossed out with crayon and Muggleborn written over it are undeniably evil and I do not think that anyone would argue the opposite.

The scars are certainly not worse than the magical Reichssippenamt, but at that point the veil has been lifted and such measures are what is to be expected by the government of the big bad. But Umbridge in book 5 is a different beast, she is a member of the legitimate, supposedly good government who swoops down to the level of the big bad (remember, she ordered a political assassination of a teenager, tortured him with the blood quills and then tried to crucio him) for the sake of power. Also, keep in mind that it was not just a quick cut which left a scar but the result of thousands of times dragging something across a wound again and again. If you did that in prison or the army, do you have any idea how large the scandal would be?

And your edit with the ad-hominem guarantees a downvote.

******** Molly spoke proudly of the scars Arthur still had from the time when the back then caretaker caught them on a night stroll. Physically punishing children was a common thing in the educational institutions up until mid-twentieth century (and the wizarding world appears to be stuck in the seventeenth-eighteenth century) and so were state sanctioned tortures and punishments (a high ranking official could easily have someone below them maimed or killed by simply giving an order). So I never found the Black Quill punishment as big of a deal as people on reddit make it sound. I'd gladly take that over being practice target for the Cruciatus Curse, considering the world we're talking about. Also you are referring to a government as good when they kept a prison like Azkaban guarded by wraiths who sucked out the happiness and hope out of people. That's quite close to the biblical definition of hell.

Furthermore the punishments inflicted by the Death Eaters were applicable to purebloods as well (Longbottom was just as much of a victim).

********* Caning was a one off punishment (in most cases), Umbridge was ripping open the same wound again and again.

The campaign against purebloods was fairly limited to those who stood out opposing the regime. Neville was in the DoM and leading the Hogwarts resistance. Luna likewise had fought openly in the DoM and her father ran a regime critical newspaper. What do you expect Voldemort to do, give them an Order of Merlin?

But overall Voldemort did not treat purebloods badly, else they would not be his power base. And in the Ministry, certainly a lot of people collaborated rather than carry out sabotage and boycott work. And, as can be seen throughout history, fear alone does not pacify a land. So it could not only be the stick, there had to be enough carrots or status quo for Voldemort to take over so completely within days.

********** Probably that would not work in real life and if you know of any good story that presents Voldemort's rule through someone else's eyes than Harry, I would happily take your advise because Voldemort-centric canon-compliant fics are so rare. However in Book 7 it is quite clear that Voldemort's rule is based on terror and fear. Lupin says that even if people might suspect it's him pulling the strings, they are afraid to talk among themselves because they don't know who is or isn't a Death Eater. Furthermore, maybe at first he might have been using carrots, Voldemort rules even over the Death Eaters through fear. Treats the Malfoys and Bellatrix like shit, treats Wormtail like shit (despite him being the one who helped him regain his body), tortures anyone that summons him because of Harry Potter. I always thought that despite his ideologies being closer to the Nazis, his style of rule is closer to Stalin's.

*********** Lupin is hardly an unbiased source though. There is not a single character which actually represents those who are more annoyed by the whole thing than really threatened, those who think that the shops closing was the worst part of the whole mess. Or at least no character which was more than an offhand mention.

And people being afraid to talk openly amongst each other, that's fairly normal in authoritarian countries. East Germany was particularly notorious for using civilian informants, yet there were/are plenty of people who didn't consider it more than a minor inconvenience. There's a reason why the successor party of the former Socialist Single party has consistently disturbingly good results in the East here. A good chunk of the population learned to live under the iron fist and had good lifes because they accepted reality and felt no need to put a toe across the line. Of course, that's not the entire population, but Voldemort was pursuing a rather final solution for that part of the population anyway.

************ We are free to imagine whatever we want because canonically there's no other information than whatever Harry receives. Of course people will go on with their lives if they are not affected by the changes, but my inclination is to believe that, since it's a fantasy story, the trope always goes that the Dark Lord rules through fear.

In any case, I'm not quite sure how this conversation is related to my initial comment. Umbridge is a shady and power-hungry politician who abuses her position both within Hogwards and the Ministry, but (and that comes from the book 7) the Carrows make her seem tame. Personally I wasn't as shaken by the Black Quill scene as by the thought that children as young as 11 were used for practicing dark arts. Harry himself is not that affected by it since he keeps getting himself in detention with her and never complains about it.

So I don't quite get it why the fandom always calls her the second most evil character after Voldemort. Pretty sure several Death Eaters are worse (I would think Fenrir is actually even worse than Voldemort although his evilness is sort of righteous), but they don't appear as much.

************* Because of the scale of her "work". Umbridge was chairwoman and chief judge of Voldemort's deportation scheme which is clearly inspired by Nazi Germany, the Carrows were a pair of sick bastards, which is deplorable but sadly not uncommon.

If you go by crimes we see, Draco Malfoy probably earns the number 2 spot with a long list of war crimes no other Death Eater committed because they were pretty open about their loyalty and membership. Although the very existence of a werewolf probably violates several treaties as well.

************** That's a fair point but Umbridge does nothing more than offer a sham trial to those that the Death Eaters round up. Most Death Eaters would likely do the same. If anything, I would say Runcorn is even worse because he is in charge of reviewing backgrounds. He also holds this power over the heads of those with a dubious origin because he can easily falsify information for witches and wizards that are not from the sacred twenty-eight to make them appear as Muggle-borns.
