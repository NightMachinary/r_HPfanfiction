Curious about what tropes you mix up with cannon. I recall reading in a fanfiction where Luna was passively getting sent information(Seer) into her mind during sleep, hence her eccentric behavior and I was like "WOW that makes so much sense why dont I remember this from the books!"

******* Well, you kinda can. I don't mean arguing that the OC/spell "is" canon. But there is nothing wrong with stating "a second-year Hufflepuff called Tom Smith /could/ exist in canon for all we know", and therefore saying "Tom Smith canonically doesn't exist" wouldn't be a true statement. Same thing. I think there's a difference between things that aren't mentioned in canon but could exist between the lines (i.e. Tom Smith, the Notice-Me-Not Charms) and things that canon makes clear /do not/ exist (i.e. Wards, depleteable Magical Cores, a twin brother of Harry Potter).

** *Fanon:* Wizards are either pagan or atheist, and are generally clueless about Christianity. due to the Christian church's historical involvement in prosecuting and burning witches.

*Canon:* Wizards are, at the very least, culturally Christian. They celebrate Christian holidays (Christmas, Easter), namedrop God, and have some familiarity with the Bible.

It looks like fics just use paganism for worldbuilding, and atheism to look cool, but it's not supported by canon, even if you take away canon's themes on resurrection, love, sacrifice, and forgiveness.

  Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. ‘“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death”...'

Only if the Satanist is a wizard. Magic isn't about the spells, incantations, or wand-waving. It comes from inside the wizard. A muggle who grabbed a genuine wand and tried to perform a spell would fail.

***** This errors on me since I was mixing fiction with reality, but when I posted that I was considering what if they'd simply performed accidental magic and had no information about magic hence they got burned. Though that'd be rare I'd assume considering all the magic schools around the world, nevertheless sometime to consider.(Also I never checked Pottermore so whatever)

Regarding what I said about Satanists, is their anything on how magic works in Harry Potter? Part of the reason I take to fanon so much is their theories on magic, addmitedly it's rare to find good fics that explain magic but they're there regardless

Certain characterizations:

*All forgiving, non-violent Dumbledore. He encourages Harry to use any spell if they're attacked in HBP and keeps Snape on a tight leash.

*Snape being kind to all his Slytherins. PS suggests he's critical of them all save for Draco.

*oblivious, pushover, "Just Harry" Harry. He takes a turn for the worst in OOTP (ugh Theodore Nott), but he notices so much between 1-4 that he can even tell Ron how to hold his arms while under polyjuice. He does what he wants, save for where Dumbledore is concerned, and "Just Harry" wasn't even about being the BWL

Draco could have, at any time:

- Fled the country. Tracking down Karkaroff in some remote cottage is probably easier than trying to find Malfoy (with dyed hair) in NYC or Houston.

- Attempted to off Dumbledore directly instead of committing a bunch of war crimes. How difficult would it have been to stab him with a cursed dagger in some corridor, maybe even using the first idea as a pretence.

And this "child's" life is more valuable than the lives and well being of all other students in the school for some reason? Malfoy nearly killed Katie and Ron and Dumbledore knew this and did /nothing/!

He should've confronted Malfoy, exposed him and if he wants to be "forgiving", placed him under a Fidelius. If his parents die in the bargain then /so be it/, they're in a war and they had willingly chosen Voldemort. It's better than playing with the lives of the students.

I've read some where he's so insane and eccentric it's cringy. Yes he's rather eccentric but alot of people forget - He's the only person able to duel Voldermort equally, he defeated Grindelwald and won a war, he is a leader.

I don't really like Harry as a character that much imo, I much prefer characters like - Tom riddle, Dumbledore and Snape. It'd be much more realistic for Harry to become a shy, introverted, bitter kid, or a sociopath but, hey what do I know. (When I mention Tom riddle, the key is TOM RIDDLE, not Voldermort)
