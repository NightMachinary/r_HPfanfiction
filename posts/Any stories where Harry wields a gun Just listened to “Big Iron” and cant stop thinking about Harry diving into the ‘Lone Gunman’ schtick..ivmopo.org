Additionally the song reminded me of a crossover with Mass Effect where someone refers to him as the “Wizard with a big iron on his hip” when teasing him about being unnerved by something or other.

Also:

To the town of old Hogsmead rose a wizard one fine day\\
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say”

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Best I ever read in this vein was linkffn(Old Soldiers Never Die), though it leaned a little too heavily on "muggle weapons are super mega awesome amazing and the magical world could never hope to survive".

** Okay but I'd read this so hard. Kid Harry was like really into those old Clint Eastwood westerns. He carry's his wand in a holster on his belt

** There's a whole movie like that, [[https://harrypotterwithguns.com]] . It got taken down from youtube but copies are still floating around and should be findable with a bit of effort. People who watched the whole thing say it's hysterically funny all the way through. I thought the trailer was very funny but am not into movies enough to want to sit through 2 hours of even a good one, usually.

Harry with a gun and other Muggle weapons shows up in HPMOR but might not be what you are looking for. If it is, then there's a spin-off fic "Alastor Moody and the Methods of Engineering" that has more of it.
