Seriously why do people not realize how cringy an eleven year old would look saying "Professor, Draco Malfoy has been firing hexes in the corridors and poorly at that. I'll leave his wand with you while I escort Miss Granger to the Hospital Wing." Like dude you've been friends with Hermione for years now, call her by her freaking name. It makes me think of Harry Potter as a neckbeard and ruins the fic completely for me (bonus points if he has long hair that he keeps in a pony tail, because that never looks horrible /s)


** Yeah. 360Saturn is right. It's older (particularly Victorian and earlier) British etiquette. We were big on the 'use Honorifics and Surnames only until you're given permission to use their forename' business back in the day. If someone were to call Hermione by her first name before she'd given them permission, it'd be regarded as being 'overly familiar' and kind of skeezy.

In America, it's perfectly normal to talk to strangers in a friendly and amiable way, but here in England you'd be looked at like a lunatic or with mild to moderate fear if you tried to speak to someone you didn't know without a legitimate reason. It's sort of like a less-gross version of going up to a complete stranger on the subway, throwing your arm over their shoulders, and then proceeding to tell them all about your latest bowel movements and how your doctor recommends certain kinds of drugs to fix it. Calling a stranger by their first name without permission is that kind of weird. Culturally, we don't really like closeness without permission or history. That forename thing isn't really a thing anymore, but even children are still taught it sometimes. I imagine it is indeed just used in HP fanfic as an element of the Magical Victorian England trope.

If Harry was still calling her 'Miss Granger' after years of friendship, that would be weird, though. It reeks of Teaboo-noobs trying to be British and not really getting the point. The only time a longstanding acquaintance would still call their friend by an honorific would be if there was some degree of social imbalance. Like two friends growing up together, one becomes a Lord and the other becomes his Butler, the Butler would always refer to the Lord by title and not first name. I believe it's the same in the military, where officers and grunts are friendly and usually refer to each other respectfully rather than by first name, but that could just be Star Trek rather than reality.

*** Yes - sorry to let my lit nerd run away with me there.

To add on to this point, something which I didn't touch on in my original comment...

To people not familiar with British literature and children's literature in general, just in case you aren't aware, the way in which the characters talk at Hogwarts - referring to teachers by their surnames only (Snape, Flitwick), kids to other kids by surname (Granger, Potter yes - but don't forget the Trio /always/ refer to Malfoy rather than Draco), and teachers to kids as title surname (e.g. Mister Potter) - none of those were things that JK Rowling made up for her /magical fantasy world/. They're accurate depictions of how people at private schools in the UK talk(ed) and refer(ed) to each other. Both in a Victorian setting, and in modern day Britain, where they persist as traditions although people might not any more always stick to them.

So for Pureblood characters and Slytherins, arguably hanging on to that kind of language is actually very /in/-character.

(Although fwiw OP, I don't personally agree with the popular fanon conception that the wizarding world is /completely/ neo-Victorian down to almost being an export of historical Victorian Britain but plus magic.)

**** That sounds about right though I would take it a step further as well. Having a strict and formal culture for the magicals seems extremely important to me. To summarize a popular quote 'A well armed society is a polite society', when everybody is carrying a weapon that has a destructive range from small pistol to instant death to nearly WMD (fiendfyre anyone?) politeness seems a must have.

It was not that long ago historically we were still bashing it out drawing lines for countries and the wizarding world has had magical wars on top of the muggle ones during that time.

Forcing etiquette and manners would help keep tense situations from blowing up. It's one thing for muggles to get into a fist fight over anger. It's another for a wizard to start spamming off the equivalent of a rocket launcher when angry (bombarda).

Etiquette was created to keep Lords and people in power in check through social constraints. I can only see it growing even more important in a magical society.

You have plenty of historical figures who were (in)famous for getting into duels, most of which ended at least in grave injury. Also, the idea of duelling for fun was pretty popular even 100 years ago. For example, facial scars from fencing duels were seen as marks of honour amongst German students.

It kept things generally in working order for thousands of years. Roman era and earlier languages were littered with forms of address towards others. There is no way such a method stayed in use and was so heavily used for thousands of years unless it worked.

Sure there are tons of examples on it backfiring or being ignored throughout history. Still overall it was a good system that helped far more than it hindered.

I wonder if there is a study done on general public politeness, even false politeness, in comparison to how many citizens are actively armed in first world countries and/or regions.

The biggest part of etiquette and keeping things level is the forced separation of emotions and actions.

Military discipline is nothing more than enforced etiquette brought to an extreme. You may want nothing more than to punch your leadership in their fat mouth for being a dumbass yet you stand their at attention and respond as needed.

I would argue that extreme etiquette would actually increase friction and mood disorders in the long run, due to bottling things up.

Teaching children resilience and how to manage and share their emotions also reduces heat of the moment problems. In fact, it is more effective.

In my opinion, there are more friendly ways of ensuring the same outcome than stifling people.

**** It varies. There's not really a strict etiquette used these days. I'd have to try and dig out my old heraldry books, but I believe the old ways used to be either a simple numbering system or reading out enough of their titles that you'd get the difference (Earl Whatever of the Whatever Estate, Lord of Whatever-One vs Earl Whatever of the Wherever Estate, Lord of Whatever-Two, etc).

In a more modern setting though, there's really no strict etiquette for that at all. There are a few ways I've noticed or heard of that tend to be most used, but they're not really specific to England or specifically mandated etiquette rules, so adding them in is probably unnecessary. I just figured, "Why not?"

So, if you're trying to refer to one of the two people specifically, there are two main ways to go. Sometimes you just make sure you're pointing to or looking at the relevant person. Think McGonagall looking over her classes while glaring at Harry. I knew a teacher that used to hold their glasses like a pipe (pretentious bastard) and pointed with the temples of his glasses at people, whether they were same-surnamed or not. When we were actually paying attention, it made distinguishing the same-named folk quite easy.

Some teachers used to have nicknames or distinguishing names for different people with the same surname, whether the generic 'Mr Whatever One' and 'Mr Whatever Two' or something more specific and in-joke referential. I've known a couple people to try add qualifiers to things. "The Elder Mr Whatever" or similar.

If both are involved in the same conversation, then you can just refer to them as Mr Whatever and The Other Mr Whatever. You can designate which is which as you prefer, though I've noticed it's usually the one you like the most that gets the first ranking. :)

Finally, if you're trying to refer to both of them collectively, you can also refer to them collectively as Messrs Whatever/Whatever and Whatever. The female equivalent is Misses or Mmes (short for Mesdames). I'm not entirely sure if the Mx honorific has a plural yet, but I'm sure they'll work one out if not. (Mx is gender-neutral, for those unaware).

** It entirely depends on the setting and situation. For instance, the one you mentioned in your example shows that he's being formal - towards the professor, and in a way that might highlight how reasonable he's being. In other formal situations, it would make sense as well.

It can also be made into a societal thing, as others have mentioned - it's older British etiquette, particularly towards acquaintances and people you don't know, and making the Wizarding World operate on those can fit thematically fairly easily.

Now, if the fic is going to explore more political and formal situations, I would rather it age up the characters - even if an 11 year old doing that would be /possible/, and could be made into a reasonable setup, it's much more fun to speed things along IMO. Then all the plots and dealings that we tend to see would not stand out as much.

** Your example fails a bit, because that's a situation in which it's not implausible that Harry might choose to speak extra-formally. If he says "Malfoy tried to hex Hermione, here's his wand, I'm taking her to Madam Pomfrey" it frames the incident informally, an incident between children. If he speaks formally, however, it can be the start of framing and handling the entire incident formally, possibly through the legal system.

Formality is a tool to be used at appropriate times, and it's not strange for a more politically-minded Harry to deliberately tailor the formality/adultness of his speech depending upon the impression he wants to create.
