40k words plus if u can. Don't care about Weasley/Dumbledore bashing. Don't care about mature content (I actually like it) P.S. And maybe u know any stories like Awakening? (harmony of) I mean like ruthless Harry, that understands war is a war, and u need to actually kill people if u want to win it. Thx for ur attention, have a great day.


** I swear there was a near-identical thread to this one, not even 2 days ago.

+Also, you should flair this as a Request, not a Recommendation - the latter is for when you have a fic you want to recommend.+ EDIT: This has been done, so strikethrough'ed.

Both of those things out of the way, one of the few Creature!Harry fics I know of that doesn't devolve into a poorly written slashfic is The Beast Within.

Harry is a werewolf, there's canon pairings with very minor soulmate-type stuff. Sadly the sequel's been 'on hiatus' for about 4 years now.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.
