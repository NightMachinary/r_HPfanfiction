Thanks.


** Having only gotten about half way through it i can only assume it's either het or gen, but as i've said i've only gotten halfway through it so i might be wrong

*** Thanks, and please, when you do finish it, please let me know what it is. I don't like multi much, nor gen, but I do read them. I just can't relate to slash fics, femslash is ok, but maleslash just isn't possible for me. I've tried enough times, both with and without smut and I just can't.

** Going to spoiler tag it just in case for anyone who hasn't caught up and doesn't want to know.

It's het, not sure if multi or not, but at where it is at now, it isn't.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

** Harry is straight and is paired with a certain marvel character(Asuuming she doesn't die!) But it is expanded more in the sequel Ghosts of the Past.
