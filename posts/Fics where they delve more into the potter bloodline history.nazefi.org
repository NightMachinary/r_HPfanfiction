I read a similar fic by UllTima101 named A new better life, I liked the direction he went with.


** Little self promotion here, and forewarning, the story hasn't been posted yet, but I am actively writing and plan to start releasing chapters soon.

In the fic I'm writing, I have the potter's being descendant of the peverells (can't remember if that part is canon or not). But I've added on that the peverell line is descendant from morgana Le fay. I won't get into more than that because I have some cool stuff planned for this subplot

*** Which version of Morgan Le Fay are you using?

Depending on the interpretation, it could do some interesting things

**** I'm using the common "Morgan was bad" Arthurian take, with a big caveat, morgana wasn't actually the bad guy. History is written by the victor, and when Merlin won, history was written and twisted to make morgana the bad guy. I have it written that Merlin gave birth to Salazar Slytherin familial line, and thus voldemort is descendant from Merlin.

It gives me the opportunity to have a cool take on Arthurian legend and tiring it into harry potter verse. There's also some poetic writing here since lily and James were seduced (using the term non sexually) into the death eaters side of things, and were killed when they tried to mutiny against voldemort. Harry grows up hated because his parents were death eaters despite him deffinetly not being a blood supremest himself, and over the course of the 4ish year timeline I have for the books, he will rebuild his family's reputation through fighting against the death eaters and will make ally's along the way.

Morgana also makes an appearence very early in the fiction and will be a big part of it throughout, and will be Harry's chief mentor. I won't ruin how I have done this though (no she is not alive)

It's also a harry and Daphne pairing, because I love daphne's character lol.

***** Ironically Morgana not being that bad, seems to be the original telling of the Arthurian canon. Her evil with Mordred for example, is a later addition.

The original telling, has her more as a Cartoon Villain, where one of her schemes was literally to scare Guinevere to death with the Green Knight. After that she pretty much retires and becomes a benevolent sorceress. She is then one of the few who attempt to heal Arthur and sail him to Avalon after the Strife of Camlann. That and she's a fairy, hence Le Fay.

****** I actually didn't know that lol. But I think I've got a pretty damn cool premise for my fanfiction. It's a take I don't think anyone else has tried, as least not in any of the fics I have read

****** I'm also not using any horcruxes or prophesies in my fiction. Voldemort looks like his younger charasmatic self in that he didn't go through the physical transformations the horcrux creation caused, and because he's not immortal, he is smarter and more dangerous since he isn't going to be a complacent immortal villain

** Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower) has so much history. So much. Part 9 is just family trees. Of every family in the universe. Stretching back at least 5 generations. It's insane.

** I am constantly confused about “Strong Blood” by CooLibrarian linkffn(7211094): there are some parts which are really great, and some which are very much not, and the whole thing is unfinished, but there is a lot of family histories (more Evanses, but some Potters as well, I believe).

Also, “Honour Thy Blood” linkffn(12155794) (the author is also working on rewrite of the story).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
