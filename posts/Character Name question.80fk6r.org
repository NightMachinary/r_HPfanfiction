What are some believable names for Marius Black's children and grandchildren? I had French names in mind since Marius is from a French novel although his parents wouldn't have known that.

Clementine for a possible daughter (born in the 1950s)

Ferdinand for a possible son (born in the 1950s)

Claire for a granddaughter (born 1980)

Florian for a grandson (born 1976/1977)

Do you think Marius would've changed his last name?


** Marius is the name of a moon crater, so maybe look that up instead. There's a lot of 'normal' names there that would fit in with the Muggle world (Carol, Charles, Natasha, Mary, Mavis, Melissa, Michael, Robert, Rosa, Ruth, Stella, Susan, Walter... Yeah, there's a lot of possibilities). I'd also make sure those names were used in that time period.

**** Granddaughter would be classified as a Muggle, I think. Are you looking for unusual but not overtly striking names, then? Other crater names: Alan, Albert, Ann, Delia, Diana, Donna, Edith, Felix, Grace, Harold, Ian, Isabel, Julienne, Kasper, Kathleen, Kira, Leonid, Linda, Louise, Patricia, Priscilla, Vera (these are doing a quick search, there's a lot more)

Another way is to look at a list of asteroids.

******** Sounds cool. Marius for me had a son who moved to Wales and married an Irish mughleborn who died of Dragon Pox when Corvus was really young. The father raised Corvus until he was almost 15 when he got hit by a car when trying to walk home drunk. Corvus then went to Hogwarts.

********** Kicked out of the family for being a squib, moved away and tried to raise his family following the traditions of his family, only without magic. His son shows promise with many magical signs but is still classified as a squib. He gets a job in an Irish shopping district and meets a muggleborn witch. They move to Wales when she get ill as they are told she has a greater chance of living there but she dies, leaving behind her husband and son. Corvus's father tries to homeschool him using his wife school books as he doesn't like British Magical culture (or any culture as he's a loner) and he doesn't know French to teach Corvus enough to get into Beauxbatons.

*********** My Marius is kicked out per usual. He is taken in by a well-off muggle family. They send him to Eton where he discovers his love of cooking. He graduates Eton and starts working his way up. He meets a muggle woman. They have a whirlwind romance and get married in 1949. She falls pregnant quite soon after their marriage. Their son much to Marius' relief doesn't show signs of magic.

The son meets a French woman in the mid-1970s like his parents before him they have a whirlwind romance and a quick pregnancy after marriage.

** Son of Marius - Rainer Douglas Black (b. 12/1/51)

Daughter- in -law of Marius - Clementine Black nee Debarge (b. 4/2/52)

Grandson of Marius - Oceanus Fabian Black (b. 12/18/76)

Granddaughter of Marius - Maia Elizabeth Black (b. 8/4/80)

I need a normal middle name for Oceanus that he'll go by instead of Oceanus.

** Okay so Blacks seem to like Astronomy based names. Keeping with that theme:

Simon Marius: he independently found the four major moons of Jupiter (days after Galileo. But his names for them are the ones we use: Io, Callisto, Ganymede and Europa.

Marius Hills are Volcanic domes found on the Moon. Names you could use associated with Marius Hills: Oceanus (where they are found), Clementine (A spacecraft that analysed them), Selene (another spacecraft).

Marius is also a crater on the moon: Rainer, Kepler, Bessarion, Milichius, Encke are all craters near Marius.

Part of me wants Marius and Sirius to meet/reconnect somehow. I doubt they would've met when Sirius was younger. It's either that or they can connect with the Andromeda who would be Marius' great-niece if I'm not mistaken.
