Hi all! I'm doing a research project on Fanfiction/FMVs and copyright laws! I could really, really use some more responses, and would be super thankful if some of you could take the time to do the survey! It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, tops!!

** I would personally suggest removing the 'living under a rock' comment as it subtracts from the professionalism of the survey, especially if this is for a research project! Good luck though!

** But is it really copyrighted when the author gives permission for people to write fanfiction? Completed. Good luck :D

** What's with the third question? If the purpose of the project is to educate people about what copyright (as defined by the US government) is, then say so.

*** it is not, it is more about perceived copyright infringement. i am not looking to educate anyone, haha. it's cool if people learn from this! but i want to know what people think about copyright in comparison to the actual law.
