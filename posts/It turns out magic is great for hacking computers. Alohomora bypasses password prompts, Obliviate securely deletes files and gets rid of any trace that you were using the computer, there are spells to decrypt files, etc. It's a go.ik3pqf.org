#+TITLE: It turns out magic is great for hacking computers. Alohomora bypasses password prompts, Obliviate securely deletes files and gets rid of any trace that you were using the computer, there are spells to decrypt files, etc. It's a good thing, because someone just uploaded evidence of magic on Youtube.

** As an aside: What would be evidence of magic that would hold up on youtube and wouldn't be dismissed as a hoax by any sane person? I can't really think of anything that, if put on youtube, would convince me that magic was real.

*** It would have to be something intriguing to scientists or people who are really closely analyzig the video, something that would be expensive to fake.

Maybe it'a a film of a wizard casting wingardium leviosa, and in the video it can be seen that the levitated object is behaving exactly like an object in microgravity, and not like an object that's being suspended on a string. And there isn't any evidence of editing or cgi.

**** And how many can do such an analysis? And why should I believe them, since I cannot do it?

The idea that youtube will reveal magic is not very convincing.

** There's an entire subculture of persistent crackpots who still insist that the moon landing wasn't real. Their principal source of evidence is all of the minute details from the film and photographic evidence that was brought back from the Moon. Conspiracy theorists claim that the details about things like the lighting, the gravity and the movements of the astronauts prove that it's all a hoax. In fact all of these details actually prove the reverse.

No matter how crazy it is, if it's on YouTube, somebody's going to believe it.
