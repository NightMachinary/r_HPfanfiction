Imagine growing up in a family of magic and you were unable to do anything. Keeping the squib children despite not having any magic is a terrible kind of torture. At least in the muggle world, the child will grow up to become something, make a life for themselves, rather than be descriminated by wizards and witches everywhere, with fewer job prospects.

Edit: I amend my statement by saying that squibs should be taken care of by their magical families within the muggle world, rather than being abandoned.


** I seriously object to the whole idea that magic is so all-consuming that children without it should just be cut off to avoid disappointing them.

Sure, it would feel like a serious disability. So are blindness, deafness, and cerebral palsy. But children are born with those things, or develop them early, and their families still love them and care for them, and that's as it should be. Because the love of a family is more important than whether all family members are equally capable and employable.

Sure, it would be hard to grow up seeing magic and not having it. It would be hard to be the parent of such a child, too, and work through both your own disappointment and your child's. But any kind of rejection does nothing but make it harder.

** Still, being abandoned by your family at age 11 isn't good either. It would be better to stay part of the magical family, but have them help by sending the kid to a muggle school, etc. Maybe they could have an arrangement with the parents of a muggleborn to help out each other's kids, shop for school supplies and stuff. They don't need to cut all ties to their own families though.

** I think I'd rather grow up with my family. Not only are muggle orphanages generally very bad, but I don't think I'd mind knowing about magic and not doing it that much. Like it'd suck for sure but I'd get over it pretty fast. I'd prefer knowing to not knowing.

** Yes. It's not even the discrimination. Knowing for a fact that magic exists and all the wonders it offers, and not being able to do any of it myself, would suck massively.

Of course it takes a while for families to find out that their child is a squib. They probably know for sure only when the child is 11. I'd imagine that being discarded by their parents would suck massively too.

** I disagree, since there's more to the wizarding world than just being able to perform magic. If Squibs are forced to live as Muggles, they don't get to use magical objects, benefit from healing potions, follow Quidditch, and participate the culture they were raised in.

Furthermore, if we accept the fanon theory that Muggle-Borns descend from Squibs, by expelling Squibs you're increasing the odds that a magical child will be born to non-magical parents, which we know is problematic (e.g., the Evans sisters, persecution of Muggle-Borns, etc.).

I'm sure there are plenty of jobs within wizarding society that a Squib could perform (e.g. barrister, psychologist, primary school teacher, etc.). Or they could help bridge the divide between the Muggle and magical worlds, to the extent secrecy allows.

And yes, it would be cruel to essentially kick someone out of their family for having a disability, but other commenters have made that point already.

** We know potions work on muggles from cannon, so imagine they abandoned their child in an orphanage and later found he/she died to a disease easily cured by a potion ... Decent people don't abandon their children if they have any disabilities, even a sheltered pureblood without exposure to muggle world if they are decent can try to make sure their squib children are accommodated(house elves, enchanted objects, hire caretakers) as much as possible in magical world and provide options for them to live off comfortably in muggle world if they want later in life .. it's parents responsibility to care for their children to adulthood and provide as many options as possible.

I think the abandonment of children is wrong, taking care of them in muggle world is not.
