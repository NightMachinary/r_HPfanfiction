Thought it sounded like an interesting prompt that I'm not sure I've read. I could definitely see that after slowly gathering her life force for roughly 10 months all of Tom might not have been destroyed. Perhaps he needs time to recover once the diary is destroyed but eventually he begins to change her. Looking for links or just general discussion.
