As it says in the title I'm looking for self insert fics that don't focus on the school years. I don't really like slash but I'm fine with romance as long as it's not the main focus of the story.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

Has the SI tell all to Dumbledore and then focus on their own life instead of canon.

  Dropped alone in a world of magic that seems strangely familiar, I must take up arms to save the day-or I could just tell Dumbledore and let him deal with it? Yeah, I prefer that idea. A Harry Potter Self-Insert fic.
