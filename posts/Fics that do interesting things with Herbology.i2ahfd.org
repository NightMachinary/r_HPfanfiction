Like it says on the title, I'm looking for fics that do interesting things with Herbology. Anything from cool plant stuff featuring in the plot (a la Devil's Snare) to Neville making Triffids to the ever-delightfully-disturbing Mandragora (Link below).

LINK - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7864670/1/]]

linkffn(7864670)

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking. Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** I'm sorry I don't have a contribution. I just wanted to say that I feel Herbology is an underestimated subject, and I wish there was more focus on it. Some fanfic writers even forget that it's a core subject and that it's necessary to have NEWT level Herbology to become an auror (unless you're a war hero, that is)

*** Sames! It has such potential for shenanigans, if nothing else. I can totally imagine Neville fucking shit up with magical plants - the Battle of Hogwarts would be considerably easier if you could turn the Forbidden Forest into Ents, right? :)

  Consider the curiously humanoid mandrake root, or mandragora. It is hideously ugly, deadly dangerous, and a powerful restorative. Why would anything else matter? * * A tale of horror. Please review. * *

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden by rumblestiltsken). It's a one-shot, with a wonderful ending.

I'm aware of a couple of Batman crosses that involve Poison Ivy, but I don't know if that can really be considered herbology.

*** I am not a superhero person, so I don't know what you're getting at. From the name, I'm assuming Poison Ivy has some kind of power over plants?

And oh. Oh that ending. That got a full "Oh, you" chuckle from me. That hasn't happened in a while. Thank you for that rec. :D

**** Yeah, she's one of the Batman villains, and has powers over plants.

Just for reference, in linkffn(A Wizard in Gotham by jon.mcclusk), Harry is abandoned in Gotham City, and gets adopted by Ivy. In linkffn(Deadly Nightshade by savya398), Ivy is Lily's eldest sister, and Harry is her son by Bruce Wayne (Batman's secret identity). And, in linkffn(Kicking Gotham by Steelbadger), Harry goes looking for Neville, who had been searching for magical plants in muggle areas.
