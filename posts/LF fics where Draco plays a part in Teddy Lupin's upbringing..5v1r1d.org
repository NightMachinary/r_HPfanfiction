I've always had this thought that when everything was said and done, did Draco try to form a relationship with his Aunt Andromeda and more so his second cousin Teddy? He never got to know Dora but now there is this baby she left behind where he can help raise one way or another.

Looking for a fanfic of that type. Long or short. Open to all pairings (gay/bi/straight) although I figure a popular one would be Draco X Harry since Harry would be helping to raise Teddy the most. Open to any ratings.


** linkao3(4230765) is a longish one-shot that fits your criteria. Draco reaches out to Andromeda and is involved in Teddy's upbringing

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/574801][It Was We Who Were Cliche]] is like this and great. Draco being part of Teddy's life is the catalyst for the Drarry.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751586/16/Lonely-Moon][Lonely Moon]] is a Harry and Draco are both single dads fic (Harry of Teddy and Draco of Scorpius). Not exactly what you're looking for but a similar vibe.

And iirc Draco and Teddys relationship is a plot point in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335][Twist of Fate]] but not at all the main thrust of the fic. Linkao3(473335; 574801) linkffn(4751586)

  Draco asks Harry to help him beat the Imperius curse during 4th year. The lessons turn into more than either expected. A story of redemption and forgiveness. Pairings: HP/DM (Slash) Timeframe: 1994-2002 Goblet to 4 yrs post-DH EWE Rating T for language, high angst, content.

  When the reconciled Black sisters go on holiday together, Andromeda entrusts Draco, rather than Harry, with five year old Teddy Lupin for three weeks. Harry is convinced she made the wrong choice, and he decides the way to fix this is simply to keep turning up at the manor and refusing to leave Draco alone.
