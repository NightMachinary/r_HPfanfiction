As the title said. Any ship, if there is one, except Dramione, incest, or huge age difference. The last point would depend on which age draco would identify with shall the story be time travel.

I don't mind crossovers, like someone reincarnating as Draco or Draco reincarnating as someone else.

Thank you in advance!

  Draco Malfoy is an accomplished potions master when he finds himself back in time a week before the start of Hogwarts.With no choice but to re-live his entire life he attempts to navigate Hogwarts without destroying the future he knows.However, considering Draco long ago stopped being prejudice and hateful this will be harder than he thought.-First Year Complete, see next work for Second Year.

  Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. First step: befriend Potter.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23872387/chapters/57383854][Draco Malfoy and the Mirror of Eurydice]] is the first in a rather long series! It has Drarry after a few fanfics in (series stays Gen till fourth year) but I highly recommend reading all of them
