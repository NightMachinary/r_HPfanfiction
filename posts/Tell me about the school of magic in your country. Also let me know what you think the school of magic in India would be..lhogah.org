** In the VP universe I go with 13 major schools of magic, rather than 11, as I feel like 13 is the minimum to cover the regions I wanted to cover (as well as include the canonical ones).

The Indian school is called Suvaloka and is located on Mount Meru (Indian Himalayas).

The Chinese school is called Xifang Xuexiao ("School of the West") and is located on Jade Mountain (Chinese/Tibetan Himalayas).

I like the idea that the Indian and Chinese schools have an intense rivalry, a result not only of their close geographical proximity, but also because they have overlapping and contradictory founding myths (Jade Mountain, the residence of the Queen Mother of the West, is supposed to be part of the mythical Kunlun Mountains, the Chinese version of Mount Meru).

It also tickles me that so much of the world is completely empty of any magical school whatsoever, and yet here you have two major schools really close together.

** Now, let's see here... The name of the school would be Freyja's Hall: The Icelandic School of Seiđr. (Seiđr is Old Norse for magic). It is very much a natural energy research centre, seeing how much there is, up here. Fire, Ice, Wind, Water... we have an abundance of it all.

Here's an interesting tidbit; we Icelanders understand Old Norse, while the Norwegians do not. Modern Icelandic is basically Old Norse, and has not changed all that much in the 1000 years we've been up here.

But I digress.

Freyja's Hall is carefully hidden beneath one of the glaciers within the Highlands of Iceland. Hofsjökull, to be exact.

The basic curriculum would be similar to Hogwarts. However, there would be great emphasis placed on the Fúþark, the Norse runic system, and how to use Runes in the various settings.

And since Iceland is extremely active in the volcanic and geothermal sense, much work is put into researching how to harness the energies to fuel the various runic clusters.

There is also a class dedicated to the summoning of elementals. Air, Fire, Ice, Water and Earth elementals are the most common and strongest in Iceland.

And since the vikings used the stars to navigate, there is also a class that focuses heavily on the night sky. Astronomy, how to navigate via the stars, and the researching of the Aurora Borealis and whether or not it is feasible to try and harness those energies for runecraft.

Oh, and the students do not use wands, but staffs, carved with runes.

*** It's sad but unfortunately the caste system must be taken into account. In my opinion I don't think they'd have stratas within themselves.

In india the caste system often had upper castes adopting attractive lower castes or marrying them and thereby making them upper castes. As sick as the practice is, I believe, the magicals in themselves would have been a caste in themselves or made into a tribe.

I'm unsure as to whether they would have been conquered or not. I'm really fifty fifty there.

On one side, they might have gotten sick and tired of being persecuted or used or answering to others abd gone into seclusion. On the other side there is the possibility they tried to lift their status and acted as aides to the kings and utilising their powers, thereby increasing their standing.

There's evidence for both as in Ancient India, magic was part and parcel with normal life. Saints and Yogis had mystical powers, and magic was revered, so it would be interesting to see how that would have changed with time.

However as we get closer to medieval india, such mentions are nearly gone, and magic and mystics are nearly completely forgotten. Perhaps there was a fracture between magic and religion - with magic amongst the religious eventually dying out.

Religious undertones would be massive. And a lot of distrust amongst different wizards from different regions owing to religion and language. But the powerhouse would definitely be there.

***** With muggleborns they'd either be raised up, or the magicals would probably try to find them and save them - i.e. kidnap them and integrate them, or they'd end up as God men.

It's highly likely and plausible as great personalities in Indian Mythology were considered demigods or reincarnations of gods. Most likely these people were muggleborns that the magicals missed out on.

Might also lead to the destruction of the blood purity in india xD

One important thing about the caste system. While it's rigid in theory, there are numerous instances in India, where the lowest tiers in the systems ended up as the ruling class for generations. Two examples would be the Nanda Dynasty and the Mauryan Dynasty which overthrew them. So practices didn't always reflect the theory.

** I'm currently writing a fic that is set in India, dealing with Tamil mythology.

As for what schools would be like, I feel like there wouldn't be just *one*. India is so diverse, and so ancient. There have been tons of peoples and cultures and traditions over thousands of years; I feel like there'd probably be at least 2 of 3 schools, focusing on different things (like 1 in the Western style, the other 2 in more regional styles).

Completely agree with you that fanfiction could do some really interesting worldbuilding in some more neglected parts of the world. One of my other fics, for example, dealt heavily with Sumerian mythology, and has quite a bit of international travel.

*** I agree. A country like India can't have only one school.

If you go by race or language, India has multiple scripts and races.

Then we have the number of kingdoms that have come and gone. Southern India was never fully conquered by the Mughals. Marathas, while they did have a certain amount of influence, didn't really conquer the south either. Then you've got the invaders from the west of the Indus, and the Indus valley civilization in itself.

There's simply way too much to reduce it to one school. Also even if they did, the population alone would be huge.

I honestly don't know how many schools would be there and how to segregate.

** The idea of every Irish magician giving up and going to school in bloody britain sits wrong with me.

The Irish school for magic is an island off the western shores only accessible at the spring equinox, summer solstice, autumn equinox and winter solstice, and only by entering through one of the countless fae circles that litter the landscape. The island is Tír na nÓg, the land of youth, but that's a misleading name given by muggles who failed to realise that wizards just live longer - the school itself is Caisleán na Fíanna.

Ireland is the originator of every modern witchcraft holiday you've heard of - I've just finished making my Beltane/Bealtaine crosses and I have a turf fire going the entirety of Samhain night - so there's a lot more cultural classes offered, especially considering that the Irish magicians are holding tooth and claw onto the traditions stomped out in mundane Ireland. Runestones made of Ogham, curses woven out of ladders of twine, magic that isn't instant but is powerful, as well as history and poetry and debate.

Classes are usually taught in Irish with the technical terms in English, with an additional class for all first years to ensure they're up to standard. 94% of students leaving the Caisleán are able to speak in both languages fluently, with the minority being natural Irish speakers who have no need or intention to learn the colonisers language.

Theres a lot more focus on being properly Irish rather than properly pureblooded; the closer related you are to a Brit the more you're looked down upon for not knowing “real” magic.

Due to the focus on traditional magic, there are no wands for the first three years of schooling. Students focus on calling the power of the earth beneath them and the sky above them, elemental magic, as well as astronomy, potions, a blended class of herbology and care of magical creatures known as survival studies, and other non-wanded disciplines. A class on surviving the muggle world is mandatory for the first three years, and completing it means you have a Junior Certificate muggle qualification that can be leveraged into attending a muggle school if you so choose.

After three years students can either spend the summer in the castle or take a gap year on the island where they build their own magical focuses - usually staffs, though occasionally wands or even the odd ring. The last three years of schooling have transfiguration, magical defence, and charms, as well as more advanced versions of the core classes and an optional course that gives you muggle qualifications in biology, physics, ordinary maths, history and Irish.

All students on the island of Ireland get letters both to Hogwarts and the Caisleán, but very few prefer the former to the latter - mostly Northern Irish Protestants and people worried about the language aspect. For some reason, “your child will have good qualifications, speak two languages, and not be given a magic gun until they turn fifteen” is much more appealing than “we promise the school is safe; it's only had wizard hitler invade it five times in the last seven years.” Theres always a small percentage of students from Scotland, Wales, and Brittany, but it's more common for them to come in fourth year when everyone has wands and the ability to cast translation charms.

** Great Lakes region of North America: we have a mix of Native American (mostly Aanishanabe and Haudenosaunee) along with a fair number of wizards with predominately French, British and Irish ancestry, plus a random mix of other European ancestries.

I'm in two minds about what the school itself would look like, and am leaning towards having Ilvermorny as a sort of Oxbridge style school: a bunch of collected campuses that each teach a similar curriculum but at the same time have their own local cultural thing going on as well. So, much like if you were to attend Cambridge or Oxford, you would probably not step foot on the main campus until you're almost done: NEWT equivilents at Ilvermonry? Sure. OWL levels? Absolutely not. This would also help out with the /absolute shitshow/ that sorting /every single kid in North America/ would involve. Seriously: check out the population difference between Britain versus the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and all the countries in Central America.... now stick all the older students on a balcony and make them watch. For hours. Yeah, I'll pass. Thanks.

If this particular corner of the Great Lakes had a magical campus, odds are it would either be French or Aanishanabe leaning.

Edit, for those who don't want to look it up:

Aanishanabe - A culturally related language family that includes Chippewa, Ojibwe, Algonquin, Odawa...

Haudenosaunee - The Six Nations of Iroquois: Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca and Tuscarora

** I'm from the United States and I think Ilvermorny/Salem Witch institute does a good job, but I'd like to think that Britain/Ireland has 3 wizarding schools: Hogwarts, a Welsh school, and an Irish school. The Welsh school is in similar size to Hogwarts and has houses named after characters in the King Arthur stories, while the Irish one is smaller and has no houses.

I also like to think that there is an Italian school named after the Medici family. It's not as big as, say, Beauxbatons, but it's fairly decent-sized, although it doesn't have any houses either. Oh, and then there's a Scandinavian school, which is located in Iceland for some reason or another (I view Durmstrang as serving Finland/Baltic states/Eastern Europe save for Russia, which is serviced by Koldovstoretz).

As for Ireland, I view the Irish school as being the place all Irish students go and an alternative to Hogwarts for Northern Irish students. This explains why Seamus goes to Hogwarts instead, because in my headcanons, he is from Northern Ireland instead of Southern Ireland.

Oh, and Koldovstoretz probably started out as a small school originally, but as the wizarding population of modern-day Russia grew because of birth rates/expansion, it also got bigger. That's why it is as big as Durmstrang and also why they service similar areas, because maybe Koldovstoretz was for Russian wizards specifically (as in, founded in pre-USSR times).

*** I don't think that expecting there to be just those two in America is justified.

I think there'd be at least one more, located in the southeast, probably in Charleston, South Carolina. Maybe even another in New Orleans.

Southerners, especially after the Civil War, wouldn't want to send their children to schools where those damned Yankees could corrupt them. They'd have a school that was originally restricted to whites during the antebellum period/reconstruction/pre-civil rights era that focused on the kind of magic Hogwarts/Ilvermorny/Salem did, with the addition of courses on proper etiquette and conduct of gentlemen and ladies. It'd be integrated now, but still highly traditional.

There's also the cultural traditions around Charleston, with the Geechee-Gullah people, a combination of African traditions and folklore. There'd be at least one school for those magics in South Carolina. I imagine there'd be minor historically black wizarding schools dotted throughout the south, with another in New Orleans, traditionally recognized as the center of American voodoo and hoodoo.

The magic would also be really diverse, and probably would have the main magic branches that are featured in classic HP be more divided, with several deviations, and many individualities depending on which tribe that my country was formed out of, became more dominant. They would also have quite a wide variety of foreign magic due to middle ages (1410~) and ensuing conquest done by my country in that time. It would be heavily influenced by Nordic magic systems due to availability to the Baltic sea. Several small encloves of highly enclosed communities that have their own brand of magic would inevitable crop up. Much of it be lost in the war with Grindevald, and the WW2.
