So i just read throught the mind arts and i found it amazing. Now what are the best of the best fics that feature Occumency/legilimency as an important tool to harry?


** It's fairly popular, so I imagine you've already read it, but Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin fits the bill pretty well. It starts off, in the author's own words, as a "bog-standard Slytherin Harry/WBWL story," with the goal of eventually subverting those tropes to make something really special. After 100 chapters we're only in year 3 but I'd say the author has already succeeded at their goal. To be quite honest, I even enjoyed the beginning bits. Well-written stuff is increasingly hard to come by, even if it is well written cliches. No spoilers, but it has one of the best takes on GIlderoy Lockhart ever.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Okay lets see:

- A Cadmean Victory linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) has some dealing with the mind arts, but its not really the focus.
- What You Leave Behind linkffn(What You Leave Behind by newcomb) has a good depiction of them, but again not the focus of the fic (still a great fic though).
- Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) has Harry learning it in a basically exact manner as in canon (not shielding, but becoming emotionally void and listless).
- Taking Control linkffn(Taking Control) is an old school Indy!Harry fic, and was probably one of the forerunners for the trope, but mind magic features pretty extensively here.
- Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches linkffn(11574569) features heavy mind magic, but its mostly an excuse to have adult behavior by the group of eleven year olds. World building is more of a draw here.

Most fics with mind magic have it as a subset of a talented/trained/powerful Harry. Its usually a side-show to other ideas.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
