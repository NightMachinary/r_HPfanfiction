Because of reasons, Harry can leave the Dursley, and get adopted by someone else. And he does have know a caring parent that take interest in him, his life, his schooling. Basically a real good parent.

All is great and well, but Harry actually don't really know how to deal with that. He doesn't know what is normal parenting, what he should accept, and what he can fight against. How he should really react. What he can expect of his new parents, and what is expected of him.

Like he doesn't get why this new parent is all upset about his not-so-great grade in Magic History, or absolutely wants to know where he wanders to.

So, Ron and Hermione write him a guide full of advices to help him out.

Other characters helps out and share their little tidbits, according to their personality and experiences.

What would we found in this guide?

*** A bit different, sure but great different.

I'll admit, I didn't expect this new guardian, but it's a great choice for this prompt and what I was thinking.

You really wrote a confused Harry very well. The mention of his abuse are chilling for how normalised it is for Harry. It's quite accurate for a child raised like that.

I also adore your Hermione. She is still as smart as ever, but still sounds like a pre-teen.

Also liked the bit of world building thrown here and there.

Thanks!

*** That wasn't what the OP meant but: What do you have against double names? I mean: Hermione is the only child of her parents. If she takes Rons name her own would disappear. I get why someone wouldn't want that.And even if they only take one name: Why not Ron Granger? I have a very good friend who took the name of his wife. It happens.

**** Because Harry Potter fanfiction has the awful trope of Haroldus Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Hufflepuff-Gaunt-...-Evans.

And because in Britain double-barrelled names are generally a sign of pretentious twats.

Really. Never heard that before. Double names are quite common in my country.
