:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi there's this Tom riddle/Harry fanfiction I'm looking for. So how it starts out, Harry time travels and ends up losing consciousness, and ends up falling out the sky. Minerva finds him and reports it to dumbledore. Harry ends up adjusting to that time, becoming familiar with Tom riddle and his group, he fights grindelwald and wins. I can't find this fanfic and I know it's on fanfiction.net it won't pop up in my read history for anything.


** There are countless fics with that exact premise. Do you remember any other details?

*** Well really those were pretty unique characteristics, But it's where Harry is the master of death, he goes back in time accidentally falling out of the sky onto the ground, in front of a young mcgonagall. Who then alerts the teachers, and then dumbledore questions him, I found it it's called Lord of time, you should check it out if you aren't bothered by slash
