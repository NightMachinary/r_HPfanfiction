Do anyone know a fanfic we're Harry is sorted in to Slytherin and befriends a lot of dark families children like Draco and Theodore Nott. Hermione is not his best friend, not that he has to be rude to her, and he could become “the king of Slytherin.” But that's not a deal breaker.

Tanks in advance.
