Are there any good stories about Harry and an older woman? Something like linkffn(11752324) where they explore backstories and don't just jump into bed. I find it difficult to find something that is as good as LdS but I'm hoping against hope. No recommending ‘grow young with me' which I've tried to read and just couldn't. Read all Harry/Tonks stories. Over 60k wording please.

Thank you!


** linkffn(for love of magic)

Harry has a thing for older women in this fic and gets around a lot. The main pairings don't include the older women, but they are repeated side action.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Griselda Marchbanks looked over at Bathilda Bagshot laying next to her on the bed. She was not as young as she used to be and the last 2 hours had been exhausting, pleasurable but exhausting. She waited a few moments until Bathilda's breathing returned to normal. Then said "Harry Potter is supposed to start Hogwarts this year."

"Hmm," was the tired reply.

"I was thinking he could use a mentor or two."

Bathilda turned to face her friend of many years and even with her poor eyesight could see the gleam in her eyes. She thought back to the last young boy they had mentored. It sadden her heart to remember he had died so young, but that was tempered by how many deatheaters he took down when he died. He had been a powerful wizard with very good stamina who always looked out for the needs of others first. "Yes, I think that we should take a trip to Hogwarts once the term starts," she replied as she rolled toward Griselda with a new burst of energy.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** I suspect [[/u/TE7]] would remind readers that this isn't a pairing in the classic sense (it just seems as such with regards to intimacy and mutual understanding).

***** I mean part of me doesnt want the pairing to happen as the story could suffer for it. The characterization of Emily is incredibly well done, giving her depth.

But then I realize firstly I've never read a good Harry/femVoldemort. And secondly that Emily needs something to pull her out of her ways. And I think Harry could be that spark that makes her more like Emily Price was and less like Emily Riddle.

All in all your story is incredibly and I hope you continue.

Also if there are any good Harry/femVoldemort send me some recs.

** You gotta say how much older because Hermione is almost a year older than Harry and meets your criteria.

In fact, since Harry is almost the youngest in his year (July 31st, cut off date for his year is Aug 31), most other girls in his year also qualify.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11379466/1/][Always]], linkffn(11379466), is a cute short fic in which Harry was KIA in his 40s and reincarnated as someone much younger later. He got together with Ginny again, now at least 25 years older than him.
