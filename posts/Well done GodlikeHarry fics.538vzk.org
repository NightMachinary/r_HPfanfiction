  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I'd say linkffn(4068153) fits this, though voldemort is also much more powerful. I remember talk of boiling oceans. The main mechanic here is that Harry returns to his previous self on a certain time if he dies. What I love about this fic is that harry didn't just get godlike through luck, inheritance or other convenient asspull. He got there through hard work, living and dying over and over again until he became strong enough. This is pretty the Dark Souls of HP fanfiction.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
