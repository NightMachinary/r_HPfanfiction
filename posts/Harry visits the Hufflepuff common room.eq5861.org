Harry walked the corridors after his detention heading back to the Gryffindor common room. He turned a corner and spotted Cedric sat with friends in jovial spirits. Cedric and Harry gave one another a faint smile and an amiable nod of acknowledgement. He quickened his pace to escape the staring eyes.

“Harry!” Cedric said enthusiastically as he caught up with him. “Have you had any thoughts on the golden egg?”

“A couple of ideas” Harry lied.

“Would you like to brainstorm some ideas on what it means?” Cedric said.

Before Harry could think of an excuse to escape, Cedric interrupted his thoughts with “Come on! The common room is just around the corner”. Harry reluctantly followed glancing the corridor that headed back to Gryffindor.

They reached the common room entrance near the kitchens. Cedric tapped a tune next to the portrait and the painting swung open. Entering the room Harry was met with Hufflepuff eyes all looking at him. He wasn't supposed to be here, the common room knew his presence was foreign. However, a badge started to appear and attached itself to Harry's robe. The badge read: Hufflepuff common room -- VISITOR -- HARRY POTTER.

Cedric ushered him over to a sofa in the corner next to a window. Cedric rushed upstairs to collect his golden egg. Harry took his seat and examined the room. The Hufflepuffs had returned to their conversations and books, and took no further notice of Harry. The common room was large yet cosy. Its golden bricked walls had numerous windows allowing in natural light to fill the room highlighting all the plants of different shapes, sizes and colours. He noticed Rita Skeeter's article on the table next to him. His picture covered the front with no mention of Cedric. He pushed the paper away in annoyance and embarrassment.

A plant's branch edged closer to Harry's side and started nibbling at his ear. As Harry brushed it away Cedric returned with the egg in hand.

“Oh, don't mind that one” -- Cedric exclaimed. “It's only wants to eat your earwax. It offers quite a good cleaning service. It's that one over there that you don't want to go near. You have no idea what that one will do to you”. Cedric pointed towards a lonely menacing looking bush with large spikes on display.

Harry and Cedric sat discussing the egg for some time as the light faded. Cedric offered supporting yeah's, uh huh's and nods of enthusiastic encouragement. However, Harry felt a sense of shame having no real ideas of note to contribute to help with solving the egg's puzzle, all while the plant kept trying different angles of attack on his ears.

They opened the egg, a howling piercing screech filled the room, which made them close the egg very quickly.

“Perhaps it's a language we can't understand. Maybe it needs to opened in such a way we can understand it. Or maybe it needs to opened so it doesn't shout at us” Cedric hypothesised, grasping at straws.

As the common room's light dimmed, Harry made his excuse to leave. He exited the common room. The portrait closed behind him and the badge vanished.

After Harry returned to the comfort and familiarity of the Gryffindor common room, he spotted Ron and Hermione sat by the fireplace with the golden egg resting on the table between the two. He wanted nothing more than to retreat upstairs to bed, or to talk about anything other than the TriWizard tournament, but he knew full well that wasn't going to happen as he approached them. He took his seat as Hermione asked “Have you had anymore ideas” looking towards the egg which made its unwelcome appearance.

Harry settled down for the evening as he recounted his tale of detention and his visit to the Hufflepuff common room.


** Umm i missed the point i guess. Nothing happened? It could have happened anywhere? Just 2 cents. Make it interesting in some way?
