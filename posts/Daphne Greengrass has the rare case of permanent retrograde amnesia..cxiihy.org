Daphne (having gone into hiding shortly before the beginning of the Second Wizarding War with her family) resurfaces as an adult (around 28) with seemingly no memories of her past and Hogwarts education, as a blank slate (hah!).

She stumbles onto Harry while wandering around central London, who is somewhat surprised to see her much to her muted confusion. Harry takes Daphne to a muggle hospital, where she's examined by a Doctor who tells the both of them she appears to have retrograde amnesia due to an unknown cause. The Doctor adds that hopefully it's only a matter of time before Daphne regains any memories of her past, also recommending that she stay with Harry in the interim.

Daphne has to redefine herself as a person in terms of personality and skills (complete with being told she used to be referred to as the Ice Queen of Slytherin cliche due to how distant and aloof she was), as it increasingly becomes clearer and clearer that her memories of the past are in fact not resurfacing despite Harry's attempts to inform her of at least her years in Hogwarts alongside Draco's own help. and that Daphne's retrograde amnesia is unusually permanent.

Daphne after being told of her old self thinks (somewhat correctly much to Harry's objection) she was a massive bitch, as she becomes a more extroverted happier, kinder and approachable person. As Daphne and Harry grow closer, romantic feelings begin to settle in between the two.


** Sounds interesting, but this reads more than a full-blown story than a simple prompt. You should try writing this, could be a fun ride.

***** Idk it's sad, totally, but it's better than ending with her actually dying.

Unless I'm misunderstanding- I'm not going to lie, I only read the epilogues and about half the chapter before it.
