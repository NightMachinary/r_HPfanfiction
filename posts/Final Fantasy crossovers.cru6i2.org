Anyone know any good crossovers with any Final Fantasy game? I'm hoping for a FF14 crossover but any crossovers with other FF titles would be good too

Fics that also just have Final Fantasy style magic (black mage harry maybe?) without being full crossovers would be cool too


** ...dammit. Now I kinda wanna do an HP/FF7 cross...

After getting hit with the Killing Curse in the Forest, Harry wakes to find himself laying in a circle of flowers in an old ruined church, with a beautiful girl standing over him...

Not quite a crossover, but in the same style.

  Without warning, the world changed in ways no Seer could predict. History erased. Maps rewritten. Modern life replaced by monsters, magic, and fantastical quests. Some people are happy with what the world has become, but others will stop at nothing to turn the clock back. Harry as a Final Fantasy--style adventurer, no game knowledge needed.
