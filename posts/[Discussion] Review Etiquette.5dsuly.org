I'm finding myself really curious, so, do you guys have a particular etiquette for when you leave reviews?

For example, do you set yourself targets of you should review each chapter/update, or each fic you read? Do you review long fics but not one-shots, or only review completed stuff?

Do you have a particular format for reviews, and targets you try and hit, or do you just review with something quickly to let the author know you liked it?

Do you offer criticism in particular ways, or...?


** I usually leave constructive criticism with compliments on what I thought was done well. I don't hesitate from leaving comments on what I thought was done badly, but if I think I'm going to come off as obnoxious or rude, then I just don't review.

I feel its important for every reader to remember while giving criticism that the person who wrote the story spent /hours/ worth of time on the story. Sometimes dozens of them. Even if I didn't like a fic, it is important to respect that effort.

** When I write reviews, I generally address the potential reader, rather than the writer. If I want to convey specific comments to the writer, I would write a PM.

** First and foremost, I'm a writer myself and so I always try to think of what sort of review I would personally like to receive when leaving reviews. And I do see reviews for fanfic as being 100% for the author's benefit (as opposed to reviews for actual paid products which are for your fellow consumers).

This generally results in me leaving truly MASSIVE reviews for the fics I really enjoy since I want the author to know absolutely everything that I liked about the fic - characterization, plot, the actual writing itself, you name it. I'll often copy & paste lines as I read so that when it comes time to write a review I can remember what I want to talk about. And I do try to review everything I read, no matter how old or how many reviews it already has, unless I find that I just can't write a review that's generally positive. I don't want to leave anyone a review that boils down to "I didn't like this," after all.

I don't generally review each chapter if a multi-chaptered work is complete (and I almost always read complete works) but I try to review each update and I usually do review more than once for longer fics. It honestly depends on how much I have to say. I've often maxed out the AO3 character limit for comments, so if it's a really long fic that I really like I might do every 3-5 chapters unless the chapters are like 10k monsters or something.

I don't generally offer criticism unless the author really wants it, though I might point out a typo or two. And if I re-read something, then I review it again!

** I don't leave reviews unless I think some constructive criticism would improve the story. When I do review, I usually spend half an hour discussing the major issues I see and sharing how I would address them. I used to be more sarcastic in my reviews but I've reined in my snark (when I talk to strangers anyway) and it's greatly improved my responses- they used to be split between writers effusively thanking me for a long, constructive review and writers telling me that I was the worst flamer they had ever had.

I do try to end on a good note and mention at least one thing that I thought they did well. It helps that I don't review fanfics that are irredeemably bad so there's always something to compliment.

** First of all, I honestly despise reviews of the "great update" kind. What am I supposed to do with this one-liner? It's not a review, it's a comment. For that reason, I strive to never write such reviews myself.

From here, it depends on the story. If it's a short one shot, I may not have much to say. If it's a novel-length epic, chances are I'll compile my thoughts into a wall of text.

I don't keep myself to a particular standard like, mention five good things and five bad things. If I enjoyed the fic, I'll probably focus more on what I enjoyed and be willing to forgive more. If I'm feeling let down, I may be merciless.

In short, I always make sure I have something substantive to say. If I don't, I don't review.

** I generally try to write out a few sentences saying what I liked about the story, sometimes I'll write my reactions to certain things, especially if it's an ongoing story. I only ever leave concrit if I know they would appreciate it. I don't really have guidelines to when I review, I try to because as a writer I know how much reviews mean. I'm not the greatest at always reviewing. I'll try ever couple of chapters with ongoing stories or leave a review after finishing a completed one. Often times its when I'm moved by a story or impressed by it.

** Nope, no format or anything for me. I will say that I never leave a negative review. If I don't like a story, I'll just stop reading it. If there's a particular thing that I feel could be improved upon I may leave some constructive criticism within an otherwise positive review. But mostly I just tell the author that I enjoyed the story or that particular chapter, mention some part that I really liked and why, things like that.

One thing I do is thank the author for writing/posting the story, though I usually only do so at the end of a long completed fic that I really enjoyed.

** I try to leave reviews for pieces that I enjoy that may not already have a lot of reviews... Usually I won't leave a review if a piece already has a couple hundred of reviews. (If I do, I leave it at the very end if it's already completed.)

It really depends on the piece to be honest. I will never write a negative review. If I don't like it, I will just stop reading it and move on. If their characterization bothers me, I'll move on. If they make it ridiculously fluffy or unrealistic without probably building it up for me, I'll move it. It's not my place to publicly say something negative about a piece of writing someone has dedicated hours of their life to.

I try to leave encouragement and let them know that somewhere in the world someone else has read it and enjoyed it. If there are particular phrases or scenes that catch my attention, I'll definitely comment on why I enjoyed it so much or how well they captured the moment. If I know the author very well and we have a good relationship, I may or may not do a lengthier review and sort of break down the chapter bit by bit, but I don't do it frequently. It takes a lot of time, some people might take it the wrong way, or some authors may not even appreciate it.

The only time I have said something slightly negative was when an author blatantly asked the readers at the end of a latest chapter how we felt about something. I liked the story well enough, but I wasn't fond of a small plot development. I didn't say anything bad, I just said that it wasn't my cup of tea personally. Well, as fandom is, I got a crap ton of flack from the author at the end of the next chapter and from other readers. Needless to say, I unsubscribed from the piece and haven't gone back since.

** The few reviews on my pieces so far have been just very quick 'hey I like this' kinds of things.
