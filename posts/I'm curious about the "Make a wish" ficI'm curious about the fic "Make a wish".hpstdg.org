I already read it, but I feel curious about how the "Mr. Black" story was interpreted.

More specifically, how those who did not know it was Harry understood it,I managed to understand something about a former dark lord and someone who participated in WWII.

Someone help, thanks for your attention.


** Excuse the double title pls
