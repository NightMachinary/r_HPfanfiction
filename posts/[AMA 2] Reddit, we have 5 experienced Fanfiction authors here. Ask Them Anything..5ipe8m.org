You have been hailed by many as "the next robst" and certainly when reading your fics one gets the sense that you are the true inheritor of his throne. How do you deal with the pressure of these comments? It can't be easy to follow in the footsteps of such a well-known author with so many reviews, favourites, etc.

Two questions:

a) Are we going to see an update of The Dark in Peace in the forseeable future?

b) Can you tell us a bit about your method of developing characterization? I always get the feeling that your characters are vibrant and dynamic, almost alive, in a sense. Is characterization fully organic and spontaneous for you, or are there techniques you use to develop them? Or something else entirely?

***** Fordeable future? No. I was going to finish DiP after I finished Vitam Paramus but then I was conned into writing something with a female villain. So I came up with LdS. It also means I'll have fics set in 4th, 5th, 6th year which seemed like a nice trifecta. I intend to return to it at some point. That point just never really seems to come.

As for characterization. That's a harder question. I do a ton of planning so I know before I even start writing just what their purpose is and how they get there. So I think that helps.

Other than that I guess I just try to make them like people. Give them vices and motives and make them act how people act. I want the average person to think that it wouldn't be bad to join say Vitam Paramus's Harry and Titus for a beer. It's a matter of showing good traits and bad and creating empathy in my mind

*** No. Emily Riddle was always Emily Riddle. The potion was botched, in a sense, but not in a way that affected her gender. Wormtail's incompetence and her insistence on the masculine pronouns will be touched upon far more in more detail later in the story. As will the most commonly asked question; the shade in the Chamber of Secrets, which was still male. I can't really say otherwise without getting into fairly big spoiler territory so I'm going to avoid that. I can say that the 'when' is crucially important to the reasons.

Two: I actually do use breaks in the documents I type up. They upload right but since I mostly use additional spaces and not god awful ugly lines they don't show properly on ff.net's page. Having never actually read any of my own stuff on ff.net I didn't quite realize how it formatted. Upcoming chapters, since the specific splits will become more important coming up, will have some hideous form of line break.

That or I'm just going to half the lengths and make the story twice as many chapters. Haven't decided yet. But I like the thematic presentation with a Harry perspective and a Voldemort perspective in each chapter.

I like to think that I write with sort of hybrid of the Realist school and the Modernist school. I tend to depict the banal fairly often, and I try to then lead that into subversion of troupes. A whole lot of this probably doesn't seep into Fanfiction. I'd say my fanfiction tends to fall more into the 'Realism' category, especially with Quiddithc World Cup and Vitam Paramus. But Princess is far more of a Modernist work.

*** To be honest, I have no earthly idea what my writing style is. I guess I'm generally dialogue-heavy to action-heavy, but that changes from fic to fix and scene to scene. The fic I've put up as my 'fic to read' is a sort of standard fantasy affair with twists on the genre, but my other fics often rely on unreliable narrators and characters with confusing, almost contradictory goals and beliefs. So, I guess that puts me squarely in the postmodern camp.

*** I honestly don't really think about what my writing style is. I just write. I don't have any focus on what style I want it to be, or who I want to write like. I just try to make the audience feel what my characters are going through. Or understand why they are acting in a certain way. So when I write I spend a lot time focusing on character development. I don't want to tell you someone is sad, I want you to read the paragraph before and know that what just happened had to have crushed my character despite it not being something that would crush anyone else. And I want you to know because you've read enough about my character that she feels real to you and you can have a sense of her.

I know how I want to write, but I can't honestly say where I am at in regards to it. I don't believe I'll ever think I'm exactly where I want to be, but I do know I'm improving. With every chapter I feel like I get better. I'm sorry I feel like I've given you a poor answer. I suppose the simplest is I write and if elements of writing styles such as post modernism etc. creep in they weren't put there intentionally and I don't focus on thinking about the fact that certain writing elements slip in. I just write to further my story and bring understanding to my characters.

*** Man, if anything makes me feel bad for not updating quickly that does haha. I'm really overjoyed that you do that though.

Writing Neville wasn't too hard. I don't feel like his character was really explored too much in the books so it made it easier for me to just kind of write him as I thought to. I took cues from what we know of him already and just expanded his character from that. An example of this is what we know of his parents and how Neville doesn't like to talk about what happened to them. It was an interesting thing to think about. There is no way that can't impact someone profoundly. ( I also know there is no way it can't impact someone because my grandmother was a paranoid schizophrenic and my mother had to face that as a child.)

As you see in the story line he has a lot of mixed emotions regarding his parents. He loves them, but he doesn't know if he loves them or the idea of them. They've never been able to really be his parents. He sometimes feels he loves them out of only obligation or he just loves the idea of who they are and who they used to be. That to me would be such a difficult thing to live with and Neville's so kind in nature it's no wonder to me that he hates himself for being even thinking such things. He hopes that he just loves them, but at times he's unsure. His grandmother had the memories of who his parents were before the war, and Neville doesn't have that. I really wanted to use his home life as the base of his personality. His shyness, self doubt, insecurities but also his kindness and the way he's so gentle and inviting. I feel his grandmother and parents impacted a lot of him and I always wished it was explored more in the books, so I decided that when I wrote this I wanted to explore that specifically. And as you can see in the fic Graces pushes him past some of his demons that hold him back.

I guess my experience has been really great. I don't have as many ties to keep him perfectly in with the books because there wasn't as much about him in the books as let's say Harry. It gives me a lot more freedom. And I really love writing character development. I have a whole notebook of small personality traits for all my OC and where/ how they got such personality traits.

***** I knew at the time Hannah was paired with Neville. I had them go on a date as a little nod of acknowledgement. I didn't feel Hannah and Neville was a good match though for many reasons. I think Neville could have a happy and comfortable life with Hannah, but I wanted something else for him in this. I wanted him to grow and for him to help someone else grow. A couple that makes the other one better that pushes the other outside their comfort zones and makes them improve.

I can imagine Neville as a placid partner with Hannah. He can't be that Graces. Graces is one too wrong a lot of the time as we can see with her ideas about the world and muggle borns and two way too demanding. I mean there is a point where enough is enough and because Graces is all about her way it forces Neville to have a firmer voice in demanding his way as well. Both Neville and Graces have some flaws in their personality and both of them could learn from one another. Neville's life with Graces would be harder, but it would also be better. And the same stands for Graces. If they get a happily ever after ( which I won't say yet if they will there are still many factors that could ruin that for them ) they would be very madly in love and have a very good life that neither could have ever expected. Great question by the way! I loved it.

We saw this when she was called a mud blood and he defended her ;and also when Snape called her a know it all and Ron stood up for her. Ron isn't perfect. That's for sure, but he has many amazing qualities. Amazing qualities that are ignored in the movie. I also want to put out there that when the spiders attached in the second book he made sure the dog got in the car before he himself did. Also, when Hermione was being tortured in DH Ron was losing it. He was in sheer agony over Hermione's pain. Book Ron is so amazing, and I feel like the moves have taken a lot away from that. The movies gave Hermione a lot of Ron's lines. So yeah haha I ship it. I think Hermione could use a funny guy and also Ron in the books had no issue saying how brilliant Hermione was and I think she needs a guy that isn't intimidated by her brains. I think through the books he grew a lot.

I am curious as to why you dislike the pairing though. Maybe I'm missing something.

Like when he was mad at her cause he thought her cat ate his rat and he was being a jerk to her. The argument stopped when she was crying because she didn't think she could find enough information to save buck beak and Ron was the one to mend the friendship she was crying about not knowing how to help Hagrid save buck beak and he was the one that said "You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help." Ron tended to do those things a lot more in the books. When Hermione was hurt or insulted he jumped up to attend to her before anyone else. Yeah he was an idiot in how long it took him to realize she was a girl, but when he did he noticed things about her before anyone else did. When her teeth were changed, what her schedule was, anytime she was out of site he seemed to look for her. I also liked how in the fifth book there was a brief mention of how Hermione asked Ron something and it reminded Harry or Molly appealing to Arthur. I get the arguing thing I just liked watching them grow and I always felt Ron was much more attentive to her than Harry was.

He's protective certainly but not really possessive. He's leaning on her more. He's scared. Scared for her and their family, but also terrified for himself. He doesn't desire her in that way, but he does cherish her as a link to his own soul. He's taken the mark and feels branded and soiled. Like his own soul is damned. Graces, in his eyes, is a part of him. And because he kept her from taking the mark he feels like the last bits of his salvation are alive in her. He may have to do evils, but her soul is clean and he did that. She represents to him a happier time of his life and he feels like if he can keep her in such a safe and happy state that a part of him lives through that as well.

Other authors who influenced me range from Mary Shelley, to Dostoevsky, to Ian Flemming, to Hunter S. Thompson. Too diverse to emulate all of them, and if I did one of them, I feel like I'd be doing a really poor job of it.

*** I understand no problem. I don't think you could have worded that better.

I can't see Draco dating in this fic. You will find out more reasons why in the second fic, but for now his main reason is his obligation to his family and trying to ensure they survive. Later he has much more obligations and stress. Draco, unfortunately, carried the weight of the world on his shoulders. He's scared and unsure of himself. He doesn't have time to really seek out a relationship. I will say though that if he survives the war and if Graces does too she would want him to find someone. I don't think she would take on any jealousies she would be very happy to see her brother married well and having the comfort of someone else by his side. Especially with all that they are going to go through in the second fic. She's going to want her brother to be happy.

I made up Graces in May of 2012. I specifically remember making her up in the last month of College. And I just started writing things about her, and slowly coming up with the idea for the fic. Then I sat down and made my outline for the fic and wrote out each chapter number and what would happen in that chapter. Then I wrote the first I think 27 or 30 chapters? I can't remember off the top of my head. And started looking for a beta and then started posting chapters in October of 2013. It's been a very long process, but I love it.

*** This might be one of those question where you don't get a real consensus on the answer, because everyone is wildly different. Case in point, the way I attempt to keep from burning out on a fic is to /not/ plan ahead too much. Writing is as much an adventure for me as it's supposed to be for the readers: the second I know everything that's going to happen in a story is the second I lose interest in putting it to paper. Of course, I'm not advocating a complete lack of planning, but allow yourself some wiggle-room, writing something on-rails can get real stale, real fast.

*** Having an easy word goal. I set my low limit on 500 words a day. Its doable even if I'm tired or not entirely motivated. But motivation is a fickle ally, discipline is much more reliable. And every time Scrivener tells me I got my goal done, I'm stopping (or continuing) with a good feeling of accomplishment.

But that mostly counts for my original novel. With my fanfictions, the way I don't burn out my desire to write is writing whatever I feel like, which fills my hard drive up with /a lot/ of "Chapter1-s". It makes for impossible upload schedules (sorry, btw), but if I wouldn't do it like that I wouldn't write fanfiction at all.

*** It will involve the trio more. I don't think I could avoid that haha I'm excited for that to come a long. It's going to happen in the second and third book. It took over a year to get the plot line for the first and the second and third are already pretty much planned out. Just need to add more details here and there. My beta actually asked to see the timeline the other month, before he chose to be more in the dark haha I think he was glad he had a beer in hand when he saw it. There's still just so much to write! I feel I'm more motivated in writing now than before. Love is the real motivation I love writing this fic. I've found I just love writing. I never wrote anything before I started this. It's been a real eye opener for me.

My biggest inspiration is JK Rowling and Sarah Maas. I just think their both amazing authors and amazing women. I really hope one day to write my own books, and I feel like writing fan fic helps me improve my writing.

[[/u/denarii]] was not the headmaster at the time. He wasn't a mod either. That all came later. I posted my fic, I had just put up the first 6 chapters and he offered to beta for me. And I'm so glad he did, he's awesome. We've grown pretty close over the years. He even flew across the country to attend my wedding. I'm horrible with grammar, with out him my fic would be a serious mess. He also lets me bounce ideas off him. He's stopped me from making some big mistakes as well. I think what I like the most about him as my beta is he doesn't push me to change things he's very good about not taking my reigns as a writer, but every once in a while he warns me about a cliff up a head and gets me to slow down and think something through. Or notice a jagged rock and pause to fix my mistake. My friend Aleah also is a huge help. She doesn't like Harry Potter, but she's super supportive of my writing and we often talk about my characters and when I get stuck on a chapter that I decided to add in or a plot I want to explore more she will sit on the phone with me while I think it through and give me loads of questions to think about so that there are no plot holes. Or when I can't seem to like the chapter I had originally outlined I usually will write that chapter in two or three versions and she will read all and help me piece together the best of those versions. Mdman1 is still a new beta for me, but he's been really helpful as well.

Main events will stay the same in the plot line, but there will be some big changes from canon. Certain people will live that had died etc. haha I don't know if I will change other pairings though. Still deciding on that one actually.

I don't get to write everyday, I'm pretty busy a lot of the time and if my husband isn't busy then I obviously want to spend my time with him so we go out or meet up with friends. But I make sure I'm having quality writing time at least once a week. So once a week I make sure I have time to sit down for at least three hours to write with no distractions.

I realise that sounds pretty bad, but it's just as likely that I'll not be able to sleep that night, get up, and write 3000 words at 3 AM.

Hmmm of the top of my head I can't remember them. I know he's stopped some big ones, but I can't for the life of me remember what they were. He ripped them away too fast. I know in my authors notes I mentioned it when it happened I just don't remember what it was. Oh now I remember one! I was going to have them go to an amusement park in February! Which he pointed out would not be possible it was way too cold. I'm so glad he told me though because I feel like them going to the house for Valentine's Day was more meaningful.

He's very good at making sure I keep them in character too like reminding me when Graces wouldn't know a phrase because she's a pure blood and wouldn't know a muggle phrase. I also a month ago brought up an idea for a character death, that I wasn't originally planning. And he told me to wait a week before making the decision. It was a very rainy week. ( I have decided to kill off the character though)

I have a lot of deleted scenes hahaha. Sometimes I write chapters in different ways then choose the parts I like and morph them together. And sometimes I don't finish scenes because it's not needed and this fic is already so long. If I start a scene and then realize it doesn't serve any purpose in my writing I will sometimes just stop or delete it.

My husband doesn't read it. He's very busy, so I understand. He's started it a few times here and there, but he's just too busy. He's in med school currently so his time is very limited and when he does have free time he spends it with me. He's always known about my writing and though he doesn't read my fic he knows about every chapter. I talk to him a lot about my fic, he knows everything. Including the ending. He's very supportive.

*** Not only was the ending of Princess planned from the beginning, the ending of Princess was the first part of Princess put to page. The rest of Princess was written purely to get to that ending. There was one major difference between the first ending; though, and the ending that was put out.

I've received a, well, lot, of complaints about the ending to Princess. And been accused of things like 'lazy writing' and 'no inspiration' when really the rest of the story existed because I wanted to write that specific chapter.

I actually have a ton of scrapped material for Princess that may or may not get a final look over and edit and wind up posted. For example, I actually wrote out about 2500 words for each of Harry's articles in the second epilogue detailing his time in the cities as a travelogue of sorts. I could probably post another 100k words of things related to Princess that never made the cut.

Although Ff.net constraints mean that no one will ever see Princess exactly how I intended for it to be viewed. The 'epilogue' wasn't really supposed to be an Epilogue. It was supposed to be chapter headers, more or less. But I didn't really like how the serial nature of that would have worked out, nor did I like how ff.net formats it. So really, between chapter 1 and 2 is supposed to be around the first thousand words of the epilogue, and so on until the end. The only real epilogue portion of it would have been Claire Potter's eleventh birthday.

I doubt I'll really write another fic based on a pairing assuming I never return to Tenebrae Vincunt. I'm more interested in a concept or a theme to explore rather than 'pairing' characters. And I've pretty much done the ones that I'm interested in. I don't particularly think Harry would ever really be that interested in Hermione. And I think his relationship with Ginny would play out a lot like how I have it in QWC or DiP.

I would be interested in exploring Luna more. But Luna is weirdly hard to write and I haven't really managed to think of a plot that warrants exploring it more.

I do think that LdS will probably be my last new fic. I'll probably update some combination of TV, DiP and Thaw after it's done. But I said that after I finished Princess, and Vitam Paramus sprung itsself one me, so who knows.

** [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]]

Does Emily have a certain amount of gender dysphoria? Or is her desire for gender ambiguity purely a by product of her desire to dominate and control in a world traditionally run by men? Or am I massively missing the mark in both instances?

I get the feeling she's had to put up with a whole bunch of crap that male Voldy never did. Snape's attempt to undermine her, Crouch's purposeful botching of the ritual to 'make her the way he thinks she should be', etc.

Will this be explored more? Personally, I find it the most fascinating part of the whole fic so far.

Love the fic, btw.

*** i wouldn't call it dysphoria. As Dysphoria implies she wishes she was male. Which she doesn't. She does have to put up with a lot of things that Tom Riddle would have never had to deal with. And that is certainly going to be explored in greater detail.

At the same time, does she think that certain things would have been considerably easier if she was male? Yes. Yes she does. She forces them into the masculine pronouns as a form of dominance. The same reason behind the branding, mostly. To her, it's just another form of control

A large portion of the upcoming chapters involve 1944-1957 Emily Riddle. And I'll say that I find a villain who is just evil because villain to be a very boring concept. So there's a great deal that must be developed here.

I've already had her claim, and I will say readers should take everything she says to Harry with a grain of salt, to Harry that she isn't so much interested in Pureblood superiority as she is Magical Superiority vs Muggle Superiority. And that is a large chunk of hat will be explored in the story.

I find the 'If I was a Man!' female Villain to be boring through. So she's never going to use that aloud as an excuse. But she did grow up during a very interesting time in the Muggle World. Especially in London.

** u/. Is it wrong for me to say I never like Hannah and I always thought that Neville would end up with Luna.

*** Haha not at all. I love Luna, I just never thought that Neville and her would make a good couple. Like the idea of them together is nice, because I like them both, but then when I sit down and think of it I feel like one would always be missing something from the other. I think Neville would want a really quiet life. Like we know from what JK has said that he was an auror for a bit but then decided he wanted to teach. I think he was an auror for a while because he felt obligated to help out after the war. I think that in reality he just wanted a quiet life where he could have peace. I can see Neville's perfect date night being ordering in and watching a movie. Where as I feel Luna needs more in her life. I think she has a restless spirit. I see Luna as someone who would want to constantly be traveling and seeking out the new and different things. I believe if Neville and her were married Neville would do what she wanted but always be longing for something more quiet. I also think he wouldn't get Luna and that makes me sad, because I love Luna and I would want her with someone who understood her and could live in her little world. I don't the Neville could ever do that. He's too pragmatic. He's feel are too firmly on the ground.

*** Hey, thanks! It means a lot to know people like my fics.

I'm actually not much of a ff reader, or at least, I'm not as much as I used to be, so almost all of my recommendations are going to be old or well known ones like A Black Comedy for regular HP fics or The Black Prince for x-overs, rather than deep cuts. I could recommend a whole bunch of original stuff if you'd like.

As for your question, I try to write chronologically, and generally, to avoid being info-dumpy, I try to do a lot of implication: Since we're working with a world that our readers are most likely familiar with, we re-introduce concepts in a way that doesn't treat them like an idiot. When you rewrite concepts that the readers know in a wordy manner, it bores them to tears and gives them no incentive to keep reading.

So any canon concepts or background should be implied by the writing, and maybe touched upon, but never lengthily discussed. Instead, try to give the reader an immediate narrative hook: a funny conversation, Harry (or whoever your protagonist is) in an unfamiliar situation to people who've only known him from canon, etc. I think that does a better job of drawing the reader in without wordy or overly-explanatory.

Hope that helps!

** [[/u/SoulxxBondz]] a couple of questions for you.

In The Ilvermorny Champion (Which ironically has won the Best American Harry Potter Fiction Award in the GryffindorTom Online "Gryffie Awards"), you mention that Fleamont was a bit of a anti-Muggleborn. What is your view on his wife, Euphemia and his (Storyline) son Charlus and their views on Muggleborns.

Also, in Harem War, you mention that Ron is having Pansy and her cousin as his concubines. Where do you anticipate going with them? Will he use them in the later battle against the Crestview Alliance?

First off, wow, I totally did not know I won an award for the story. THANKS!!!

I suppose I don't have much of a view for Fleamont at all, other than I have a severe dislike for his name. He was just a cameo in my story for a portrait. Maybe I'll flesh it out further in the story, but I don't know the answer to this yet.

They're going to be used for his get-rich-quick scheme, and his plans definitely aren't nice. Er... I don't know if he'll use them as soldiers, or not. It is a good idea.
