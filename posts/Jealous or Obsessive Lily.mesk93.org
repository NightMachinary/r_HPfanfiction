Any stories out there that inverts the canon situation of James badgering/being in love with a reticent Lily? Or where Lily becomes jealous of either James moving on or finding a girlfriend?

I know there's one in the Pureblood Culture series (that was a little ham-fisted), but that's all.

...Heh, the idea of people's memories being clouded or viewed through rose-tinted glasses of the canon Lily/James dynamic, and it was actually her being just as bad as him or chasing him would be pretty hilarious.


** Hum... basically adorable violence but with Lily as the main character

  Lily Evans got described by many adjectives: vivacious, charming, bright, natural, talented, brave, funny, witty, kind, popular...Truly, she was an exceptional witch who for some reason left behind her a trail of deeply troubled individuals.Answer to the question: What would change in the story if Lily Evans had been born a sociopath is: not necessarily anything.
