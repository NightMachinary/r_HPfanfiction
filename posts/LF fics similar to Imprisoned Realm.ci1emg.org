  Sequel to The Will of All Others. Harry is trapped in every way under the rule of Lord Voldemort. Now he has been summoned to an Alternate Universe where everything is at once so much better and so much worse. As the events of his world threaten to repeat themselves, how can Harry save this universe, when he couldn't even save his own?
