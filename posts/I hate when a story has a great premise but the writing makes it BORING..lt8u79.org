*** Well, for one story, it was that I was all the way on chapter 22 of what was supposed to become a mentoring story, and Snape was only just then starting to think maybe he might change his attitude some time in the future. Harry's just getting more and more depressed and withdrawn in a story that was NOT marked as angst.

One story just didn't seem to have any real emotion to it. For example, they say the character is frustrated but don't show it: no clenching of hands, no brooding or outbursts... just saying that's how they feel. This wasn't helped by the occasional section in first-person POV. (It's not my favorite writing style but I can tolerate it; but if you choose that then you need to stick to it for the whole story.)

Another story that I recently slogged through but didn't really enjoy is my own fault. It was obvious from the beginning that it was written in the form of a "paper," and it was dry, dry, dry. I should have bailed when it started with the table of contents for the paper.

Other things that have made me stop reading a story is when they get "clever" with writing in a back-and-forth-in-time fashion. Flashbacks are fine, but your main story needs to have a linear progression. One story I remember reading had an "epilogue" (to a one-chapter story, that was nearly as long as the original chapter---so, basically, half the story) that did so much time jumping around that my conclusion was that the author just wrote things down as they thought of them. It made the story so disjointed that I stopped reading it and left a review (one of the ones I wish I could take back) that said if the author didn't care enough to put the story in order so it would make sense, I ddn't care enough to do it myself to read it.

**** First, thanks for the good answer. :)

Yeah, I have noticed there's a lot of bloated stories around - icebergs-melting level pacing and odd repetition pop up quite often. Editors are a blessing, there's no doubt about it.

Interesting that non-labelling is a thing that switches you off. It's something that's fascinated me for my entire time here - how much tagging is good tagging?

Also interesting how much the 'meta' of writing has an effect for you. Writing style, format, technique, and story structure are a lot more important than some people give 'em credit for, huh?

*** It can happen in several ways. I've read a few stories that started out well, but degenerated into "tell, don't show" as they went on. In other words, instead of a scene with dialogue, you are presented with narrative such as, "Now Harry goes to the goblins, but he found out his vault was empty." (Poor grammar intended.)

There was another story that had, IIRC, three viewpoint characters, and whenever the viewpoint changed, the story repeated the previous scene from the new character's point of view, without adding anything in the way of different insights from that character. It was merely superfluous repetition, rather than a way of highlighting different things that different characters can get from the same event.

** I've had this problem for a few super long stories not just in the Harry Potter fandom. There are many shorter ones that I just dropped (don't ask for names idk) because while they had a lure like a pairing I like (Haphne) or an interesting summary they were just too plain or intolerable writing.

However, the big stories are what hurt the most when you've already invested +100k words then the story drags on and the reader loses interest or just seems to continue on in cycles of shit (everybody has read some story of character conflicts that get resolved but then the same problems keep happening again, usually for just added angst). Honestly there have been times when I'd just start skimming even skipping sections of later sections of monolithic stories because writers couldn't just move forward, for instance I read a story where Harry hadn't even made it to King's Cross or even met another magical child yet after about 50k words in.

Others just get too messy with intricate subplots or even lose interest in the intricate subplots. Sometimes the author loses their hook on the audience making reading tedious.

** Most don't know when to show and when to tell, which can lead to either too much detail or too little, too much thinking, too many slice of life moments between action. One thing I appreciate about the books (not you OotP) is that something happened in almost every chapter.

Also HP fan fiction authors tend to railroad canon.

*** This is so true. One of Stephen King's rules (that he seems to break himself more and more these days) is "show, don't tell". Don't spend most of your story talking about what happened to the characters at some point, find a way to show it. If most of your story is the characters talking about things, maybe do a re-write and SHOW them going through those events. I agree - this is a bigger problem than it should be in fan fiction. It's made me nope out of a lot of stories. Your characters shouldn't spend most of the story talking and thinking. Show them actually going through situations. Even slice of life needs, you know, some slice.

** Sure, I've come across such stories. I can slog through almost anything, but if it's riddled with grammatical problems, I just cannot do it.

Watching authors jumping between tenses, almost like watching the windshield wipers on my car, drives me insane.

Also, I just cannot fathom writing a 300k plus story, and by the end, there has been no improvement in their writing. At all. How does that work?

Sure, I understand that a lot of fanfiction is written by people whose native language isn't English, but surely you must improve at least a little, when you write that much.

On a different note. I do not leave reviews, blasting the author, or their work. I assume they are writing because they enjoy it, and who am I to take that from them by acting like an asshole?

Most people have enough problems to deal with, without having to worry about an idiot who cannot act like a decent human being.

Seriously, if you don't have anything constructive to say, just shut the hell up, and go about your business. No need to spread your own misery.

** That or when there are way too many grammatical errors in the story I feel like I end up editing it in my head instead of actually reading it. I recently came across a story in Ao3 that had over 5k kudos and had a decent premise, but the verb tense shifts and hard to follow sentence structure took me right out of it.

I know these are stories that aren't written by professional, with editors and all that, but you need to read things over before posting. I don't want to sound harsh, and I really want to finish the story; it's definitely got potential, but it was hard to read. I almost want to reach out to the author and ask if they need someone to edit for them.
