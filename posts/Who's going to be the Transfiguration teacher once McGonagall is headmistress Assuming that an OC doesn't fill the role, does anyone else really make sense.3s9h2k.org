#+TITLE: Who's going to be the Transfiguration teacher once McGonagall is headmistress? Assuming that an OC doesn't fill the role, does anyone else really make sense?

Only one I can really think of is Hermione, but it'd be weird to imagine her teaching with all the shit she has to do. Anyone else we know with special skill in Transfiguration?

Alternatively, if you DO end up with an OC, which OC do you most prefer and think makes most sense?


** OC makes the most sense. But, knowing fanfiction, the author would make it precisely from Harry's year or the DA.

Might as well say Daphne Greengrass, because Reasons.

*** I might be writing a 'fic and I really have no idea. Probably will steal the OC from Hogwarts Houses Divided. Unfortunately I think the author is inactive so I don't think I'll be able to ask for permission.

** OC makes by far the most sense. There are so many people in the wizarding world that we don't know.

While I think it's best to shy away from OCs as main characters, there are circumstances where it can be jarring to shoehorn a known character into the plot.

*** Heh, well my main characters are going to be OCs anyway(it's that kind of fic) so. Didn't want to make more OCs if I could avoid it. But yeah, it'll probably be an OC since tradition dictates a DA member has to be DADA Professor.

** I use Teddy Lupin. He's a metamorphmagus, so, it kind of fits. He's mostly a minor character in my stories, but I have a ficlet series dedicated to his misadventures with demons and tenure, being the youngest professor and first one to not have gone through the war.

*** Fair enough. Too early in my fic(~'03) to have Teddy though, but a good choice in general.

** Augusta Longbottom, if only because she considered Charms to be a soft option for Neville. Of course, if you do make her a Professor alongside Neville as Professor of Herbology... it might be cruel.

Or really, really funny.

** George Weasley. The Weasley Twins were able to invent sweets that transfigure humans into animals, or objects that inflicted minor transfiguration, they must have been pretty good at the stuff. Plus, Fred was able to turn Ron's teddy bear into a spider when he was /five/.

It would be the ultimate irony for McGonagall.
