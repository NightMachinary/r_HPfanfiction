Is this an example of knowing what will happen so it seems obvious or something that should be taken into consideration?

What a strange place to visit. Do they take credits?

Anyways, if you're looking for logic and consistency in HBP, you're doing it wrong. The whole story is built up around several mysteries that slowly unravel at the end of the year, so the characters have to act stupid (to the point of absurdity or OOC) to give Harry a chance to figure it out himself. Dumbledore takes months to explain Voldemort's backstory, the teachers brush Harry off when Katie and Ron almost die, no one does anything about Romilda's roofies when Voldemort's entire backstory centers around a thirsty witch with love potions. You'd think that the theme of "unwilling love" would be more than a non-sequitor, when it's such an apt parallel to Lily's willing sacrifice, but it's just a one-and-done moment.

Similar to Tonks' patronus, which foreshadows the possibility of a witch losing her power when her love is unreciprocated. This plot point completely trashes Tonks' original characterization as a happy-go-lucky chipper Cockney, successful young Auror who managed to pass the training with a famously strict dark wizard hunter, Alastor Moody. For plot reasons, HBP turns her into a crybaby because a man doesn't want her. Lovely.

This lack of consistency goes the same for Hermione, "cleverest witch of her age", not thinking much about Malfoy potentially being a Death Eater, because he's /too young/, when he was literally shouting "Mudbloods, you'll be next!" at her when he was 12.

  "Malfoy threatened Borgin with him!" said Hermione. "Back in Knockturn Alley, don't you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he'd be checking up on Borgin's progress!"

  Harry gaped at her. "I forgot! But this proves Malfoy's a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?"

  "It is pretty suspicious," breathed Hermione. "Unless ..."

  "Oh, come on," said Harry in exasperation, "you can't get round this one!"

  "Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat."

  "You're unbelievable, you are," said Harry, shaking his head. "We'll see who's right ... you'll be eating your words, Hermione, just like the Ministry."

Literally the whole of last year had Harry telling everyone that Voldemort was back, and being called a liar. The next year, everyone forgot he was right all along, and are back to calling him a liar. Lol.

Everyone should have seen it. It should have been obvious, to maybe everyone but Fudge and Umbridge. But the needs of the plot come first, and character consistency comes second.

.

*TL;DR:* What is obvious and logical to you, is only obvious to HP characters if the story needs them to add something to the plot.

**** But Draco was namedropping marked Death Eaters, and they should have taken that seriously, even if they thought it was a stretch for him to be one himself. His father was a marked Death Eater, and so was his aunt Bellatrix, who murdered Sirius right in front them last year. There's a chance he was throwing around empty threats, but his family relationship to several known DE's is undeniable, and shouldn't be blown off because they don't like him.

Everyone jokes about Draco's "my father will hear of this", but he's actually effective in making stuff happen. Lucius got Dumbledore sacked in Y2 during the petrifications, and had Buckbeak put on the chopping block for biting him.

Given his track record, I don't know why they aren't taking him seriously.

***** Yeah plus how the heck would it be out of the realm of possibility for him to be a death eater? his father's a well known high ranking one and he obviously shares the same beliefs, and Voldemort is known to be back and recruiting again. Seriously if a kid is the son of a Baker and decides to make some bread people are ussually not all that suprised by it lol

*** But Harry often jumped to conclusions throughout the books, blaming Draco and Snape for all types of stuff (hexing his broom, opening the chamber of secrets,...) and he was usually wrong. If he blames Draco for every bad thing that happens around school, I don't think it's that surprising that they doubt him.

**** Issue there is that all those jumping to conclusions moments were mostly understandable and that Hermione and Ron jumped right along with him.

Snape jinxing the broom? Hermione's idea.

Snape going for the stone? All 3 believed it.

Malfoy opening the Chamber? All 3 believed it, and Malfoy shouting "you'll be next mudbloods" gave them a fair reason

Hell, in GoF, Ron bitches out Harry for ages because he jumped to a stupid unevidenced conclusion about Harry entering himself.

All together, it becomes very very weird when suddenly everyone goes full skeptic about something much more plausible than either their past incorrect assumptions or the frankly insane reality of Hogwarts - the idea that now of-age son of the Dark Lord's right hand, who's been aiming for a Death Eater spot his whole life, and is now namedropping Fenrir Greyback inside a Dark Artifact store, might be a Death Eater/up to something - and decides Harry's paranoid.

  ‚ÄòMr Weasley, I'm sorry, but isn't it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it's probably something Dark or dangerous, isn't it?'

  ‚ÄòI doubt it, to be honest, Harry,' said Mr Weasley slowly. ‚ÄòYou see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We took away everything that might have been dangerous.'

  ‚ÄòI think you missed something,' said Harry stubbornly.

  ‚ÄòWell, maybe,' said Mr Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr Weasley was humouring him.

  ‚ÄòMr Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school?'

  ‚ÄòI checked, Harry,' said Mr Weasley at once. ‚ÄòI went and searched the Malfoys' house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn't have been there.'

  ‚ÄòYeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you'd looked... but this is something different... well, something more...'

  And he told Mr Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape.

  ‚ÄòHas it occurred to you, Harry,' said Mr Weasley, ‚Äòthat Snape was simply pretending---'

  ‚ÄòIt isn't our business to know,' said Lupin unexpectedly. He had turned his back on the fire now, and faced Harry across Mr Weasley. ‚ÄòIt's Dumbledore's business. Dumbledore trusts Severus, and that ought to be good enough for all of us.'

** He investigated Malfoy manor and found nothing. I think that's taking Harry seriously. And Harry often blamed Snape and Draco for everything bad going on around school (like opening the chamber of secrets for example) and they were usually innocent, Snape even sometimes the one to save him (broom), so I don't think it's too much of a stretch to not believe him in something like that. Also, Voldemort did not usually mark students (obviously very risky) and grown ups don't usually think of students when they think of murder. And Dumbledore did ask Snape to keep an eye on Draco, which he did, but unfortunately wasn't enough. Dumbledore also would not kick Draco out for being a Death Eater, as he wants to protect students and gives everyone a second chance. Getting kicked out of school would lead students to Voldemort, as they would not have many other options...

*** Hmm I agree with you on Arthur though I do think the fact he found NOTHING in lucius house shouldve tipped him off that lucius knew a raid was happening. I'm off the opinion that except for Arthur, Snape, and Dumbledore, there shouldnt be a single person in wizarding Britain that wouldnt take Harry's concerns seriously. Arthur checked and found nothing so that's understandable, snape and Dumbledore needed draco for thier plot to work so that's understandable, but to every other person in Hogwarts harry has never made a wrong move in his entire life as dar as thier aware. Only Ronald and hermione knew about draco and they both know that the only reason draco wasnt the one behind the pertrifications is by sheer chance and that he admitted to their faces that he would've if he couldve. Hagrid and mcgonagall along with the trio know about his suspicion of snape but the trio suspected him as well and mcgonagall was wrong as well that year by not believing harry about the stone being stolen. Hargrid could maybe not believe harry but harry is the sole reason he got out of azkaban so I think hagrid owes him a little credit. To evryone else though harry, successfully stopped Voldemort as both a baby and a 11 year old, found the chamber of secrets, saved Ginny and killed the basilisk, didnt put his name in the goblet but was falsely blamed for that and Cedrics death both accusations proven false later, was a successful and well respected teacher when umbridge was ruling everything, was right about Voldemort being back when the ENTIRE WIZARDING WORLD was telling him he was full of it, and is also the chosen one destined to be voldemorts enemy. I'm pretty sure the only reason he wasnt easily believe is that harry was supposed to be a jesus metaphor so Rowling had to make sure there was a ton of doubt even if it's all bullcrap lol
