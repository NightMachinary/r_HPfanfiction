So I posted a similar search about a month ago I got several shorter length fics, but nothing I could really sink my teeth into so I'm asking again

I need some help, I have a real soft spot for hp/Luna, friendship or relationship but I've never really found any that I like outside of a few shorter ones. They are either harems/lunar harmony, or the author uses Luna as an excuse for a dark Harry

If any of y'all have come across any good ones, I'd really appreciate them.

So as you can tell above I would prefer no harems or Dark Harry,

I'd also prefer longer stories but as long as the fics are good any length will suffice

**** Pairing is supposed to be harry/Luna and Hermione/Neville.... I've read some of the first book, and though it was written well, I lost interest. I personally am going to give it another go, because I don't really remember anything about it so maybe the second time is the charm

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade]]

Starts as parody of the formula most independant!Harry stories follow. Overly friendly Goblins, Manipulative Dumbledore, a shopping trip, a will from Sirius etc... Then it gets weird.
