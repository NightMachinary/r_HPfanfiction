Authors/Readers/All the abovers, I find myself constantly thinking of different stories and AUs of Harry Potter and was wondering if anyone else does too. I know some people have many stories and there are thousands of HPFFs, but does anyone else read ff and then frequently have a concept, premise, plot ect. ... pop into their heads. Or does anyone watch a new show/movie and think it could be good FF if HP characters replaced the tv show characters in a new setting.

For Example: I am reading an 8th year story about Draco liking Hermione, Harry's Best Friend, and Harry liking Daphne Greengrass, Draco's Best Friend, and now I want to make my own story on that. Also I saw Ghost in the Shell and want to make a story where Harry is an Unspeakable in charge of various HP girls (who all have their own specialties of Magic) I want Harry to be like Motoko (The female leader of a group of Males who are experts in their fields, but who has little attachment to them with almost no themes of romance).

This is only from the past week and I want to know if anyone else gets these thoughts/ideas, does anything with them, saves them in an idea box for a rainy day, or sends them somewhere for other people to write or comment on. (I'd write them for personal fun if I could ever stop thinking about new stories. I already have too many unfinished projects and one of my readers jokingly commented (at least I hope jokingly) that I can't end stories like I have been and expect to get away with it).

Sorry for the length of this post and thanks for your input!


** Yeah, I get ideas like this all the time, and not just for HP fanfics, or even fanfics in general, but also for original stories. I write them down and encourage them, because they usually either end up going somewhere, or get sucked into much larger projects. For example, I had two ideas for two separate original stories. One took place way in the future, another took place in an ancient fantasy world. I entertained both of these ideas until I ran into problems I solved by merging the two stories and worlds so they told one long story of a character's beginning and end after they're taken out of time.

Keep those ideas you get somewhere and they might turn into your next obsession! Its also really fun to go back and find ideas I had that I kind of forgot about.

** This happens allllll the time when reading. And those ideas just won't leave me alone, like I HAVE to write about them. My computer is filled with terrible, unfinished projects.

I think it's a good sign, though. It sounds like you have an active imagination, something every writer values.

** I currently have some stories running around in my head, but since I usually run into trouble filling in the blanks of the story. Like I can think of a premise or a start for a story, but then from where I start to finishing it is where I lose creativity.

Right now I've got what I'd like to think is a decent AU, somewhat original story with time travel. This one was mostly because it seemed that in all time travel stories Harry becomes this super loved character and tells his parents who he is and they love him and life is good. But I haven't found a properly written story that has Harry take a more dark turn, while still not becoming a Dark Lord himself.

** yes. I have like eighty story ideas whirling around my brain like a blender.

- Harry is a ghost animagus but he almost-dies at the end of first year and transforms and thinks he's dead.
- Harry tries to make a staff, it ends up working like two big wands stuck handle-to-handle.
- Hogwarts falls into the Void between universes. They still go to Hogsmeade on weekends.
- Sword of Gryffindor talks. A lot. It won't shut up, actually.
- Hermione has a thing for knives. And she's good at Conjuration.
- Sirius does all kinds of dumb illegal stuff to the point where nobody even thinks of him being Voldemort's Right Hand Man, he's just the jerk who keeps loitering and leaving his trash on the ground a foot away from the garbage cans and runs around without pants on.
- Luna Lovegood teaches Merpeople how to make omelettes.
- Harry's Holly wand actually doesn't like him but he buys it anyway because when he first tried it it jumped out of his hand and beaned Draco Malfoy, and he wins vs Voldemort because it flies out of his hand and impales the Dark Lord
- Sticking Charm abuse
- Ron using his broken wand to cast 'Expelliarmus' which makes him throw his own wand and it beans Draco Malfoy
- everyone beaning Draco Malfoy with their wands
- A huge conspiracy where Crabbe and Goyle were actually baby cows transfigured into Wizards at birth in order to provide Malfoy with bodyguards.
