This may come across as one of those slightly weird requests, but it isn't actually a fetish. I like ASMR videos, and I also love makeover type fics. Sadly, searching for ASMR Harry potter fanfictions doesn't seems to work, so I'm looking for fics with makeovers, backrubs - anything. I would prefer it was not sexual, which just about all backrub ones I find are.

Maybe its Hermione getting a complete makeover, or a feral Harry getting his first haircut, or Molly being given a magical spa mothers day voucher, or Ginny getting a back rub from Harry after a day of Quidditch training, or Ron giving Hermione one after a day in the office. Or maybe a Lavender and Parvati dorm party where they do each others nails and hair. Or someone nursing someone else.

So! What fics have scenes like these? Pretty please?


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has such makeover scenes - like a spa visit before the Yule Ball. It also has many details on makeup throughout the story - although often related to disguises. They're not that long, though.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a physical sensation characterized by a pleasurable tingling that typically begins in the head and scalp, and often moves down the spine and through the limbs.

  Also known as : AIHO (Attention induced head orgasm), AIE (Attention induced euphoria), or simply "head orgasms"/"head tingles".

** Wait, do you mean audio recordings of such fics being read aloud? Or... just scenes with characters feeling asmr?

Gotta say this is the first time I've heard about someone being able to get ASMR from merely reading about it.

*** Mm, thought it might be a bit weird. No, just fics with things like massages and pampering in it.

Yeah, I've never heard of anyone else, either. But always have done, I'd get scalp tingles as a kid when reading a description of someone getting fussed over, hair brushed, nails clipped, etc.

** Not weird. I have a whole collection of massage fics - in other fandoms - for the same reason.

I haven't run across any in HP though.

**** The best, completely non-sexual one is linkao3(Touching Moments by Ysabetwordsmith). Avengers, but no knowledge of the fandom really required.

***** Oh awesome! I don't do Buffy or Supernatural, but I love Avengers. Well written Harry Potter/MCU crossovers are the best.

I love this line
