Thanks to my failure to find a decent Slytherin!James story, I decided to write my own and while I have far more experience writing research papers than narratives, I think I did an okay job of it. I noticed a couple of fanfictions had the the Potter family motto as 'Fortune favors the bold' and I thought that was rather on the nose as a blatantly Gryffindor mindset, so I kind of flipped that trope on its head changing both the family motto and heritage to Slytherin. I changed the genealogy and family history of the Potters to make James first cousins to the Black children through his mother, Dorea. I explain more in the first author's note and the first few chapters are mostly world-building anyway. I hope you'll read it and give me some constructive criticism to improve it, because I really don't want it to turn into a hot mess.

Oh...a minor warning. I know some of you probably hate the whole lordship system trope, but I'm quite fond of it, so it's included. I plan on it being semi-defunct in James' era and almost completely defunct by the start of the canon timeline, however. So while it's somewhat important in the beginning, it's far from the focus of the main plot.

I'm new to reddit, so forgive me if I mess up the mechanics of linking. I'm going to copy and paste the summary then the link to the first chapter before I try the additional bot thingy.

Summary: A looming conflict between light and dark is shrouded in shades of grey and the Potter heir must choose among loyalties both old and new. As he struggles to make his choices he knows one thing for certain, what every Potter is born knowing, that Fortune Favors the Cunning. Slytherin!James Ravenclaw!Lily AU Marauders Era! Riddle era prologue and interludes

Flair aside, the title should've been more descriptive. Something like "My Slytherin!James fic - Looking for constructive criticism".

Anyway, the idea sounds fairly interesting, even if the Lordship and Charlus and Dorea thing are making me wary, so I will probably check it and post real input soon.

*** Thank you. I thought of the same thing after I posted it, but by then it was too late to change the title and posting a new thread would just be obnoxious.
