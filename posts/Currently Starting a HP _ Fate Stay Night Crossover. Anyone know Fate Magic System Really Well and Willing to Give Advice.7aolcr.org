Basically as the title says I'm in the planning phase for trying to do a proper HP & Fate/Stay Night crossover. I've seen the Unlimited Blade Works anime as well as Fate/Zero and read lots of the Wiki. I'm still having a bit of trouble woth the Fate magic system though.

My basic premise is to merge both universes where HP wizards (and witches) as well as the Mages know about each other but dont generally get along with each other. They've clashed in the past but for now are under a somewhat tenuous peace brokered between the ICW and the Mage Association.

Now, the Evans family is a somewhat well respected family within the Mage Association. Unfortunately Petunia wasn't born with any magic circuits forcing the family to retreat somewhat from their social circles. Luckily for them when Lily was born, she was indeed a mage (something even more contributing to Petunia's bitterness) but unexpectedly was also born a "muggleborn" witch as well which is almost unheard of. Lily chooses to study at Hogwarts anyways however and the rest follows canon for a while. I was planning on making the Evans family especially proficient at runic magecraft and that is what she uses to save Harry from Voldemort (causing his scar). She will survive the encounter too though the magical backlash will knock her onto a coma/magical stasis like state. Harry will grow up like canon thinking she's dead, much like the rest of the world. The main story starts at the beginning of the Order of the Pheonix where Fudge is a little bit craftier and manages to get Harry expelled like he wanted to and even tries to have his memories of magic wiped (though it's botched and Harry remembers soon after). Long story short, he gets attacked by Death Eaters outside the Dursleys but is saved by someone he'd never expect to see alive. ;)

Anyway, if there any big Fate fans on this subreddit, im looking for some advice on how to affectively merge the two universes and magic systems. Feel free to comment below or send me a message and we can chat. Thanks!

*Sorry in advance for any typos. Wrote this whole post on my phone. *


** Fate Magecraft and HP magic doesn't really get along, imo. Magecraft is high cost for little reward and is slow as fuck to develop(see progress measured in generations), though it does have the advantage of being very science-like in nature which allows for things HP magic can't really do. HP magic, on the other hand, is very easy to use, easy to create, and can have major returns for the amount of effort required.

So, maybe you can play that up. Mages seethe with jealousy over the efficiency and power of wizards, while wizards look down on mages as barely more than squibs.

You're also going to need to address the fact that mages would be quite willing to kidnap and dissect wizards(adults or children) to get whatever it is that gives wizards their magic. And what they might do with it if they can successfully get wizard magic.

*** I have to agree with you and thats where I've been having the most trouble. Both systems of magic really don't jive well and its been my biggest stumbling block. I was planning on playing that tension up a lot. Like you said, Mages are somewhat jealous of how freely wizards can use magic as well as disaprove of how they treat it so casually. Wizards on the other hand like you also said see Mage's as barely above a muggle. Mage's will also have tried to capture and dissect wizards in the past, but that has mostly stopped when the ICW and Mage's Association came to a peace agreement in the past though there are still cases of it happening under the table. Up until now, no Mage has managed to figure out wizard's secret to using magic like they do. This also leads to wizards looking down on Mage's as almost barbarians as well (in their eyes). For the most part though, the two groups ignore each other. No one wants to accidentally set off a war between them.

** You could take the route of various others and make it that of a taboo to talk about. Or something like mid-way through chapter 5 of linkffn(12063068).\\
I'm really interested in this anyway so good luck

  The magical world has been split between wizards and magi for centuries, and both sides are happy to pretend the other does not exist. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end as Harry Potter finds himself growing up on the wrong side of the magical divide. Harry Potter/ Nasuverse AU. On brief hiatus- likely to return in the winter.

*** It's an interesting idea. I was considering more that Mages would be jealous of how freely wizards can use magic (sort of like the other commenter on here mentioned) while most Wizards just look down on mages. Both sort of underestimate each other. Or at least thats how I was thinking of writing it.

I'll have to check out the story you linked. I don't actually think I've seen this one surprisingly.

Edit: I have read that fic before. Its quite good. Hope to see it updated again.

** linkffn(Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) describes wizards as having a single magical core, which is like one particularly large and diverse magic circuit. Later n there is a set of powerful Fate runes, which appear on Fatebreakers: I think Harry has Fate/Victory (his scar), Dumbledore has Fate/Materials (sign of the Deathly Hallows), Voldemort has Fate/Zero, etc.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.
