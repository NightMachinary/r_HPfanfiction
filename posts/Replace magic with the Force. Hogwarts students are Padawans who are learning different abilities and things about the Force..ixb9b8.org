** Dark Arts = Dark Side of the Force

So obviously Gryffindors get red saber (Not associated with dark side here), Slytherins green... And so on.

Gryffindors of course are of course favoring intuition and saber abilities

Ravenclaws more studious on the Cosmic and Undying force. Prefer use of force over saber.

Hufflepuff are dedicated to the study of the Living force.

Slytherins on the practical use of force and the Noble history of the jedi order.

They would need new names and mascots. Porgs for Hufflepuffs.
