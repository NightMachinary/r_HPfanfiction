I am looking for a fix where those listed above leave their house, but dont join a new one. I know they find obscure unused parts of the castle to build their new dorms in that are pretty elaborate.

Edit: I think the find a loophole in the school rules where they can leave their assigned house if they aren't sleeping there. I know they eventually have to find a teacher to oversee their group I think it was Vector or Babbling, or both helping each other.


** Did they take up residence in the Chamber of secrets? I read one that had something like that and I've been trying to re-find it again for a while now..

**** Awwww. They had people from all the houses "quitting" their old houses and joining house "potter".

I think Snape was getting pissed off because he couldn't figure out how to take points.

** Wait, I think I know that one. Manipulators of Destiny, or something like that? Pretty sure I have something similar deep in my faves several years back.\\

***** I'll keep looking. It's been awhile, but iirc setting up those four while bashing Weasleys and Dumbledore wasn't uncommon way back when, so I might have a few more stashed.

** I've read this recently and now it's bugging me I can't remember. They formed a sort of house and had babbling be the head and vector was also helping. Hermione learned to pop around hogwarts and taught the other two. Ugh! This is really driving me nuts now!
