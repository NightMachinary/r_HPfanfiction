In Harry's fifth year seeing how much stress Harry is under, Dumbledore decides to introduce Harry to the magical drug he uses himself all the time.

Now Harry is calm and cheerful and keeps going around in colorful clothe twinkling at people, preaching love and forgiveness, and wanting to be everyone's friend.

Malfoy is furious because Harry doesn't get offended by the insults he has so painstakingly thought of and practiced in front of a mirror.

Crab and Goyle are conflicted. The boss hates Harry Potter, but he's being nice to them and gives them chocolate frogs. They wonder if they should be friend with Potter. The boss is kind of going crazy anyway, all that eye-twitching when Potter's around doesn't seem very healthy.

Professor Umbridge is frustrated because the damn lying half-blood doesn't rise to her baiting.

Lord Voldemort is puzzled and angry because he can't put dreams in Harry's head anymore.

Hermione is insanely curious to know why Harry has changed, but he isn't telling her, and just twinkles at her and give her irrelevant, wise-sounding advice.

And Ron is glad that Harry can play chess much better now.

*** From chapter 13 of linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter):

After reading the parchment twice to ensure he properly understood, Albus opened a drawer under his desktop and retrieved a small cloth sack. This sack contained the 'special' lemon drops that he brewed himself on those rare opportunities when he got to visit the dungeons without students or teachers to deal with. As the muggles were known to say, these lemon drops were really good shit, man.

Albus took two of them together and followed them with a shot of his personal restorative draught. The phoenix tears and scotch mix both enhanced his special candies and prevented his heart from stopping. Did he mention how especially potent these lemon drops were? Was that wall breathing? Oh! The dancing broomsticks were back! Ha-ha! They always put on a good show.
