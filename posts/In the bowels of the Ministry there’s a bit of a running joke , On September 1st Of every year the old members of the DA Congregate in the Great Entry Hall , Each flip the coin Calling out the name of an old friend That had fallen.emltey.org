And many others

In the ministry there's a bit of a running joke, If Harry Potter calls you an old friend, It makes you looked into the eyes of a dementor or fear itself And laughed. It meant you faced the death Eater head on It meant you charged into battle Alongside him . And it meant you knew what the bloody hell Seamus Finnegan was Talking about When he said he blew up a bridge with Minerva's stamp of approval. And why anytime a staff meeting if Hermione Granger-Weasley Mentioned Centaurs At least one person said pink and started coughing to cover up laughter

****** There's an event held every September 1st in the ministry. People write a name on both sides and pass their coin around. That name is of a person they trusted before said person died. Being picked by Harry Potter instantly makes you a wizard or witch on an higher level than others. It makes people see you as a person who in life was an untouchable impossibly hard to kill person, lesser only to Harry Potter himself and perhaps the Golden Trio, true or false it may be. No one really knows what requirements there are to be picked by him, but everyone knows you must have faced truly incredible things alongside him to receive such an honor that few people would believe or ever truly understand.
