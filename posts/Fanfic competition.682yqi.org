Does anyone know anything about the Quidditch League Fanfiction Competition? It's hosted on ff.net. Any info would be welcome!


** What would you like to know about it?

I helped run the comp for the first few seasons and then participated as a player in a season or two.

You basically sign up for a team/position before the season begins. You have team threads where you can organise things, but these threads often turn into just giant group chats when everyone becomes friendly. When the season starts, rounds will come out one by one. Your team will be assigned another team to "play" against. Each position will have a different prompt to follow or task to fulfil in writing their story. Seekers must get their stories in asap, first one in earns their team extra points. Every round is different, prompts are unique, and the rounds continue on knocking teams out week by week until the finals. Fics are scored by a team of judges with a set rubric, who will send the results to the current comp host. Scores are tallied, the team with the highest combined score wins, and continue on to the next round. I think rounds are two weeks long? But I can't remember for sure.

It's a lot of fun, and you make some really great friends. I have friends from all over that I still talk to daily four years later. Would definitely recommend taking part at least once :)

I have never used that forum myself, but why don't you contact one of the forum moderators and ask?

*** That's what I was going to do -- just figured I'd check to see if anyone had any first-hand information about it

** I participated in the QLFC for season 4. I was Seeker for the Falmouth Falcons. (My name on FFN is Sunne [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Esunne][https://www.fanfiction.net/~sunne]]) DoTheThingAnyway gives a really good breakdown of how the competition works. Participating in the QLFC was one of the most invaluable things I have done for my writing. It has made me think about plot structure and characterization differently and it has really improved my sentence structure. The people I have met are awesome and I love the team that I had. We really bonded and it really felt like a group of tight-knit friends despite the fact that we were literally around the world from each other.

It's intense though. You are writing a short story every 2 weeks and you have to really commit. The QLFC is not a short competition. Season 4 lasted a whole year (I'm told it's the longest this competition has ever run). You have to ask yourself if you are able and willing to do this for possibly a year because you have a team depending on you.

If you end up doing it though, spend time getting to know everybody. There's a lot of role playing in the changing rooms which is fun. Be open to feedback and constructive criticism. And have fun!

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me anything. I'm not participating this season, but I'll lurk.
