So this is a fic I've been thinking about but can't find anywhere and I would appreciate any help finding it.

It had Harry travel back somehow to the 1930's and he opened a sanctuary type orphanage in the wizarding world out of his Peverell estate and basically turns it into a small village with squib parents of muggleborns and such. He first wakes up in St Mungos and has to lie about being attacked by Grindelwald's followers or something I think because he came from a future were some catastrophe has happened and everything was dying. He had a trunk full of magical creatures that he brought back with him like goblins and centaurs but not many survived only one young centaur girl who joins his orphanage and becomes friends with Tom Riddle.

He meets his grandfather or other relation that turns out to be darker than he thought they would be and Harry tells him that Dumbledore has a taboo on his name and he might have been somehow responsible for the catastrophe. His grandfather takes him to the ministry to help speed up the process of getting his sanctuary approved and for a while thinks that Harry is an illegitimate son to the family somehow but later gets told about the time travel. Dumbledore has also been ignoring his duties as deputy head by not going to every muggleborns house and claiming their parents refused to send them to Hogwarts, eventually leading to Harry finding kids in abusive situations Dumbledore has left them in and taking them to his sanctuary.

So yes, I remember a lot but I can't seem to find the fic! Thank you for any help!


** Linkao3(1535306) I do believe it is this one, but he doesn't have a trunk full of magical creatures (FBAWTFT?)

*** This is it thank you! I was searching Fanfiction.net and didn't realize it was on AO3. The trunk is in the second installment, but unlike Fantastic Beasts it holds shrunken tents that the creatures are housed in.
