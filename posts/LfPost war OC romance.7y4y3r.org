  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

****** No. It was trying to head that way. The author hasn't updated for a while though so I think the author might be having trouble making the romance happen.

** I know she's not actually an OC, but she's a blank slate in canon so I might as well leave this one here. linkffn(Days to Come).

I don't think I can remember any actually OC stories unfortunately.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
