After reading wizarding runemaster(harry/wow)

And a difference one man can make (harry/GoT) Led me to being enthralled with crossovers where harry knows a lot of versatile magic and puts it to good use in the plot instead of just out right rofl stomping people.

Anyone know any other fanfictions similar to these ones?
