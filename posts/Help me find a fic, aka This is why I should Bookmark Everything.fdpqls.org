:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I really should just bookmark every fic I read, it'd be an insane number but it'd be worth it so I wouldn't have to go digging through a million tags!

Anyway the fic I'm looking for might be a little hard to find because all I remember now is that Harry finds a book or an article about the lost art of letter-writing and ends up building up a correspondence with several people, including Augusta Longbottom and Molly Weasley. I -think- Harry is in Slytherin and Ron is a bully because I remember Harry writing Molly about something and Molly sending Ron a Howler. But sadly that is the extent of my memory - I've been through the Slytherin!Harry tag and didn't see any that rang any bells. Could be under Smart!Harry or snarky!harry too.

EDIT: Also this fic is on AO3 because I no longer know how to navigate [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and have never explored livejournal, more's the pity.

If you happen to know what this is let me know! Thanks


** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality? I think he was in Slytherin?

*** Holy wow. No unfortunately that's not it, and I don't think I've ever read a fic that long omg! You (both) must be extremely dedicated to read all that! I think the longest I've ever read was 200k... although I sometimes read series with multiple 100k+ fics. Also you reminded me to add an edit to my post (I read 99.99% of fics on AO3, but it's so normal to me that I forgot to mention it). Thank you though! I'm (somewhat) tempted to read this fic... think I'll bookmark it for a rainy week.
