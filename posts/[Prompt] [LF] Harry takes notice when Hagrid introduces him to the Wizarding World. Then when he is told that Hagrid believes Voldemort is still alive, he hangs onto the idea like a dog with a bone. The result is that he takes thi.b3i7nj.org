** So a Harry who is motivated by the inevitability of facing Voldemort from the beginning?

Surprisingly I can't think of any fics with this. I imagine because any authors interested in a magically powerful protagonist have no reason not to just make Harry interested in magic for its own sake.

Having the protagonist be bored while learning but forcing themselves to do it out of fear probably would not be that fun to read.

*** I prefer fix-it fics where Harry isn't given any superpowered boost, but rather his personality changes in a way that's actually helpful. Being raised by eg Sherlock Holmes or Alastor Moody would make Harry much more effective against the canon plot without any sort of "huge magical core" or "dragon animagus" handwaving. A Harry who could have solved his yearly mysteries much sooner, or a Harry who was ready for and trained to deal with threats is the ideal fix-it fic protagonist compared to reincarnation-of-Merlin Harry imho.

**** Well, I personally don't like fix-fics at all.

The magic system of Harry Potter's setting is what me makes me read fanfiction, so a protagonist dealing with their problems using mundane skills is not particularly interesting to me. My ideal Harry would just ignore the hooks for the yearly plots and seek out their own adventures without needing a threat.
