** I'd say the best would be linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB).

It is a Riddle-centric fic taking place during his schools years, which features great magic and a mentor-Dumbledore as well as conflict with Grindlewald.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** I second the Demonologist one. It's so well planned & funny & original at the same time. You could also look up "Six Pomegranate Seeds" by Seselt on ffnet. Hermione is sent back in time to fix a glitch by the essence/spirit/beings of Hogwarts, as the child of a /deatheater/. It's a really interesting concept, the writing is realistic, Hermione as a pureblood deatheater kid is really believable. All together, one of the gems.

linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild): Probably the funniest HP fanfic since /Seventh Horcrux/. Point of departure: Harry is a redhead. This creates some confusion with the Weasleys, and from there insanity spirals out of control. Ongoing, frequently updated.

linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor): Another single-point-of-departure: Hermione is born a Parselmouth. She befriends the Basilisk in first year and various light-hearted adventures ensue. Ongoing, frequently updated.

linkffn(We, Harry Potter): Another contender for Worthy Heir of Seventh Horcrux, this story revolves around Harry somehow turning into a five-headed dragon and the ensuing shenanigans. Ongoing, updated rather slowly.

** I'll bang my usual drums for this request, since I think they fall under your request.

linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox 5). One of my favorites the last few years, basically what happens if the Ministry accepts the notion that Voldemort is back and tries to manage his return with diplomacy. Leads to Hermione and the other muggleborns to fight back.

linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC). Not AU I'm sorry, but tells the story of Percy, Audrey, Bill, Fleur and others and what they were up to during the war. Basically the work they did to protect muggleborns. Truly amazing storytelling.

There are others but in my opinion start with these two. Definitely my top 2 of recent times.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.

** linkffn(12001201)

Let Perpetual Light is the story of Albus, Gellert and Ariana in the summer following Kendra's death. It's largely canon-compliant, but extends Ariana's role with a creative interpretation of the character. The story has a quite mysterious atmosphere, especially the parts written from Ariana's point of view.

I know you requested no slash, but the slash aspect is negligible. There's one kiss between Albus and Gellert, the rest is just implied.

  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.
