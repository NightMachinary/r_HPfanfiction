  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

** That's a great fic, for only 40k words it's rather well done. I found the characterization of Draco believable and I absolutely love the Daphne/Harry interactions. Its refreshing to have a fic that focuses on the school interactions rather than the fight against Voldemort.

As to fit your criteria? Linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7) has Harry running a black market within the school and eventually gets caught by Dumbledore

Edit: Antithesis has a very cringey summary. However I would ask you to give it a chance; as it has really done some incredible things really. Harry is not edgy, he is not overly powerful, and his conscience is a major inhibitor.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
