[Suggestion] I'm looking for a fanfiction. It's your favourite fanfic or one that you feel should get more attention. I've read a lot of the common fics but I'm hoping that you can help by upvoting recommendations for fics that you've read and enjoyed even if you can't think of anything specific to recommend yourself. Links are preferred. Post is potentially NSFW depending on how horny the community is feeling today.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4291790/1/Polyjuice-Memory-Charms-and-More][Polyjuice, Memory Charms, and More]], linkffn(4291790)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327), is really good IMO, packs tons of actions and emotion, but only has 53 Favorites.

Esama's [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire Series]] is great, but not very often recommended here.

*** Island of Fire is fantastic. The creativity and unique-style make it a fun read.

If yo've ever wondered how ship wrecked wizards would colonize an island, definitely check out the series.

** Anything by Slide. She's such an amazing author, and hasn't been recced nearly enough. An astounding amount of worldbuilding in her two years, especially the greater European magical community. If you're worried about writing quality, she's a published original author.

She has 2 separate series that I'm a fan of. The first shows the last 3 books from the point of view of 4 slytherins in the year above Harry's. The characters all have depth and solid interaction.

The second is a sequel to the first involving the next generation. Revolves mostly around Scorpius Malfoy, ALbus Potter, & Rose Weasley. Featuring Slytherin!Albus

** Overlooked good fics? Happy to help.

I hope you like Luna, since that's primarily what I got.

If you want something that's of medium length (as far as fanfics go), and sticks close to canon, then say hello to /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./ This is Luna's /Order of the Phoenix/ and it's very good.

** This story may have a few errors and is somewhat short, but I immensely enjoyed it and I wished I hadn't finished it so fast. It has a concept that isn't written about enough and is irredeemably AU and some characters may act OOC. There also may be things that may be impossible, but I read this fic when I had second degree burns (my own stupidity) and it was so good, it took my mind off the pain.
