Looking for a fic set while Harry and Draco are at Hogwarts, and somehow become a couple. Would prefer if they weren't friends before-hand (not an AU where Harry is a Slytherin or something like that).


** linkao3(4105780)

Or search ao3 for Hogwarts 8th Year fics. Plenty of those to go around.

  After the fall of Voldemort, the students whose 7th year was so heavily impacted by the war and the Death Eater-takeover at Hogwarts have been called back to retake their last year of school. The power balances in the wizarding world are shifting, but at Hogwarts, the old alliances remain unchanged. The animosity between Slytherin and Gryffindor is as strong as ever, and while Draco is trying to restore some of the lost power and influence of House Malfoy, everyone is trying to come to terms with what happened during the war and who they are now. Voldemort may be gone, but it would be a lie to say that all is well.

** ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9756136/1/Everything-s-Different-yet-Everything-s-the-Same)ffnbot!directlinks]] I don't know if this will fit exactly what you want because it's a time travel fic but it is Drarry set in Hogwarts. Either way it's a really interesting story and take on things. Unfortunately it is unfinished though.

** It's been awhile since I've read most of these, but these are some of the Hogwarts fics I have bookmarked with Drarry as the main pairing. Hope at least one of them is what you're searching for! Most of them are eighth year, but not all.

  Harry and the lot are back at Hogwarts for their final year, after the final battle. But Harry finds himself more ostracized than ever before, and finds an unlikely companion in Malfoy, also shunned. How will the others react to their friendship, and how long will it take the dense boys to realize they want more than that? Harry/Draco, canon Ron/Hermione, and Neville/OC.

  Harry has had quite enough of sharing his mind with someone else, thankyouverymuch. A miscast Legilimecy spell says otherwise.(Fic from 2010 FF archive being uploaded here.)

  Cooking. The Muggle Way. Without any Magic. Definitely Draco's idea of hell. Unless, of course, it leads to much more interesting activities with one Harry Potter. But wait. Draco's into girls, right?

  (COMPLETE) Draco drinks a potion that makes him know if a person is lying, and Harry, apparently at fault that Draco is this way, is forced to 'help' him with the effects of the potion. For the first time, they deal with each other with no lies to hide behind. HPDM RWHG BZNL SSRL
