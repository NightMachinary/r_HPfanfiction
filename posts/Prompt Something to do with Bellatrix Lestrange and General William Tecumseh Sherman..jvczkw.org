I was just thinking how Sherman burned down Georgia and terrorized the South, while Bellatrix tortured innocents and terrorized the Wizarding World.

Don't know exactly what to do with it, but I thought the idea might be a good one.


** That's a ship I've never seen before. What do you call it, Willatrix?

*** Actually, scratch that. I just had an idea for something I could do with it.

So, there is this Alternate History scenario called A More Perfect Union, where two points of divergence cause the United States to be /extremely/ progressive and utopian. Like, to the point where slavery is abolished in 1839, the Civil War is fought over segregation, and there is a black President in 1876, followed immediately by a female President.

Anyway, essentially, what I was thinking of was writing a fic in this world, in which Bellatrix's ancestor hears Alexander Hamilton speak. Hamilton in this world is one of the primary causes for the divergence. He becomes convinced of Hamilton's 'Revolutionary Spirit' ideology, and convinces the Black Family to move to America.

Anyway, Bellatrix grows up surrounded by the Revolutionary ideology her ancestors espoused, eventually joining the US Army. The reason being that the Black Family has, ever since her ancestor moved the Family to the States, served in the Army, whilst keeping their magical status secret. She rises through the ranks and becomes a Major General during a conflict with a Neo-Ottomon Empire. Due to her scorched earth tactics, she is referred to by the press as 'The Second Coming of Sherman.'

***** Really? What do you like about it? I've kind of forgotten about this idea, actually. And my proposal is full of grammatical errors.

****** I'm not a huge fan of AUs because they're overwhelmingly, IMO, used as a device to smooth out the more problematic elements of canon characters (usually for the purpose of making natural enemies lovers or friends). The Coffee Shop AU genre makes me want to strap myself to the train tracks down the road. I think your proposed AU provides a fresh spin on Bellatrix without losing the spirit of her character.

Also, I have yet to find a fanfic that succeeds in moving the HP characters to America despite the fact that I imagine most fanfic authors are from the states. I have always wondered what a more fleshed out story in the US would look like. The Fantastic Beasts series provides some good starting points but not enough to easily build a world out of.

***** I kind of want to know, so I can understand why this idea might be appealing.

*** Whoops, at first I thought you meant ship is in vessel.

Not necessarily a ship, but just something involving them both. I think it would make an excellent Rap Battle. The man who made Georgia howl Vs. the woman who made muggles howl.
