:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
From what I remember (and I hope I'm not mixing things up) Hermione didn't find her parents back because they broke up while during the war, her being the reason why they hadn't. Harry leaves Britain (maybe temporarily) for Australia where he meets a muggle girl and they fall in love. Hermione tracks him down and they end up all together with a twist the muggle girl is Hermione's mother. Hermione finds out, doesn't tell Harry and erases her memory of this fact after setting up empty tombs for her parents

I can't find it anymore and I'm wondering if I imagined it. Does anyone know of it?

[EDIT] Thanks to karfoogie for finding it : [[https://a.rihaansfics.com/fanfic/not-what-i-was-expecting-by-seelvor]] And damn I didn't remember it with smut. Maybe I read a censored version


** This post was something of a rollercoaster ride.

*** ahah well the story sure was. I think it was not too long either. And I wanted to give as much info and at the same time I find it's a shame to spoil the twist.

*** That's the one thank you! Was wrong about Hermione obliviating herself... and it's New Zealand. Meh, can't get everything right.

I'm pretty sure it was on FFN at the time I read it (because I rarely read elsewhere).
