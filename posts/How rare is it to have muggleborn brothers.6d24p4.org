** To be fair, the books don't cover the lives of the other students very well. Or at all, really. They're almost entirely Harry-centric, and he doesn't seem to have very many friends outside Gryffindor.

If you assume that it happens at least one time in each house (minus, perhaps, Slytherin), you could say that it's 3 families per 7 years, at least. But that's an assumption with no facts to back it up.

*** Its fair to say he doesn't have many friends. You don't need to say outside Gryffindor. Other than Katie Bell and Cormac McLaggen can you name anyone in the year above from Gryffindor? Or in Ginny's year? We only know about Romilda Vane in the year below Ginny because she's a tad scary.

EDIT: Oh wait did you mean only one more year above? if you did.. uhh... hmm.

** Rowling has said it's genetic, so assuming it's a recessive trait you'd need for both muggle parents to have the gene and then for both siblings to get it from both parents.

Genetics is terribly complex, but if I remember bio 101 the most simplistic Baseline would be each sibling would have a 1 in 4 chance to be magical, or 1 in 16 collectively.

I should also say I hate the idea of it being genetic, and it's never explicitly stated to be genetic in canon, but that explanation makes the most sense.

*** In pottermore, it was stated that it comes from squibs (that married muggles only to have a muggleborn 3+ generations after).

***** Of course, the whole genetics angle is stupid when you consider all the species breeding going on. Hagrid, Flitwick, and Blast-Ended Skrewts should be evidence enough that Rowling's use of genetics as an explanation is inconsistent, and can probably be safely ignored in fanfiction.
