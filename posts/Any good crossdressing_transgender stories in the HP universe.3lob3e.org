Part 1 of what is currently a 3-part series. Cross-dressing fem!Harry who keeps it secret from almost everyone else (for good reason). Unbelievably good story, one of my favorites at the moment.

** Two Snape/Harry crossdressing fics, one for each of them. YMMV for the pairing, but the writers and the stories are excellent.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/515206]]) Full disclosure, I beta'd this fic. It's strangely beautiful, erotic, crude, and atmospheric. Note: it's also locked to AO3, so you need to be a member of the archive to read it.

linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/997569]]) This is more of a character study, with a fascinating, depressed, queer Snape and a lovely, warm, unashamed Harry.

Hmm, what did I do wrong links-wise? Is the bot unable to pull the information because one fic is archive-locked?

**** Hah! ENJOY. Apparently I'm here to balance the scales! I have enough Snape/Harry enthusiasm to compensate for all the detractors, and I'll even defend Snape's honor, such as it is. One great thing about the Snarry ship is the number of fantastic authors who have fallen under its spell. Yes, it could be nicknamed Ship WTF, but once you've acquired the taste, it's delicious. ;)

***** Oh yes, I absolutely agree!

There are so many truly excellent stories in the Snarry ship - I personally think it is because the majority of authors are adults or more "seasoned writers" and their works are truly well written. By nature their relationship is difficult to write and make realistic, so again, I think the authors that write for this ship generally take more effort and care to keep them in character without sacrificing their not-so-platonic relationship. And what again is interesting is seeing their (the characters) difference in years, experience, personality and view points. They're so different yet at the same time, they share similar traits.

So many stories for these two are absolute classics even without the Snarry tag and I am happy to see how many new stories live up to the well-written reputation.

Snape is my favorite character and I always defend him to the death while acknowledging his less than stellar traits. Of course Harry is my second love, so perhaps that is why I like them together as well. Besides, their interactions in the books always tend to steal the show especially with the increasing complexity of their relationship through the years.

Their dynamic is just so interesting and always makes for an excellent read - when written well!

** I just remembered another fic, although anyone easily squicked by slash and gender issues should save us all the trouble and stay away. The pairing is Severus/Sirius, and Snape is a trans!man. It's intense and absorbing and emotionally persuasive, although I confess I still felt a bit distant because I can't quite see Snape as trans. But Snape's gender dysphoria is handled with great attention and sympathy, and the writing is vivid, dramatic, and emotional. Also quite funny and sometimes lewd.

Here's a link to someone else's more in-depth review: [[https://localfreaksficrecs.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/harry-potter-rec-sexing-the-pumpkin-and-pumpkins-are-not-the-only-fruit-by-ratherbrightred/][rec for Sexing the Pumpkin]]

The story is only on LJ, as far as I know.

WARNING: the journal layout is BRIGHT RED (see also their LJ handle - truth in advertising!) and painful to the eyes. Be prepared to copy/paste or convert, because ouch.

ETA: corrected a typo. The redness must have addled my brain.
