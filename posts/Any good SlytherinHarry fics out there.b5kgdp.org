I have read some but find Harry so out of character in many - being super rude, entitled and becoming some sort of dark wizard - and they're just... not good. I don't mind Drarry at all (actually I would love that)

Anything to recommend?


** I think Lomonaaeren has several good Slytherin!Harry fics; one that I just read the other day (which is why it comes to mind) is Other People's Choices: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8835628/chapters/20258512]]

In it, Harry gets resorted Slytherin by the Sorting Hat during the Chamber of Secrets climax; while he definitely becomes more Slytherin, I don't think he becomes rude/entitled/dark.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
