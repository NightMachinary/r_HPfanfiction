I'm looking for stories wherein Sirius has a daughter which is the same age as harry. My only requirement for a fic is that Sirius' daughter becomes paired with harry in the end. I've read linkffn(Black Bond) and i enjoyed it a lot. I've read a lot more fics like this, but i can't seem to find more. TY in advance for your suggestions


** Only one I know of is the over worked headmaster but harry and Sirius' daughter or more like siblings and the new generation of a potter andna black turning the school on its ear

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
