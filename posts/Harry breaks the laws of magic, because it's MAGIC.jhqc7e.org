I never really liked how JK essentially made magic a form of science in the books. So i'm looking for any, and all stories where Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, OC, SI, whoever actually uses magic. I want magic to be this wonderous, limitless, beautiful thing. I want whoever the MC is(and maybe a bunch of others as well) to look at the "laws" of magic, throw their head back, and laugh. Whether it's learning how to talk to animals, and trees, riding dragons, becoming a dragon, creating food from nothing, flying unsupported, anything. My only requirement is that the story doesn't end after 20k words, or after only a year, or two at Hogwarts. I want a good, long story. I don't care if there are romantic relationships nor do I care if the pairing is M/M, M/F, F/F, M/creature(as long as it's not beastiality, the creature must have intelligence, and not be some bloody beastiality smut), whatever. Like I said, as long as it's long, and it is Magic!!!

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** the problem is a setting without rules generally makes the reader lose interest because if the charcter can pull any power out of his ass at anytime where is the tension.

Rules add structure to the universe, we know what characters can and can't do.

as fair as magic systems goes JK's is actually quite loose compared to most. there are plenty with fair more defined rules.

*** I'm not saying there shouldn't be a system, but it should be a system of growth. The MC can't pull powers out of his/her ass, but that the power itself doesn't really have limits beyond the pursuit of understanding, and knowledge. He/she couldn't just straight up fly, but with enough dedication to study, and power requirements, they eventually could. Magic should be limitless with possibilities, but you should have to learn how like any good magic system.

***** Yes, but not hard limits. Most good magic systems have limits that can be broken in the right circumstances with the right knowledge, because magic is in itself limitless. These soft limits exist, because you'd need a crap ton of power, or there's something missing that with it allows you to bypass it.

******* One, we don't actually truly know that. We're discovering whole new things about the universe everyday. Two, I don't f****** care. Like you yourself just stated, most settings have hard limits, but not the best. LOTR's magic system for example has no real defined hard limits. They just have different methods to achieve different goals. Most magic systems actually in general don't really have hard limits now that I think about it. They have forbidden branches, spells, and such, but give me just five decent fantasy stories that have hard limits. I'll wait.

******* Also, now that I think about it, why should I care about your opinion. I'm not asking you to write a story, nor am I asking you to stay here. What I requested here has zero bearing on you. Why do you care so much about what I want, and why are you in the HPFanfiction sub if you cared whether magic is real, or not. I'm not asking for a story based in the real world, i'm asking for a fantasy story. So 'magic is not real' means jack here. I feel like you're being obtrusive for the sake of it. Why?

** Well, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7866134/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Weasley-Seer][Weasley Seer]] all magic stems from belief, so the spell formulas, wands, "laws of magic".... it's all to stop wizards breaking the world with out of control reality warping.

** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/631214][the secret language of plants]] is a four part completed series. It takes a while but Harry develops a very unique form of magic that I haven't seen elsewhere. It is my favorite fic of all time.

I also recommend [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833?view_adult=true][Life skills outside the curriculum]] by the same author. Harry runs away before his Hogwarts letter comes and develops his own style of magic (different than previous). Absolutely love this one. It's complete and 66k words.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17040896][Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails]] is a oneshot and clocks in at 8k words but it is incredibly singular. I don't know that I've read anything similar and the less you know going in the better

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296][blood crest]] is a WIP that is still regularly updated. This delves into necromancy. It's dark and funny. I also loathe following works in progress (abandonment issues), but I make an exception for this one.

However, I think the best answer for your request is this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]]. The protagonist literally throws back her head and laughs at the laws of magic. This one is also a WIP that is still being updated.

I hope you enjoy!

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
