So, I have a fic idea bouncing around in my head. It's a retelling form the beginning of the series with a number of changes that don't actually affect the above question.

This is the scenario. Harry has just received his letter and succeeds in reading it before Vernon can make a run for it as he did in canon. Vernon decides that he can't let Harry go to Hogwarts and continue to live in his home. He knows the wizards will force the issue and he can't stop them. He decides that if the boy can't be found, Vernon can stop him both from attending school and living with them. He considers killing the boy but he's too cowardly for that. He decides that he can take the boy somewhere isolated and dangerous and leave him. He can tell anyone that comes looking, police or wizard, that Harry ran away. If Harry dies, problem solved. If he is found or finds his way home, hopefully it's after everything has blown over. Any tales Harry tells can be disputed as lies. That ground work has been laid for years.

My question is where in England can a panicked Vernon take Harry. If this were set in the US, I'd have him drop Harry off in a remote part of a national or state park. Is there any remote, dangerous place within driving distance of Surrey that would work?


** I don't think a national park is your answer.

Something I've noticed a lot of Americans have difficulty with is the concept of just how much smaller the UK is. For context, the biggest American national park is over 50 thousand square kilometres. In the UK, the biggest is about 4500 square kilometres - assuming it was a square, that'd be about 68 miles across. Even if you stuck the kid right in the middle of the biggest park we have and he could only walk five miles a day, it wouldn't take too long for him to get out. The only real dangers he'd face would be thirst, falling off cliffs, and getting lost - for more context, the statistically most dangerous animal in the UK is a cow. Wolves went extinct centuries ago, bears went even earlier, etc. Even a relatively unwise eleven-year-old would be at least mostly-likely to survive two weeks in the middle of a forest. Would definitely get parasites from drinking river water, but they'd survive.

So, yeah. Probably not an overly useful option. Especially if Wizards have any power or sense in your fic. Send him an owl, tell him to pick a direction and keep walking in it, and eventually they'll find him or he'll find the edge of the park.

A cave could work - they're a lot more mazelike and difficult to traverse (with bugger all in the way of edible things to find, unlike a forest) and a lot of them haven't been well-explored. If you backstory-ed that Vernon, in his... slimmer years, had encountered a particularly inescapable cave entrance, he could throw Harry down and let the kid go through a 'Descent' kind of scenario as he tries to find a way out.

The 'Terrify him and Leave him in the City' idea is also a good one. That way, even if he does get contacted, he'll be too scared to write back and will hide more.

I've been taking a similar start-up to one of the stories I'm writing, but I had them abandon Harry while on Holiday outside the UK, with the thinking being that the UK Magicals wouldn't have as much jurisdiction or reach/resources outside their area.

*** That's what I figured as far a deep forests go in the UK. My idea is for Hagrid to find him in a day or two. He'd be there long enough to get lost, get a minor if inconvenient injury, and see a magical creature or two. I have this image of Harry trying to avoid this large creature moving through the underbrush and it turns out to be Hagrid. The cave idea has merit. Are there a lot of natural caves in southern England? To Google! I swear my FBI agent is going to think I'm planning a murder in England.

**** If that's your idea, a national park is perfect. :)

There are lots of natural caves all over the UK! I've been to a couple of underground spaces in Surrey, but I did a quick google and there are a lot more natural and man-made spaces both in the area. I'm a big fan of Subterranea Britannica - it's a group that documents underground spaces - and I think they might have some useful resources for you, though I'm not sure how easy the site would be to navigate.

** Vernon thinks of Harry as a criminal in the making... ship him to Australia. "Should never have stopped in my opinion". If they set off on day one, they have a week or so to get there before Hagrid is sent, and you USED to be able to add children to an adult's passport (I was born in 93, and flew on my parents passport), on an unlaminated page you could doctor with a typewriter. So since Dudley would be on his parents passport they could add Harry to it, book a last minute flight to Oz, be there a day or two later, rent a jeep, buy lots of fuel, and off into the bush they go. And because I was watching it last week, I will point out that Crocodile Dundee moved back to the bush at the end of the sequel, in 88, so would be there for a crossover.

** Going by your other comments, the New Forest is probably your best bet. Bear in mind that if Harry is panicking and /or thinks Vernon will come back, he might not actually go very far or walk in circles so he can get very lost without traveling a great distance. Remember he is a small boy with no concept of surviving outdoors and no preparation, so it could still get very dangerous in just a few hours with exhaustion and hunger and thirst. That is before considering cold/rain and minor injuries/falls. Finally you could have him stumble one some sort of very wild magical segment which us muggles don't know about.

** If he wants Harry to die but doesn't have the stones to actually kill him... the little brook of death. [[https://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/11/bolton-strid-stream-that-swallows-people.html][Bolton Strid in Yorkshire]] appears to be only about six feet across, but if anybody falls into it, not even their bodies ever come back out. I first learned about this in an article (Bored Panda, maybe?) of beautiful places that make horrible vacation destinations.

And I just had a thought that this would be the perfect setting for a "portal to an alternate universe" fic.

** I live basically there, and we do have “Areas of Outstanding National (or Natural, I can never remember lol) Beauty” which are deemed too pretty or have too many endangered species to build on. You could have Vernon leave him there. I think I remember a fic like that- Fantastic Elves and Where to Find them- where Vernon drove to a forest pretending the whole family was going on a picnic and then left without him.

So you could leave him at the “Surrey Hills AONB” or if you want to go slightly further away to an even more remote place, the South Downs National Park would work too.

Or you could have Vernon put the fear of God into Harry about going to the authorities (e.g. “they'll put you in a juvenile delinquent prison or insane asylum” “no-one will believe you”) and just drop him off in any random city with a high population of homeless people where Harry would blend in, could even be London. Or Milton Keys has a high homeless population and is quite close.

*** South Downs is one I have looked at but I get the impression that it's pot-marked by small towns and the such. Is there enough unsettled land for Harry to wander for a couple days at least?

I'm trying to avoid the city idea. I've seen the Homeless Harry trope a few too many times. I also feel that Vernon would think it's too easy for Harry to find someone sympathetic in the city, police or wizard. After all that's the only place we know he's personally seen the "freaks".

**** There are some small towns but it's pretty isolated as far as England goes. You're not going to find anything more isolated around Surrey. I think he might be able to walk around for a couple days- there would've been fewer towns, roads and buildings around in the 1980s anyway. And you don't have to make your fic 100% true to real life lol, no one's gonna google Surrey national park and be like “ACTUALLY”

**** That's fine. I actually intend for Hagrid to find Harry in a day or two. On his birthday even. Vernon doesn't have the imagination to predict what specifically wizards can do to find Harry. He's thinking of wizards like mobsters. They show up, do unnatural things at people to get what they want, and leave.
