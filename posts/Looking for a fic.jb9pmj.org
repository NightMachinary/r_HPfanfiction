:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Does anyone know a fic from a few years ago?

One of the scenes I remember is that it turns out Fawkes wasn't actually a phoenix but something I believe was called an "Aguery" or something similar and Dumbledore had been placing painful transfigurations on it for years and its phoenix tears were black market tears he ran through an IV like thing to his eyes.

It sounds crazy when I type it out but I swear it was real and I REALLY want it

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
