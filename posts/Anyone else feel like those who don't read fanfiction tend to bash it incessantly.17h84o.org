Seriously. I hate those posts. Until J.K. Rowling writes another wizarding novel, I'm going to keep reading freaking fanfiction.


** People tend to criticize any subgroup they don't really have serious exposure to.

There's some pretty awesome fanfic out there. However, if you go looking, it's not hard to find some that's utter dreck.

What's important is that YOU enjoy reading what you're reading. People who want to bash it don't have to read it if they don't want to. Just ignore 'em.

*** Very true! And I appreciate good writing much more after I began reading and writing fic. It's okay to not like fic, but I think anyone bashing the idea of fanfiction itself - as long as the original author isn't against it - is rather narrow-minded.

** I'm a huge fan (in general) of people willing to take on the challenge of fanfiction, which is a whole different ball game than writing one's own fiction.

But even I'm guilty of being less than appreciative (to put it kindly) of fanfics I don't think are up to snuff...

edit - I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a difference between GOOD fanfiction and BAD fanfiction. I don't excuse bashing of the first, but I can at least see where the posts are coming from when it's poorly written in some way.

*** Oh absolutely. I love fanfiction -- by which I mean SOME fanfiction. The number of fics I've read through and enjoyed is completely dwarfed by the number I've started and rejected in disgust.

*** I think the thing, in general, is that fanfiction communities can support or even engender bad writing habits. Basically, people read the fanfic and like it, so they say so. Fair enough. An author gets enough of those and he or she may be unwilling to listen to any criticism, because it's the odd voice out that's saying anything bad. I have seen this happen a few times. So for people who read fiction and fanfiction, there /can/ seem to be a gap in writing skill.

But that's really just Sturgeon's law in action. Most of any group of writing is bad. I think that's just the particular reason for the most common forms of bad writing in fanfiction.

** I used to be embarrassed that I read fanfiction, like it was this awful dirty secret. Now I've stopped caring, my friends all know and make fun of me (in a nice way), and I make fun of myself, because sometimes it can be pretty silly.

But those who refuse to give it a try, or who mock it without even knowing what they're mocking, are just close-minded. There are some truly excellent authors out there. Not that anyone is obligated to enjoy reading fanfiction themselves, obviously, I couldn't care less if you do or don't -- just don't bash what you don't understand.

*** Exactly. I tend to get frustrated with these people because there are books out there that are literally giant best selling fanfiction. Take the book Scarlett which is widely accepted as the sequel to Gone With the Wind. Its a best seller and has movies and tv shows made off of it. Of course there are fanfictions like 50 Shades of Gray as well but there are some talented writers out there who can truly capture a character.

** I second (or third) that even if people give it a try, it is more likely than not they stumble into really..REALLY bad fanfiction, either poorly written, Harry/Draco Slash (with no buildup, just all of a sudden "Draco, its obvious that the tension beween us is sexual! Now take me you beautiful twink!") or both.

Even the good pairings can be done very badly, not to mention for every good HP Fic, there are several bad Twilight or My Chemical Romance fics.

Ladies and Gentlemen, its time to put the GOOD stuff you read into perspective, and be sure to review for the authors who don't suck so that maybe they will continue writing.

** It bothers me too, it's one of those "don't knock it until you try it" things and if you don't like it then fine. It's annoying being judged for wanting to continue something we love.

** No. I find that most people who don't read fanfiction don't talk about it at all - unless someone else brings it up first, in which case, yes.

** Well, quality of 99% of fanfiction is ridiculously low. But I really don't get people that waste their time on hating something or someone (in fanfiction I completely do not get all this bashing X stories, more general example - I know about Bieber only due to hordes of people that use their and mine time on bashing him).
