Looking for some fics to make up for the abuse my recent reads have dealt towards Hinny, what are your favs?

** KIndle (MUggle AU) by itsblissfuloblivian

California Dreamin' by jenorama (author began writing this series before JKR had finished her books - Ginny is a healer and Harry has left the aurors to become a teacher

Anything by gryffindormischief

Ginny Potter and Hell's Portal by Sarcasma (Ginny centric)

I need a Hero by Ellesar (incomplete but left at a point the main story was concluded, Ginny hunts vampires

** I'll mention [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][The Meaning of One]]. When I first looked at it, I was concerned that it would be too saccharine (soul bond that lets them share all their senses and thoughts and memories? Dubious). If you keep reading, though, you find that the author has properly challenged them. Yes, they have each other as emotional support all the time, but the level of intimacy granted by the bond drives a wedge through her family, as her parents and brothers each have to come to terms with her being effectively married at age ten - and her mother, in particular, cannot just shrug her shoulders and accept it. They're not caricatures, though, nor is it bashing; it's just complex characters struggling with a complex situation.

And then there's the issue of their combined magic being too powerful to safely use. They come within a hair's breadth of unintentionally reducing Draco to ash.

And they really don't cope if one of them is disconnected. Natural sleep is fine, but stunning, not so much. And petrification is very bad indeed.

** You read linkffn(backwards with purpose), I assume?

Linkffn(The Arithmancer) had some cute Hinny in it, it isn't central though

**** Does the bot only work if you capitalise the L? Let me try.

***** The bot has a problem with names in general at the moment. Often doesn't work if you add the author either, just gotta paste that URL in or at least the number in said URL.
