And are there any fics that explore this idea more in-depth, beyond Lily being Neville's god mother and Alice being Harry's?


** 1. It's common fanon that the house of Potter had some standing in the (not-canonically-existent, but that aside) wizarding nobility.
2. We know for a fact the Potters fought alongside Frank and Alice Longbottom in the original Order Of The Phoenix.\\
   This makes it logical that they were friends.
3. In the fanon Wizarding Nobility, heritage is super important - you don't become friends with a family that was enemies in the previous generation.\\
   Thus, they must have been allied families before.
4. Especially in a Weasley-bashing story, Harry needs a male friend that isn't Ron Weasley - so they talk up Neville as someone who wouldn't betray Harry ever because of some reason. A long-standing family alliance is an easy way to do that.

** The fact that they are pureblood families, both on the "light" side and the fact that giving Harry Neville instead of Ron and making Neville the perfect friend is very convenient. So lot of people don't stop there.

** Lily and James as well as Alice and Frank were in the Order too, so it's likely that they were friends.

** I know there are wizarding nobility stories that go into more detail on the alliance, but I can't think of them. I believe someone recommended one the other day where the Longbottoms were viking raiders that the Potters defeated and then showed mercy to or something, which began their alliance.

As for where the trope started its kind of a chain of fanon starting with the fact that canon Harry and Neville became friends later on and were both potential subjects of the prophecy as well as the fact that the Potters and the Longbottoms were both in the Order.

From there the fanon added on that they were godbrothers. Which implies a close familiar relationship. When wizarding nobility gets added into the mix there is the addition of formality. If your son is Heir to and Ancient and Most Nobly House, its a bit bigger of a deal who you choose as godparent. Which implies alliances. Even without the idea of Neville and Harry being godbrothers, Neville fought alongside Harry, which sets the precedence of a Longbottom fighting alongside a Potter, which lends well to the idea of an alliance, both politically and in the case of fighting.

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
