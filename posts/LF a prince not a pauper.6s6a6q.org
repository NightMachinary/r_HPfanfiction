Dumbledore left Harry with Petunia for safety and so he would grow up away from his fame. Petunia feared and hated magic so she treated Harry badly. What if the fear went the other way. What if Petunia and Vernon treated Harry like a prince because they feared the magic he would one day wield. How does Dumbledore deal with a entitled Harry who has the world handed to him on a silver platter? Any fics like this would be appreciated.

  The Dursleys eventually decided that they feared my dark presence more than Dumbledore's threats. They dropped me off at the orphanage, the firehouse, and deep in the wilderness. They even called Child Protective Services on themselves. Repeatedly. Yet I was always back by morning.

  I blame Dumbledore.

  I was five years old when Petunia Dursley realized that she would never be rid of me. I know this because she began sobbing while insisting that she would never be rid of me.

  Thick as they were, the Dursleys eventually realized that the only way to live unharmed was to accommodate my desires. It was the childhood I had always dreamed of.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** linkffn(Harry Potter: Hero of the Wizarding World? by JK Pratchett) does something along these lines, IIRC.

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.
