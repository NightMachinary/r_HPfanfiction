** I think that all spells classified as Dark Arts are illegal in Magical Britain.

What classifies as Dark Arts? I have no idea.

It can't be just "spells that cause harm", because otherwise much of the curriculum at Hogwarts would not be taught at all for being "Dark Arts". It has to be something deeper and precise than that. The next steap from the "cause harm" would be to say that they're spells that *only* cause harm - that have no other purpose. But then the Boogey-Bat Hex would be dark in nature, as well as the Tripping Hex. While the harm is not immense, their purpose is still nothing but to harm.

My personal headcanon in this matter is that "Dark Arts" are by their nature either psychologically or even physiologically addictive, while being designed only to cause harm, assert unquestionable dominance or pervert some rule of nature.

*** JKR actually does classify all magic that causes harm as dark magic, with even minor jinxes called "[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_charms][dark charms]]."

Sorry, but I find the trope that dark magic is addictive to be annoying because there's no canon evidence for it, and it only seems to serve to make characters who dabble in it out to be worse people. My headcanon is that there is a second, narrower definition of dark magic, which is magic that is /corrupting/. Things like the Unforgivable Curses requiring actual malice to cast or the magics Voldemort dealt in transforming his appearance even before his first death.

**** I mean addictive in a sense like cheat codes in a game are addictive. Once you use them, the rush of power - this crazy drug called dopamin - you gain over the opponent is something you want more and more and more of. I cannot imagine how addictive an Imperio would be. It would probably far supersede the addictive power of a bit of a emotion-manipulating spell. I don't really have an example for a spell to be physiologically addictive, like an actual hard drug, but I didn't want to exclude the possibility.

I use this feeling of fleeting power as this threshold to what is and isn't "dark magic" in a legal sense. Its interesting that some form of dark magic is taught at all - or at least not restricted. Thanks for that link.

***** I always felt the dark arts were addicting because you have to touch darker emotions to cast them.

The more you tap into anger, hatred, etc, it becomes easier and thus more powerful making you rely more on this magic. Eventually you are constantly on edge.

****** That's the sense I get from it, too. The dark arts are the spells fuelled by rage and hate and vindictiveness, all things that are, in human psychology, terribly habit-forming. Not quite forever-will-it-dominate-your-destiny, but the more you indulge, the easier it gets to become a truly unpleasant person to be around.

And because such emotions are easy, especially under threat, they're the go-to shortcut to power. Impossible to make truly illegal, but Everyone Knows that dark arts users are all raging arseholes.

*** I think it's a tautology: Dark Arts are spells that have been declared illegal, so all Dark Arts are illegal.

** They're not illegal in general. Borgin and Burkes is a legal business and is said to have a patronage numbering in the hundreds despite being known to deal (almost exclusively) in Dark objects. Outside of the Unforgivables (and experimental creature breeding, e.g. Basilisk), Dark magic doesn't appear to be unlawful at all. Attacking other wizards with it would definitely be illegal, but that would be because it's assault or attempted murder, I presume.

** Personally, I think the Confundus charm should be classified as a hex, but it's far too useful for the Light-aligned characters to be acknowledged as Dark magic. So, no. Definitely not. There are all sorts of nasty spells that Hogwarts students are casting that don't appear to be legally restricted in any way.

** It might be that Dark Arts classify spells that require malicious intent to cast. For example, /Wingardium Leviosa/ has the *possibility* of being used to maim or kill but can be used in other, "good" ways. Meanwhile, /Crucio/ has the sole intent of causing pain and requires the malicious intent to cast, thus is classified as Dark Arts.

Thus, Dark Arts could all be classified as illegal with varying punishments for the "degree" of darkness.

*** I remember a fic that had the great idea that crucio was actually the corruption of a spell used in medical resuscitation. It would give a short burst of activity in all the nerves of the body in an attempt to kickstart the organism back into woking condition.

I think that the idea of all dark spells being the corrupted version of "normal" spells is a great one. You could also imagine spells that were first created to be "dark" in intent being modified for other use or as a counter to other dark spells. I think it was in /I'm Still Here/, by kathryn518, where the MC uses a controlled blood boiling curse to counter a blood freezing one (or the opposite, can't remember).

Anyway I like the "two side of the same coin" kind of argument, where it's all really about the intent.

** They are. That's how the Ministry's classification scheme works. If a spell is classified as Dark Arts it is outlawed.

This has only tangential bearing on the actual spell in question being dark or harmful.
