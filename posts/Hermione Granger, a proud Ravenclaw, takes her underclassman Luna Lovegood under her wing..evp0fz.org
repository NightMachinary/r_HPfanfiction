** I've wanted to see this premise for years; but I'll even settle for the "Hermione Granger, a proud Ravenclaw". There are practically no fics in which Hermione is in Ravenclaw and actually likes it there, unless she's sorted there alongside a Smart!Harry who does all the actual Ravenclawing.

**** Thanks for the recommendation! I think I've seen it before, but I was turned off by the "lonely and friendless" bit in the summary. This is exactly what I am talking about when I say that there are practically no fics in which Hermione is in Ravenclaw and actually likes it there. She's basically in a holding pattern of misery and uselessness until (in order of frequency), Harry, Bellatrix, or Ron comes to her rescue.

On your recommendation, I'll give the fic a try.

***** She is lonely and friendless before she befriends The Trio (or The Duo), yes. So, yes, you don't get much of the inner workings of the Ravenclaw house, if that's what you are after. For that I really prefer my preferred NextGen linkao3(373224).

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

****** I'll take a look. Meanwhile, I tried to like the Ravenclaw!Hermione fic. I honestly did. But, it's exactly how I had expected it to be. Pretty much nothing happens that didn't already happen in canon, and the only effect of sorting Hermione into Ravenclaw was to make her all nice and passive. It seems like a weird extrapolation, but whatever floats the author's boat, I guess.

******* I have to admit I don't like non-canonical sortings much. It's better just to take somebody who actually is a Ravenclaw and create story for him/her. One of stories I really miss it being finished is linkffn(11858501). Although, HP/Avengers crossover ... bleh, just say no. Perhaps it is better it has not been finished.

  The Battle of Hogwarts took many lives, and left many scars. In the wake of tragedy, one young witch searching for answers and healing finds a new beginning on a path that could lead to her ruin, or her salvation. A prequel to my upcoming Harry Potter/Avengers crossover story 'Not a Hero'.

** I've started writing this... Here's what I've got so far...

Hermione Granger could have belonged to any of the houses, really.

She was determined to be the best, and she knew how to make the most use of her available resources which fit in with the Slytherin ideals. Only she didn't really consider people to be a resource, and her level of self preservation was perhaps too lacking for that house.

She dearly wanted to be brave and popular, and she had a stubborn, mulish quality that would do well in Gryffindor. She had her own lofty ideals that fit in with that house's sense of chivalry.

She was deeply distressed by unfairness and held justice highly on her list of values. Her past successes had been largely due to the amount of effort she put into her endeavours. Like a good Hufflepuff.

Those endeavours were largely academic. She loved knowing and learning anything and everything. She also loved the written word and how a person could turn a phrase to give it multiple meanings. She remembered a tutor telling their student at the library once 'So, Romeo, he's sitting under a sycamore tree, syc amore, sick with love because of his pining over Rosalyn' and she was hooked.

She loved research, and figuring out the cryptic crossword in the newspaper with her dad. She loved watching documentaries with her mum. She loved going to museums, and galleries, and guided tours of crumbling monuments with both her parents on holiday.

And she loved planning, and thinking, and dreaming, and imagining, and 'learning about learning' as an old teacher had told her. She loved taking the personality quizzes in teen magazines, even though she they were pseudoscience (she learned that she was the take charge type of her friendship group). She loved taking the personality tests with her therapist who also taught her how to deal with bullies and a fear of failure (as well as acknowledging one's strengths).

And after all that introspection the hat said, 'Well, Miss Granger, I know where you will thrive, it's tough to remember sometimes, but Rowena knew that there is much more than just knowledge needed for true wisdom. Keep that in mind because you are perfect for RAVENCLAW!'

Perfect, she beamed as she ran up to the applauding table, I'm perfect for somewhere

*** Not really. Or at least, not where I live - I grew up in the North and hit the lower years of secondary schooling in the mid 2000s. I think. My only vivid memory from back then was being young enough to be scared by the Empty Child when Doctor Who first came back.

We might call them 'lower years' and 'upper years', I suppose, but it never really came up as a student. If you're pretentious you might call them the 'lower forms' (vs the 'upper forms'), but that's a tad archaic these days outside of places like Eton and Harrow.

*** English doesn't really have words for someone who is above/below another person in grade/form. Japanese has「先輩」 /senpai/ and 「後輩」 /kouhai/ which describe this type of relationship, and they are usually translated as "upperclassman" and "underclassman", but it's not an ideal translation, since those English words tend to describe absolute class/grade/form rather than relative.

Maybe "Hermione Granger, a proud Ravenclaw, takes Luna Lovegood, one grade her junior, under her wing."?
