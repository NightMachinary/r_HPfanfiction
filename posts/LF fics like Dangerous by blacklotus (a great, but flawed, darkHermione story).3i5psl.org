Once you get past the premise, [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]] is a brilliant post-DH dark!Hermione fic that is rather well-written, unexpectedly sexy, and unrelentingly interesting. A short summary: After 10 years of minimal contact, Harry returns to a wizarding Britain where Hermione is a terrorist (a violent dark lord with a muggleborn following), muggleborns are openly attacked, and peace and reconciliation are further than ever. I like a number of its elements (and am looking for stories that have them): Hermione is actually brilliant, but scary; there's a dissection of the often skewed nature of Hermione's friendship with Harry and Ron; there's an exploration of socitial prejudice and violent resistance, as well as the consequences of many things casually mentioned and rapidly forgotten in book 7 (muggleborns in Azkaban; student's being tortured in Hogwarts). The world is bleak and the author holds few punches. Naturally, as it is with fics that center around any particular character, Hermione is too smart, and the past a bit too conveniently explicated to her advantage - though, in the later chapters Harry does begin to counter that narrative.

So, essentially, looking for fics like this. Ideally, H/Hr or at least not Hr with Draco/LM/Severus, as seems to be the norm with fics that explore the darker aspects of Hermione.

Ps. I'm familiar with Applied Cultural Anthropology


** This is the best darkish Hermione fic I've read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11085189/1/The-Two-Body-Problem]]

*** Excellent story! Thank you for recommending. (The only bad moment was the random mention of how *Powerful* Harry is, even though it has literally no plot relevance to the story.)

** This story deserves more mention in this sub. It's atop my all-time favourite fan fiction list. The characterisation is great and the story made me ponder a lot about events in canon. Unfortunately I think Applied Cultural Anthropology is probably the closest comparison. I may have seen a few other Dark Lady Granger stories but none of them really stands out (unless you count a few in which Hermione pairs with Tom Riddle)

*** I wouldn't say the characterization is, erm, good exactly. It's a very interesting story - after you suspend quite a bit of disbelief. Harry's decade long hiatus is utterly unbelievable, for example, and the narrative Hermione spins about the past is exceedingly one-sided - and way too uncharitable towards Ron. I love the fact that Hermione began to have doubts in the later chapters, and that Harry was not as useless as he initially seemed, but unfortunately the story was abandoned before it developed that very much. Still, even given these problems the world this author has created is fascinating, and esp. the relationship between the two (H & Hr). It reminds me another story (You have always Believed in Me (which, btw, given Ron a far better narrative)) in the way that Harry tries to get to relate to her in way eerily similar to one the ones this Harry adopts.

**** Hmmm, I think we may have interpreted the actions taken in this story a little differently.

I have always seen Harry as someone who could be traumatised by the War, and he can be very bad at acknowledging other people's pain. I see his leaving as the 'moment he snapped'. Life is not fair, and I could not blame him for not staying. It was not like he spent 10 years doing nothing either.

As for one-sided narrative, that is Hermione's problem, not the story's problem. Hermione is a very judgmental character in canon (see Luna and general bossiness), and it's probably her greatest character flaw. Her view of the past is definitely one-sided, and in that regard it is as bad as Harry's inability to acknowledge other people. If Harry's effort to end Voldemort is just for revenge (Hermione's word), then Hermione's Nova is also a revenge act (Harry's word) as well. It is not unrealistic to see Malfoy and co. got free, and Hermione's hopelessness can easily twist into anger as it had in this story. She was also egged on by other mad Muggleborns (Hannah, Justin, Penelope, etc), and her revolutionary side seemed to gradually see their points as nothing changed.

I think the story does a fairly okay job to not portray Ron as a villain. Yes, Ron would have trouble truly understanding the Muggleborn issue (similar to Arthur's egalitarianism), and in his own POV the decision to stay put is justifiable. Unfortunately, for Hermione inaction meant supporting the enemy, and she began to blame Ron more and more as she got angrier. Revolutionaries tended to see the world as us against them, and Hermione's case is no exception even though Ron is pretty much not 'them'.

If canon is interpreted more cynically, I think this story would be pretty realistic of how things could go. The story made me see Hermione's canon actions in new light, and it wasn't a light one. I agree with Hermione that Harry and Ron had not acknowledged her as much as they should have, but that does not mean lumping them with the enemy is justified. Like you said, I think the author abandoned the story at just the wrong point, at which they began to counter Hermione's narrative with a more objective view which would have made the story more believable for many. It is a cynical interpretation, yes, but it is not unrealistic.

Maybe it's the language, but this story will stick with me for a long time, especially Andromeda's line on love and hate and Snape's one on blind fools.

Oh, and can you give the link for You Have Always Believed in Me? I would love to try that one.

Aside from the excellent H/Hr, I love Ron in this one.
