Hi!I'm looking for Harry Potter fanfictions that can be considered as canon, so not oppose any information from the original books and other details by Rowling (I do NOT considere the Cursed Child as canon), and takes place in the past, medieval ages, dark ages, something like that. Could be stories of the Founders, or totally original characters being put in a historical time period in the Wizarding World.Oh, and preferably: a finished story, completely readable.\\
Something that expands the Wizarding World's history and it's magic, but still loyal to the laws Rowling layed in her world.


** Hi! I have two for you. Both Founders stories.

*Strange Visitors* is a story where the trio go back to the Founders Era. Its good! Theres a good mystery, a lot of backstory, Salazar is very interesting. Both parties learn a lot. There's not a whole lot of detail regarding the era aside from 'The food is weird' but the story and plot itself is really enjoyable. I haven't finished it yet but I'm liking it! There's only 1 chapter left which i assume will be posted in the next few weeks since the last chapter was posted at the start of the month. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887/chapters/918771]])

​

*Of A Linear Circle* is a series that is super big with a lot of emphasis on being real to the world and time period and everything else. Aside from the main plot which is set in OoTP time and about Snape, they have side-stories just about the founders that can be read alone. These are brilliant and are a real learning experience about different cultures and languages and royalty and how that all works. Its incredible. Part 3 is Harry going back to Founders Era. Kinda the same plot as Strange Visitors but waay more focus on the time differences of being in 996 (and in my opinion better tbh). Way more realistic and i just love the characterisations so much! The magic is all the same but bigger and better and better explained. Cannot recommend enough! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114/chapters/26156739]])

  Harry Potter's fifteenth birthday starts off just like all the others...for the first few seconds, at least. The gift he receives changes his entire life.

** It's not exactly what you are asking for but it's one of my favourites in the 'historical fiction' subgenre. I personally feel it maintains a relatively canonical feel about it's magic and tone.

It's got a bit of time travel too, between the Iceni revolt of A.D. 60 - 61, and the present day.\\
I'm not sure what else to say without spoiling too much. It is completed and the writing and grammar and the historical basis is solid.

** There are too few of them, and even less which are not just stupid transformation of a generic Dramione story to the past.

  Long before the Statute of Secrecy, when Kings still sought counsel from wizards and scholars debated magic at the great centres of learning, England seethed as her nobles struggled to check the power of the King -- and one young friar found his new path taking an unexpected turn.
