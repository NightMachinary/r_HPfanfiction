Usually when Harry has all these lordships and power he does as he pleases and has a great time. Is there anything where its not all it seems to be. Perhaps he was raised by Salazar Slytherins ghost but worked tireless all day everyday and didn't have much of a child hood. All his lordships put pressure on him and take ip time to maintain, business ventures go wrong and he is opposed every step of the way.

Basically something where everything he has comes at a cost much like his fame, he'd probably understand Dumbledore a lot because of it too.

The Methods of Rationality. He's pretty much a genius kid at the start and finds all the tricks to become over powered. The fun begins as you find out his enemies are also buffed to an insane level. Just keep in mind that it's not a parody, even if it seems like that at the beginning.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

** linkffn(Charon) He's among the richest wizards alive, could cause major waves on the Wizengamot, and reaches bogeyman status on an international level. He's also obsessed, emotionally stunted, socially inept and described as "killing for the sake of killing" at one point.
