Premise:

In the lore of Dark souls, there is a curse that afflicts humans with undeath. It's not the zombie kind...well not yet anyway. The curse of undeath makes you hollow: a 'human' that has lost its purpose and mindlessly attacks anyone craving for it. Now to become hollow, one must die repeatedly, only to be reborn near a bonfire.

The bonfire is a sort of check point in the game. It brings back the 'Bearer of the Curse' to life. It's like a becon to them.

In addition, when 'the bearer of the curse' dies, they leave a perpetualy wet bloodstain wherein all the 'unused' or unsynthesized souls are. In order to get those souls back the cursed one will have to travel to the point where they died and touch that stain.

In the first Dark Souls game the bearer of the curse used the bonfires in other to synthesize or 'level up' using the bonfire. In the sequel, Dark Souls 2, a person called the Emerald Herald or Shanalott levels them up.

Now the main character of the game possesses the Dark Soul. Its soul, once it defeats and enemy, takes in its essence in order to become stronger whether it be physically or mentally stronger. The souls can also enhance the speed of the bearer of the Dark Soul.

Now you might be wodering where I'm going with this. The paragraphs above is just the basic gameplay of the dark souls franchise. I thought what if someone other than me could combine the two? I would attempt to do so, but I've got the sickness called 'i can't finish anything I start'. Here's my thesis statement for this story:

Potter's 'Power-he-knows-not' is him being afflicted with the curse of the undying wherein even though he's morally against killing, he needs to do so in order to match the powerhouse that is voldemort.

It's not a concise thesis but meh.

I don't know if writing prompts are allowed in the subreddit but just comment if it isn't and i'll take this down. If you have any questions or suggestions that would polish this up, kindly leave a comment.

Eit: not sure if this is a suggestion or a request. But i'll flair it under suggestion for the time being.


** A great idea, but would be a huge undertaking for any fanfiction writer due to the nature of having to kill in the HP universe and having sufficient knowledge of dark souls lore (which is very broad and is nowhere near encapsulated in your brief description). The alternative would of course be to send Harry to the dark souls verse, but would perhaps lose it's HP flair upon doing so...

*tl;dr*

It's damned hard to write good crossovers, even more so a Dark Souls one.

*** Exaclty! This idea has been stewing in my head for a couple of months now, and since I've read Shaydrall's the Merging it's been giving me plot bunnies.

But with a busy schedule and me having the disease of not finishing stuff, i doubt this will come out as a full fledged story. Have i missed some important details in my quick basics of 'what is Dark Souls?'

**** Upon rereading your description of Dark Souls, I think you've brilliantly summarized the basics of Dark Souls progression, which may lead to others writing a "gaming/rpg-progression" based fic as opposed to a fic that captures the bleak, yet driven atmosphere that Dark Souls has. I think your "quick basics" could note that the vague-backstory to the dark souls protagonist, and the relatively rogue-like feeling to exploration in dark souls (on your first or second runs) are intentional, and that you could make direct references to various points in the game that would make it clear why a Dark Souls crossover would be so appealing.

Otherwise, a great idea that would require quite a bit of research and effort in its undertaking. Apologies for my long-winded explanations... :/

*tl;dr again*

I write incredibly long replies and your description is only missing direct references interspersed with some insight into Dark Soul's unique atmosphere.

***** That's why I only gave the basics. The prompt was supposed to superinpose the lore of the game to the HP universe.

I guess this would be applicable to an after Voldemort scenario if you want the desolate atmosphere.

*** I have a lot of HP knowledge, and I like to think I know a lot more than the average player's DS lore knowledge. Unfortunately I can't write for shit.

**** Additional DS lore would be solved by watchig Vaati's speculation videos on youtube.

I would link you guys but it's a pain in the ass on mobile.

Off topic: i need to edit the promt. I've reread it and it's chuck full of grammar errors.
