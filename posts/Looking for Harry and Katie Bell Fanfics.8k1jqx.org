** I've been through most of the ones on ff.net and there really aint much there. Katie seems like she should be a popular pairing, one year older, unknown/vague background, share sports team.

Instead they all get written as tonks/fleur/daphne for all your older/unknown desires.

*** When I planned out "No longer alone", I had her as love interest initially. But for some reason, I didn't find that ship particularly interesting for fourth year, at least unless you want to go with "she was the only one who believed Harry". In my headcanon, Katie simply fits better as best friend.

You can make an argument for any of the chasers, but because they are older, and, more importantly, more mature, it wouldn't be a balanced relationship. I mean, if you look at OOTP, Angelina appears more mature than Tonks, who is four/five years older.

**** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6i2ejc/katie_bell_vs_angelina_johnson_vs_alicia_spinnet/dj34tvc/?context=3][Going off on the differences between the Chasers, I'm inclined to agree. A Katie/Harry ship is possible, and I wouldn't consider it unbalanced necessarily, given that Katie is about the same age as Cho, but her overall friendlier personality fits better as a good friend.]]

** Enjoyed this one, although like most things it hasn't been finished: linkffn(8830313)

I'm pretty sure A Stranger in the Promised Land was going in that direction, but, again, unfortunately it's long abandoned.

  Katie Bell's fifth year should have been simple, without even Quidditch to distract her from OWL exams. But an unexpected romance brings the Tri-Wizard Tournament close to home, and pulls her into the ugly side of the magical world.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
