There was a fic I read a long time ago where the Potters lived next to the Weasleys and Harry grew up with Ron and Ginny. Harry acts a lot like a younger James and is a bit of a manwhore, but he and Ginny eventually get together.

Also, it's not "A Different Life", but similar premise. Thanks in advance!

**** I know the fic you are talking about...but I forgot the author like you did.

I'll go looking for it. IIRC it was 320k words or so long.
