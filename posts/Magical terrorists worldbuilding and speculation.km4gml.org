In our world some crazy people fly planes into buildings or fill trucks with explosives.

What are methods that decently skilled wizards (no Voldemort level dark curses) could use to inflict as much damage as possible, and what are things the magical governments could do to stop them?

For example, the wizarding governments might have some people keeping an eye on the world's nuclear weapons just to make sure there's nobody with an invisibility cloak sneaking in and stealing some.

The floo network might have systems built in to prevent someone from sending someone else a very explosive package, whether chemical, nuclear or magical.

I wonder if wizard space travel is possible, would they have something in place to prevent someone from sending an invisible asteroid on a collision course with London at 50000 km/h? Because I could totally imagine someone (named Marco) doing that.

Please discuss. I'm trying to figure out what certain details of the magical world might look like, given a pessimistic/realistic view of human nature.


** First thought is Mandrakes. You could mass kill a lot of people by setting off mandrakes in Times square or similar.

Most XXXX or higher magical creatures could be counted as severe threats depending on your head canon on how well they would hold up to muggle weaponary. Dragons, Basilisks, Nundu, all are known to need at the least a team of specially trained wizards to deal with, ranging up to regiments of them with expected casualties.

Again depending on how you apply other magics to the world, but in some magical systems (specifically D&D) putting an expanded space inside an expanded space can result in exponentially large matter annihilation areas of effect. So setting up some of them on time delays would get through nearly all protections because expanded spaces are just things that all magicals use so nobody would protect from them sombody carrying a trunk and a bag.

Then for the more subtle, mind control and memory wipe exists in the HP universe. You can control muggles into doing anything for you. Or even just take thier place using polyjuice. That means that the leader of any given muggle country country could only be a few imperio's away from being in your control with all their weapons at your disposal. We saw that it was a called out detail that Kingsley infiltrated onto the protection detail of the UK Prime Minister, so its possible that it was an abnormal situation and that there is not normally a magical protecting from that kind of control. Or it could just be that it was called out because it was a member of the order. It depends how ignorant and seperate of the non magical world you want the magical world to be i suppose.

*** I think mandrakes probably have commonly known and available countermeasures. Against muggles a similar effectiveness as a bunch of poison gas, against wizards a good chance of zero casualties. So not much more effective than what muggle terrorists can do.

Dangerous creatures are probably very difficult to get. There's a black market but acquiring a grown up dragon would require a very difficult heist at a reserve or several years of raising it in secret. And a team of skilled dragon handlers could be apparated in pretty quickly as soon as the attack is noticed. In the modern age, the magical world can deal with dragons much more easily than in medieval times. Probably not too feasible as an attack.

I don't think putting one magical bag into another would be too dangerous. Hermione made an extended bag so it's likely that it's a well known thing that plenty of people use, and plenty of people also use extended tents. There'd be VERY big warning signs on those tents if magically extended spaces caused dangerous interactions. The DnD logic is really broken, makes it way too easy to make reality tearing weapons.

As for attacking muggle leaders, the top government officials probably have some level of wizard security. The British PM had Kingsley, he probably a less high ranking auror in peace time, and the American president probably has several top wizards in the Secret Service. Putin and Xi and Kim are probably similar.

Nukes are probably controlled too, perhaps magically sabotaged in a way that's only reversed for planned tests. It wouldn't be too difficult to transfigure a wire into non conducting plastic, and it'd make a proper explosion impossible unless someone knew exactly which wire needed fixing. It may be possible for a wizard to use magical methods of refining uranium to construct their own nuke, but that'd require several years of studying physics, not something wizards are likely to do.

Someone could imperius a general to do a conventional missile strike, but without a good reason and without confirmation from the very top, it's likely that the order would not be obeyed and the general would be declared insane.

Stealing conventional muggle weapons is likely still possible as it'd be too manpower intensive to magically guard all muggle military bases, but those wouldn't be too effective against wizards.

Destroying muggle infrastructure, sure possible. Would harm muggles but not wizards. If wizards figure out that a wizard was behind it they might even magically rebuild it just as quickly.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** This is overly complicated and depends on some stuff that isn't in the books, but it should be possible as long as portkeys conserve momentum.

Step 1: enchant something heavy as a repeating portkey. Step 2: use runes to make it activate when it gets within a certain distance of the sun. Add an alternative destination (a target on earth), and a way to switch destinations on the fly. Step 3: set the destination to somewhere just inside the Oort Cloud, outside the plane of the elliptic so it doesn't collide with any large debris on its repeated freefall. Step 4: activate the portkey for the first time, and let it fall inwards towards the sun.

Once it gets close enough to the sun, it will activate again and appear at the start of the loop, but instead of being at a standstill, it will be moving at the same speed as it was at the end of loop 0.

Every time the portkey activates and moves to the Oort Cloud again, it will be moving at a greater and greater speed. Enough loops, and you have an RKKV, which is where the alternate destination from step 2 comes in handy. Once the destination is switched, the portkey of mass destruction will impact the target as soon as it finishes its current gravitational acceleration loop.

Of course, you could just use the imperius to get someone to launch an ICBM, but magical governments have probably made plans to deal with that kind of thing. For example, planting portkeys on every nuclear missile, with somewhere in deep space as the destination.

*** I think if portkeys allow travel between different sides of the planet (which move in different direction due to the earth's rotation) it means that portkeys don't conserve momentum. The destination probably contains a location, velocity and orientation to make sure that people arrive with the heads facing up and standing still.

**** AFAIK, the books don't really show transcontinental portkey travel. I assumed the coriolis force was the reason portkey travel was so uncomfortable. In the Goblet of Fire movie, when Harry lunges for the triwizard cup to escape the graveyard, it shows him arriving at hogwarts while still skidding forward. That means movie!portkeys do conserve momentum.

** Wingardium Leviosa. Levitate a large block from a construction sight and drop it in Diagon Alley, anywhere in London or other busy cities.

Fiendfyre. It's illegal but it works.

Other ways to inflict damage include: Killing high people on government.

Method? Scrougify. Let everyone choke on bubbles.

** Cast Fiendfyre and portkey, etc out. But not just on one location. Imagine a guy sets off a cursed flame in one location, then has a collection a expanded trunks portkeyed into every major population center with a spark of Fiendfyre in them.

There was even a fic I read somewhere where Voldemort had set up a 'if I die, so does everyone else' contingency where he had rune arrays using the world's ley-lines to cast fiendfyre on a world-ending scale if he died.
