** - Your paragraphs are way too large. Three/four sentences per para for exposition, one/two for dialogue. Otherwise the eyes get tired. Line space between dialogue lines for the same reason.

- Think a bit about sentence structure too. You have long sentences filled with commas and clauses, which get a bit tiring to read. Try removing clauses that are useless, or could be revealed later. Dashes help break up the monotony.

- Daphne Greengrass is all but an OC. The reader has no reason to care about her, so it's tedious when Eyan constantly worries about her. You also didn't make us care much about Eyan either -- we should be sharing in his frustrations, fears and anger, and elective choices don't really do that for us.

- Snakes don't have dens.

  There they came, *the* Hogwarts first years of 1991, looking about as nervous as a dog finding out they're going to the vet instead of the park.
#+end_quote

This is a poor simile. It's too long winded and also not particularly useful. Were the first years surprised when they got to Hogwarts, like a dog would have been at the vet? Probably not.

#+begin_quote
  As Eyan Greengrass observed the worried faces, he quickly made eye contact with the older of his two younger sisters, Daphne. He noticed that she looked even paler then usual. He shot her an encouraging smile, +hoping it would make her feel more at ease+.
#+end_quote

The last part is already implied by the encouraging smile, it doesn't need to be explicitly stated.

#+begin_quote
  She hesitantly returned his smile +with her own+, before being distracted by the girl standing next to her. Eyan continued to scan the first years, or *firsties*, as he heard some of the *Gryffindors* call them mockingly, for the supposed "Boy Who Lived". The rumour that Harry Potter would be attending the prestigious Hogwarts *S*chool of *W*itchcraft and *W*izardry starting this year spread through the +school+
#+end_quote

train? hall? They have barely arrived at the school.

#+begin_quote
  even faster then Eyan thought +was+ possible, and he had to admit he was quite interested in what the boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was like.
#+end_quote

New Paragraph

#+begin_quote
  "Greengrass, Daphne!" *H*earing *Professor* McGonagall call out *his* sister*'s* name snapped him out of his musings. She walked towards the stool, head held high, +seeming to have gained back+ *gaining back* some of her confidence +after getting awestruck by the Great Hall along with the other first years+.
#+end_quote

This is very clunky.

#+begin_quote
  After only a few seconds of contemplation the Sorting Hat shouted: "Slytherin!". The house of snakes clapped loudly for her, presumably happy a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight got added to their house. While he clapped for her, and even gave her another smile when she quickly glanced at him before making it over to the Slytherin table, Eyan had to admit to himself that his heart sank a bit further in chest seeing her walk away from him.
#+end_quote

And this is just the first paragraph. There are a lot of errors in this. Simple ones that can be easily fixed. First of all, learn how to use apostrophes. When and where they're acceptable, and where they are not needed. After direct speech, another punctuation mark is not needed if there's a sentence-ending one in the brackets. Some minor spelling errors too.

After every paragraph you write (they are all far too long) go back and read through it. Anything you think is redundant, delete it. Anything you think sounds clunky, redo it.

There are some parts when you miss out words. Usually articles, like "the" and "a". It's as if you're writing in the way that you speak. That makes for bad writing.

There are quite a lot of Americanisms in this. Most of them aren't major (other than "vacation") but they are noticeable. Things like "Morning to ya fellas," and "I *so* look forward to having Care of Magical Creatures without you Greengrass." I do appreciate that these will be very hard to pick up on for a non-Brit so don't worry about them too much.

I'm not much good at analysing plot, but this seems like a reasonable chapter to set the scene. A minor point. Thirteen year old boys don't flirt with eleven year old girls. They just don't.

Hope this helps :)

Some actually do, but they are usally called out for it by other boys
