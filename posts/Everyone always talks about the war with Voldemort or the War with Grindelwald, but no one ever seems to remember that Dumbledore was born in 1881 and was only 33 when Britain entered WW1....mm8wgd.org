What was the FIRST world war like for Wizards and Witches? Did they do their part? What did they think of this jump from simple muzzle loaded warfare to the horrors of the modern age of warfare? Was there a Dark Lord... Or did the people simply have to come to terms with the fact that muggles had finally surpassed them in destructive power?


** I think that might have been the last moment when wizards got somewhat involved in muggle affairs and paid a massive price of bood fighting alongside their muggle counterparts.

It would make sense for Grindelwald and Voldemort to rise to such prominence after that - having a substantial number of your best and brightest dying in a mindless slaughter tends to shift societies.

And, well, it was a perfect opportunity - we know wizards from different counties dont necessarily get along with each other, so I can definitely see them picking up on the hard-core nationalism of the times.

**** It definitely had an impact - i'd imagine being on the frontlines of the war muggles started had twofold consequences:

1. One side that didn't want to have anything to do with non-magicals whatsoever, since they're clearly not worth the cost
2. One side that wanted to lead muggles instead, to make them civilised and not prone to wanton slaughter.

The difference between Dumbledore and Grindelwald (both in camp 2) sprung from different approaches - Dumbledore most likely wanted each country to do their own muggle-leading thing, since that seemed like a good idea not to shake the boat too much, whereas Grindelwald wanted to go forth and unite the world under one state, to take the 'no more war' further down it's logical path (after all, no countries - no conflict, right?)

And from that you get WW2 being somewhat influenced by Grindelwald alliance with the nazis.

OFC none of it is canon but i think some setup like that would make good grounds for some story in that period.

** I think JK was saying that Archer Evermonde passed emergency legislation that forbade wizards to get involved in the war. Whether similar practices were observed all over the world is unknown but it could be likely that it would have been a direction coming from ICW since the concern was that there would be breeches of the Statute if wizards got involved in the conflict. So assuming this, it's quite likely that the wizarding world stood out the first war with minor exceptions such as Henry Potter and those that secretly helped their Muggle neighbors (but JK makes it seem like it was on minor stuff so not really a big deal).

** Rowling has gone pretty far out of her way to make it clear that the wizarding world is totally separate from the muggle one when it comes to wars. Even the issue with Grindelwald is portrayed as being entirely coincidental. It is wholly coincidental that the Grindelwald war happened at the exact same time as World War II and covered the same core theater of conflict. The two events are in no way related, according to Rowling, and any similarities they share is sheer coincidence.

I personally happen to DISAGREE with this approach, which I'll talk about in a moment, but given that context, I would ASSUME that since World War II did not matter at all to the wizarding community, that World War I (i.e. The Great War) passed by them completely unremarked upon. They did not participate, and it did not matter.

This is really down to what I call the Hitler Problem. If you're some sort of modern fantasy writer, and your writing happens to encompass that era of history, you have two choices: ignore Hitler, or embrace Hitler. MOST writers choose option 1, which is to ignore Hitler, which is the safest option for public relations. There is zero chance anyone will be upset about it, even if it is superficially absurd to suppose that it is true. The second option, which far fewer people use, is to "embrace" Hitler by directly involving him in the story in some way, or involving the events that happened. This makes way more sense logically, but it also runs the risk of offending people.

Rowling went with Option 1, and in fact went in for it so hard that she's practically wished Hitler out of existence. You can see another instance of Option 1 in The Dresden Files, though that is a somewhat softer example. Instead of Hitler never being discussed at all, it comes up, but it is generally acknowledged that Kimmler was the more dangerous of the two, since he nearly destroyed the world and came /extremely/ close to ascending to godhood. Also, Kimmler was literally a card-carrying member of the NSDAP and had his own occult research division in the German military at the time, so he had a direct connection to Hitler. This is in direct contrast to Grindelwald, who is, ALLEGEDLY, just some random guy who happened to be alive in the same generation and whose rebellion and war had nothing to do with anything else happening at the same time in those same countries.

At some point during her worldbuilding, Rowling made the executive decision to never mention Hitler or National Socialist Germany, EVER, even though important parts of the plot are the result of things that happened during that time period that need to be explained. Dumbledore's motivations and attitudes don't make much sense if he lives in a vacuum: you have to explain his falling out with Grindelwald, his estrangement from his brother, and Ariana's death, for any of Dumbledore's long term choices and decisions to make sense. In addition, Dumbledore was 'merely' a genius academic until he killed Grindelwald, so Grindelwald's whole story is the catalyst for Dumbledore's fame and influence: without Dark Lord Gellert Grindelwald the legend of Albus Dumbledore does not exist. And yet, in spite of how involved the foundation of the story was in that time period, Rowling absolutely refused to bring up Hitler or allow any connection with Hitler to be made in her story. She was so adamant about this divorce from mentioning Hitler that she went so far as to spell out that /World War II did not matter to wizards and they barely noticed it happening./ Half of the planet fighting the other half of the planet was beneath the dignity or notice of the wizarding community, and they were entirely divorced from both the influence of the war and any material or ideological consequences that came about as a result of it.

So, given Rowling's own statements on the issue, I would have to assume that if they didn't notice World War II, then they almost certainly didn't notice the Great War either. I would assume that obviously the muggleborns cared a great deal about it, and the halfbloods of the time were aware of it, but wizards as a whole ignored it or were dismissive of it. Muggles fighting muggles with strange muggle contraptions, not a very big deal and nothing to be concerned about. If you see any funny gas coming your way, cast a bubble head charm on yourself and carry on.

** If Magical and Muggle histories are similar/same, does that mean that, for 200 years, Magical Britain had subjugated Magical India, Magical America and countless other colonies? Because that changes a lot, since those colonies are freshly independent in the timeframe of HP. Well, except Magical America, because they gained Independence in the 1700s

** I dont think wizards are outclassed by muggles in terms of destruction whatsoever. Mainly due too the fact wizards also have what could be considered WMDs, (fiendfire, dementors, dragons, lethifolds, etc) and by just corraling and unleashing or just unleashing they could bring muggles too there knees. Especially with wizards right in the middle of many high end muggle settlements, with muggles unable to find them.

** 'Surpassing' is a strong word considering competent wizards have access to unlimited explosions, fire and kinetic force to only name just a few of the things witches and wizards can do. Don't forget that Fiendfyre isn't that hard to cast (as shown by Crabbe), the trick is to be able to control it, which you don't really need to - you only need to be able to disapparate away quickly enough - since Fiendfyre is not like Gubraithian Fire which is everlasting and a different thing.

**** It did, hence the disapparation comment. Since Fiendfyre will eventually extinguish itself since it isn't Gubraithian Fire if you want to destroy a city or what have you, you don't actually need to be there for the whole time, just cast it and disapparate and voilà. You have yourself a city getting destroyed by fire only powerful wizards can stop.

** Wizarding nations are functionally almost completely independant from the muggle nations they share geography with, oh they pop over to say hello whenever a new leader is elected, but they have their own laws, own politics and certainly aren't about to go fight a war for them.

Reactions will probably depend on how long ago the most recent magical war was and how it was fought, but since we never hear mention of anything big, I'd assume it was quite some time ago, perhaps even pre-statute (open warfare being rather hard to conceal), and the response would therefore be "Those muggles truly are barbaric, slaughtering each other over petty disagreements and is such a gruesome and excessive manners too, I'm certainly glad we're not part of that society"

It could easily have been part of what made Grindelwald's rhetoric so appealing to people like Albus, the muggles are clearly doing a horrible job of ruling themselves, so much violence and collateral damage, wouldn't it be better if we, who war much more rarely, were to lead them.

** 1. it is implied that Grindelwald insisted that they had to lead muggles for muggle's own sake.
2. I think it is more like they realized the muggles are crazy beyond they thought. Magic overrides mundane nature and they don't seem to adopt guns or something. If they are terrified, then they should have used guns and artillery in their conflict. By JKR's definition magic is superior. So... muggles are too obsessed with violence that they developed the non-magical method to kill their own population that is on-par or more than the entire Wizarding population. It is just crazy.
3. I doubt Wizards would fancy 'big' things. Muggle fancy big and blasting things, but wizards seem to focus on more obscure things after their adolescence. Muggles could have seemed like a crazy child, strengthening Grindelwald's argument.
4. It is implied that the Wizard government did not go to war for very long, while muggles are treating war as a sport. "Wow, muggle filths are really beyond imagination!".
