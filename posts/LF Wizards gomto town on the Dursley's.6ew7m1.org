Just read A Hero, the one where Dudley realises that his parents are abusive and how he helps Harry, looking for a fic which has Wizards reacting to this. A few preferences is that the Wizarding World is otherwise ignorant and itr is only a select few. I really wouldn't mind seeing Dumbledore, Snape, Arthur, Molly or any others go to town on the Dursley's. I also wouldn't mind if it involved a redeemed Dudley.

Edit: stupid phone placing m's and n's where spaces are supposed to be.

Edit: and perhaps some good Wizard!Dudley fics.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind.
