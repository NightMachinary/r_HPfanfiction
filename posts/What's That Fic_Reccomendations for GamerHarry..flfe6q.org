:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been reading a lot of Gamer Harry recently, and my interest has been piqued by a memory that just resurfaced. What was the fic where Harry chose a specific bad trait to balance out the other good ones? I'm fairly sure the bad trait was "Lecherous" or something similar.

Other than that, Gamer Harry Fanfics are a Guilty pleasure, so indulge me on your favorites.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Game]] is a really popular one and was pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12591080/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Critical-Game]] is regularly updated and an interesting read.

**** I started reading it - and holy crap - I could not be more sorry to have searched it back up - the whole pre-pubescent/underage sex and including RPFF - eeesh - got out of there quickly. That trait is chosen at six years of age and without any sort of teenage hormone present, despite his older mentality, he starts flirting with adults, his aunt, children, JKR???? - just so people who want to know what's going on are fully prepared and know what they are getting into.

****** Yeah, I started it, but Harry gets the gamer ability when he's six (though quite older mentally) and is immediately saddled with the disadvantage of "Lecherous" when he chose to remove the disadvantage of "Horcrux", instead of giving the option to switch one of the other advantages out - deus ex machina to make him a pre-pubescent pervert - at age 7, he loses his virginity to JKR, another 6/7 year old - it's effing bizarre. I just couldn't continue with it. Not what I want to read. I don't mind smut in HP fics, but dear Merlin, not when they're /children/ children, you know? 15/16, okay. 14 - squicky, but I'll choose to skim past it if the story's good - anything younger, just nope - exit, pursued by paedo-bear

I only made to the very beginning of Chapter 5 (the paedo stuff is in Chapter 4, sectioned with warnings for when to stop/resume the fic if you don't want to read that stuff - but that's still no excuse - the game REWARDS Harry with a Hidden Quest complete to lose his virginity before the age of eleven - WTF???)

I need brain bleach and I need to gouge my eyes out. It seems light-hearted enough for a fic where the characters are near/of-age/over, but not that effing young.
