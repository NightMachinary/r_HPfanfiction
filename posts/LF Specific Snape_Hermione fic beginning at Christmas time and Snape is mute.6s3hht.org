Title is fairly self-explanatory - I can't remember what the fic is called, but it's a fairly short one (I think?) where Snape is mute due to injuries sustained by Nagini, and Hermione befriends him, ends up learning sign language for him, and it's all rather fluffy (and of course I really enjoyed it. Hah.)

Can anyone remember what it's called? Thanks so much in advance!

Good stuff. Didn't quite start the way I remember.

*** You're right, it doesn't start the way I remembered, either! This is definitely it, though - thank you so much!!
