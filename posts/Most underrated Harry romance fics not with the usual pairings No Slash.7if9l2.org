***** Why? Because they have sex in the first chapter? What's wrong with that? I personally know examples of people meeting and ending up sleeping together within hours, especially if we are talking about horny teenagers here. And getting engaged within two months is also known to happen.

I prefer stories where the main question is not "how long will it take them to get together". I like to read stories where a couple takes on problems together instead of 400k words of teenage Angst where the reader knows by page and age 5 how it will end. Give me "real" conflicts, not the kind based on misunderstandings like you see in trashy movies (RomCom).

  A found phone number, the decision to tale a risk. What does a different summer of 96 hold for Harry? A tale of light romance. No secret training no major angst. For once Harry meets someone normal. Now completed. A tale of one summer.

** Since Call me is already recommended I'll throw in Headsman's Hostage. It is a Harry/Cho story, something that is surprisingly uncommon, and in my opinion the only good longer story for this pairing (please correct me if I'm wrong).

  What if Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts had begun not with a dementor attack and a trumped-up charge but with a birthday party and a ransom note? In this AU, the Order's decision to pull Harry out of Privet Drive on July 31 has far-reaching consequences.
