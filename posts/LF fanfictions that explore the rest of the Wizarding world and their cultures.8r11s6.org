I always wondered how it was like in the rest of Europe. Or how magic was in Africa and Southeast Asia. Or maybe something about the Native Americans and aboriginal Australians. Or the Middle East, I think it would be interesting to see how it is in other parts of the world, what other magics they use, parts of their cultures and how they dress. Like do some of them still use staffs or do some even mutter incantations? Maybe they just will for something to happen and it does


** linkffn(The World of The Accidental Animagus) An interquel between Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War, with each chapter exploring a different location. The first chapter is an American Muggleborn being introduced to the Wizarding World, and the last is from the perspective of Sally-Anne Perks, who transfered to the Canadian school of magic. The series itself heavily features different magical cultures, such as Aboriginals using songs to cast wandless magic to great effect, and one of the greatest wandmakers in the world is Native American.

#+begin_quote
  A series of one-shots in the Animagus-Verse showing the state of the magical world at the time of Voldemort's return. Some brace for war, while for others, life goes on. A bridge between The Accidental Animagus and Animagus at War.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is possibly the best at building a wider wizarding world. Seriously, there is so much there I don't think I could do it justice.

The Firebird Trilogy has some exploration of the different wizarding cultures, but bear in mind its also a fairly AU story, so you may not be interested.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkffn(Time To Spare by EmySabath) explores a Harry where he becomes an apprentice to a Spell Master and does higher studies in a university that's under water 100% of the time. It also explores the other side of the war, and Draco Malfoy is on the light side this time around.

linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord) explores the magical world during the WW1 and WW2 era and how it affected the magical world. It also is one of the few fics I've found that shows the rise and fall of the Dark Lord Grindelwald.

linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) also explores a lot of the pre Hogwarts era world, especially when Merlin was helping to shape the modern wizarding world.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald
