There's probably a million fanfics that take the Common Potterverse Fanfic Plot Pointsâ„¢ and then subvert the hell out of them. I want the best of those - cracky or not.

Alternatively, if I'm wrong and those fics don't exist, consider this your new mission in life.

...it's mostly to keep the political machinations of Lucius Malfoy and his cronies at bay. It's the same reason Dumbledore remains Chief Warlock; he can't trust his successor to not succumb to bribery and corruption. Dumbledore would much rather be a mere headmaster and amateur bowler.

It's actually a potion that will increase his appetite, as he needs more calories and nutrients than normal to counteract the lack of food from the Dursleys.

...plenty of other wizards are descended from them, as most of the greatest wizards were encouraged to have many children in secret in order to ensure magic's survival. These children, for the most part, grew up with their non-famous parent and had no clue of their heritage. Once reliable methods of tracing parentage were discovered in the late 19th century, wizards quickly found that over 20% of their population had at least one famous ancestor, and many of those had more than just one.

*** For all the bashing of Mrs. Weasley, I only have two complaints about her character.

Her treatment of Sirius in his own home (that we see.) and not advocating for Harry to get enough information.

Her treatment of Fleur, though unjustified, was understandable.

**** And even the whole not advocating for Harry being informed is justified, even if he did face Voldemort he wouldn't honestly have much to do to USE this information (being in Hogwarts much of the year). To say nothing about the risk of the information being discovered (Harry blurting it, trusting the wrong person, trusting someone who trusted the wrong person, being dosed veritaserum -not farfetched, Umbridge was planing to- or plain Legilimens). Plus despite what he thinks being 15 is not the same as being an adult, no matter who he fought with (and let's be fair with him, at 15 we all though ourselves adults).

I kind of want to someday find a story in which the order does give him information, someone from the ministry/Death Eaters manages to take it but then it's reveled as being false information that they wanted the enemy to find up as part of some plan.

Making Griphook your account manager backfires, since hes just the guy who drives the cart. He flunked basic math at goblin elementary.

Indy Harry throws a tantrum in the middle of the great hall about how much of an old goat dumb-as-door is, and gets sent to his dormroom without dinner, like the little shit he is. People make fun of him for acting like a 6 year old.

Harry does a ritual from an ancient book, without knowing anything about rituals. The 'Increase Magical Core by 200%' ritual is actually a 'Permanently turn the caster into a kangaroo' ritual.

** Actually [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10283561/ZebJeb][Zebjeb]] has written a number of fanfics that subvert fanon tropes. Of the ones I've read:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip][/Albus and Harry's World Trip/]]: This one's incomplete, but still active, and makes it a point to try and subvert a lot of fanon tropes. There's I suppose there's some Weasley bashing, technically, but frankly what they do in this fanfic isn't really a great departure from what happened in canon, and it's not as pervasive as an actual "Weasley Bashing" fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13348041/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breaking-of-the-Blood-Wards][/Harry Potter and the Breaking of the Blood Wards/]]: This one makes the Blood Wards from canon a lot more insidious than intended. I don't really want to say any more, because it would spoil the fun of it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13255413/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Giant-s-Wand-Rights][/Harry Potter and the Half-Giant's Wand Rights/]]: An logical explanation of why Dippet /actually/ expelled Rubeus Hagrid from Hogwarts. It turns out it was for his /benefit/. Probably one of the few fanfics I've ever read that used the term "Light Lord" as a positive term, rather than derogatory(more often I see fanfics use Light Lord to imply that Dumbledore is as /evil/ as Voldemort).

** Controversial pick, but exactly what you are asking about:\\
linkffn(Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother by Ynyr)\\
One of the biggest, and most often seen, complaints against this fic it that it out of nowhere includes a soul bond trope between Voldemort (Very OOC, it's a comedy) and Tonks. I don't have time to link to all the people who mentions it turned them entirely off the fic and made them stop reading because it's so jarring. Especially for a comedy that tries so hard to be unique and there is literally no leadup to it.\\
The reason I'm recommending it is because it's a fake out! The subversion of the trope is so subtle, people have literally missed that the entire thing is a deconstruction of the soul bond trope. I don't blame people, I almost missed it myself, because subtilty in fanfiction is so rare that the reader aren't prepared for it. Heck subtilty in comedy as a genre is a gem in the rough. This is both, so it really throws the reader.\\
So I highly recommend for you to read this, it's just funny in the same vein as Carlo Zens acclaimed "The Saga of Tanya the Evil." It's comedy based on character perspectives and communication.\\
When you get to the Soul Bond trope, read very carefully and you will catch it. I will not spoil any more.
