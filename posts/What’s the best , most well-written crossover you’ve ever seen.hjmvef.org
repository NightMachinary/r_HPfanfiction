#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** A Study In Magic: linkffn(7578572)

Sherlock crossover, with a fem!John Watson. Sherlock and John adopt Harry after the Dursleys get killed in one of Moriarty's schemes.\\
Writing style is pretty great, though early chapters seem to suffer from some infrequent-writer-syndrome (awkward presentation, mostly).\\
I guess if I had one actual complaint it'd be the amount of muggle-wank - major parts of the fic rely on "Muggles do it better" clichés (CCTV, Internet, Sherlock being Sherlock and solving the plot before it can even start).

Heroes Assemble!: linkffn(12307781)

Harry Potter/MCU crossover - Harry leaves the UK to "get away from it all", ends up getting sucked into the Avengers Initiative because of the events of Avengers (2012). He's not too overpowered within the context of the Avengers, at least not until the Infinity War events where he fully becomes MoD!Harry.

A request from the FBI sends Hermione to Derry, Maine to investigate a series of child murders that took place over the last eight months.

She befriends the Loser's Club and forms an atypical relationship to the clown itself as well as Its secret alter-ego, Bill Gray.Follows the plot of the 2017 movie as well as all of its lovely canonical monthly separations.Now with cover art by SylvesterLazarus

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.
