*** Side note: I don't think that orphanages were around still in Harry's time, he likely would have been put in foster care and as he was a baby, adopted. There's a great fic about Harry who grew up in the foster care system called linkao3(Harry Potter and the ‘superhero' origin story) that really captures the working class British atmosphere.

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

Edit: And there are of course so called "Krisenpfegefamilien" which can be translated like foster families for crisis who take children in for a short time if they have no place to stay and need a family immediately (for example if they are babys, toddlers or children with special needs). They can stay there for some month until a permanent place is found if they are orphans or (more often) came from an unsuitable family.

I guess they are technically pretty similar to orphanages, except children are not really supposed to stay there. Unlike the orphanages from Riddle time, you also can't just enter there to choose a child to adopt (adoption tend to be a very long process now, in Europe at least).

*********** In a sense, though there are some difference (such as the size as said by Serena_Sers).

I think the biggest difference is that these foyers (called "Foyer de l'enfance" in my country so "Children Home"?) are not supposed to be a long term solution. Children are only supposed to be there until a place is found for them (as in a foster family). It can only become long term when there are no other options (like when the children as already been to several families and brought back).

The system is far from perfect and there is regularly adult who grew up there that talk about the experience, but it's still a lot better than most of the old orphanages.

Anyways, a Harry growing up there can still have a very shitty childhood, but it's probably better to not make him like Oliver Twist. Children is these homes are still fed, and not forced to work as an example.

************* Well, with the current system, the "orphanage" would not have the responsability of finding him a family. There would be a public servant (in the "child protective service" or whatever they call that in the UK) responsible for his dossier while the "orphanage" would only have to take care of him.

Also, considering Tom Riddle circumstances (a healthy baby whose mother just died in childbirth), I don't think they would have any difficulty finding him a family since he doesn't have any "bagage", at least at first.

What could happen is that every Foster Family end up bringing back Voldemort (probably because he did magical things), until no family want to try anymore and Voldemort is stuck into one of these dormitories until he gets his Hogwarts letter.

It's really not. An orphanage was like an animal shelter but for children. There were no real regulations about how many children lived in one orphanage, no real regulations about what education and what care they got and the main difference was, that an orphanage was a permanent solution while todays variants of children homes, group homes etc have the goal to bring children into families or at least have something close to a family structure.

************* There are similarities between the 2 systems (which is normal since one is used to replace the other), though the name is not the only thing that changed.

As an example, there is a pretty common scene in the "orphanage! fics" (either for a young Riddle or a time traveler Harry) where the children a basically put on display (asked to play in a room), with adults coming and chosing which one they want to adopt.

Such a scene would not be possible with the current system, and adoption could only happen if several conditions are fulfilled (like a child having already lived 6 months with the foster family that want to adopt him).

** Probably with Lily's next closest relative.

There is a big difference between a functional “no family” and “no one who shares blood for a blood-dependant magic spell.”

Lily's parents and grandparents predeceased her. But did her grandparents have siblings? Did her great-grandparents have siblings? Did her great-great grandparents have siblings? Did any of those people have descendants who yet live?

It's usually possible to find someone with a blood connection if you look hard enough. That grandparent's sibling's child would be the same generation as Lily's parents, and would only be Harry's first cousin once removed. Their child (same generation as Petunia) would be Harry's second cousin.

If we have to go a generation further back, we're talking second cousins once removed and third cousins. Still plenty of ‘Lily's blood' to power a spell.

Charles II was notorious for his many mistresses, and 400 years later it is probably hard to have English ancestry and NOT be related to Charles II, which means my neighbour would be related by blood to hundreds of people she has never met. "Blood relation" (therefore able to use the blood protection) is different to "family". I imagine it may be weaker than a full sibling but it would be better than nothing.

** Without Petunia, I'm not sure Harry would have grown up in the Muggle world. While "protecting him from his fame" was one of the main arguments for putting him there, the main reason was still the Blood Protection.

Assuming that Harry doesn't have any other relatives (which means that the blood protection is not an option), I doubt the Muggle world would have been judged safe enough against all the people who may have an interest toward him (either to use his fame or avenge their Master).

I suppose Harry would ultimately been raised by a Magical Family, but while the decision would (or should) be in the hand of the Ministry, I have no idea about which family would be chosen. Though, while it's up to the author to choose, I would not consider the usual family as suitable:

- The Weasleys are poor (it's an argument since they may not be able to take care of Harry's financial needs), and have already 7 children.
- Depending of the timing, the Malfoys are either still suspected Death Eater or are still doubtfull because of the "Imperius defense".
- Dumbledore (even if he may use his fame to get him) is a very busy man, with no experience with children (and has also a limited interest toward Harry since he doesn't know yet of the Horcrux).

From the usual "guardians", I guess the Tonks would be the best choice (though Andromeda family ties to Sirius may be a bad point), but I don't see any reason they are chosen compared to the tens of unnamed Magical family that would also have volunteered.

Then without Hagrid to insist on taking Harry on Dumbledore's orders, Sirius can't go off and track down Pettigrew. Then Sirius would end up raising Harry, because he'd be able to clear himself as not being the Secret Keeper.

Looking for the Potter's family tree (not that any of it is cannon, but we can have an idea either way) on google, it says that Henry Potter is Charlus cousin, meaning he is James' cousin twice removed and Harry's cousin trice removed, making Dorea Harry's cousin trice removed by marriage. This same supposed family tree says that Euphimia was a Grengrass (we don't know, truly, but if werey going with it, might be possible).

That would mean Harry could grow up with Daphne and Astoria as well.

If he does, then probably try sticking Harry with some of her relatives to maintain protections. Which would be more difficult. If that fails, then I'd think a suitable magical family. Maybe the Boneses?

** I suspect if that there were no remaining relatives for lily. Dumbledore would try to put him in a magically protected place under someone he could trust perfectly. My first thought was aberforth at the hogs head. But that might be too public for his likening. Perhaps mad eye? Someone trusted, and magically powerful. Though the problem with that is then Harry might have been too headstrong and paranoid for dumbledores plans.

Overall I'm thinking with the long bottoms. They were tortured the day after which is around the time Harry was delivered to the Dursley's. So if he was going to the long bottoms the death eaters would have arrived to the longbottom parents, dumbledore, hagrid, and possibly mcgonagall. Making it a completely different story.

***** Yes, completely fanon. JK Rowling has said that Harry didn't have a godmother. There's nothing in canon that indicates that the Potters and Longbottoms were friends (let alone close enough to name each other their children's godparents) other than them being in the Order together. Frank and Alice were likely several years older than the Potters, given that they were respected Aurors when they were tortured and Auror training takes three years.
