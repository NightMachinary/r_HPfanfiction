Does anyone know any fan fictions with a si / oc or a crossover with someone reincarnating as hagrid? if not hagrid then any other not really used characters if you know any semi-decent ones.

** I don't have anything to offer, but reincarnating as Hagrid would be pretty sweet. Swole with hardly any effort and most likely hung like a horse, just saying.

** The Perks of Survival has Sally Perks, a forgotten character, as an SI. Not Hagrid, still unusual.
