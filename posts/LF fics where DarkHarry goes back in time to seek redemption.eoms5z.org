Exactly what it says on the tin. LF fics in which a dark wizard Harry regrets what he's done to the world and travels back in time to stop it from happening. Preferably he travels back as he is and doesn't replace his younger self. Bonus points if he's really messed up in the head like the Harry from Circular Reasoning but still trying to be a better person.

No fem!Harry, no Death Eater pairings, no explicit content.

Thanks!


** This is similar to a prompt I posted on ffnet a few years back, but no nibbles. Main difference was that my version had it that whoever his love interest was had been killed, and she was his Jimminy Cricket, and he eventually realized that he couldn't keep himself on the right path without her influence and therefore went back in time to save her. It was not a mentally-healthy Harry by any means.

** I remember a Dark Harry fic during Fourth Year, and Hermione and Neville were evil in the future, and Harry became a Dark Lord because of Evil Hermione and went back in time. It was a Harry/Daphne fic, i just can't remember its name
