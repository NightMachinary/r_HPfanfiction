This is my attempt at gathering all the pieces of original canon material (books 1-7 and movies 1-7) that are used to justify the Evil Dumbledore trope. Assembling all of them will probably take some time, I will need to once again find the books in English, but if someone else wants to contribute, I'd like to keep the response structure like this:

-Response (must contain a quote, must contain source material)\\
- - Response (discussion)\\
- - - Response (discussion)\\
- - - - [...]\\
-Response (must contain a quote, must contain source material)\\
- - Response (discussion)\\
- - - Response (discussion)\\
- - - - [...]

This is so the quotes can be easily found, and not buried under an avalanche of comments by people discussing... things.

  â€œYes,' said Dumbledore. 'He'll have that scar for ever.'

  'Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?'

  'Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in useful. I have one myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the London underground.'
#+end_quote

Book 1, Chapter 1. Immediately after Hagrid arrives at No. 4 Privet Drive with baby Harry.Occasionally used to evilize Dumbledore using the scar Horcrux argument.

*** I don't think Dumbledore was actually aware of the horcruxes at that time though

**** True. We are told he started suspecting after Diary. But I am amassing quotes that CAN be used, not necessarily should.

Additionally, if we believe Dbles to be evil, but not extend that assumption to all his compatriots, we know three things about Dumbledore that make this quote valid. He knew that Voldemort was still around. He knew what Horcrux was, and had some suspicion from Slughorn. He liked to keep secrets.

That is other part I have seen thrown around: solid suspicions, 10 years to act and no results? A bit hard to believe, ain't it?

But then again, this is a repository of 'maybes'. I am well aware that canon Dumbledore does not provide a single 'certainity'.

  'Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.'
#+end_quote

Book 7, Chapter 35. Dumbledore's response to Harry showing pity for what is assumed is a fragment of Voldemort's soul (scar Horcrux). Since most precise descriptor of the thing in question is:

#+begin_quote
  small, maimed creature
#+end_quote

Thus, even if no help can be provided, chastising someone for taking pity upon a thing that looks small, harmless and in much pain comes across as quite heartless to some.
