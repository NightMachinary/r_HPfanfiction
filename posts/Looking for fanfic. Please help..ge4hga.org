Hello I am looking for fanfic where Harry goes to school in different dimension at least I think. It was creature dimension. That school was already once destroyed so that's why they created this dimension. He lives there in house and is later courted by boy. Later in fanfic Hogwarts students come to visit and Ron and Ginny get in trouble. If I remember correctly Molly, fudge and Umbridge get in trouble too and have trial? I think there is also something about evaluating because of war between Dumbledore and Voldermort? Thank you for your help. ðŸ¥°
