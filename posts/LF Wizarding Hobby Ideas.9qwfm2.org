Basically as the title says, I'm looking for wizarding hobby ideas for characters other than Quiddich, Wizard's chess, gobstones, exploding snap, reading, dueling, and spell creation.

I know, wizards are humans too, so if magical ideas fail, what would teens in the 90s do as a hobby that would translate to wizards? I know a muggleborn could probably do any hobby but a pureblood might be more restricted in what stuff they know. If you guys could help me come up with some ideas, that would be great! Thanks!


** Model building with magic should be awesome. You can literally shrink anything, have brilliant animations, maybe a running water feature, sound effects etc. It would also be a great way to practice for your exams

** Racing brooms. Trading chocolate frog cards. Swimming. Hiking. Camping. Baking. Painting. Writing. Going shopping in Diagon or Hogsmeade. Sharing a sundae at an ice cream shop with a friend. Having parties where they dance and eat and do all the typical teen party stuff like spin the bottle and sneak a bottle of whiskey from their parent's liquor cabinet.

Really, they'd be doing most of the same things we do and did as kids. Most things aren't something I'd call exclusively Muggle. Watching TV or going to the movies, yeah. But most everything else? No. Especially if it's a physical activity or something people have been doing for centuries.

I've read some fics in which wizards go to the theatre to watch plays, which for them might be equivalent to going out to see a movie. I wonder how magic might be used in place of technology during stage productions.

** I love the ideas of Hobbies, they provide depth to the world building of any story.

I don't remember the name of the story but I read one where they had a magical Olympics, things like potions, broom racing, dueling, Transfiguration, and others were all added to a standard Olympic format.

Other things that would be awesome are things like herbology societies or clubs, much like the garden clubs of today where the fantastical plants of the Wizarding World are arranged in gardens. There could also be competitions for best specimens that people grow on their own.

There can be home enchanters people who like to create small items help them out around the house. Much like mr. Weasley was all about enchanting muggle items, but instead people who invent new items for The Wizarding World to solve their problems.

People who build models of things. Ships in a bottle that have their own miniature storms with them inside the bottle and miniature figurines that work the ship displayed proudly behind some Wizards desk that took them 30 hours to get the Transfiguration and charms correct.

Breeding of magical creatures. People who raise magical creatures for things like Pegasus races much like the horse races we have. Or pet shows where people display their magical breeds of animals and get awards for the ones that best conform to whatever their breed standard is.

Magical puzzles. Just like the puzzles we have but moving pictures as you put the pieces together if there are people in the frame they insult you if you put one in the wrong place or encourage you as you get closer and closer to solving the puzzle. When you complete the puzzle the enchantments on it cause it to become one solid piece where you no longer see the lines where the puzzle pieces are but with a tap to the correct spot the pieces break apart and Shuffle themselves again so you could do the puzzle again if you wish.

Magical puzzle boxes, same category as puzzles but different. More like toys for hobby Curse Breakers, without the risk of getting trapped in some deadly Ward that could cause you harm.

*** I like your idea of magical puzzles. I've put together some 3-dimensional puzzles of famous buildings which were a lot of fun, so I wonder if there would be magical 3D puzzles that come to life when they are done.

** Painting, Tactical Topiary, Dueling, Breeding Miniature creatures to replace Mail Owls in the hopes of becoming famous and well loved.

Of course another hobby related to one of the above is coping with the brutal and inconceivable reality that nobody wants your tiny Hippogriffs, (even for the sheer lovely novelty) might be politics. You could champion the rights of Mail Owls, citing that they lack the mental faculties to understand that Knuts are a cruel compensation for their unnatural labor.

Perhaps you could become a hobby spell crafter, of course you could be meaning to create a harmless knee reversal hex to be used by school children, for casual psychological trauma via body horror and WHOOPS you misspoke the Latin necessary for that one.

Now that I think of it, Linguistics would be incredibly useful for a hobby and an immense help in the employment market.

** Here's something for the upper class - concerts where Mermish music is played. Mermish when played inside water is supposedly to be beautiful, so have the concert halls built in a way that allows the audience to hear the music without having to get wet.

** 1. Gnoming. You buy a Gnoming Rod from a store and poke your pet gnome with it. What happens is a copy of your mind posesses the gnome. The copy can end the effect at will and when it does you gain the memories. The quality of a Gnoming Rod determines the maximum lifespan of the possession. A cheap rod can go for 5 hours at a time, an expensive rod can last up to a week. Garden gnomes happen when peoples pet gnomes escape and become wild.

2. Dreamsharing. A spell that links peoples dreams together for a night and lets you remember the dream. Anyone already linked can link others in for the night. Usually done with friends but something linking can get out of hand and you can get a very large number of people in the same dream occasionally.

3. Dreamsnooping. Very similar to Dreamsharing except only one person sees the others dream. Mostly used on muggles by curious magicals and the #1 culprit for a witch or wizard falling in love with a muggle. Usually happens when they come across someone with a particularly interesting mind. They keep using the spell on that person and over time they develop feelings for them. The charm to ward against Dreamsnooping is simple to cast and lasts forever unless dispelled so this spell is rarely used on an unsuspecting magical.

4. Torbill. Three dimensional croquet. You hit a floating ball through various rings with a gavel.

5. Mirror Conversing. A mirror that transmits images and sound to a counterpart mirror in a concurrent but identical reality. This hobby takes a while to get going. At first it's no different than a real mirror since the realities are identical. You use a pair of Randice, magical dice that are truly random, to create a difference and then build off of that until you can have real conversations. No mirror is ever connected to the same reality as another persons mirror since there are infinite concurrent identical realities.

***** I don't consider the FB movies canon. If they are then perhaps some of those ideas might work.

Gnoming: Possession is considered very dark magic, and if it was so easily possible then it would have been weaponized already.

Dreamsharing: That one might actually work in Canon

Dreamsnooping: Invading another persons mind without their consent like that, even if it is just a muggle, is not very nice and also kinda overpowered. The counter spell that is so easy to cast and lasts forever is a cheap way to balance it. I could see this as a thing if it was very difficult and warding against it was equally difficult (like Legilimency and Occlumency). It would however be a hobby limited to very few people then and used more for espionage or other malicious intents. In any case, suggesting that most unions of magicals and muggles stem from dream stalking is very creepy.

Torbill: That might be a thing, although there are already a few established magical games like Quidditch, Quodpot etc.

Mirror Conversing: If it is actually just a simulation then it might work, but a connection to different realities? If such a thing was even possible, it would be as a research subject of the DoM (or a similar organisation in a different country), not available as a toy.

** Ok, hear me out:

Magic. Pogs.

Slammers charmed to make different effects. Moving pictures on the pogs. Maybe collectable things like the chocolate frog cards?

Man. I'm gonna go dig out my pogs now.
