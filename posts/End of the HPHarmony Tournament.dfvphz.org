As some of you might have heard/seen, the [[/r/HPHarmony][r/HPHarmony]] subreddit created a one month long Tournament to vote and determine the best Hhr story out there. Now it has come to an end and the results are being shown [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/dfv5oe/the_tournament_is_over/][here]] and I wanted to share it with the HPfanfiction sub since it's related to HP fics!

The event has been split up in four posts with the first three being linked in the last one. You can check it for yourself at your leisure. I for one am proud of the people who decided to participate in this :)


** Hmm...I was hoping for more reading material, but I didn't get far into the winner before it felt like an off note :(.

*** To me and a lot of Hhr fans, the story truly becomes good when Harry starts to travel in other dimensions

I'm actually dropped the story quite a few times because I found the beginning extremely boring lol...
