** I would say the most obvious one is after the Triwizard tournament. That is the first time we as a reader experience the death of a protagonist in person, as well as the overall shift in tone from what was a more lighthearted children's book into a more serious series based around a war torn community.

*** I agree with that, once the Triwizard tournament came, it started to get more dark, and transitioned more from a kid discovering the wonders of magic to fighting for your life.

**** I would say the shift was a little earlier with the attack at the World Cup. It was no longer a 'villain' but a gang of thugs that would not have been concerned if people died.

*** I'm of the opinion that calling Cedric Diggory a 'protagonist' is a bit of a stretch. I mean, his death was was surprising, and there's a definite tonal shift there (if not earlier as Thsle said), but he's a background character who played a supporting role in GoF.

**** Indee, I mean I didn't want him to die, but he's less important (over all) than say for example Sirius (now that one hit me like a hammer...he was one of my favourite characters, damned Rowling, couldn't you have killed another "nobody" or someone I hate, like say Snape? -.-) and we know less about Cedric, too (Sirius is still a minor character, but we do know a lot more about him)

***** Thing is, Rowling liked to try to have her cake and eat it, when it came to character death, and it kinda showed how immature her idea of death was in many cases. Often she would randomly kill a background character and I'd get his sense that she was giving me this puppy-eyed look through the pages and saying 'see how /tragic/ war is? I'm a ruthless, heartless /monster/!'

Except she really wasn't. Often, it was someone who had contributed barely anything to the plot. She massacred her supporting caste in DH for very little effect, in my opinion, because it only served to highlight the plot armour of the main characters. Basically, there's a difference between 'senseless' death, which can be legitimately surprising with the right timing (Cedric actually worked, for example), and actually senseless death. Most of the deaths in DH were the latter, and they had very little effect on the main characters for the most part. There just wasn't time to show it all, and she used the device way too often on background characters.

She was under enormous time constraints for the last couple of books, but still, I think she overused death tropes for little benefit in Deathly Hallows.

** I would argue that it is either when Voldemort comes back, along with the death of Cedric or when we realize just how fucked up the Ministry of Magic (and the political culture more generally) is in its failure to counter Voldemort and his purist fascists.

** I think the tone shift happens in PoA. It is that book that we see a man imprisoned wrongly, and no one doing anything about it. It is there also that the story starts getting darker with the concept of Dementors, Sirius and Remus completely willing to murder Peter, and we see the a side of Harry that /makes/ him the chosen one; his righteous anger streak. That along with his saving people's thing, is what makes Harry Potter the subject of the Prophecy.

Like Starfox said, in the Third Year, the bad guys won. Sirius was still a criminal, Harry still went back to that hell he grew up in, and Remus was outed as a werewolf to everyone. All that and the only positive out of it was that Wormtail (a 30ish year old man) stopped sleeping with Ron.

** I would argue that there are several thematic shifts in canon. The most obvious is the one between GoF and OotP, which a lot of people have already commented on, but I'd argue that there was also one between OotP and HBP, and also between HBP and DH. I'll try to qualify this as I go on.

There's a thematic shift in magic that happens gradually from PoA onward, where magic slowly becomes more and more tied to powerful magic items and 'unique' plot tokens such as animagi. In earlier books problems are often solved by remembering the right incantations, giving the sense that almost anything is possible if you know how to use a wand or brew a potion. The later books focus more around 'ye olde weapons of yore', most notably the hallows themselves, and personal ability/knowledge takes a back seat. You either have a magical plot coupon, or you are too short to ride the plot train. Things become more ritualistic and less functional with regard to plot devices (like Horcruxes, Animagi and Hallows) and less complicated with regard to spellcasting, which is often relegated to 'point at object and say funny word' in place of earlier complex wand movements and such.

I would say that the quality of writing shifts after OotP, marked by a sharp decline with the inclusion of the prophecy, which was a step away from the 'famous kid who people think is a chosen one' into 'actual chosen one' territory. It marks the beginning of Harry's transition into a weird kind of Jesus analogue... but I'm getting ahead of myself. It's a transition point where Harry is no longer implicitly expected to fight Voldemort because of genre conventions, but is actually expected to do so in-universe. Basically, by the time HBP comes along, the HP series makes an audible clunking sound as it desperately tries to bootstrap itself into young adult fiction. In my opinion, it does not succeed.

Book seven is where the Christian subtext really takes off, though it had always been present (House sorting = Calvinism, in a nutshell), and it coincides neatly with JKR's association with the Church of Scotland. Dumbledore plays an odd sort of God role, and Harry's faith in Dumbledore is tested by Rita Skeeter's biography of him. Ultimately, this leads to him dying and being 'reborn' after a conversation with DumbleGod in the afterlife, in a way that is so crassly symbolic I feel a little dirty just writing about it. There was no subtlety, only Jesus!Harry. It's also where, once again, there is an audible clunk as the books attempt to continue the adventure in the format of the school year, despite only tangentially involving the school at this point. It's a dramatic change of pace, because there is relatively little 'wacky school stuff' to distract from the bareness of the mystery plot, so there are long stretches of basically nothing going on in DH. This mirrors PS in some ways, as that year didn't have much going on either, but in DH I feel this is more obvious, especially since it was meant to be marketed to teens.

** I 100% think the biggest "shift" in the series is the death of Cedric. That moment, instantly, the books transformed from a children's fantasy series to young adult/adult themes.

** Learning more about Lord Voldemort's (Tom Riddle's) past, and the Horcruxes, in /Half-Blood Prince/, and ending with Dumbledore's death at Snape's hand. Not only does it help to characterize the main antagonist and villain of the series, providing a reason and motivation for why Voldemort "cannot die" and why he fears death, but it provides a major thematic shift and tone change, setting up the Horcrux hunt to come for much of /Deathly Hallows/. Likewise, the death of Dumbledore also signifies the "death" of Harry's innocence and childhood, and ushers Harry and the audience into a "bloody hell, things just got real" stark moment of realization.

** I see the shift in tone in book 4. Not only does Voldemort come back, but we are also seeing that no, the heroes do not win. It all goes downhill from there, as the next books reveal that the Ministry is inept, then evil, authorities are worthless or hostile, and good guys die while bad guys live.
