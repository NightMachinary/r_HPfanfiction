Im looking for anyfanficion where harry uses avada kedavra in there final battle and they both die, or any where both die and how ginny and the rest of them cope after.

I really like this premise. Not nearly enough fanfics kill off Harry. I think it really makes a compelling premise with loads of potential directions a story might take, depending on when Harry is killed.

*** Thanks! Seconding this, a Battle of Hogwarts with no clear winner but all the powerhouses that can defeat virtually any number of lesser opponents (i.e., Dumbledore and Voldemort) taken out really opens up the universe into an honest-to-Merlin wizarding civil war.

Harry doesn't even have to die as such, but if he lives, then the battle will be perceived as having a clear winner. (No matter Harry's actual combat ability against those who are not Voldemort, nobody's going to mess with the guy who killed Voldemort with a Disarming Charm.)

  ...Signifies a new beginning. Harry dies in the Final Battle. Dudley attends his cousin's funeral, quickly discovering that there was much more to Harry's life than he ever dreamed. Can regret give way to a fresh start? Canon, aside from Harry's death.

** Darn, was going to suggest *If You Are Prepared*, but it doesn't fit your requirements exactly...especially considering it's a classic, tragic and really explicit Snarry.
