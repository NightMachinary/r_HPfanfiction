Hi there! So there is an idea that maybe Ginny learned something about Tom, about how he thinks, how he works, while writing to him all year long. Maybe she was left with something more than just white blocks in her memory. I think I've read something along those lines, but it was few years back and I can't remmeber anything more. I'll be greatful for any rec. Brownie points if it's H/G as well :) Thanks in advance guys!


** That sounds a lot like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9631998/1/The-Thorny-Rose][The Thorny Rose]] (ffnet). Be warned though, since it has some serious Ron bashing.

** If you want any rec then you can check linkffn(A Changed Destiny: Rewrite). It has some serious problems with pacing and overdone drama which made me drop it, but the writing is technically competent.

  Ginny Weasley becomes a Slytherin (b/c of Riddle's diary influence) and later a Death Eater spy, changing not only her destiny but the destiny of others. She makes terrible mistakes, causes others and herself pain, but read how she grows beyond it, or does she? HP compatible, but AU after Deathly Hallows. No Ginny or Weasley bashing. Dark, powerful Ginny. No sequels! COMPLETE!
