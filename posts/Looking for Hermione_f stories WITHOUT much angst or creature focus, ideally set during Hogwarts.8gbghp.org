So I was bored and decided to look into Hermione/any woman stories only to find out that they are either an "everyone is gay" AU, are 80% angst or deal with some weird creature inheritance (Veela, werewolf, vampires; stuff like that). I frankly don't care whom Hermione is shipped with, but her partner should be within a generation of Hermione (so born after ~1955).

The story should not be angsty, not be a "Voldemort won" or similar scale AU, not include some illogical undercover work like in Murder Most Horrid and generally have a happy tone. And please no Harry/Ron, Harry/Malfoy, or Harry/Snape in the background.


** "Yule Ball Panic" and its sequels should qualify.

*** Already read it. The story was well written, but would have been better at half its length. The sequel has a lot of angst about being discovered as lesbians, which really isn't believable after Harry/Jasmin killed a bloody Basilisk with a fucking sword at age 12.

  Sequel to The Power of Love: Voldemort is back, the Ministry is in denial, and Dumbledore is stalling, but Jasmine isn't alone. She and Hermione are supported by new friends, defended by two shieldmaidens, and empowered by ancient magic. Eliminating Voldemort is the least of the tasks which prophecy expects from them, but how will these witches transform the whole magical world?

Yeah, Bellatrix is a bit too old for your cutoff, and you're probably thinking "Eww it's one of those Hermione+Death Eater fics, but it's really not. Well, it kinda is, but Hermione isn't just going to roll over and go "Yeah I be dating a terrorist now!". The fic really tries its damnedest to take this situation seriously and I adore it for this.

I'll keep an eye on this topic, because I'm interested but most f/f fics seem to focus too much on the whole 'coming-out angst' (like Yule Ball Panic) and that doesn't interest me in the slightest. Keep it a secret or go public, I don't care, but pondering this shouldn't be the main focus of the fic.

***** He tried to kill Dumbledore and used the imperius curse for that on INNOCENT BYSTANDERS. That alone is something called a war crime and something the magical world sees as one way ticket to Azkaban, no matter the circumstances. His actions also nearly killed Katie Bell, Ron, Slughorn and Harry. And he joined Voldemort on his own will. After all, he has been calling for genocide since the tender age of 12. He supported Voldemort and his ideals and only jumped ship when forced to do the dirty work himself.

But Draco was 16 in HBP, not 12. He was a few months away from being considered an adult. And funnily enough, you didn't argue against him being a war criminal.
