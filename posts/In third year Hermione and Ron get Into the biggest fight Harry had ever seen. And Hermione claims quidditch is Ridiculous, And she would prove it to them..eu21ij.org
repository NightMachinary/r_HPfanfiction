In the process Hermione tries out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a chaser Just to prove a point. She makes the team, And then proceeds to be hounded by Oliver Wood until she agrees to join the team because she's the best Chaser he has ever seen.

Oliver Wood can be heard Throughout the tryouts, “ What the hell are they putting in the water for 3rd years, First Potter can fly like a mad man , now Granger looks she should be playing Chaser for Ireland at next year's cup. What is it with those two?”


** In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) Hermione finds a way to /subvert/ Quiddich.

As for the prompt itself, I think I'd appreciate an AU in which Hermione becomes as good as Harry in Quiddich about as much as I'd appreciate one in which Harry becomes as good as Hermione in magic---which is to say, I wouldn't appreciate it very much at all.

I think that in order for the premise to work, Hermione must be good at Quiddich in a very /Hermione/ way.

*Edit:* Clarification.

Ron's eyes looked like they were trying to escape his head, as Hermione came to a graceful landing. "H-How? Hooch's class, you could barely lift off..."

Hermione nodded. "Yes, Ronald. Do you realise just how challenging it is to learn to ride a broom if you don't start early---or are Harry? Too much will, and you streak off until you hit a tree. Too little will, and you start dropping. Lose your focus, and it flips over and then drops. And every broom is a little different, and it responds a little differently. And the worst part? Those things can sense it when you don't trust them. And if you don't trust them absolutely like an idiot, they'll either ignore you or try to hurt you.

"So I enchanted my own. It's not the fastest broom, but it moves exactly how I want it to, when I want it to. It is perfectly attuned to me and my thought processes and my magic and my will. And, I trust it as absolutely as I trust my wand, and it knows it. I call this the Specialised Performance and Levitation Adaptation Technology---SPLAT for short."

"Can you apply this... SPLAT... to the whole team's brooms?" the suddenly very attentive Oliver Wood broke in.

Hermione shrugged. "I can show you how, but you have to enchant your own broom, or it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang at least customise theirs."

Olvier clapped his hands to get everyone's attention. "Okay, team! Next practice, bring an unenchanted broom, and brush up on your Charms! We'll all go SPLAT in no time flat!"

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** This sounds incredibly entertaining, I love fics that subvert the general strengths we see of characters. I imagine as the story went on, Hermione would have an interesting with struggling to balance the team and school work, and starts to fall behind.

**** Slowly she slips from the title of "brightest witch of her age", consumed by the sport. Harry starts to worry, but Ron keeps pushing back, taunting her into continually playing, provoking her competitive drive to be the best, despite his comments being completely wrong she keeps going to prove him wrong.

***** Hermione stops eating in the great hall, eating solely from food brought to the quidditch pitch. No longer sleeping in the dormitory, she lives, breathes, and dies by the sport. Professor McGonagall tries to ban her from the team, but her efforts are futile, Oliver begging they need her, and Hermione ignoring the witch, single mindlessly practicing with her fervor that had prior been given to schoolwork and studying.

As her skill grows exponentially, the other houses drop out of the quidditch cup, unwilling to play against the 3rd year, and soon her other team mates are dropping the sport as well. Only Harry and Oliver remain, but with the lack of players, no matches start. So Hermione falls deeper, forcing as many students as she can to play. Using what remains of her logical mind to start correspondences with all the professional teams in Britain, matches start up again against any that would respond, but soon even those fall flat. Nobody wanted to play against the rabid chaser, her offensive play brutal, unending, and nearly unbeatable. Backed by one of the strongest seekers in Britain of the last decade, they hadn't lost a match in months.

((not sure how to end this bit, and can't write more tonight, but if anyone wants, I'll try to keep going xD. I have no clue why I even started this, I barely write my own fics, but ridiculous plot bunnies attacked and I couldn't help myself. Hope Y'all enjoyed the crack nonsense so far.))
