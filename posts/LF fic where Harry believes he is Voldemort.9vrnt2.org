I'm looking for a certain (long and complete) crackfic where Harry Potter believes he is actually Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter's body. It is explained partly through the story that this is due to delusions caused by Harry Potter being a horcrux.

I remember, in the story, that Luna Lovegood came up with increasingly ridiculous theories regarding Harry and his secret, or why Harry acts the way he does, her last one hitting the nail on the head (and conveniently explaining the issue to the reader as well).

I also remember that a very stalkerish Ginny Weasley told everyone but Harry Potter that she was dating Harry Potter, and in the epilogue when Harry finds out about this, he proves that he "knew it all along" by proposing to Ginny and marrying her.

I also remember Harry Potter joking that Ronald Weasley was a werewolf, and then later actually believing that Ron was a werewolf.

I know this fic is a classic but I can't for the life of me remember the name or find it!

**** It was more of a merge between them. He's not completely evil, but he thinks he is so he tries to be

***** I have read the story, I just thought it's actually a cracky version of Voldemort rather than Harry thinking he's Voldemort

****** We're not given a definitive answer either way. It is heavily implied that Harry just believes he's Voldemort though. Quote from the story:

#+begin_quote
  Luna took a deep breath before saying, "When you were a little baby, did Voldemort accidentally put part of his soul in you, causing both of your souls to merge, so that you have all of his memories and will never acknowledge that you're not the same person because it's too central to your self-image?"
