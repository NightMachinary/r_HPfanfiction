OK so I only remember ONE scene from the whole story so I know it's not a lot to go on but here we are... Harry is in the hospital wing (possibly end of GOF?) and Sirius is there along with the Weasleys and Hermione and it's decided that he has to go back to the Dursley's and so Sirius gives him advice about how to avoid them and to sneak around at night and to wear socks and crawl on the floor because it's less likely to make floorboards creak and all this stuff and the Weasleys are just in absolute disbelief that Sirius would think he needs advice like that but Harry is just like nodding along and that's when everybody realizes how bad it is at the Dursleys.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?? It's like when a song is stuck in your head! I feel like I need to reread it so I can stop thinking about it lol!

Thanks in advance!
