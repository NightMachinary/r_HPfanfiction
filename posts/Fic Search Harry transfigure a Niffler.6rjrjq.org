I remember clearly a story about Harry Potter making a Niffler with Transfiguration, he enhances the bones, and skin, so it was quite alot heavier then a regular Niffler, he tended to carry his pet with him on his head, if I recall. I also remember this being in 4th year!

I also recall, if slightly less so, that he used Transfiguration to win the first round of the tournament. I think he was transfigured alot of cows, that also had alot of draught of living death inside them, so when the dragon ate them all, she fell asleep, either that or the cows were made from rocks and boulders and when the magic wore off the dragon got a quite severe stomach ache (but I think the stone transfiguration was another story, cant be sure though) OH! and the cows had odd textured skin, I remember 1 cow had the night sky as skin, it was midnight blue with stars and plants on the skin.

Sorry if Im bad at this, but this is all I remember, well he also speaks to Fleur in the library, with his Niffler sleeping, and he or her erecting a silencing charm around them, but I didnt think that information was really going to help anyone.

Off topic: Could someone teach me how to put these threads in the correct place? I never really used Reddit, I find it quite weird why they simply could use a simple forum template like others, but thats besides the point, I have no idea whatsoever how to make it so this thread has the "Fic Search" tag left of my topic name, theres an option here called choose a subreddit, but it already has HPfanfiction, am I supposed to add to that? like Hpfanfiction/Fic Search?

EDIT: found how to do the Reddit placement thing, its apperently called flair here, and I did look to the left when making the thread, but it only had 5 options, none where Fic search. but I clicked on flair after posting the thread, and more options came up.


** I can't remember it either. But it includes the cows that are transfigured almost ritually, with bad eyesight so they don't spook when faced with a dragon. He takes over a classroom to use as a workshop? I can't find it. :(
