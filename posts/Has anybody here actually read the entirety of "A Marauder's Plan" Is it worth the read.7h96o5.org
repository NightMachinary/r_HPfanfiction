** Apparently I'm the only one who actively likes it. I'll just repost what I said the last time this question was asked ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/73ay3c/discussion_a_marauders_plan_to_read_or_not_to_read/):]] I'm a pretty big fan of this story but I think most of that is because I don't mind or like the things you mention. Sirius does maintain a father figure role throughout the story. Harry does become less emotional and more "there's a prophecy I need to help get stuff done" as the story progresses but he never becomes some 14 year old cold hearted mercenary. Dumbledore does continue to make mistakes with regards to Harry and the prophecy throughout the story. Almost everyone in the story besides Dumbledore is always saying "I don't care that there's a prophecy we're going to kill this guy with minimal help from Harry" while Dumbledore continues to try to force the issue. If you really dislike the things you mentioned then yeah you probably won't like the story but I always found it to be a well written piece with a nice dose of fluffiness while also being serious when necessary.

*** You're not the only one. I liked it too, and have been looking for other fics that portray Dumbledore and Sirius similarly

** I read it. It is a nice fic, a little bit long and cliché, but the story focuses on building the Harry/Sirius relationship, and it is pretty good. I would recommend it. I don't really understand all the hate it receives.

** I managed to make it all the way through, eventually. Lots of stopping and starting to read other fanfics (and discover a new fandom! hi Worm) in between.

A Marauder's Plan is writing-technically competent. The i's are dotted, the t's are crossed, the sentences flow nicely and the story forms a coherent whole. Character development is generally fairly good, as is character consistency.

However, that's where my praise ends. The plot moves at a glacial pace and there are clichés up the wazoo. Too much politics stretched over /far/ too many words, with a side helping of Lordships and... ResidentSleeper.

** It's cliched as fuck. You know the ending way before halfway through.

It's not bad /per se/, but the enjoyment/time investment ratio is awful.

** I have read it twice, once when it had just ended and I loved it. It was the perfect wish-fulfilment with just enough fluff and battles to make me happy. It was also the period where I truly enjoyed Ancient and Noble Houses and that stuff, so it obviously appealed to me. The second time, this summer, I couldn't finish it, not because it is not well written (it's a surprisingly enjoyable read), but because I had outgrown those tropes. So, should you read it once? Yes, because it is a bit of the top fanfiction for that genre. Will you go back to it multiple times? No, because it is quite long and exhaustive once you know how it goes.

** I am currently reading chapter 29 and have read about 1/4 of the Story. it's not a bad story, If you do not expect much action. Much character development. However, I will probably pause and give other stories in the meantime preference.

** Harry/Hermione annoyed me , so I stopped at around 2/3 of the story. Author went too much into fluffy kids romance and describing their fluffy dates, this was so stupid I couldn't continue any more.

** I've never read it specifically because I've heard people complain that it's the cliche of all cliches and for something that long its gotta be good for me to read it.

** I really liked it, it took a couple of well-worn tropes and makes them work.

Things like Lordships, Ancient and Noble houses, rings (heir rings and head of house rings), Peverell ancestry, ritual magic (mostly blood rituals for family (house) purposes), blood adoptions, time bubble magic (Harry and Sirius spend a couple of months in a time bubble but only a week passes outside). It all sounds like it should be too cliche-ridden to be any good but it's actually pretty well plotted.

I like the fact that while all the on-screen romance is straight (and strictly G-rated), there is a mention of gay relationships and characters and there isn't any sense of disdain for them. (As a gay reader I like it when my existence is acknowledged without being shat upon). There is also a creative use of a pensieve to give Harry and Neville "the talk".

I love the characterisation of all of the Weasley's, from Molly and Arthur suffering from empty nest syndrome, to Ron overcoming his jealousy and becoming more sure of himself. I admit to a bit of a crush on Bill as portrayed in this story. Even Percy gets to have a bit of character development.

I usually hate original characters but the ones in this story are tolerable. Especially because some of the characters named in canon (Augusta Longbottom for one) are fleshed out in such a way that they are pretty much original characters too.

Overall, it is overflowing with a very large number of fanon tropes, but it is also a well-plotted, well-written (from a grammatical standpoint it's near perfect), story that I added to my favourites without hesitation.
