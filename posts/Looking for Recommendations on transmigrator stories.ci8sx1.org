Essentially someone who knows the harry potter story and is re-born into the harry potter world. Ideally it isn't the MC babysitting the golden trio, but doing his own thing. Super evil MC's are often cringy to me so unless it's logical i'll dislike it.

Thanks, I'm new to the fanfiction thing and have read about 2 unfinished fanfictions so far.

Also any other fanfictions that follow none golden trio characters would be nice


** Linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff)

Barely any interaction with Ron and Harry, in fact, because of her meddling, they dont even /like/ her.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.
