Mages know that all humans shape the world with their wills, but Sleepers (*Muggles*) do so unconsciously - reality is what the majority of people believe it to be. For any individual willworker to work magic, he must force his belief on the world, fighting the billions of minds whose beliefs shape the Consensus. Subtle or coincidental magic seeks to act in tune with the paradigm established by the Consensus, and is thus easier than obviously unnatural vulgar magic. When a mage contradicts the Consensus, it fights back in the form of Paradox.

** if i'm understanding correctly Harry potter,the geek has something akin to what you're saying in which the belief of our current muggle society is what determines what core root of magic is trully strongest,only talked about on the last chapter on a talk hermionexdumbledore buf present overall in the fic.
