I always felt like it would be the most obvious pairing choice given that she doesn't really fit in with the magical society. For example, she was the only one bothered by the treatment of the house elves and didn't have a problem with a werewolf as her teacher.

M/F and F/F are fine.


** Oh man, I'll run through my history. I just read a story where Hermione was paired with Rich!Justin & it just worked so well for the exact reasons you mentioned.

** In a sense, Harmony is kinda like that because even if Harry is a half-blood, his lack of knowledge and exposure to the Magical society makes him almost a muggleborn

*** I know, but most Harry/Hermione stories distort either one or both of their characters and we had a Harry/Hermione thread just yesterday.

  The third and final part of the Thorny Rose trilogy. Voldemort is again without a body, Ron has vanished and our favourite couple now know the contents of the prophecy. More importantly, Sirius is getting married. What will Harry and Ginny do now to finally put the Wizarding World to rights.
