Harry is not the Boy-Who-Lived -- perhaps that honour goes to Neville in Gryffindor or someone else.

Harry is that one type of person that's a relative loner and nervously treated as a ticking time-bomb by everyone else. He's nuts, easily irritated, and downright /nasty/ if provoked. He spends his time studying, and Dumbledore would be worried about a Riddle Redux if it weren't for a few mitigating factors.

Chiefly and baffling amongst them is his best friend/only friend or girlfriend, Daphne Greengrass, the only one he can really stand... who is pretty much like Lola Bunny in the cartoon, though I suppose she'd become more like Space Jam's Lola characterization in her sixth/seventh year.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ63L7fMGCA]]

As you can imagine, this volatile dynamic causes tension in Slytherin and utter bafflement in Hogwarts.

​

...Heh, I can imagine her planning a just-after-graduation wedding in their sixth or seventh year, and everyone staring at the two and thinking, ''what is wrong with you two'' and ''mate she's literally talking marriage barely a year out of school: why arent you running for the hills?''


** Interesting prompt, but all I can think of is the fact that the cartoon Lola Bunny is just the Overly Attached Girlfriend meme in Lola Bunny form.

I still do like the idea of Loony Tunes Lola Daphne maturing into a character like Femme Fatale Lola seen in Space Jam, though.

** You had me until the "Lola Bunny" part lol. Don't quite get that (yes I know all about Lola).

However, your initial characterization of Harry sounds great. I do like the idea of a Slytherin Harry like that with only Daphne Greengrass (or maybe Luna?) as the only one he stands and who has some sort of limited control over him.

** That ticking time bomb idea sounds like Stages of Hope, by Kayla Silverstorm. It's not a Slytherin story, but it has a lot of moments where the supporting characters worry about Harry and friends (Hermione, Luna x Neville) going mad. I'd describe it as tropey, like how there are writers who use “Damned if we do, and damned if we don't” a lot, this writer likes to bring up their madness, seemingly resolve it, then bring it up again with apologies and such happening. I never really finished reading it. For me, the main appeal was Severus and Sirius being friends, along with Villains on the verge of winning, at least at the beginning.

If he means my literary tastes, I like reading mostly Harry-centrist stories and non-slash ones at that (not my cup of tea), which typically have pairings. The more unusual the story, the better really (I've been reading HP FF for so long that most stuff feels 'same old' to me, if that makes sense), and that includes pairings.

******** In that case, you might have more luck if you broaden your search to Luna or maybe Ginny. Luna is already scatterbrained and Ginny is already overly attached, so you might find something where they're written the way you're describing.

********* Luna /could/ go that way on a stretch, but both she and Ginny already have characterizations since they're secondary characters... unless something happened to either of them, like the Diary assassinating Ginny's personality or something (wouldn't that be a body-horror story -- seeing practically someone else walking around in their meat-suit) as a side-effect.

...Huh. I could imagine how horrified people would be if something happened in the Chamber that took a hatchet job to their personalities.

Anyway, Daphne is a good template because she's pretty much a blank slate -- there's little known about her. Same deal with others that only have a name or general appearance to them. Tertiary characters that are mentioned only a few times and have little attributed to them too would also work.

...You know, the idea of Katie Bell being a punkette outside Hogwarts could be a nice change.

As you can see, I'm a big fan of stuff that's unusual.

Time-travel and significant butterflies in the past because of how hardened Ginny, Ron, and Harry are, but it's pretty solid in most areas, I think. But, the romance angle is pretty low-key, despite their being married before going back in time. I think I skimmed this in the past, so I remember pretty much nothing about it, except that Molly and Arthur are worried Harry might be jaded towards muggles because of the Dursleys (misconstruing the situation).

A lot of others I think might fit your criteria that I know are a lot shorter, are more humour-orientated, and some are just... bad (as in Megamatt09 bad).
