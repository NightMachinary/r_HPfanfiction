Look at the title... Bonus if it reminds someone of a game called Doki Doki Literature Club


** I have recently read linkao3(digging for the bones) and maybe it'll be something you enjoy. It's the only abused!harry story that I found realistic and not overly dramatic(but just enough). Children act like children, adults are competent and as a bonus they are not cartoonish. It deals with depression and suicide, as you asked. But even with all the above, I didn't find the fic exceptionally sad...

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

** linkffn(Stronger than hope) Harry attempts suicide to bring down Voldemort so deals quite a bit with that theme. Snape mentor fic that focuses a lot on exploring and adding to the concepts of legilimency and occlumency. I don't know if I would call it sad though, just somewhat dark in tone.

  AU after OoTP, a few HBP details. An obsessed, grieving Harry has decided on a dangerous way to defeat Voldemort. Snape is paying closer attention than before, but his contempt for Harry blinds him. Eventual Snape as Harry's guardian story. COMPLETE

  Teddy has struggled with depression for as long as he could remember. At the age of eleven, he finds himself in a battle with bulimia, a battle he isn't so sure that he's ready to fight. Trigger warning.
