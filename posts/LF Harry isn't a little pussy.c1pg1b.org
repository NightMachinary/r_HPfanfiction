  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions. However, this job, which was just supposed to be providing Harry with research and allow him to expand on his knowledge, will have him make grand discoveries about himself and that of the entire magical race.

****** The first one isn't a crossover, and completes HP completely. So you'd be fine, and it may be the gateway series to crossovers for you. I'm not saying read the sequels, but ITMOAS is a great stand alone story, and doesn't go into Stargate at all until the last few chapters, and their only barely one-line mentions.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016): Both Ron and Hermione left Harry during the hunt and they were soon brutally murdered. Harry had carried on an one-man war against Death Eaters for years, until he freed Daphne Greengrass. One of the better H/D fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): Hermione got 'indy' first and began killing rank and file Death Eaters by the boatload. But unlike most other 'grey' or 'indy' character fics, Dumbledore is more than cooperative here, because Voldemort is also a lot tougher than in canon (hint: canon Horcrux Hunt would have never worked). In the first half, Harry (and Ron) spends lots of time being personally trained by Dumbledore and Moody, and he gets to shine in the second half.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5648259/1/Elemental-Harry][Elemental Harry]], linkffn(5648259): Both Harry and Ginny gain elemental powers, and Dumbledore is more than happy to help them control their powers.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This story takes place in a non magical sci-fi AU where superpowers exist. Hogwarts is a spy school for the British elite; Purebloods are the European aristocrats; and Riddle is bent on building an aristocratic tyranny. The Trio is awesome, Dumbledore is a totally manipulative spy master, and Harry himself is "a very dangerous young man" according to the author.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): An arch-typical curb stomping indy!Harry fic, with a Ginny who has inherited all Diary Riddle's powers. This pair likes torturing their enemies and having rough sex after battles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): AU after HBP, as Grindelwald breaks out to help Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe. Harry still tries to reign them in, buy can't really stop his friends, and he enjoys having his share.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): Time travel, so this Harry is completely cured from any pacifist leanings. He kills off his enemies effectively, but the new Hermione, who hasn't gone through any of that shit, still needs some time to get convinced.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Another time travel in which they killed off their enemies efficiently once back in time. But they don't stop at that either.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620): This concise and excellent fic goes through all 7 years in 25k words, and yet manages to capture all the highlights. As the title indicates, this Harry is rather ruthless.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Death Eaters attacked the Wedding and killed most Weasleys, the Trio triggered the Taboo a few days later and everything pretty much ended in a huge cluster fuck. By the time they made it to the new dimension accidentally, they have all become seasoned killers with severe psychological issues.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Just because Voldemort has been defeated, doesn't mean bad guys are gone. Harry (and his friends) finally had it enough after one betrayal too many, and they killed the fuck out of their enemies. The Trio also dived quite deep into dark arts, blood magic, soul magic, Fiendfyre, to name just a few.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** See, I agree a bit with the ideas, but you have to remember that Dumbledore in canon would have killed Voldemort were it not for horcruxes and the prophecy. I don't really think Dumbledore thought the death eaters were mostly capable of redemption, just Draco (and Snape). Which he was, but the whole situation in the sixth book was stupid and Malfoy should have been expelled.

Dark magic in Fanfiction is a slippery slope. Logically, the killing curse is objectively the best spell for most duels. I personally prefer fics where the true dark magics are addicting and require negative emotions like the cruciatus, but there are effective spells that do not require said emotions.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

**** I disagree with that tactic in the earlier books. On the run it makes more sense for the trio to kill death eaters. They have no supplies for interrogation. In order of the Phoenix it's better so they get info on what Voldemort is doing.

I'm not saying Dumbledore was a great character. He groomed Harry to kill himself, which is screwed up in a kid's book.

It's only the making of Fanfiction that none of the death eaters were executed because of Dumbledore or that he framed Sirius.

** If you don't mind proactive Hermione:

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

After the ministry didn't do anything against Voldemort for a year and only expelled all the mudbloods to appease him, Hermione has enough, starts a guerilla army, gets her hands on some explosives and kills as many Death Eaters as possible.

Meanwhile, Harry and Ron work with an actually competent Dumbledore against Horcruxes (which aren't the usual ones, and not limited to Britain). The French government isn't amused.

In the Ministry, half the aurors are Death Eater trying to recruit the other half, and they're mostly busy hunting Hermione.

And Voldemort got his hands on jamaican zombie magic. The Jamaicans aren't happy either.

Between Death Eaters, aurors, Order members, Resistance guerilla fighters, the Avengers (no crossover), zombies, international politics, dark curses, bombs and espionage, it's one of my top favorites ever.

**** If you like it, definitely check out the other HP fics from the same author. Marriage Law Revolution and Lady Thief are just as good and in a similar style, although Lady Thief is less violent and Revolution is more international war.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
