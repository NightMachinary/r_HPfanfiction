** Could either be taken in a more slice-of-life way with James raising Harry while grieving and slowly coming to terms with Lily's death while trying to keep Harry safe no matter the cost.

Or could be taken in a darker way, with James making Harry a child-soldier to avenge Lily and generally coming off as even more abusive than the Dursley's. Kind of like John Winchester was portrayed by Sam in the first seasons of SPN.
