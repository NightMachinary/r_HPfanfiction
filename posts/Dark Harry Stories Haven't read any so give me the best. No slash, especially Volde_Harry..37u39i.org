Completed stories preferred. Let me know if they're just Harry using dark arts or if hes actually evil or such.

Thanks.


** My favourite is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/1/Control][Control by Anonymous58]]. Summary below. This is Crazy!Harry as well as Dark!Harry if I remember right. Unfortunately not complete though.

#+begin_quote
  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

Another favourite is the Denerian series by Shezza starting with [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denerian Renagade]] and continued in two sequels, all of which are complete. Crossover with the Dresden files, but no knowledge of the series is needed. Summary below.

#+begin_quote
  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7662761/1/Charade][Charade]]: He wasn't the misunderstood victim everyone thought him to be or the chosen savior decked in the purity of the light. He was the exact opposite, and he had fooled them all. Dark! Evil! Harry. Slight Dumbledore and Weasely Bashing. Harry/Hermione! One-shot

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6969295/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-Point][Harry Potter and the Turning Point]]: What will finally drive Harry to the killing edge? No relationships, One-off and SHORT .

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5515009/1/The-Serpent-Court][The Serpent Court]]: During the summer after Sirius' death, Harry discovers some things about His mother and Hermione. A/U DarkHarry, DarkHermione (Dark Arts, not really evil)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4545504/1/Aspirations][Aspirations]]: AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing (Dark Arts, not evil)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter: Mercenary]]: Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot. (Not evil, but definitely grey and ruthless)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3941656/1/Magical-Contracts][Magical Contracts]]: In Goblet of Fire, JKR established that it was absurdly easy to bind other witches and wizards unwillingly into binding magical contracts with a simple, school-taught 'confundus' charm. What if Harry took note of that and decided to do something about it? (not evil, but ruthless)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]]: Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again. (crossover with Hellraiser, uses the Cenobites to fight the Death Eaters)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2267009/1/The-Lord-of-Azkaban][The Lord of Azkaban]]: Harry is sent to Azkaban for murder. Years later Dumbledore comes to release him but what he finds is nothing like what he was expecting. Dark and very unforgiving Harry (not evil, but ruthless)

*** Aspirations is really good, but it badly needs a beta reader. There's some sentences where I genuinely can't work out what the author is trying to say.
