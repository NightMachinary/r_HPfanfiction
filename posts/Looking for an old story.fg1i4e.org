:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry and Hermione are married with a daughter and they left England and live in the states. They eventually come back to England because Hermione's parents are dying.

Does anyone know if a story that's like this? I've been trying to think for a while and I honestly can't find it.


** I think 'What's that fic?' would be the flair you need.
