As title says, im looking for fics where someone (the ministry/delores/whatever) interrogates Harry about something, and is hopefully completely surprised and chocked at all the shit that has happened to him. Bonus fun if the dursleys and dumbledore ends up in hot water.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390267/1/Insidious-Inquisitor]] sounds like exactly what you are looking for, though I don't approve of Dumbledore-bashing, so I haven't read it.

  A series of Vignettes involving possibly the second most powerful but underused magic in the HP universe, Veritaserum. AU after GOF. Rating increased to T due to a bit of implied sexual situations, attempted suicide, abuse, and other nasty stuff.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
