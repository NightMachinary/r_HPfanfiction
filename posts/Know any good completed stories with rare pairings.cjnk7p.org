** Linkffn(Under the Southern Cross by Floreat Castellum)

It's canon, but nobody writes it in the fandom. A truly adorable fic.

#+begin_quote
  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
