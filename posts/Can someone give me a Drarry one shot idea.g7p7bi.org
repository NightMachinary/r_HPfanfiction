Something fluffy. I don't mind a bit of smut.

Actually, you know what, scratch that. Hurl anything you got at me.

Edit: Did the Mod really flag this post because of my use of Smut?

** personally as a drarry fan,, i really like fics that focus on building their friendship before jumping into the relationship so maybe you can focus on like how they start noticing small things about each other that they like and stuff like that.

sorry if i was vague tho it's been a good while since i've read HP fanfic and i'm just tryna get back into it now.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finally find the bastard who almost killed his best friend and who hated his other best friend all these years. His attempt to kill him was just the last straw.

  He shot him with the Muggle gun straight between his eyes.

Did you mean this kind of one-shot?

*** Oh...Merlin no.

I meant a fluffy one shot that describes love, I don't know how I could write a one shot where he...kills the person he's supposed to be in love with.

**** I was joking, but what I meant seriously is that whole Drarry (and Dramione and Snamione) stories are complete crap in its foundation. Draco and Snape are not good persons, they are evil bastards.

***** I don't like Snape. But I'm not going to argue with you on how you see these controversial characters.

I like them and you don't and that's fine.
