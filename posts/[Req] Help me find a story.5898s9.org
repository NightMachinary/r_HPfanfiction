I want to find a HP fanfic, I can remember most of the story, but not the title. The key points I can remember are:

1. Harry is a time traveller/dimension jumper
2. The world in which he travels to has an alternate set of events, with alive james, lily and a different harry.
3. Harry is in hufflepuff.
4. The other harry is an arrogant jerk.
5. James is an auror, lily is the professor, maybe charms?
6. Sirius and Remus are a couple, and have a son, Orion Black, whos looked down and bullied by parallel harry.

I dont think the story was complete when I last read it. Help would be much appreciated.


** IIRC, Lily was muggle studies professor.

Edit: Probably writer deleted from ffn. Here's ao3 link:

**** Dont, worry, I found the story on archive of our own, where it was reposted by the original author of the story, along with other works of his that he deleted from FF.net when he left the site. The link is below:

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** Unfortunately, this is not the right fanfiction I was looking for... sorry. Hufflepuff harry, transfers in after a few years, maybe year 3. Loves pranking, bit of a crazy genius. Not this french reincarnation I'm afraid.

**** Perhaps I spoke too soon. I don't think the story is in fanfiction .net any longer, hence my confusion with a story of the same name, and the wrong link provided by the fanfiction bot. You were indeed correct, so thanks a lot!
