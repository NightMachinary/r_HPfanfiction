Hey, guys. As the title says, I'm searching for a Harry x Luna story that I read a long time ago and want to read again. I've been looking through the internet for several hours and can't find it, so I figured maybe you mavens could help!

A description: The story covered Harry and Luna's entire lives. Throughout that time period, Harry was actually married to Hermione (I think it was her, might've been Ginny), but whenever Luna sent him an owl to meet her, he would. She was affected by her torture in Malfoy manner, among other things, and would need his comforting touch from time to time. The story ends as they are meeting for a last time in old age, and Harry says that he would still do anything for her, no matter what. It was a story that described his cheating as a necessary thing for his friendship with Luna, and I liked it a lot because it cast that typically terrible thing in a touching light.

If anybody has read a story like that and can send a link, I'd definitely appreciate it! Thanks a lot :)
