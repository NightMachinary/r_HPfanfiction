I've literally read most of the ones most people recommend, so a new haphne fic would be great! No slash No harem


** Here's some good and long Haphne fluff without mariage contracts, lordships or manipulative dumbledore. Entirely from Daphney's POV.

****** All of them, for long-winded reasons I can't get into without major spoilers. 05 isn't as bad because it provides much needed context to the other two but the author wouldn't have even written it had they not lost a bet and it still goes off the rails.

But don't let me taint your perception; it's entirely possible you might feel differently, and I do think the rest of the fic is exceptional, as are the rest of this author's work.

**** Linkffn(contractual invalidation) Rdude also has a companion piece to this fic and a fun one shot.

Linkffn(butterbeer, bollocks and a ball)

Linkffn(three black birds) This one is hit or miss from what I've seen. I don't really like it but lots of people do.

Perfect situations by jenonais

I assume you want mostly romance fics? I could link some gen and considerably darker stories but I don't wanna harsh the vibe.

  "She Transfigured Seamus' testicles into a pair of tweezers!" Through a series of unfortunate events and unwise decisions, Harry Potter ends up going to the Yule Ball with Daphne Greengrass. Perhaps things won't turn out so bad after all: when you've hit rock bottom, the only way to go is up, right? ...Right? Not your usual Daphne fic. Warnings for language and underage drinking.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
