Hi, Iâ€˜m searching for a fic in which Hermione uses a Time Turner multiple times for Missions. Dumbledore sends her on those to train her for the coming battle . The missions have different lengths a feg month to years. She keeps a diary in Order to keep the time lines seperate. At one point she becomes part of the order and as a disguise puts beads in her hair. I think in the end it was a Hermione Snape pairing.

Thanks for your help.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

** This one . linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12825374/1/Never-give-Harry-Potter-a-Time-Turner]])

Harry and Hermione repeatedly use the time turner for the same mission. Not bad, if you have a thing for cheesy writing.

  Hermione soon learns why Harry Potter should never be let near a time turner. Now, his convoluted plot has become so convoluted that even he can't understand it. A CRACK PARODY TIME TRAVEL TALE, (inspired by Magical Me)
