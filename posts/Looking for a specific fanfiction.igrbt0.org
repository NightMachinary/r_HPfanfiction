:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for that fanfic where Harry is a genius and when sorted to Hogwarts, he didn't end up in one of the four houses but in a house where no one has been sorted for many years. Sorry but this was all I can remember and I don't think there were any relationships. I hope anyone reading this knows what this fanfiction is.


** Any chance it's the fic where Harry gets sorted as headmaster? linkffn(7619993)

*** No, I don't think so. All I remember was that the house Harry was sorted to has never had any students for the past decades(?).

Edit: Though the story you provided was not the one I was looking for, it was very nice. Thanks!

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

** Well in the ultra-crack fic Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, Lily (fem-Harry) is initially in Slytherin but her sorting breaks the hat, creating a new house literally called “Default” which she and her friends later join. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831]]
