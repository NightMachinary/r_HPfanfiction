I read a story a while back that had harry looking for an engagement ring for Ginny and then ran into someone he went to elementary school with. I know its a long shot but does anyone here know of it?


** Is there anything else that you can remember about it? Like what site it was on, how long it was, or how long ago you read it? Was the entire story about this run-in, or did the old schoolmate eventually become Harry's friend or lover or something?
