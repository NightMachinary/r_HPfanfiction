** Depends on the content. The two biggest and most likely to be long lasting are ffnet and ao3. I wouldn't post it to ao3 unless its chock full of smut, a light/dark pairing, and/or a slash pairing. As for the others, if your OTP fits a certain site you might find more positive reviews on one of them (SIYE - HP/GW, Patronus Charm - HPHG etc.) but most are secondary to ffnet nowadays, meaning the same readers will see it on ffnet regardless.

Edit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/qyump/fanfiction_archives_forums_and_sites/][Here]] is a reasonably complete list, though I don't see HarryPotterFanficArchive, and at least one of the listed sites (TheQuidditchPitch) is down permanently.

*** Patronus charm is HP/HG? Don't you mean Portkey?

Anyway, it's like this:

General purpose: fanfiction.net.\\
For nsfw/easy archiving: AO3.\\
Next Gen/ Marauders/ Non Harry Centric in General: HPFF.\\
Harry/Ginny: SIYE.\\
Harry/Hermione: Portkey.

*** If you don't mind cross posting, then I'd recommend both ff.net and ao3. You're more likely to get reviews on ff, but your story can be found easier on ao3 with the tags.

**** Bit late there, but yeah if it takes minimal effort to post in more than one site then I would do so. I don't know how much editing you would have to do to make sure the markup is correct for either version though.

***** I've only posted to ff, but I imagine if you fit your story to their specs, it will meet ao3 too. Mainly, ff deletes common line breaks like all dashes or asterisks. So if you use those, I recommend a combo of symbols and numbers in whatever order you desire. Those will transfer to ao3 with copy and paste too. I'm not sure about if you use italics in your writing if those will go to both. I know that if you copy out of word and paste at ff, it will. And ao3 is generally more user friendly.

** Dark Lord Potter (DLP) - Fanfiction review and discussion. HP-centered, although includes other fandoms too. Registered users may access Work by Author section (WbA) for early beta updates. They keep impressively high standards and generally produce very well-written fanfiction. Monthly writing contests. Tendency towards darker fanfiction. Notable dislike for slash and post-OoTP canon. Runs PC, FilteredFanfiction and a notable C2 on FFN, currently the largest FFN community.

*** DLP's monthly writing contests are no longer being run, though one can still participate in the "TGYH" (thank God you're here) threads, which involve timed writing to a requested prompt. There are also occasional opportunities for original fiction writing, as Joe6991 (Joe on DLP) and jbern have published short story anthologies written by fanfiction authors. (Disclosure: I've contributed to anthologies for both editors.)

DLP's WBA was a huge help to me when I was new to writing fanfiction.

edit: added jbern

*** Completely brand new authors generally don't do well on DLP but if you're willing to put in the effort to get on their good side it's a great resource and decent community.

*** I've always heard bad things about DLP forums. Stuff like the people there are incredibly rude and rage about quality fics, while not writing them themselves. I'm not saying you have to write fics to understand but, it just seemed like an angry place I guess. Idk if those rumors are true or not though.

** If the story isn't NSFW, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][Spacebattles' Creative Writing forum]] is a good place to get feedback. It's not heavily HP-focused, but there are still a few very high-quality fics that have been written there, then mirrored to FFN/AO3 after some editing. /Applied Cultural Anthropology..../, /Seventh Horcrux/, and /In Bad Faith/ are the most prominent examples. The [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ninth-times-the-charm.305865/][HP discussion thread]] is a good place to find a beta.

** AO3 (archiveofourown.org) is a good second home. Don't expect much of an on-site community, though it is good for stuff FFN doesn't like (mostly smut) and for linking to from other social media platforms.

*** Well it's not smut. Its a novel length post gof AU. I have like 70k written and I'm learning a lot as I go. I think I'll have to go back and edit some of the humor out of my early writing though. :/
