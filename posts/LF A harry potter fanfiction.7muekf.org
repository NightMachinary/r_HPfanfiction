Looking for a fanfic i read a while ago. In it Harry was the older sibling and was sorted into Slytherin. I think that he had a friendly relation with Hermione. One scene which i remember is where Draco was having a verbal fight with the bwl( i dont remember Harry's brother's name) in the middle of the hallway. Hermione tries to stop them but couldn't. then harry comes and says something and Draco shuts up. And i think Hermione is the head girl in this fic. Any help in finding the fanfic will be much appreciated.

That is the worst possible title you could have chosen.

would have been better.
