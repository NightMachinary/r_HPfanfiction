I have an idea for a fic that I'm sort of developing with some friends. My thoughts are that the fic is set during the game Wizards Unite, in the middle of the Calamity, the event that scatters Foundables in the Muggle world and thus threatens to expose the wizarding world to Muggles.

The protagonist of the story is a Squib, and the middle child in a large family of probably five to seven siblings. Both of his parents are very skilled wizards. In particular, his father is a half-blood with a wizard father and Muggle mother, and is the CEO of a venture capitalist and research and development firm that has branches in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds, so the company is one of a few businesses that has managed to successfully straddle and operate in both worlds. What the company does varies based on whether the office is located in the Muggle or wizarding world, but it does research topics relevant to the locality in question. As such, the family is very wealthy and known as great philantropists in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds.

The protagonist's father is well-versed and up to date on matters in both worlds and knows how to function as either a Muggle or a wizard. However, the man seems a bit more at home in the Muggle world (he was very close with his now-deceased Muggle mother, who taught him never to lose touch with his Muggle roots/ancestry). The protagonist's mother is a witch of unknown blood status who never knew her parents as she was left on the doorsteps of an orphanage as a baby. While she has some awareness of Muggle customs and culture, she still finds interacting with them somewhat awkward, though she is trying. The protagonist being born as a Squib never bothered his parents one bit. His father, having a slight preference living as a Muggle versus a wizard, actually welcomed the thought of a child he could indulge his love of all things Muggles with. His mother, being abandoned as a baby, is a kind and caring woman who is personally horrified at the idea of a parent abandoning their child, and loves him unconditionally. The family lives in a large mansion in the Muggle world, with a crossing into the wizarding world situated nearby, similar to those at the Leaky Cauldron and King's Cross station.

While the protagonist is loved dearly by his family, who don't care that he is a Squib, there is some friction where his relationship with his parents and siblings are concerned. Because he doesn't attend Hogwarts and instead goes to a normal Muggle high school in the UK, he gets to go home every day after school and stay with his parents, and thus, gets to spend a lot more time with them than his siblings who go to Hogwarts do. It's no secret that because of his affinity with Muggles, the protagonist's father was actually delighted to have a Squib son and kinda spoiled him, because it allowed the man to really get in touch with his Muggle side. While the protagonist's siblings are at Hogwarts, the father is known to take his Squib son to events like the Super Bowl or World Series or to watch Muggle movies. He is not excluded from family outings, and has been to a number of wizarding events like Quidditch games with his parents and siblings.

While the protagonist's siblings are told wizarding fairy tales like Beedle the Bard and given wizarding toys like broomsticks and Gobstones, the protagonist is read Lord of the Rings and allowed to watch Star Wars and given S.T.E.M. toys and science kits and his own laptop computer. This differential treatment, and the fact that the protagonist gets to spend exponentially more time with their parents has led to some jealousy on the part of his siblings. Of course, the parents love all of their children. It's just that the protagonist being a Squib has caused them to baby and spoil him a bit more, seeing him as equivalent to a special needs child in the Muggle sense, even though there's nothing wrong with him from a Muggle perspective. And of course, there's the complex of being born "different" in a family that can use magic while he himself cannot.

As for the protagonist himself, he's an average high school student in the Muggle world who has gained somewhat of a reputation as a "big man on campus". He's athletic (his dad taught him to punch back and not cave in to bullies) and part of the school's rugby team. However, he is also rather intelligent and skilled in the sciences, and in particular, technology. His ambition, in fact, is to be a whitehat hacker for the family business. His personal hero is Angus Buchanan, for obvious reasons. He's also somewhat geeky and well-versed in sci-fi and does play some TCGs such as Yu-Gi-Oh! and MTG as a hobby (which his father appears to also share in). Owing to his popularity in school, he does have a number of Muggle classmates who are fans of his, but his closest friends are probably of the nerdy and geeky cliques.

As mentioned, the story is set during the Calamity, where Foundables have emerged all over the Muggle world. I would imagine that the protagonist's father has thrown himself into helping to deal with the incident and volunteered his company's wizarding staff in that endeavor. My thoughts are that as Foundables have started showing up in his school, the protagonist has also taken to trying to hide them from his Muggle peers and trying to find scientific or non-magical ways to contain or resolve them, or if not possible, keep Muggles from finding them until one of his siblings can come and help resolve the issue. Along the way, the protagonist would discover a greater conspiracy than threatens to upheave relations between Muggles and wizards, perhaps forever.

The protagonist would have to contend with racism towards himself as a Squib from wizards, some of whom may think that his parents are cranks for loving and accepting who he is. He also would have to keep magic hidden from his Muggle peers, and along the way, he could question if magic really should be hidden to begin with, especially since times are now so dramatically different from when wizards first went underground, so to speak. In a sense, the protagonist would have to wonder what it means to be part of a world like the wizarding world, but not of it. It is also possible that there are some elements in his father's company who want to worsen the Calamity for their own purposes.

In any case, that's what I have for the story as a thought so far. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

*** Well, any Wizards Unite based fanfic would inherently go in the HP category of a fanfic site, so in a broad sense, it is a HP fanfic on a technical level.

As for the protagonist, I think he is broadly satisfied with being able to live as a Muggle, but I do also think he gets whispers in his conscious of "what if" he was a wizard and the sort of life he could've lived. I think there is some measure of mutual envy in that he is a little jealous of his siblings for having "awesome magic powers" while they are jealous of him for all the time he spends with their parents and the special treatment he tends to get.

I didn't have the room to broadly explain it, but there would be a good amount of focus on the protagonist's siblings as well and what they get up to in the wizarding world and at Hogwarts. It also allows for the story to examine a wizarding perspective towards the Calamity and how it impacts the wizarding world, especially if some magical families have Squib or Muggle relatives. But I feel this is secondary to the concept of a Squib who is content with living a Muggle life but is still inexorably drawn into wizarding matters due to circumstances beyond his control. As mentioned, there's a conspiracy underfoot.

One other idea I had for the protagonist is that he could also be a "magical theorist", in that he has hypotheses about how to further delve into the workings of magic, perhaps through borrowing concepts from other magical fiction (like Avatar the Last Airbender or The Irregular at Magic High School). He thinks tapping into concepts from these series could augment HP magic such as by increasing potency of spells or deceasing casting time for spells. But these are theoreticals that no one sane might be so keen to try. I'm not sure about using this idea because it would likely complicate the narrative and it seems improbable for a Squib to have these sorts of ideas and even have anyone believe or want to try them.

  I think you have two fronts in your story: the family drama part and the Calamity part.
#+end_quote

That's, quite frankly, the point.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know how capable you are as a writer, but it just seems too ambitious for now
#+end_quote

Go big or go home, IMO.

#+begin_quote
  (Will I be reading a squib story that has a lot of family drama? Or will I be reading a mystery fic that has a great twist?).
#+end_quote

Exploring both angles is fundamentally important in my plotting of the idea, since one is insubstantial without the other.

#+begin_quote
  The latter would be especially bad, at least for me, because I don't find the family setting particularly interesting in the first place.
#+end_quote

Well, I already figured out and planned what sort of people the protagonist's siblings and his friends are, such as their personalities, hobbies, quirks, likes and dislikes, etc.

#+begin_quote
  In short, if you're not planning your fic to have a huge word count, I'd prefer it to focus on one thing.
#+end_quote

It does have a huge word count.

  If one is indeed insubstantial without the other, then I think your pitch was missing an important selling point.
#+end_quote

Not actually true. Both aspects tie together in a manner than constitute a few plot twists in the story.

#+begin_quote
  I'd actually like to read a fic where the Calamity creates conflict among family members; it seems far more interesting than a family drama that just happens to take place during the Calamity, which seems to be the case in your pitch.
#+end_quote

The Calamity would create conflict between the siblings, primarily in ideological and methodological ideas on how to handle the issue and the underlying conspiracy. Conflict would also come from the idea of if the wizarding world being a continued secret in this day and age is a justifiable or even practical proposition. In that sense, it is also to an extent, a family drama that happens during the Calamity.

** I'm not at all familiar with Wizards Unite, but an exploration of a squib's interaction with the Wizarding world from the squib's perspective does sound interesting. I also like the idea of friction between siblings just because the MC gets to regularly see their parents unlike the others.

#+end_quote

One thing that always did interest me about the whole Squib thing was, what if a wizarding family had a Squib but did not disown or cast him out? What if they love him all the same? You'd have to imagine that they'd send him to a Muggle school and the shift in dynamics would be rather distinct, since then he'd be immersed in Muggle culture, which would obviously separate him from any magical siblings.

The protagonist having a half-blood father who knows the ins and outs of the Muggle world, might be a more at home there, would clearly make this a bit easier to handle. However, as mentioned, it comes with its own issues, since the father might be more inclined to spend more time with his Squib child as the expense of any magical siblings, as they can connect about Muggle things that the magical children cannot. While a Squib in a wizard family could lead him being seen as the black sheep, as is so often the case in HP canon, if he is instead loved and cared for, it could be the opposite, he is babied and spoiled as the parents try and compensate for his lack of magical ability.

I also want to explore the idea of a corporation that straddles both worlds and has both wizarding and Muggle staff, though the former group are aware that Muggles work in the company and the latter obviously don't know about their wizarding colleagues. It draws some inspiration from Cross Academy in the Vampire Knight manga, admittedly. Presumably, one of the protagonist's ancestors founded the company to fulfill a dream of having both societies coexisting in some microcosm.

Those are good options as well, yes. I did recall though, that American football, such as the NFL has some popularity in the UK, evidenced by the league's willingness to hold some regular season games in London. I would also suppose that as a businessman, the father is rather well-traveled as well, and may have watched some Muggle sporting events on the side.

***** Well, the Super Bowl was a placeholder of sorts. It can be something else like trips to Disneyland or Universal Studios. Or something like a cruise ship holiday to Alaska or the Caribbean. The father being well-traveled and cultured could still justify him taking his Squib son to the Super Bowl, though. You can't strictly assume that British people have zero interest in American sports leagues. The main point is that the protagonist's parents take him on outings, probably to exotic locales that appeal to Muggles, and his siblings don't get that because perhaps they are doing their schooling at Hogwarts or working wizarding occupations (if the older children are at the age where they have finished their wizarding schooling).

****** Of course British people might be interested in American sports. But if that happens in a Harry Potter story, a number of people will be put off because it will look like you just transplanted American culture to Britain.

So, I would advice you to use British culture and sports, not American.

******* I wouldn't exclusively use American events/culture, but would include stuff from a number of countries I have a good amount of knowledge about. So, there could be Russian, Singaporean, Australian, Brazilian events/sports/culture, etc. The point mainly is that the protagonist is exposed to a lot of global events/culture, so it would ultimately transcend the whole British vs. American thing. There's also the idea that the protagonist's father is known to indulge in his Squib son's hobbies at times. For instance, if the protagonist shows an interest in a certain TCG, his father might also research it and get his own deck and play against his son and his son's Muggle friends. The father is certainly seen as almost like a "cool uncle" to the protagonist's Muggle friends.

Not if the first elements aren't American for one, and the American elements are spread out among those from other countries. So, I'm not really pushing America into HP at all on the balance of things.
