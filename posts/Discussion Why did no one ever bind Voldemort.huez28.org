A thought that's come up a few times, and hit me again today. From GoF we know that wizards can be entered into binding contracts without their knowledge or consent.

So why isn't that standard practice for, say, the Ministry's most wanted list? Pick a crime they like to commit (say infecting people with lycanthropy for Greyback) and write in whatever consequence you can get away with.

Or even for the 'ex' death eaters, a simple contract with a schedule of absurd fines should they willingly act in service of Voldemort after their acquittal.

I know it's just a gap in the world building to push the plot, but it is a lazy one that sticks out.


** The Goblet of Fire contract doesn't seem to be binding in that it will enforce physical consequences but rather that three countries and schools entered into a legal contract that cannot be changed. Note how Crouch and Bagman refer to the "rules". Now if you could get Voldemort to sign a jinxed parchment, that'd be another thing.

*** In canon, we don't even know if Harry not entering the Tournament would really have any true consequences. The 2 people who defended the "magical contract" theory are Moody (who was impersonated by Crouch Jr), and Crouch Sr (who was imperiused by his son). 2 people who really wanted Harry to participate.

** While I don't remember if this is actually canon, a common fanon detail is that the Goblet requires the signature of the person entering the tournament, and Crouch gets this from one of Harry's assignments. Maybe a wanted criminal would be more careful with their signature if they knew magic like that was possible. Or maybe the Goblet only works for the Triwizard Tournament, not magical contracts in general, and the Goblet can magically tell whether it's being used for an actual Tournament or something else.

** It's only in fan fiction that one loses magic if they choose not to compete. It's just as likely, as someone somewhere argued (don't feel like searching), that it's a violation of magical law. As such, who's going to go arrest Voldemort and Greyback?

*** Well, as Hermione demonstrated you can easily write a contract such that one who breaks it is affected by a jinx.

Or, say, a tracking spell that pings like the Trace.

***** Harder but not impossible. Luckily the canon Ministry are idiots because JK doesn't really think like an authoritarian bureaucrat very well.

After all, the Ministry, like any government, has legal guardianship of convicts, and could easily enough compel signatures as a condition of release... or as a 'routine measure' after an arrest.

***** Not exactly true as in Canon harry was bound to a magical contract for a tournament he never entered. So for Voldemort could one of his old school assignments be used to bind him? I would say yes as that's how Harry got bound.

There's a short story called Magical Contracts by Kalen Darkmoon that ran with a similar concept.

******* We have no idea if Hogwarts retains every assignment for every class. Considering with magic that they could all be placed in a magical trunk and then the trunk shrunk to the size of a matchbook it is possible that all assignments are retained.

The reason it doesn't happen IRL is because we don't really have the storage for that much paper. Of course with digital tests/assignments and the cheap cost of storage media we are now seeing things kept much longer.

It took a confundus charm and a torn signature from a homework assignment for harry to be bound in a magical contract. So the same thing but with a torn signature from one of tom's old assignments might work.

  In Goblet of Fire, JKR established that it was absurdly easy to bind other witches and wizards unwillingly into binding magical contracts with a simple, school-taught 'confundus' charm. What if Harry took note of that and decided to do something about it?

** Yeah, Harry being forced to compete and then no one using the apparent ability to enter people into contracts without their knowledge or consent is a huge plot hole.

All I can think is, if Harry hadn't competed, whatever consequences of not competing must be visited on Barty instead because he's the one who actually put the name in.
