Astoria would be nice, but I think I've all of the 3 fanfics that has HP/AG exclusively. Would be interesting something the Carrow Twins (Flora and Hestia). Or muggle OC, maybe. IDK. something nice, preferably complete, or at least ongoing.


** You mind linking the H/A fics? I'm guessing one of them is linkffn(Heterochromic). That shit took a dark turn.

linkffn(9885609; 7539141)

Motivations is quite cute, as is "Finding a place to call home". I really disliked Dementor's Stigma, because while the premise is supposed to be about a dystopian zombie apocalypse, its mostly a political and suspense fic, which I hate. Never actually manage to read it whole, though, so it might change later on.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

** linkffn(Madley in Love)

Fits the premise but it's not a great fic imo. Definitely readable but the relationship and ending/sequel are a bit weird.

Edit: Madley in Love wasn't the story I was thinking of. The one I was thinking of involves a professor!Harry dating an OC female student. Her friends and family disapprove so age is an issue. Don't want to spoil more details but I'll try to find it.

*** I liked Madley in Love quite a lot when I first read it. Its was really sweet, but in hindsight, its a really weird relationship at the start. Harry's a bum and okay with a random chick just crashing every other day in his house ? WTF. It is a sweet story though.

The story you're thinking about is one by Emilyherself, with a horrible ending. I think its called Tonight.

**** Yup, that's the one, good call!

After I linked it by accident I reread parts of Madley in Love - it's still a really enjoyable piece of fluff although I'm not sure the length/chapter count are justified. And yeah it's a bit hard to suspend disbelief (Harry is literally broke and lives off grocery donations from the Weasleys and his garden?) but the tax collector premise is so weird and fresh that it's still a charming story.

Tonight is a story that I didn't love but once I started reading I figured I might as well finish because at least they'd get together and it would be somewhat satisfying. [[/spoiler][The relationship feels really toxic and destructive. Rosa's friends both abandon her over it, and it's her fault. Harry insists on calling her Rosalin for some reason. Neither of them, especially her, seem like great people. And then he dies in awful fashion because why not. The sequel is somehow even worse - both her parents die and then they live in the US totally isolated from any friends and family yet they're happy or something.]]

I also just noticed after looking at Emilyherself's profile that she exclusively writes the Harry/OFC genre in various incarnations. Are they supposed to be self inserts? The first one with Sadie Lewis feels very familar, but I haven't read any of the others and I'm afraid to now because I have slight PTSD from Tonight/Tomorrow.

***** Sadie Lewis is the "You and I" right ? This one is actually nice and has a good ending. It isn't anywhere near the level of a Grow Young with Me, but its sweet and WAY more believable and nowhere near as toxic as Tonight. Haven't read anything else from her though, only those 2. I was actually really scared of reading You and I because of Tonight's ending, I was waiting for someone to die, most likely Lily, but its all good and sweet.
