Hey all! Im new here and desperately want to find this one I've read before. I hope I'm not mixing two together. I remember there was a fight in a populated city. There were crocodiles animals swarming in, but you realized later that it was because they were running from a Nundu. I distinctly remember the narrator commenting that Albus Dumbledore, as he saw what was approaching, merely said "sh*t". They ended up trying to kill it by firing AK into its mouth.

I also remember Harry being relatively overpowered.

The second scene I remember is in a pyramid, Voldemort has set up his base camp. He summons demons, basically, to do his work and chase Harry Potter. I also believe that some version of the angel Gabriel has been helping Harry throughout the plotline.

Hope you can help!


** I believe you may be conflating two different fics.

The Nundu scene in Egypt sounds a lot like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/83/The-Accidental-Animagus][this chapter]] in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus). I don't think this is the same as the pyramid scene you mention, as its sequel, linkffn(An Animagus At War) is on hiatus currently and hasn't featured a major conflict between Harry and Voldemort yet (been a while since I've read it though).

The second scene also sounds like it might have been something out of the final showdown in linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)? Not sure though

*** Thank you so so much! I do believe that The Accidental Animagus might be one of the ones I was looking for! I have been trying to find the other one with the "demons" (I think they were actually something from a particular mythology) and the angel. All I keep getting are crossovers with Supernatural. I also remember something about Harry hiding in the rafters in one of them using some unique ability to bypass wards? And maybe the ability to project a copy of himself somewhere else? Idk.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** The second one sounds kinda like Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, with Voldemort summoning demons to chase Harry and setting up a base at a pyramid. The one who was helping harry wasn't Gabriel but I believe a comparison was made between him and Gabriel.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
