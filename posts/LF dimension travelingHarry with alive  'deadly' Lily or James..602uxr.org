Essentially, looking for Harry to meet a couple that could feasibly satisfy the pre-condition of the prophesy, ie, "born to those who have thrice defied him." Too many stories show James as merely a variant of a Weasley twin, or Lily as embodying naive, motherly cliches. And while that has its own charm, it gets old fast.

Consequently, looking for dimension hoping Harry to meet a politically astute James or a 'badass' Lily, and so on.


** I dislike this kind of portrayal of James, Lily and in extend Sirius. So many writers tend to write James/Sirius as immature as adults as if they have nothing to do but prank, as if a 15 year-old immature guy remains immature in his whole life.

Here's this one I like which has James with character: Linkffn(Give It Your Best Shot by Zenathea)

  Some men were born average and went on to live an average life. He was not, had never been, and would never be one of those men. With his ancestry, it was hardly a surprise. Facing off against enemies old and new, very few things could come more naturally to him. No Slash. AU. Dimension Travel with a dash of Time Travel. Darker themes: war, politics, questionable morality, and etc.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
