** Put simply I think the difference comes down to whether the reader feels like a viewer or a participant. And if they feel like a participant /who/ are they participating as?

In Harry Potter fanfiction I would suggest there are a few common options:

- Harry is the reader avatar. Fairly standard, follows original style of pov. Easy for guys to sympathise with.

- Hermione is the reader avatar. Use the most prominent female character so that a female writer/reader can more easily sympathise with the character.

- The reader is viewing the story from outside. Like watching a movie.

Obviously other characters might occasionally see a bit of avatar action (Ginny, most commonly) but I'd say those are the most common.

However, most prefer their avatar to act in a way pleasing to them. Thus, many straight girls find a lot of enjoyment in Harry/DracoInLeatherPants as they think Draco is hot and they want their avatar shacking up with him. I'd say that Harry avatar stories are easily the most common and probably account for the vast majority of slash. They're also why Harry has been paired with every single female, readers often like to live vicariously through the character.

Hermione avatar stories generally end up as het stories where she's paired with anyone from Harry to Voldemort.

The viewing from the outside stories are a little more complicated. Why would they be weighted towards slash? Well, they may not be but I imagine there is still a significant slash following even among those who don't actively 'identify' with a particular character. Here I'd suggest that the attraction is perhaps more in the vein of simply wanting to see relationships with double the hotness density. Male/Male is twice as much tortured and angst-ridden male drama to enjoy while Fem/Fem is sex with FOUR boobs rather than a mere two.

But mostly I'd put it down to the author/reader avatar/sympathy thing. We simply want the characters doing stuff /we'd/ do. That means slash if the main character a girl (or a gay guy) identify with is male.

But people are complicated and no one reason will explain everyone's preference. I've just given some guesses for what I think are likely to be the big ones.

***** I would disagree. Pairing is important to me, it has to be believable on some level. Draco for example might not mesh well with Harry or Hermione which seem to be fairly popular people to pair him with. You could take a lesser known character or make an OC and pair him off that way easier.

** Filter out Draco and Voldemort as characters. On fan fiction.net, it seems most authors only list characters that are in pairs (even without the pair bracket). Yeah, you might miss some stories with a prominent Draco or Voldemort without being slash, but this will take care of a /lot/ of the /Draco and /Voldemort.

** Where there is fanfiction, there is m/m slash. I think it's something universal, no matter what language or fandom, as long as there are enough male characters for shipping, it happens.

I have no idea why other people like slash, but my reason is really simple. It's just because the two characters who I want to see interacting tend to be male. When the interesting characters are m/f I ship het pairings, when they are f/f I ship femslash pairings.

*** I remember slash fics being my first real exposure to homosexual couples. It intrigued me. Not the sex, but just that it was different, but in this environment it was perfectly /normal/. This was a few years before I came out myself.

Cultural taboo might play a part like was mentioned earlier; it's a safe environment to explore things you're interested in, whether exploring is by reading or writing.

Then there's fan bases for individual couples, just like the straight couples, and that helps grow wider interest.

*** Please note that I mean this generally, not just in terms of HP fanfiction, as I've seen this across many fandoms:

Outside of very valid points such as "because I like gay characters/relationships/sex/stories" and "because this is the first safe exposure to that lifestyle I've come across and I want to explore it," I wonder if a fair bit of it comes in because there are decidedly more fleshed out and unique male characters than there are female characters in fiction. Growing up, there weren't a lot of female characters I could relate to - many of them existed to further plot points, or to play any number of stereotypes, including the raging bitch, the girl next door, the slut and the gossip queen. These women weren't flesh and bone or brain and heart, but cardboard cut-outs parroting human-like phrases in reaction or opposition to the male protagonist.

Meanwhile, the men had backgrounds and depth and feelings; they were special snowflakes, ready to intrigue the reader and other characters alike with their deep-down-heart-felt reasoning and endless amounts of angst and bravery.

It wasn't until I found Hermione (and later, other characters) in HP around age 11 or 12 that I found something close to a relatable female character - there were others I would read, of course (Nancy Drew comes to mind), but none who felt so deeply or with such nuance that they tore their way off the pages. She was the first character I could see as being a complete equal in a relationship to a male character - to this day I can tolerate good fics shipping her with near every fanciable male in sight.

But the Hermiones of the literary world were few and far between - still are, in my opinion, though that's subjective. So then what is a poor shippers heart to do?

Great writers would be able to make a good story shipping most characters together - and would have a grand time taking a minor character (Demelza Robbins, Katie Bell, Gabrielle Delacour) and bringing her to life. But most writers, unfortunately are not great, and even great fanfiction writers don't want to effectively create an OC. So when you have fully fleshed out male character A, fully fleshed out male character B (who could definitely be traditionally-compatible if they were of opposite genders) and hardly-at-all fleshed out stereotypical female character C, which two characters would you want to smoosh together into a relationship?

Now there is a fair amount of at least partially fleshed out female characters in HP, but I would argue that it pales in comparison to the number of fleshed out male characters. There are simply more characters with distinct personality traits from which to choose, and adding in the additional interest of it being a slightly taboo topic (which number of M+ rated stories on FF tells us is popular) and a safe way of exploring one's own sexual and romantic preferences, I would say it makes perfect sense.

TL;DR There are more fleshed out male characters to choose from when shipping.

** Take a look at normal published books and movies - how many of them feature homosexual couples in major roles? Very few. The fanfiction medium provides a safe, anonymous outlet of expression for writers, and a source of homosexual romance or erotica for readers that just doesn't really exist elsewhere, outside of pornography.

I can't really give a good answer on why there is more M/M than femslash, but I assume it's just a matter of demographics of readers and writers in the community.

** I actually think it's an interesting question. If you're willing to spend ~20 minutes, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMoEs7eQeZE][you should watch this video]]. It's a fair amount of speculating but still interesting. Their main argument is that many types of porn are "erotic illusions" that is to say, a combination of erotic cues merged together which sort of amplifies the effect. They claim this is why shemale porn is so popular for straight men (attractive women and penises are arousing, so why not both?).

Within the context of that argument, you could argue that slash is so arousing for women because it has the potential to combine two types of male persona together: the strong, dominant male with the sensitive, vulnerable male. Both of these can be arousing on their own in certain contexts, so why not both?

** I just like to include homosexual relationships and encounters in my fanfics because they're more common than people would think, even for people who would normally identify as heterosexual. It can be useful in some AU scenarios as well, especially when it's like, 'oh, in this universe x/y would make sense. fuck it they're lesbian'.

But then I guess I don't really write romance stories or thinly veiled (or any kind of) porn, so w/e. It'd be nice to have some more effective filters. Sometimes I want to read a ridiculous story in which Harry marries Draco, Luna and Batilda Baghshot's great-nephew... and most of the time I don't.

** The other question is, why NOT all the slash? If we're talking straight numbers (no pun intended), surely the percentage of HPFF stories that are slash is much lower than not. I think it just stands out to many readers because it is surprising/shocking/offensive to some, so it may feel like there is more of it than there actually is.

That said, I can understand HP/DM slash in stories where Draco becomes a decent human being, because JKR writes Draco as a redeemable man. But anything with Voldemort, or Harry/Snape, is just like...what the actual fuck? Voldy is just a gross character to make a sexual story about. Snape kinda the same thing, and with Harry, incomprehensible.
