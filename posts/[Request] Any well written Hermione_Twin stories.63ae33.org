** Have you read linkffn(the arithmancer)? Hermione and George start dating in year 4 and the sequel is pretty close to completion.

*** I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that Lady Archimedes is close to completion. White Squirrel hasn't been updating it as much recently, and it still has a bit more than half of 6th year and all of 7th year to go.

***** Well, White Squirrel has like 4 or 5 separate fics that he's working on currently, so I guess he's pretty pressed for time. It's impressive that it only takes two weeks, IMO.

  WINNER: BEST HONORARY MARAUDER FIC in the MARAUDER MEDALS, 2016! "Someday . . . you'll do it your own way, not theirs!" Slytherin!Hermione, in which the brilliant witch catches the attention of creative twin wizards. It isn't easy, though. Not all Gryffindors are vastly brave, nor are all Slytherins loyal to their own. FW/HG/GW, AU from Hermione's 1st year. Cover art by windyshoes!
