*** It doesn't actually have something to do about it being slash, its because I feel that a femNeville would be treated completely different to Neville by Augusta, meaning, different personality, which would be an easy segue for a possible romance during fourth year, because a femNev might be a little more confident and could perhaps sympathize better with Harry being chosen. Stuff like that, where it changes things because of the reactions of other people, not the gender itself.
