Am I right in thinking that Harry probably mistrusted Snape his whole life and only could be sure that Snape wasnt a triple spy for Voldemort when he saw the importance of his mother to Snape via his memories?


** I felt like that was fairly clear, yeah.

*** I am a bit rusty considering canon and just thought that the fact that Snape had no chance to be an asshole to Harry after this revelation may be a reason why he named his son after him

** Harry did mistrust Snape- and for decent reasons- guy was a jerk and was yet another adult that didn't notice he was abused or did nothing about it- not to mention hovering nearby to get Harry into trouble when his Godson was the one causing it, always blaming Harry and such.

Snape had good reasons to hate Harry and company too, eventually- they set him on fire, stole ingredients from him and the like.

I always thought it most likely Snape wasn't on Dumbledore or Voldemort's side but on Lily's. That's his whole thing, he's the tragic character who lost the only person that mattered to him. We're talking about a man whose manifestation of happiness was the representation of Lily even over a decade after her passing.

*** Draco was never canonically Snape's "Godson." He favorited him in Potions class, that's all though. Narcissa had to BEG him to help Draco in HBP. Snape wasn't close to the Malfoys at all, not like fanon says.

**** Where did this idea come from, anyway? Why would anyone think that the Malfoys would name a poor halfblood just out of school as a godfather for their only child?

**** Well, Snape treated him like one so well that it fits pretty damned well regardless.

** I think it was more the way Snape treated Harry for as long as they knew eachother.

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
