** Yeah, it's been a crazy day. I called my family to know if anyone we knew was caught up in it, and for now they're all alright. I'm really afraid of what consequences there will be though...

** Yep. In France, but not Paris, so I'm safe. Or is anyone safe nowadays? Be careful everyone.

** I'm one of those five and I'm ok, thanks. I didn't lost anyone but I've got friends who lost some friends of them and some classmates who lost the director of their former school, that's sick.

**** Indeed - hopefully there's a real coalition against those fanatics in the making (I'd love to see them wiped out - and I am normally not even a violent nature (but I am no pacifist either!))

ps: I am still shocked - and geographically speaking: It's not that far from my country (Germany!) and that kind of bothers me! (particularly because our police caught a guy that was on his way to France with a car full of guns and explosives (!) - well, that's what the news say anyway - so it could have been worse (more gunmen would have meant more dead people after all))

Note: On the other hand I am not comfortable (or willing to accept) civil liberties being curtailed because of those fuck ups (as in: more government spying, more "patriot act" (Germany has something similar and it's still in force when it should have run its course already, but they keep reviving it time and time again -.-)) - politicians are to moronic to understand that it's a victory for those assholes if we live in fear and let them dictate our laws!

** I hope everyone is safe. It's all really surreal, both of the shootings that took place on the street were literally blocks away from where I lived. And I used to go by the Bataclan all the time.

It's really really horrible and I hope everyone is safe and okay.
