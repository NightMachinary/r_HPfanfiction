Thought this would be a fun discussion, and also this might be a good inspiration starting point for any writers out there!

One from me to start us off; I was surprised that Madame Maxime never really made a comeback or was heard from again after her brief moment in the spotlight. Taking the series international and then closing it back down again as events escalate was an interesting choice.

**** I agree that the mysteries of the Department are best left mostly unexplained, but I thought the Veil was /too/ ambiguous. I'm glad its origins stayed mysterious. But its use and history +(or a trip to the other side)+, I would have loved. The bit about the Ministry being built around the Death Chamber isn't even from canon; it's Pottermore. It would have worked better as readers, I think, if we had the same level of knowledge as Lupin in that scene, certain it was a one-way ticket. A significant chunk of readers, myself included, thought he was coming back. The ambiguity didn't really pay off. You could have achieved the same result (sudden, shocking, quick, pointless death) just as easily with a well-aimed Killing Curse, so what was the point to the introduction of the Veil otherwise?

Not really, IMO.

These books were originally intended to be a kind of /Bildungsroman/ genre, and the PS and CS books were aimed at 10-15 year olds. At that age (especially on the younger end of the spectrum), having a nice neat 'ending' like what Dumbledore presented is sufficient to call it a day.

Now, looking at it from an adult perspective it's pretty clear the actual Stone may well never have truly been in danger, and giving Harry the soft soap was a good way to help "seed" the story that the Flamels had gone off to the great beyond, so Voldemort wouldn't be tempted to find them later.

Back to the children thing: at that age, as well, 600+ years old is just so mindbogglingly old that the natural instinct is to believe that by the time you're at that age, well /of course/ you'd pass on to wherever it is dead people go.

In short, I don't attribute Machiavellian motives to Dumbledore in his explanation to Harry in PS.

Nomenography is discussed, but beyond that, no character is a two-dimensional set piece. Every stupid decision or occurrence is reasonably explained and works to enhance every character or plot involved.

For the names, though, someone notices how strange it is that some people have oddly appropriate names. In a few sentences we learn that it's a tradition in some families to hire a seer to help divine a name that will be auspicious or otherwise helpful to a witch or wizard. For Lupin, it actually caused a rift in his family with his mother blaming his father for essentially cursing Remus to be a werewolf. The name Harry uses is "Wolfy McWolferson," I believe.

Maybe it's not Shakespeare, but I think it's a great story.

The Monster Book of Monsters. Sicing that bad boy on a Death Eater might have been hilarious.

The plot devices that annoyed me the most were the things that everyone always knew about the kids were clueless about. Portkeys were surprises to Ron. With his family. How did they get to Egypt? Canon has no mention of international floo, if the trip wasn't via portkey how did they get there? Surely they didn't go Muggle, not with Arthur along for the ride.

HERESY: even [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryandGinny/comments/ceiyfj/the_character_development_of_ginny_weasley/eu2wz7u/][poor Ginny]] has been mostly useless for the main plot since she was saved from the Chamber of secrets, with the exception of one kiss with Harry ... Harry's life would be exactly the same if she died in the Chamber, he would just have to date somebody else (I always liked linkao3(14031036) ... make this canon and Ginny is completely superfluous). Yes, I am shipping Hinny, but not because much of anything in canon, because there is not much there, see that linked comment above, but because of lovely fanfictions written about them (Northumbrian stories, linkao3(601124), or even lovely sweet one-shots like [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=9605][Rows by Antosha]], and many many others). Of course, better solution would be to add those [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluous_man][superfluous persons]] a bit of life after all.

*** Sorry, I'm just imagining Mark Evans the Greenberg (from Teen Wolf) in which we never see the kid but someone is always shouting about him blowing something up, messing around, etc etc "off screen" until maybe an epic final reveal in Deathly Hallows.

  One shot. Harry's Valentine's Day date with Cho goes a little better.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
