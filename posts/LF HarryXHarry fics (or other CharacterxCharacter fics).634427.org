Reading around, I've seen magic used to create all sorts of interesting between characters you wouldn't normally see interact. Things like Hermione getting thrown back to the Marauder Era, Older experienced Ron getting to relive his life with all the maturity he gained or Tonks using her powers to infiltrate the younger years.

And a thought struck me, I wonder if there are any HarryxHarry fics where he meets himself. I couldn't find any on ff.net, but I suspect that might be more of a limitation of their search database than a lack of stories.

I would think that Harry meeting a slightly different version of himself (HarryxFem!Harry, HarryxEvil!Harry) might be more interesting than pure HarryxOld!Harry.

The one story I remember reading where they kinda had this interaction was one where Harry got sent back and ended up in a female version of himself, who had suffered less physical but more mental trauma at the hands of the Dudleys. She was with him for a bit (with the stereotypical 'two souls one body' problem) after he came back before leaving (basically committing suicide), suggesting this is what she would have done if old!Harry hadn't come back and taken over her body. It was a small aside in the story though, wasn't really the main plot point, I think it was over with in the first few chapters. I'm looking for something that explores that interaction in more detail.

Romance is an interesting possibility, but optional. Even if it is something like "Harry goes back in Time, pretends to be his guardian to get Young!Harry away". Would produce some interesting material to read about.

And as the title suggests, HermionexHermione, RonxRon, or other character meet versions of themselves fics accepted. Preferably a main part of the story though, not just an aside they do.


** The story you referenced sucks imo.

There are a number of harry/harry stories out there. Check archiveofourown but sadly harry/harry pairing search isn't possible on ffn. I started a gilmore girls/hp xover in my anthology where harry goes back in time and becomes his own guardian and deals w/shit before harry must.

You could try searching site:fanfiction.net "harry/harry" on your preferred search engine as well, it may work. Not sure how a slash affects boolean searches

*** Which one? I am quite enjoying The Red Knight and Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass. If you mean the one where he goes back and shares a body with his female self, it obviously didn't make an impression on me, as I don't remember the name and don't have it on my favorites list. But it was the closest thing I could recall to a Harry/Harry thing. So here I am asking for some better ones :)

**** Sounds like "Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool". I'm not a huge fan either, mostly for subjective reasons though.

This recent thread has a few suggestions:
