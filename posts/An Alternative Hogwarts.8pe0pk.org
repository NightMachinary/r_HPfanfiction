I recently read Battle School and the concept of how Hogwarts was really intrigued me and now I want to read more! Having Hogwarts be the elite school in Britain was particularly interesting!

Are there any fics that have an alternative Hogwarts like this? Not specifically the battle school concept, anything where Hogwarts is a different school. Thanks!


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non magical sci-fi universe, and Hogwarts is an elite spy school.

** Reign of the Serpent has similar aspects to Battle School with the students being trained to fight.

** In my forever-not-ready-to-post fic I'm trying to portray Hogwarts more like an elite school, like Eton or Harrow IRL. There are two fics I've come across with a similar approach:

linkffn(Black Luminary)\\
linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome)

I think Untitled Tome captures the feel of a public school better, from what I remember.

  Power is a fickle mistress. You court her for centuries, nourish her, shelter her from those who are unworthy, and everything is as it should be. But then, she laughs, stabbing you in the back with cold daggers of reckoning. Still, the Blacks aren't overly discouraged. They've been at this dance longer than anyone else, they know one thing for certain: an old flame never dies. AU

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.
