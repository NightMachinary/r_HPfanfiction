Imagine a tapestry. Imagine you're staring at that tapestry, memorising where it is, where it's positioned relative to its surroundings.\\
You focus on it, and once it's committed to memory, a burst of magic comes out of nowhere. The tapestry is cut in two.\\
You wait. You wait some more. Then you remember exactly where the tapestry was. You raise your wand, pronounce /Diffindo/. The light of your Severing Charm flashes out, and vanishes into nothingness.

Time travel is like that. Something from the future makes an impact in your present, retrocausality, reversed cause and effect.\\
But, even though the tapestry's already severed, you still need to cast the Severing Charm. If you don't, where did the magic come from? It's an uncertainty, until it's made certain, by closing the time loop, you've got a bit of the cosmos tied up there.\\
Bad things happen when spacetime is tangled like that, but for tiny things you can let it smooth itself over and endure your spells going a bit wonky in the meantime. Or you can just cast that stupid spell back in time.

I sent my soulstuff two decades back in time, from a world where the Dark Lord, oh, /you know which one/, took the whole world with him when he fell. Or maybe it'd be more accurate to say that my future self gave me a big old injection of magic and knowledge.\\
That is not what we'd call a 'tiny thing'. Knowledge from nowhere and /magicae ex nihilo/, intangible or not, ties huge knots in the spacetime fabric, especially over that distance. And I don't have a Third Eye I can use to 'buy off' the knowledge, damn shame I don't have that gift.\\
So, I can leave the time paradox unresolved, and inevitably make a large hole in Britain when the temporal cosmic knot destabilises and closes its accounts to Kaboom in Equity...or, I can 'discover' what I know, find and follow the evidence trail until the knowledge I have can exist without time travel involved.

So, let's start over and let me introduce myself again.\\
Hey there, I'm Potter. /Detective/ Potter.
