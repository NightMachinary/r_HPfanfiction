I notice this the most in stories where the ship is Harry and Hermione, and usually it's Ginny and Ron who get the short end of the stick (and sometimes other Weasleys, too, like Molly). This doesn't make much sense to me because Harry and Hermione can get together without ruining their relationships with their friends, I feel like. Or, at least, without the characterization of other characters being ruined.

Why do you all think this happens?


** A lot of writers are, to put it bluntly, angsty teenagers for one thing. When your a teenager, and I say this from past experience, you tend to see everyone else as wrong or incorrect and only you can know the true answer. Part of growing up is to realize that you usually /don't/ know whats best.

For another, lots of people react strongly to very narrow points of view (see any emotional arguement made by politicians ever).

- Ron's holding Harry back he would be great without him.
- Hermione's badgering made Harry not want to try hard, keeping him from pushing himself.
- Molly's overbearing and can't treat anybody like adults.
- Dumbledore is in control of everything, sitting in his office twirling his beard like he is Snidley Whiplash.

And so on. Thing is, bashing usually has /some/ basis in the characterization. But when you ignore the full person, what you're really doing is slanting the world to /your point of view/.

Everyone has a point-of-view in truth, but you can't change the world to suit your paradigm and expect me to take it seriously.

** Because they're bad writers. I don't like all of JKR's characters, but I can still admit that every one of them has something that makes them interesting. I honestly don't understand the Weasley hate, since I find them the most human characters in the series, but some people took Harry ending up with Hermione for granted and got upset. If you don't like a character, why focus on them at all?

Character like Umbridge and Voldemort are different, of course, but even they aren't one dimensional.

*** In the same vain as feeling the need to ratchet up the abuse he suffered to explore the natural consequences of it, because the books either handled it poorly or not around all, It's a knee-jerk reaction. In this case to all the Weasley love in the books. People feel that the got away with bad behaviour, but also that it needs to be ramped up to justify calling it out. A lot of people think, or at least have expressed online that they think, Harry's mental breakdown in Dumbledore's office was whiny and juvenile and not at all a normal reaction to the death of a loved one, finding out your mentor/grandfather has been using you to fight an evil wizard, and years of general abuse.

** Because a lot of "Harmonian" fics -- especially the ones from the golden era of Portkey.Org -- were written not as stories but as polemics in the World Shipping War of 2003-2010. It was all too common to read a Harry/Hermione fic in which their relationship began with the two of them rehearsing all the arguments for why they make a better couple than Harry/Ginny or Ron/Hermione. They would then conclude that a romantic relationship between the two of them made the most sense (what a whirlwind romance! Can't wait for them to tell that story at the wedding...).

Most of these fics would then have the two of them proceed to repeat the same arguments (multiple times) to third parties. Just in case you didn't catch them the first time.

​

But really, the origin of this sort of thing has to do with some scummy people in the early HP websites (TLC, Mugglenet) who would purposefully antagonize H/Hr people and went on to ban them after RHr was confirmed. That's why you'll see Ron written in a certain way in these stories (as a thoroughly mean and bad dude)/

** Specifically regarding Molly bashing, I believe it is done to create a source of conflict. Otherwise too many of these fics just have none. The pairing gets along swimmingly and it is just a big pile of fluff. But you make Molly into something awful that the couple can join forces against and all of a sudden there is conflict. It's lazy and stupid, usually, but I at least understand it.

Specifically for Harry/Hermione fics that typically take place post-battle or post-HBP, I think writers bash Ron and/or Ginny to avoid Harry and Hermione having to deal with the fallout of their coupling. Let's say Harry and Hermione hook up during the hunt and decide to be a couple. This could easily be seen as a big betrayal to both Ron and Ginny. It's basic guy code and girl code. Basically any time you pair two characters but try to stick to canon, it generally means that the paired characters have probably done something that is sorta shitty. But in order to make us still root for them, you need to turn the jilted exes into bad people. It's quite common in rom-coms. Take Wedding Crashers. Rachel McAdams' character basically has an emotional affair with Owen Wilson's character while engaged to Bradley Cooper's character. But because the writers made Cooper's character a jerk, it's all ok.

** Not to go against the rest of the arguments or anything (i.e. bashing = bad writing), but at least in Ron's case, the reason why he's bashed is because of some of the things he does in canon that showcase him as kind of a crappy friend. He abandons both Harry and Hermione when they need him the most, and then never really has to suffer the consequences of his actions.

Examples in fourth year, he doesn't even say he's sorry when he abandons Harry because of the TWT. He gets jealous of Hermione and Krum, ruins her night and then never apologizes for it. He spends all of sixth year with his tongue down Lavender Brown's throat, ignoring his friends (and Hermione's feelings for him). He does this mostly because Hermione (according to Ginny) snogged Victor Krum. Throughout canon, you can count any number of times where he makes Hermione cry or says something insensitive about either her studying or her appearance (usually by drooling over other girls).

Then, of course, we come to the big one: the Horcrux hunt. Sure, his 'attitude' can be blamed partially on the Horcrux, but not all. And even then, he was gone for months. And he might have said he was sorry (I don't remember if the words 'I'm Sorry' came out of his mouth or not in canon), Harry and Hermione just took him back.

These are all canon facts. It doesn't mean Ron is a bad person, or that he can't be written in a good way. He can. But these are some of the reasons why he is bashed. Just like Hermione is often bashed because of her adoration of authority figures and why Harry's often bashed because he's a wimp and relies too much on luck. Ron's 'flaws' and mistakes are just so much less subtle that it makes it easy to bash him to get Harry and Hermione together. He's jealous, we know that, so it isn't out of character at all for him to be a jealous git when his best friends start dating each other.

I think in Ginny's case it's more that we just don't know that much about her character except that she's a fangirl of the Boy Who Lived. Even at the end of the sixth book, she says something stupid like "I always knew you wouldn't be happy unless you are fighting him." What nonsense. Harry doesn't want to fight Voldemort, he has to, or at least thinks he has to. Her fangirl-ness would be easier to overlook if there had been some character development during the books, but there wasn't. Even Harry and Ginny's brief relationship is mostly off camera, so to speak. We don't learn more about her or see them talking. The only time we see that really happening is when she, Ron, Hermione, and Harry are all in the common room talking. During that part, the only thing we see is Ginny putting Hermione down with a wisecrack over Hermione's lack of knowledge about Quidditch. So again, it's easy to bash her simply because the things we know about her from canon don't necessarily portray her in the best light.

Another way to look at this is that there are certain points in canon that screamed Harry/Hermione to a lot of readers. Often times, these were when Ron was being a prat (anytime in fourth, sixth or seventh year). So writers bash Ron during these times when it's most likely to get HHR together.

*** Agreed on a lot of your Ron stuff. It's not that he actually is as bad as he gets portrayed, but there is enough truth to his negative portrayals that one can bash him without completely making things up. Not necessarily good writing, but more understandable.

I do quibble with your comments on Ginny as she clearly is shown to grow out of her fangirl phase and we actually do learn a lot about her character. And regarding the "Wouldn't be happy" line, while I'd write it a bit differently so the line doesn't get so misinterpreted, Ginny isn't really wrong. Earlier, Dumbledore even forces Harry to acknowledge that he doesn't have to follow the prophecy, but that even without it he'd still want to go after Voldemort and be the one to end it. Ginny is saying that Harry wouldn't be happy staying on the sidelines and letting others go after Voldemort. He actually does want to fight him.

Finally we do learn about them and see them talking while together. It's not as much as I'd like, but there is a scene in the common room where Ginny is casually leaning against Harry while reading the paper. She makes a comment, Harry then sets her up for a joke, and she delivers on it. That moment shows their shared sense of humor and general comfort with each other. Again, I'd agree we didn't get enough of these moments, but they were there on the page.

You have to remember the line with Dumbledore though. The reason he says he wants to fight Voldemort, Prophecy or not, is because he killed his parents, Cedric and Sirius (indirectly through Bella). It's straightforward revenge, so admittedly Ginny's line could plausibly be read as indicating Harry's a sort of "fight the bad guys 'cause they're bad" statement.

PoA shows he's not, he tells Arthur he doesn't understand why anyone would think he'd go after Sirius despite thinking he was a Death Eater. But once he learns Sirius was his godfather and believed he directly betrayed them to Voldemort then he screams about wanting to go after and kill him.

***** So here's the relevant passage I'm referring to:

#+begin_quote
  “But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or ---” “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!” Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.” “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal... In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you... which makes it certain, really, that ---” “That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. “Yes.” But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew --- and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents --- that there was all the difference in the world."
#+end_quote

It's a bit of both. Harry has to be the one both because Voldemort will force the issue, but also because he wants to be the one to fight him. So to say that Ginny's line is ridiculous and shows a lack of understanding is unfair and probably wrong. I can understand the interpretation, for sure.

But we also have to look at this from the author's intent. Do we really think Rowling wants us to think Ginny has some fundamental misunderstanding of Harry, when all other instances show she innately gets him? Does Rowling want us to think that Ginny never grew out of her "hero worship" phase (a phase I bet Rowling herself would say is exaggerated by the fandom)?

In cases where it is reasonable to draw different conclusions from a passage, I think the author's intent should be the ultimate arbiter.

** When showing and telling don't match up it prompts a backlash.

The narrative clearly tells us we should like Ron. Harry likes Ron, Ron is his best friend.

Ron is unsympathetic to Harry's myriad of problems. He's jealous of Harry's wealth and fame. He is jealous of Hermione and her other relationships but is unable to communicate with her. He's not particularly charitable in his opinions of other characters, prone to snap judgements, and has a temper.

These flaws aren't something which the books particularly condemn him for. The narrative doesn't punish him, so we tend to want to do it for them.

Same with Molly- she's treated by Harry and the narrative as an unconditionally good thing, and though she's an open, caring, loving person, she is also overbearing, rude, judgemental and occasionally just plain nasty. And believes what she is told a bit too wholeheartedly. The narrative never gives her consequences for these traits, so fans do.

Dumbledore, we are told over and over, is noble, wise, kind, the best, all powerful, so clever, can do anything, such a super star, so nice, everyone loves him, everyone trusts him, everyone needs him. Disagreeing with or disliking Dumbledore is explicitly punished by the narrative.

Dumbledore's treatment of Harry, management of the Order and his information sharing are high handed, unhelpful, manipulative and occasionally cruel. He is neglectful, absent, heavily biased and thoughtless in his role as headmaster. This is never acknowledged or really condemned, especially whilst he's alive, so fans want him punished for it.

Bashing for shipping purposes is most common when a story has to push a love interest too hard when they don't have chemistry.

Ginny is a particular target because her relationship with Harry is particularly forced. We know Ginny likes and idolises Harry. Though before OotP we are told Ginny is talkative, funny, silly, etc, but w only ever are /shown/ a girl who's shy, crying, blushing, infatuated with Harry over his celebrity, and mostly submissive to her mother and brothers. When at the beginning of OotP she appears and is now a brash, bold, confident, superstar quidditch player (she always was, you just didn't know it!), it is an abrupt change.

She gets on the quidditch team, she starts helping out the trio, giving advice to Harry, she gets male attention and in the end, our hero falls in love with her. It doesn't feel authentic, it doesn't feel organic. Harry has a chest monster, but no moments of connection, no affection or particularly positive or warm thoughts about her.

Meanwhile, Ginny is disdainful of Luna and is frankly bitchy to Hermione. It just doesn't make her look like a very nice person. So people bash her.

When people ship a character with someone non-canon, but the canon romance is well developed and the character likeable, people tend to treat them much better. (E.g. White Collar: People are loathe to break up Peter/El, so it becomes Peter/Neil/El because they love her. Pepper Potts is often still a best friend, even when they break up in fic.)

With respect to the ridiculous romance, Harry and Cho are by far the most and only realistic romance plot in the series. Namely, Harry has a crush on her mentioned in PoA, she gets together with a talented, handsome senior in GoF, Harry dates her briefly in OoTP but immediately fucks it up. Like that's real. High school romances usually flame out. And Harry and Ginny, having dated for like three weeks, would only have that.

While you made some good points earlier, I don't remember Ginny being disdainful of Luna--even in the fifth book, where she calls her Loony, she's also much friendlier to Luna then anyone else and they're seen in each other's company outside of DA meetings.

And the only time I remember her being "bitchy" to Hermione was in /Half-Blood Prince/ after Harry got himself in trouble for attacking Malfoy and Ginny snapped at Hermione for being self-righteous.

** Interesting question. You have to take into acount that part of a lot of ships is the hate of the orginal canon ship. A Harry Hermione shipper will think that Ron and Ginny are bad choices. They need to be ditched to divert from canon.

​

So you dislike the orginal parings so you need to change the course of canon that is where bashing comes in. You make the bad qualities bigger and delete the good ones. And there you have your canon divergent pairing.

I mostly see him written either as bland, overly jealous, or barely there at all.

  Regarding Molly bashing
#+end_quote

Molly is a hypocrite when it comes to caring about Harry since she does next to nothing for him after year 2, despite promising otherwise. She blamed Sirius for getting unlawfully incarcerated in a prison which makes Guantanamo Bay look like a playground. She thinks that rape drugs are funny. She is a bitch to Fleur. She treats Harry like he was 8 after his fourth encounter with Voldemort.

Take your pick why she isn't popular. Every single of these things would be enough to put her on my permanent shit list. While most Ron or Ginny bashing fics go way overboard and turn them into a caricature of their character, most Molly bashing I've read does not cross that line but just slightly exaggerate her flaws. I mean, just the Sirius thing alone proves that she is an utterly horrible human being. That scene has victim blaming levels beyond 9000.

#+begin_quote
  Ron and Ginny
#+end_quote

That's just lazy writing. I'm the first to admit that I don't like Ron because I find him boring and unrelatable, but the simple solution is to simply not include him in stories. Pair him with a pretty girl or kill him off if really necessary, but bashing him is almost never necessary (unless you write the Yule Ball from Hermione's or Padma's PoV). Ginny is disliked because Rowling wrote a shitty description of developing feelings.

But a lot of authors and readers enjoy bashing since they think that Ron and Ginny deserve the abuse because they stole Harry/Hermione in the train wreck called DH. Or for being a dick at select places in the series.

*** "Ginny is disliked because Rowling wrote a shitty description of developing feelings."

Spot on. I disliked Ginny's character for years and years. Only started to like her character on my fourth or fifth re-read when I was 18 years old. I get why young readers especially will dislike Ginny and might not enjoy her character until they reach adulthood like I did. Now that I'm older I can read between the lines a bit more and see her as the spunky, lovable character that she is, though I still find her development rushed and ridiculous. Rowling's inability to convey character's personality traits if they aren't from Harry's point of view is the main reason why Ginny gets so much hate (Ginny's dry portrayal in the films did not help matters either).

Don't get me wrong, I love OotP Tonks because she was the only badass woman who made an appearance (Lily was never "on screen"), but the later books did a real number on her.

I have to admit that I don't like the way she is portrayed in fanfic, though I haven't read a lot of fics that have her as a main character. But there's something in her fandom characterization that makes me think she is a 15 year-old teenager who can't keep her mouth shut. But that's just my personal impression. But it annoys me when she is constantly mentioned talking about who snogged whom. But as I've said, I'm very,very biased.

That's a thing? I mean, I write her as sex positive and open minded l, but she's still an adult. She owes up to what she did ("like the ability to behave myself'), but Tonks also was Mad Eye's protégé and joined the Order, so she isn't just a pretty face. Yes, she is not the most serious person, but her good spirits is one of her most endearing qualities, not a reason to turn her into a mindless gossip.

So you are basically left with alcohol and sex.

Also, if you pair Harry with an older woman, she is bound to have some experience (unless you write that "Harry is the first one to treat her right" bullshit common in stories with Fleur and Tonks). Harry would get hands on lessons rather quickly because if you seduce a teenage boy, you aren't going to snog in a broom closet, he ends up in your bedroom since almost no adult would put up with teenage drama.

See, that is the part which fiction gets wrong. A real romance isn't about getting together, it is about staying together. I know plenty of examples of relationships which began as casual date or one-night-stand and eventually developed into something more. And it really annoys me when the climax of fictional romances is A and B kissing/having sex for the first time. That's not the climax, that is just the first step.

Take my own "Dawn of Darkness" for example. Chapter three is the morning after an implied sex scene. Does that mean that Harry and Tonks are now in love? No, it means that they had sex and are not opposed to having sex in the future. They might call each other boy- and girlfriend, but they are very much not in love yet. Their relationship (and the main plot) has just begun.

But I also think that they often even can't get the 'getting together' part right, when they base it solely on intimacy and calling it romance, but the relationship itself makes no sense. And the way some fans write intimate scenes /sigh/... The interesting thing is that those kinds of stories where romance is poorly developed have so many reviews. Maybe it's a romance for them, I don't know.

Yes, and no.

I mean, a friend of mine gatecrashed a party and ended up making out with the host within the hour. They were together for more than two years despite him being 5 years older and her being 15 or 16 at that time. Another friend started a relationship because she was curious how it felt to french kiss a guy with a pierced tongue (she was 14 or 15 back then). At the same time I know people who were both adults and didn't shag until two years into the relationship.

BUT

I understand your complaint. The aforementioned ridiculous stories where Harry is supposedly the only decent guy in Europe come to mind here. Or any story where Harry is a sex god. Parseltongue cunnilingus might be awesome (and it has a guaranteed novelty factor), but I seriously doubt that Harry would pack 8 inches at 15/16 after being malnutritioned for a decade. Or be ripped like Arnold after a few Quidditch practices. Then again, most fanfic writers make their characters into models or pornstars.

It's surprisingly difficult to come up with plausible reasons why any attractive woman would choose Harry (at least until the end of DH). Looks are definitely out of the question. Character is questionable since Harry had a lot of shit going on which did not leave him in a good place.

In Dawn of Darkness, I went with an established friendship over the summer of 1996 where they got deeply familiar with each other after Tonks taught Harry Occlumency and consequently spent a lot of time in his mind. Additionally, Harry reminds Tonks of her Hogwarts days, which were vastly easier times. Then they are thrown down the deep end and have no one really behind them and therefore they have to rely on each other. And even then it takes them a month to develop deeper feelings for each other.

***************** It seems those stories that based romance solely on atraction had a point after all,lol. Only the characters there weren't 15. But I read a story that you might consider to be similar to your second example. It' didn't take them two years to have sex, but they didn't end up in bed immediately either. But the author had a reason for this- she said she believed the wizarding world to be old-fashioned when it came to intimacy issues. I saw a review of that story where the reviewer asked her whether her characters were very religious or something. I mean, what has being religious got to do with this? She shows there's obvious attraction, that characters obviously know and understand each other, but it doesn't seem to be enough. My point is, it seems you have to look for a quite conservative author if you want to find a story that doesn't make sex the most important thing. What about the rest of the plot? You and I seem to agree on the way a relationship should be developed, though. I only hope your readers know those things you told me in your comment, because I know that authors sometimes find it hard to show what exactly makes those characters like each other. Btw, Tonks teaching Harry oclumancy sounds interesting. And you even used this to let her, well, know him in a way others don't, for some reason I like this.

I have a quick, interrupted kiss at the end of chapter 1. Chapter 2 explains that Tonks is struggling with her job (corrupt Ministry) uses the situation with Harry and uses Harry for several things, not that he minds being used in that case. 3 is the morning after, they wake up in her flat, Tonks reflects on her motivation, later in the same chapter there's some insights on Harry. They agree that Harry can stay at her flat for the Christmas holidays (which doesn't happen as shit hits the fan). Then the main plot kicks in.

She, like the other Weasleys, accepted him into The Burrow as family. And she fed him properly, something that his relatives neglected to do.

Remember that scene at the end of the GoF? Harry cried on her shoulder as she hugged him. That was the first time ever in his life that someone took care of him like that. And then in Deathly Hallows, she gave him her deceased brother's watch. Because it was tradition, and Harry didn't have his parents who could give something like this to him, so she stepped in. Honestly, Molly Weasley did a lot more for Harry than most people care to acknowledge in this fandom.

In other words, she let him down badly because she /didn't perform an action that she had no idea was possible for her to do/?

** For example in my fanfic I have Dramione a ship but as it happened post war Hermione and Ron were together. I had a bit bashing from Ron bc of the jealousy and all but like the others are saying, Ron's character may be a hot head but in the end he's best friends with Hermione so although he might've bashed her a bit, it quickly got resolved. I think people who write like the “bad” characters just don't understand them at all, and still portray them as inmature
