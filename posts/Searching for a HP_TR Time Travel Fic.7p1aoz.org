Found it!!!

I'm looking for a fic that was/is on ffnet somewhere. I don't remember much, but I would really appreciate any help.

It's the typical HP goes back to TR's Hogwarts era. They fall in love, and get bonded. The big thing is that HP knows he is going to be pulled back to his time at some point, and knows that, because of the bond, TR will go insane, and that is what changed TR to Voldemort.

- HP also becomes good friend with Abraxas Malfoy and I believe Nott

- At least some of the story is when HP and TR have graduated Hogwarts

I know it's not much, but this is driving me crazy.

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?
