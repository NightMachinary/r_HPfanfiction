Some stories are just epics (looking at you Basilisk Born). And I wish there were discussion places where you could just theorize with others about which way the story will go. Right now I read through the reviews to get that feeling, but it is kind of one sided.

Are there any rooms / places that we have to discuss these hp fics?


** [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net][forums.darklordpotter.net]] has individual story threads, where you can post fics to be community-reviewed. There is also a forum for fanfic discussion, but beware that most arguments have been rehashed in there ad nauseam. I believe /Basilisk-born/ has already been through the review process, so I'd read the thread and only contribute once you've finished and if you have something additional to add.

[[/r/AlexandraQuick][r/AlexandraQuick]] and [[/r/HPMOR][r/HPMOR]] are to my knowledge the only subreddits focused around a specific fic. The latter seems to be quite active; the former isn't terribly active right now since the series is in between installments, but hosts pretty lengthy discussions as chapters are released.

/Pureblood Pretense/ has a discord server, the permanent link to which should be in the author's profile on FFN.
