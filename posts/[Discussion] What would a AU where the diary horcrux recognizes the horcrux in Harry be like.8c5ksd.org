Rewatching CoS and finding it a bit odd that the literal pieces of a man's soul that can detect a threat and use psychological warfare to neutralize it can't detect when it's communicating with another soul piece jar.


** Well, Voldemort never figured it out so I can't say I'm surprised the diary never figured it out.

*** You know what, that's a damn good point. You would honestly think a man would be able to recognize his own soul, planned or not. It's not like not recognizing a child that your one night stand never told you happened, it's your literal soul.

**** I always took it as a side effect of his soul being split, like a literal "I've done such terrible things I don't even recognize myself any more"

**** Might be because Harry was an accidental Horcrux, maybe he doesn't register quite the same.

***** I guess. It just seems to me like the lack of intention of making a horcrux wouldn't detract from ability to recognize a horcrux. A horcrux is a horcrux and all.

****** I don't think the Horcruxes ever displayed the ability to tell when their fellows were nearby. Voldemort himself didn't even realize what Harry was, and the Locket didn't either even when Harry wore it.

  HPTMR slash. AU. Harry has been raised from the time he was five with full knowledge of what he was, a Horcrux, and how someday he would need to die to avenge his parents. Thus, when he finds Tom Riddle's diary in his second year, he recognizes it. Horcrux speaks to Horcrux, a game of persuasion and manipulation. Twoshot. COMPLETE.
