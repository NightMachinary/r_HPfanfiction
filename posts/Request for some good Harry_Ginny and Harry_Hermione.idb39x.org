Hello everyone, I have been reading fanfics for about 4-5 years now. At first, it started with cannon pairing of Harry/Ginny. After that it went for Harry/Hermione. Then some familiar, but not central characters of Fleur and Tonks, and now I'm firmly a fan of Harry/Daphne. The problem is, that in most of the pairings with less central characters, it tends to bash the Weasleys, (except some like twins and Bill), Hermione and/or Dumbledore. Especially Ginny and Ron are bashed. Or atleast Harry distances himself from these characters. Right now, I'm like if the pairing is with Hermione or Ginny, it's not worth reading. And I want to change that. So, any recommendations for that. I will be clear that I dislike submissive or pushover Harry. I like more assertive and powerful Harry. Not god like, but powerful and one who learns from his mistake. I mean he was considered for Slytherin. So, show some cunning.


** It sounds like my take on Harry/ Hermione may be up your alley. Harry isn't overly powerful per sey but he is definitely more assertive and learns from mistakes. And that's all I will say about that.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

  Right now, I'm like if the pairing is with Hermione or Ginny, it's not worth reading. And I want to change that. So, any recommendations for that.
#+end_quote

So you are really looking for Harry with other pairings! But your thread title sounds like you are *only* looking for Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione.

These are my recommendations then:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Head Auror Harry Potter uses Daphne Greengrass to advance his career and agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): Daphne decides to help Harry. One of the best Harry/Daphne fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Thrown back to 1975, Harry teams up with Bellatrix and tries to create a better future. Bellatrix is a very well written character here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): This Harry never entered Wizarding Britain, and was raised by his own parents who got Voldemort with a nasty trap that night. But that doesn't mean he's a nice guy though. Dark war epic. He eventually marries his high school sweetheart, a Muggle OC.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9885609/1/Finding-a-Place-to-Call-Home][Find a Place to Call Home]], linkffn(9885609): Abandoned by everyone during the TWT, Harry ran off with Astoria and traveled the world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10938984/1/Heterochromic][Heterochromic]], linkffn(10938984): Huge plot twist near the end

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13323518/1/Ice-Cream][Ice Cream]], linkffn(13323518): An adorable one shot with Daphne Greengrass

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5864749/1/Ice-Princess][Ice Princess]], linkffn(5864749): Poor Daphne

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], linkffn(11027086): An excellent crossover with LOTR in which he's paired with Eowyn.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm][Thunderstorm]], linkffn(7186430): Harry falls for female Diary Riddle

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Thrown back to 1970, this Harry showed some mighty skills and thoroughly impressed Bellatrix.
