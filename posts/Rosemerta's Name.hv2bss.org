What's the most accepted thing by the fandom here... is Rosemerta a given name or a last name?

From one side, other "Madams" (Hooch, Pomfrey...) are last names, which could make a possibility that she is named something like Yvanka Rosemerta or Britney Rosemerta. But on the other side, adults call Madam Pomfrey just "Poppy" but still call Madam Rosemerta "Rosemerta".... Also the Marauders called her ROsemerta and seems like she was just barely older than them. She could be Rosemerta Malfoy for all we know.

So, what's your opinion? What's the most usual thing you have seen in other fanfics?


** Maybe her name is Rosemerta Rosemerta.

*** It's Rosmerta Rosmertaderta. I think she was on Saturday Night Live in the mid 70s.

** Since we're discussing her name - it's spelled "Rosmerta".

** Given name. It doesn't seem strange to me that people are less formal with a bar owner than they are with teachers.

** I always saw the kids calling her “Madam” as a sign of respect but it was an earned title that applied to the teachers but not her hence the Professors, adults and somewhat less respectful Marauders calling her by her first name only

** Definately a given name. I've certainly seen instances where children use 'Miss' before a given name as a mark of respect- Miss Anne, Miss Jane, whatever. I'm guessing the 'Madam' is just the same. Possibly a bit archaic, but hey, so is the wizarding world.

​

That said, wasn't it typical in about the 18th century for the eldest to be 'Miss last name' but any younger sister to be 'Miss first name'? I'm thinking Jane Austen sort of thing- Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne and Miss Margaret being sisters. Maybe it's something like that?

** Perhaps her first name is actually Madam, but most people are confused by that

*** Fair enough. The sorting hat could have called her with "Rosemerta, Madam!"
