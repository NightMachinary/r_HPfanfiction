Mine:

1.) The writer not knowing the difference between Accept, Except, and Expect, and making these mistakes the entire story.

2.) Spelling names and locations incorrectly. I've legit seen, 'Ranold', 'St. Otteriespol', and 'Hogworts'.

3.) A wall of text. Just a single wall. No line breaks.

I have more but these ones aggravate me so much that I Nope out pretty quickly.

** I see a few comments about spelling and grammar and while annoying, it's not much of dealbreaker to me. I think a lot of the time it may be because English is the author's second language, and so may not reflect the quality of the fic itself. Of course, it sometimes does, but I choose to see if the plot is otherwise good before exiting a fic.

For example, I saw Hufflepuff spelt once as 'Huffelpuf' which may look careless on the author's part, but it's actually just how it was spelt in Dutch.

What are dealbreakers to me: character bashing of any kind (particularly dumbledore), anytime Harry is overly submissive/weak or ridiculously powerful/dark at 11 years old, if Harry can go to gringotts bank and the goblins love him as he is so polite and he immediately becomes heir/lord to literally every ancient house, and any 'the dark side was secretly the good side all along'. I think I just like a bit of realism in my fics tbh.

The only time I saw that done remotely well the author had to change canon so much as to make it a fight between two political positions where one side got desperate enough to start brainwashing prisoners and kidnapping neutrals, and it wasn't Tom Riddle's side.

**** Actually, the KKK might be a tad tame as far as comparisons go. The Death Eaters are remarkably close to a carbon copy of the Nazi movement, themselves being a mixture of SA and SS. The snatchers are basically the Einsatzgruppen, roaming the countryside while killing the racially impure (eg Ted Tonks). Umbridge's laws andccourt were a copy of the N√ºrnberg laws of racial hygiene with harsher punishments. And given how no one in Slytherin bats an eye at Malfoy, not even when he publicly calls for racial purges in CoS, they are almost the Hitler Youth.

And canon werewolves sound like a product of the Japanese Unit 731 and are a walking biological weapon/war crime.

So selling them as the good guys is questionable, to put it politely.

Hogwarts doesn't have a telephone line for internet but you can theoretically execute software by hand on paper (or enchant it to do the job for you) and you can send IPv4 packets between Hogwarts and someone else with Internet (like Granger's computer) using the IPoAC protocol.

  In particular, Nazis admired the Jim Crow-era laws that discriminated against black Americans and segregated them from white Americans, and they debated whether to introduce similar segregation in Germany.

  Yet they ultimately decided that it wouldn't go far enough.

That pretty much explains my point of view why the KKK comparison is too tame. They were racist shitheads, but they were not "Nazi level" bad.

******* Except we do see the US government, at the federal, state, and local levels, enabling the KKK and white supremacists in general after the election of 1876 and the ending of Reconstruction. That enablement led in part to the Red Summer, Jim Crow, countless lynchings and massacres and destruction - as outlined [[https://www.history.com/news/reconstruction-1876-election-rutherford-hayes][here]], [[https://time.com/5562869/reconstruction-history/,%20%20%5Bhere%5D(https://www.npr.org/2020/01/13/795892582/wilmington-s-lie-author-traces-the-rise-of-white-supremacy-in-a-southern-city][here]], [[https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/chicago-race-riot-of-1919][here]], and [[https://time.com/5636454/what-is-red-summer/][here]] just to give an example.

I know we've strayed from the original topic, but we have done a peculiar thing in the US by minimizing the harm done by white supremacists and papering over the history. Maybe the federal government didn't write the KKK a blank check, but they absolutely engaged in the same type of subjugation, terror, and outright attempts at genocide that the Death Eaters did in the books, often with the support or least tacit approval of "mainstream American society". Furthermore, white supremacists of those generations absolutely sought political office and a rule of law that would make what they did permissible, not just in actual acts of terror against black people but also in terms of systems set up to keep black people subjugated.

Again, I know that this is not the original topic of this comment, but that horrible history has had traumatic effects on generations of black people, and has created unequal systems that we are still trying to correct. It would be disrespectful to the lives my ancestors lived to minimize the tightropes they had to walk just to survive.

If the books ended with HBP, I wouldn't disagree with you. But what we see Voldemort's henchmen do in DH is worse than the KKK. Greyback in particular sounds like someone not only surpassing the average Nazi but like someone who'd stand out even in the infamous Japanese Unit 731.

I enjoy character hate, but not bashing. Give me solid reasons to hate characters, don't just assume that because I ‚Äòobviously' hate a character I'm going to find amusement in seeing them bashed - heck no, the writer needs to make me understand why THEY dislike that character. if they can do that? bash away! Extremely submissive/weak Harry? No thanks, I'm not a fan! Ridiculously powerful? I'm up for it, but it needs to be developed, rather than just him waking up and suddenly being able to beat anyone.

Honestly, I'm fairly up for anything in a fic, even the most ridiculous of ships, so long as it's developed well and the writing isn't completely unreadable. My standard is slowly creeping higher which is frustrating, but I try to keep an open mind!

I started to read and had to put down a promising story recently because of this and while I agree with you, there's still a line. Even without the AN stating that it was their third language and being prepared for the worst... it was almost unreadable: constant errors are /distracting/ when you have to stop and think 'huh - maybe they meant X?' every other paragraph. And the best part was that it said, in the note, that they'd went back to correct grammar. I shudder to think about what it looked like before lol. Hell, I liked what I read so much that I'd offer to beta it for them if I could figure out how to ask without sounding like a bitch in the ao3 comments... but I couldn't bring myself to read more than the first chapter even then.

I can forgive a lot of spelling/grammar mistakes. I've recently pushed through one that had absolutely NO idea how the hell to use punctuation around dialogue and it was wrong every. single. time. (The final quote had a mark on both sides of it "Like this.", okay? It was weird.) Random commas, run on sentences followed by fragments, mixing up the word they meant with something else, the whole thing. (My favourite was Molly 'tooting' at the twins instead of 'tutting' LOL.) But the story was great, so I read it.

I get so annoyed by this. Do not get me wrong, I love Hermione, I do, but if Harry is in another house, why in the world would he befriend Hermione and/or Ron? (Though him befriending Ron, if he's in another house is much rarer).

It'd be nice for authors to try and flesh out the more minor characters. And if the author for whatever reason wanted Harry to have some sort of connection to the Gryffindor House, they could work in a way that wasn't Hermione. But each and pretty much every time, it's always Hermione, without fail.

** Let's see:

-Overt bashing: I may be lenient if you build a character to be evil or even different in an AU like an Utilitarist or truly Evil Dumbledore, just make it believable and unless it's cracky don't use the dumb names 'Dumbles, Moldy Shorts, etc."

No problem with people who dislike him calling him old goat, seems like a perfect political offensive nickname. But then making Ron a crazy, lazy, prejudiced guy just so he can be a nuisance is also not good.

-Wall of Text: It's bad on desktop, bad on mobile and just makes reading a bore, and even difficult learn to use paragraphs and line breaking.

-Enough grammar errors that make it blatantly obvious that there was no proofreading /at all./

No, you don't need to do a complete editorial review, but a spell checker(use Word or Grammarly, or /both,/ just review what they do) and re-reading what you wrote(carefully) once or twice will go a /long/ way at improving readability(and catching other errors).

Also, your !=you're, /please/.

-Harry being an arrogant asshole three seconds after stepping out of his /abusive/ household and receiving his customary nine Heir Rings from the oh-so-polite goblins. Normally also becoming Wizard Bill Gates and then doing nothing with that money.

-Overly complicated Wands, a pet peeve of mine, I can take artifact wands, metal wands(with a very good reason), I can definitely take two different wands bonding with him at the same time.(better option) I can even take two cores and two kinds of wood, depending on how it's presented, but, when you turn up your MMORPG-ness to eleven and have him with three cores, crystals, woods, metals all at the same time it just becomes childish and ridiculous.

One Wood, One Core, Lenght, that's it, simple, effective, with enough symbolism to be significant and yet not going overboard, even the /Elder Wand/ follows these principles, and again, regular wands(as in /not the ELDER WAND)/ don't make a wizard/witch more powerful, they just make some spells easier to learn and cast, and vary in their willingness to change users. Also it may be used to read their character and inclination, that's it.

** I think the only one of those that would actually be a dealbreaker for me would be the Wall of text one. I remember reading one fanfic where every single instance of McGonagall was mispelled as McGonagal, and another where every instance of "Grimmauld Place" was misspelled as "Grimwald Place", ruining the pun of the name(Grim Old Place)

Another dealbreaker for me is violence that exceeds the scope of the characters involved. It's one thing to see a Death Eater rape and murder, but when you have a twelve-year-old threatening to rape an eleven-year-old, the desire to engage in that type of violence is well outside the scope of a typical twelve-year-old's existence.

Similarly, from the same fanfic no less, a group of /Gryffindors/ surrounding an incoming first year and "beating her harshly" seems wildly out of character. Given the characters involved I might have expected Ron Weasley to engage in name calling, but I would not have expected Seamus Finnigan to join beating up a random little girl.

Ugh. Sorry. Remembering that /still/ pisses me off.

Also, I will cautiously occasionally read slash, but if it dips too far into being casually vulgar I'll NOPE out. And it also depends on just how much I've been enjoying the fanfic before then. I actually read all of /Caf√©/ by Pleasedial123, despite dipping a bit into more vulgarity than I'm usually comfortable with. Still baffled by the crossover with a /sports anime/ of all things.

What if Harry and Luna slowly discovered the mysteries of the wizarding world and horcruxes, secrets that certain people wanted hidden.

***** I dunno man. Pregnancy does a number on the body that's hard to ignore. Creating a baby is incredibly delicate work and there are a million instances where the slightest change can totally wreck the baby. Thus you have all those hormones working overtime and have side-effects on your mood. That near constant nausea that some women experience (which is thought to be a defense mechanism against eating something that could harm the baby) puts you off from doing anything. It's pretty much like your own body is saying "baby, baby, baby and nothing else". In the later half, you can't move without feeling a weight in your abdomen, you start feeling the baby's movements after every hour or so, you can't sleep on your back any more, you can't do most activities that involve physical exertion because you get out of breath. Your body is pretty much dedicating itself entirely to making a new human. And it reminds you of that, constantly.

It's not unbelievable that some or all of this would carry over to the magical world too. I wouldn't call it sexist, to be honest. It really do be like that sometimes.

- While I don't mind slashfics as a whole, I tend to avoid them in the HP fandom because like 7/10 slashfics here read like they were written by a sex offender.

- Dry legal nonsense. Like the fics with 400k words, half of which are the same ten or so court cases. It was fun to read the first couple times, but it got boring really fast afterwards.

Here are my recommendations:

linkao3(The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow)

Ik ik the pairing is Tom/Harry but after 400k+ words, it's not been hinted at. The plot is complex and it's overall well written. I especially love the Triwizard tournament in this fic.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

************ linkffn(Stepping Back) is another HPBella fic that I quite enjoyed. Not that good compared to Delenda Est, but it's somewhat readable. Also wouldn't even reccommend reading if you've read another one of the author's works because they're all pretty similar.

A fic that I've recently quite enjoyed is linkffn(I'm not a hero) - it has quite a few cliches including Dumbledore bashing, wrongBWL, Harry being overpowered and my most hated pairing with Daphne Greengrass, but it's done in a very unique way. My main issue with fics of this sort is usually that they're all the same, but this one is just... different. It's also sorta a thinly veiled crackfic.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) is a must-read if you haven't, dimension travel with an older Harry and Sirius who'd been stuck inside the Veil for around five years. Humorous fic, but very well written

The Black Queen series, if you can stomach it. Fem!Harry/Luna, although Jennifer isn't really anything like Harry. Gets pretty effin dark at some points, but it isn't graphic and feels like a well-written edgefic without the edgyness. Or any fic written by the author Silently Watches, really, he manages to take cliches and make them good.

Dethryl's They Shook Hands series, a classic that you probably know. It's like vastly improved canon with Harry being a slytherin, no real cliches or bashing (although they do beat the shit out of Ron a couple times). It even maintains that canon feel.

That's all that's currently on my mind, currently mostly reading crackfics and there isn't really anything to reccommend off those.

Like quite a few of the top HP/DM fics involve one of them /turning/ the other, who is initially very much against it, gay via behaviour that would most likely get you arrested if you tried it in real life. And what seems to be the most popular slash pairing in HP/TMR very often involves flat out stalking levels of obsession, coming from a 65 year old Voldemort to a teenage, canon Harry. Quite often with a lot of noncon.

However, when I first started writing fanfiction, writing in magic could be a bit overwhelming - I didn't feel as though I knew enough about it to realistically write it in and develop a plot with it, so I needed time to get comfortable with it.

Making a non magic au essentially meant I could write with what I know, and it gave me space to focus on the characters. I could learn how to write the different characters, develop their relationships and become comfortable with them - and it was only then that I started adding magic to my fics.

**** I don't read them often but I do like some good non-magical AU. The most fun part for me, is how authors translate canon events that had to do with magic into non-magical ones. It's also fascinating to see characters like Dumbledore and Voldemort (who are almost more ‚Äòmagic' than ‚Äòpeople') in a muggle every-day setting, keeping their core personalities while losing ‚Äòevil dark lord' and ‚Äòomniscient 100 yo grandfather' fantasy aspects, and truly relaying on their brains and not magic to build themselves.

Basically, I find that well written non-magical AUs often give characters more real, fleshed-out personalities. Probably because in muggle AUs you can't fall back on magic as an explanation or solution to anything and any actions in real world have more severe consequences.

She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  Non Magic AUs
#+end_quote

I think this has a lot to do with how people view "characters".

To me (and probably you too if you don't see the point in non Magic AUs) Harry Potter is deeply intertwined with being a wizard, the boy who lived, born to magical parents who fought in a magical world against a Dark Wizard called Voldemort. It's a certain, *existentialistic* viewpoint.

I suspect, people who write non Magic AUs see characters as just their *traits*. So to them, what makes Harry Potter Harry Potter is him approaching situations in a certain way and behaving in a particular fashion (and maybe even more superficially, having certain looks... green eyes, etc). To me that doesn't make much sense and I wouldn't consider them close to equal if they don't have the same background. It makes no sense to me to call any person in a non magical AU Harry Potter, since Harry Potter's identity is so deeply entwined with magic.

**** Because writing a challenging antagonist is hard. Just look at Canon, Lord Voldemort is the most super clich√© Evil Vilain, he is dangerous to Harry because of his Power and followers, but in term of plot? Riddle really likes to Monologue during crucial moment and he does some theatrical to get what he want (I.e CoS Climax and The whole GoF book) If he was as really talented and intelligent as he was was described, in his young, in the books, there would have been no story he would have either won in the sixties or in 1981.

My point to say that it's really hard to write a good antagonist but, not so good enough that the Main Character cannot do anything, or just won because of Luck and plot Armor, so Authors just dumb down their villains (i.e Evil Light Lord Dumbledore being outplayed by 11 year old Lord Hardian Potter).

The Black Queen series by Silently Watches, usually avoided because of the rather extreme trigger warning in the first chapter, followed by the first chapter literally taking place in a child brothel. Although ironically the series is non-explicit and pretty mild by dark!Harry standards. His Voldemort is smart and sane, and actually manages to get extremely far in his conquests, and the OC villain in year six has more personality then any five random fanfics combined despite only appearing like six times.

**** YES thank you I have NEVER heard a good enough defense of his behavior toward ELEVEN YEAR OLD CHILDREN. You had a grudge against some guy's dad when you were in school? I give no fucks. You treat 75% of the first years like actual shot. You wanna be pissy and bitter? Keep it out of the goddamn classroom, you bitchy fuck.

Sorry, but there is ZERO acceptable explanation for Snape's in class behavior. If you are the absolute worst fear of a thirteen year old boy, and seem to be proud of your ability to bully children, you need a fucking psychologist.

And no, his death did NOT absolve him of his shitty adult CHOICES. "It is our choices, not our abilities, that define us." I am probably mangling the quote, but if that's so true, Snape's spying and good actions are very offset by years of deliberate cruelty to children.

YEAH.

Like come on, how the fuck people gonna glorify /Snape/ over JAMES.

Like James Potter was a fucking kid, but then he matured, quit the bullying, saved Snape's life, fell in love with Lily without ever being dishonest or anything, risked jail becoming an animagus to help his friend, *did not become a death eater and a murderer*, died helpless while trying protecting his wife and kid like come the fuck on.

Snape was obsessed over Lily, and I get it, she was his only friend and he came from an abusive family but guess who did too? SIRIUS. Half his family became death eaters, but he didn't, so that's *bullshit*. Snape was obsessed over Lily, and yet he treated her like shit, treated even more like shit the other muggleborns while still trying to be friends with her because fuck logic, he was actively friends with people who would have exterminated them if they could, he willingly became a death eater, and forgive me, one of the most high-ranked ones, he killed people, and just went to Dumbledore when Lily was put in danger. *He was totally cool with her husband and son dying if she was spared*, plus it was a perfect coincidence cause if Voldemort decided to kill Neville instead of Harry he would still be a death eater. He then proceeded to hold a grudge against some kids for like 15 years, treat middle schoolers like shit to the point he was the *worst nightmare possible* of one of them, ruined Lupin's life and career over something ridiculously childish and nonsense and was just generally a piece of shit.

I dont give a fuck if he was with Dumbledore, that doesn't spare him from being a colossal asshole. Period.

He's a magnificently constructed character, very deep and yes, very much in the Grey area as he's not evil nor good, but he's still a gigantic, huge, massive pile of dragon shit. Period.

**** I couldn't agree more. As someone from a family of teachers, his behavior in canon (particularly the books, the movies make him a lot less nasty) is abhorrent and someone like him has no place in any profession that involves the care of children. My take is that between Snape and Dumbledore, /at least/ one of them must be villainous - for Snape to be a decent person, it requires someone to be forcing him to behave as he does. For all that people hate on Harry Crow (and it's far from a perfect story), its handling of Snape was actually excellent: He starts out as a complete shit-stain of a human being, and it's only after gaining some distance from the locus of most of his troubles and being forced to confront his misdeeds that he starts turning his life around.

** I'm not quite there yet, but fics that are too "soft" are probably going to become dealbreakers. I can't think of a better term, but I'd say a fic is "soft" when the characters act overly affectionate, with a fixation on family. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what makes me feel that a fic is too "soft". It's when time travelling Hermione calls Harry and Ron her "pack". It's when everyone, including the guys, are 100% down for being super affectionate, maybe are really into physical contact. It's not to say that men shouldn't be affectionate, that they shouldn't be allowed to be emotional, but it's frustrating when it deviates so heavily from canon. Sure, Sirius might have a fatherly side just waiting to be expressed, and Remus might be a mother hen at heart, but that doesn't mean that they're going to shower that same level of affection on Hermione and Ron, or that both they and Snape all are fixated on family.

There are limits to how many characters can be made very affectionate before you break SoD. To go on further, it seems that it's not just about family, but about making a highly idealised and romanticised family of misfits. There is no real fighting, and yet somehow everyone is sort of broken, all their dark backstories just a part of their emotional trauma that can be overcome gently together. Never mind that there are existing parental units, they don't matter because they don't understand for some reason. It's weird too, because these MCs go about making a family and they're in this limbo of being the sort-of mother figure but not. It's what makes them distinct from something like the Dangerverse, where the main character is clearly the mother figure. Ultimately, it's just wish-fulfillment, but it's still very frustrating because it greatly diminishes the quality of the writing, and many of these fics are otherwise some of the best written fics in their fandoms.

** The spelling is a big one for me, like the correct spellings and names are literally there in the source material! There's no excuse for "Alistair", or "stupify" etc.

The worst thing for me though, is continuity errors. I exclusively read completed fics, so I marathon it all and don't wait weeks or months for each chapter like some do. That means that I notice when you get things wrong about your own fic! The worst example was a fic where Harry was called Hardwin (as his birth name), and then part way through the author just... forgot?? And Harry was now Harrison instead.

That's the most extreme example, but errors come up a lot in fics, where the author will describe/mention something in one chapter, and then a few chapters later that thing will be shown to have not happened, or will happen again. I don't write fics, but surely as an author you should know what's happened in your own story? And if you have a long break between writing chapters, then go back and read what you've written and remind yourself what happened! I don't understand it.

Edit: These aren't deal breakers for me, more just pet peeves. The only real deal breaker I have is poor writing, and my biggest hate is authors notes in the middle of the chapter (sometimes even in the middle of a sentence!). Just put them at the beginning or the end of the chapter where they belong; if you need an A/N in the middle of your writing to explain yourself, you're writing it wrong.

(but equally frustrating if they don't update for months on end. ugh)

I've actually noticed that when reading fics being written the standard I look for is much lower, because it's more tolerable to read chapter by chapter instead of reading a whole story filled with mistakes, spelling errors and just writing that doesn't have the best quality. Perhaps give it a try once you exhaust your supply of finished fics, it's extremely exciting to be thrown so many amazing fics that aren't quite finished yet, and just make sure you read things that were last updated in 2020!

Using mental illness as nothing more than a trope (e.g. sentences like "I was feeling depressed, so I slit one of my wrists", things that reduce depression and other disorders to nothing more than a trait that makes your character more "appealing" or "tragic".)

Wolfstar

Totally unrealistic and OOC crying (I even once saw a story that made ùòöùòØùò¢ùò±ùò¶ cry after seeing that Harry was abused. Like, seriously? There's a line between "emotional" or H/C and just wanting to see everyone have a crying fit!)

*** Piggybacking on the monologue thing: endless internal monologue is also really irritating. I don't need to hear the minutiae of someone's thought process. I can figure out the motivation with an action or a quick bit of dialogue. Instead, there's these big word count fics that are page after page after chapter of endless, droning thoughts.

I will skim them, and keep going if it's just a once in a while thing. If it's endless, I'll just check out and find something else to read.

*** Why wouldn't there be a magical nobility? There's still one in Britain today, and even in countries where it was abolished, it is treated as a honorific, despite having no power behind it anymore. It's been a hundred years since monarchy was abolished here and the titles are still around. The Bavarian Royal family even maintains their knightly order.

Especially since the Wizengamot is basically the title of the noble assembly from the days before the Norman conquest.

If anything, the absence of nobility would be more immersion breaking. It does not have to have power, but it should be there.

**** The strongest indicator is that no one is referred to by any hereditary titles. Dumbledore's titles and positions all appear to be earned, he is the Chief of the Wizengamot, even though his parents don't seem to have been anyone special. Percival Dumbledore likely would not have gone to Azkaban for using magic on the Muggles who harmed his daughter if they had any real influence. And there's no way the Malfoys wouldn't use titles/honorifics if they had them. Voldemort's the only one with an honorific and he seized that for himself by being powerful and scary.

And besides that, governmental structures are generally more pragmatic than people assume. The reality of wizarding society with its high literacy and social mobility would be very unlikely to support a de jure aristocracy. Additionally, power is almost always consolidated around how the militaries are structured. When your military strength relies primarily on elite warriors with expensive weaponry, you have aristocracy, when the military draws from a more general populace, a society becomes more democratic. In the Wizarding world, magical strength is a matter of dedication, not birth. That would likely pull people away from hereditary titles/ positions. A de facto oligarchy is likely, but hereditary aristocracy seems quite unlikely to fit in the Wizarding World.

Want the Weasleys out? Well, an abused child won't think kindly of you if you dismiss his abuse like Molly did with the barred Windows. Bam, Harry does not want to be near the adult Weasleys anymore without making up some stupid "stealing the inheritance/forced marriage" plot. Ron and Hermione? Harry got tired of their fights about their pets and hangs out of Katie Bell instead.

Just because Voldemort was defeated (which wasn't even guaranteed at that point, there was no body after all) that didn't mean that the danger was over. The Lestranges demonstrated that quite well a few days later.

Pettigrew was a clear and present danger (he demonstrated that quite well with his bit of mass murder) and Sirius acted to stop him. He left Harry with a trustworthy person (although why Hagrid was there in the first place is questionable).

Meanwhile, Ron was only mentioned occasionally in passing until he appeared in person to tell Harry and Hermione that he wasn't good enough to be their friend.

(Bear in mind, this took place shortly after Ron forced himself to stand on a broken leg to put himself between his best friend and a seemingly insane mass murderer. I know that Sirius didn't actually intend Harry any harm, but the trio didn't know that, and it in no way diminishes the loyalty and courage that took.)

I think that's kind of dangerous & sometimes it really bothers me when I'm reading a story and somehow Harry is being raped now & there was no warning.

Maybe we can make different tags for different "types" of non-consent but they still need to be there. For Harry Potter specifically there can be "Raped by Love Potion" or "Raped by Imperious Curse" if calling them both magical roofies is too much.

*** I've written a Draco/Hermione oneshot once where Draco pretends to have fallen in love with Hermione so that he can spy on Harry and his friends for Voldemort.

Hermione immediately sees through him but plays along, until Christmas comes along and she sends him a present. She only played along so that she could get her "present" through the wards into Malfoy Manor, because it's an improvised timebomb.

I wrote it in a reddit comment ages ago and can't find it again...

** I mean, spelling and grammar obviously. A few small mistakes are fine, but there is a big difference between a few small typos and someone not knowing/caring about it.

But besides that, bashing is a huuge deal-breaker for me, and that's why I prefer ao3 because it's usually tagged so I can avoid it. I also dislike characters being ooc just for the sake of conflict, which usually ties in with bashing.

There's also, sometimes I get a feeling that the events just... don't make sense. Characters do things without clear motives, or things happen with no clear reason, things like that. Usually, things like that break my suspension of disbelief and I can't continue with the story. I get that fanfiction is wish-fulfilment for some people, and it's partly for me too, but I can't get into some sort of super smackdown or harem or something, because it's usually not believable.

** I can deal with walls of text, poor spelling, and poor grammar. In approximate order from least to most offensive:

- A character suddenly becoming aware that their friends have faults and dropping them because of that.

- Namecalling. Repeatedly calling Dumbledore something like Dumbles or Dumbledork gets old fast.

- Character bashing that twists everything the author's disliked character does into something that's malevolent or stupid.

  #+begin_quote
    What recently began grating my nerves is how fanfic authors interpret and bash Molly Weasley. Yes, she has seven children. Yes, her family is not well-off. Yes, she screams when upset at her children. All of these do not equal her being a conniving woman or a poor mother. Molly and Arthur raised children during two wars, have enemies that would gladly ruin their reputation, and tried to kill one of their children in pursuit of that goal.\\
    If anything I think it's time there were a fanfic that explored Molly Weasley from the perspective of a woman dealing with trauma from losing her twin brothers, the threats to the lives of herself, her husband, and her children, along with whatever happens to her, Arthur and their family that we don't get to learn about because the series is mainly limited to third-person from Harry's perspective.
  #+end_quote

- Harry becoming superpowered, fluent in magical languages, lord and heir of the founders, Merlin, and all of the houses that somehow have empty Wizengamot seats.

- Magical creatures being so overwhelmed by being treated respectfully that they bless, bow to, gift precious heirlooms, and name the character a whole list of titles.

  #+begin_quote
    Magical creatures have lives and personalities. They have hopes and dreams. A character isn't owed anything for recognizing that. (That goes for real life too. Being respectful of someone different than you doesn't mean that you deserve thanks and praise.)
  #+end_quote

- Harems that bring nothing to the plot except to show how much property (because that's how it seems to usually come about) Harry has.

- Mpreg

- A Muggleborn or Halfblood character finding out that they're actually Pureblood.

  #+begin_quote
    The author usually tries to make it that the character's magical prowess is due to their genealogy instead of any hard work on their part. This tends to come along with Death Eater sympathies.
  #+end_quote

- Excusing the actions and beliefs of a Death Eater so that they can have a relationship with the author's character of choice.

*Casual violence that brings nothing to the plot.

- The Dursleys neglect/abuse of Harry being described in minute and graphic detail.

  #+begin_quote
    For that matter I can't stand that fanfic authors feel a need to make what Harry went through more extreme. Neglect and physical abuse is bad. Harry doesn't need to be raped and brutalized to be worthy of help.
  #+end_quote

- Someone being assaulted and repeatedly saying no, and the author twisting things so that they end up liking it and getting into a relationship with the rapist.

- Sexual relationships between children.

- Sexual relationships between a child and adult.

- Incest.

***** To be fair, Australian is mostly a mix between British and American with some unnecessary slang tossed in. Depending on the time period, it could be entirely British or a weird mix.

We use a lot of standard British, so mum, colour, et cetera. However, it is sidewalk for us (with pavement being something else). You really cannot get much wrong, no matter what you say. On another note, depends on who. My Nan speaks purely British with no Americanism at all (which makes sense as her grandmother was British) whereas my aunt (from my mother) mostly uses American slang and phrases.

**** Hello there, just wanted to say a few words!

I live in Brazil, and that's about as far away from British culture as you can get.

I will still go out of my way to research up British culture and traditions and words and phrases and expressions and economics and geography and landscapes and flora and fauna and everything else because I want my story to /feel/ like it's happening in Britain, and not any other place.

If you do care about your writing and making the story and characters feel authentic, you will put hours into it, and /yes,/ *just for the sake of fanfiction.* Because fanfiction is still a story being told, and /that/ is a passion that has been going on for a very long time. The very best storytellers either create completely new worlds, or it adapts perfectly to one that already exists, even if it is our own planet Earth.

In my opinion that's one of the key things that divides good and bad fanfiction. The effort the author put into making something believable.

Thank you for reading.

***** I have to say I disagree with the bit about how not using British English means the writer put in less effort.

I too live in a culture that's quite different from British culture and most of the English I know is American English (though I probably use a mix of both British and American when writing - read too much Harry Potter fics :))

I agree that not knowing basic geography, history, and commonly used words etc is lazy writing, but sometimes, for people to whom English isn't their first language, it might not even occur to them that British English uses different words - and hence they don't even know what to look for. For example, I had no idea British English had a different word for "high school" until I read this comment, so if I ever needed to write that word in a fic, it wouldn't even occur to me to look it up.

Also, I think "effort put into making something believable" is rather subjective. If someone writes a fic where the Dursleys abuse Harry and they put in hours and hours into researching different types of abuse and how that affects a child, then I think it should still be said they put in effort, regardless of whether they use "Mom" instead of "Mum." The research done for fics depends on what the writer wants to do with it. If they want the reader to feel like they're there with the characters in Britain, then yes, they should research everything they can about the culture, manners of speech etc. If they want to focus on an abused Harry's growth and how he heals, then they should focus more on researching child abuse and its short/long-term effects, even if it means that sometimes the language they use is 'wrong'.

The effort put in writing may be a determining factor for whether something's good or bad, but I think /where/ the effort goes is subjective.

That said, I completely understand how using American English instead of British English, especially if it happens consistently and with things that seem pretty obvious (like "Mom" instead of "Mum") would be jarring for a reader, so yeah, to each their own :)

"but can't be bothered to look up British English for hours on the Internet just for the sake of fanfiction..."

I wasn't pointing out the /language/ issue, but rather the fact that he was discrediting people who put hours of effort into research and adapting their story to match the place and people in it. Discrediting the effort just because they are writing fanfiction is pretty rude imo. It's something that they put a lot of effort into, no matter the language or method of writing.

******* oops sorry. Must have misunderstood your comment.

But as for the other comment: I don't think they meant to discredit people who put in effort (and neither do I). It sounded more like they were upset at /getting/ discredited because of the use of American English instead of British English.

Of course, writers who look up the details to make their fic believable deserve to be acknowledged for their efforts (and I expect the amount of research they do to write their fic in a different culture would be massive), but that doesn't mean someone who /didn't/ look up the differences in language put less effort in their fic. As I said, their focus of research could have been completely different, or they may have just written their fic lightly, just as a way to relieve stress. I think the commenter was upset that the original commenter made it sound like the use of American English meant overall less effort and lazy writing (which usually implies bad writing as well). (Not that the comment was offending - different things bother different people, and I expect if I was more familiar with British English I'd find American English jarring too.)

******* Hi there. First of all: I was not discrediting anyone. I was jsut expressing how unfair the first comment was as a foreign writer.

I was totally pointing out the language issue: I'm sorry but I'm not gonna waste hours searching every single word I use in a dictionnary to see if there is an equivalent in British English and vice versa in American English, that's all I'm saying. To me, it's a TRIVIAL issue and I don't see how it should weigh on whether a story is worth the read or not.

I was in no way discrediting authors searching up useful things like geography or history when writing a fanfiction: I'm one of those.

But still: fanfics are for me a hobby, though I'll look up places and facts, I will in no way waste my time in proofreading my work to make sure it's American/British. That's what I meant by "wasting time for the sake of fantiction".

******** No one is forcing you to research for those words that have multiple spellings or variations. The language issue doesn't really weigh on whether a story is worth the read or not. (At least, to most readers)

I think the OP was just commenting on how jarring seeing 'mom' or 'high-school' or 'fall' can be to a British reader. It's their preference.

I still think 'wasting time for the sake of fanfiction' isn't very nice, and even if I understand that you don't want to proofread your work to make sure it's British, there are people that go that extra length because they want to. Examples include word choice, vocabulary, and certain kinds of punctuation.

While it isn't a problem for many readers, some writers choose to completely pick one language and its writing customs and stick with it. I'm doing so for continuity's sake, and because I want it to feel more British.

So just don't glare at people for doing what you consider to be a waste of time, even if it might be. It's down to personal choice and tastes, and there isn't much you can do about it. The OP says that when the story feels 'American', its a deal-breaker, and that's his problem.

*** I'll abandon fics for excessive Americanisation.

Using "mom" is moderately acceptable depending on context because it does get used (at least where I'm from), however most of the established characters are from parts of the UK that don't use it, so it is mildly OOC.

What I can't stand is the assumption made by many fiction writers that students at Hogwarts must find some way to pay tuition fees - that is so out of kilter with UK culture that it frustrates me. Any fic where Harry has to /get a job to pay for school/ loses my interest.

** Wall of text is the big one for me.

My other one is if something isn't a very interesting prospect or the start isn't great and it exceeds 200,000 words. This is mainly because I have a problem with not finishing books and if it gets to a point I can't keep reading halfway through it just stays as a tab for the next x amount of time until I finish forcing my way through it. Worth noting this happens even with books I do like so I typically try to read at most books of average novel length (80-120 thousand words) or shorter.

Also for the longest time one-shots bothered the hell out of me. I read them now (out of necessity in some fandoms) but still am not overly fond of them.

First person perspective. I have never found a well written first person fanfic.

Harems, especially when they're all underage.

God damn lists. Lists are not stories. We don't need a 87 page list of every property and asset which Harry has inherited. In gamer!Harry fics we don't need a new list every time he adds a skill point or levels up or learns a new skill.

Unjustified godmode. Take the fic Core Threads for example. There is no damn reason for Harry to be able to do everything he can. He's on the train to Hogwarts for the first time and already he has fully mastered wandless magic, fully mastered occlumency and legilimency, has an entire mindscape in his head that he can pull his friends into and then slow down time so that they can train for hours or even days in just a few seconds, and has the magic ability to increase other peoples magical power.

** I'll say the normal stuff like bashing for the sake of bashing, idiot Ron, goddess Hermione, infallible Harry, manipulative Dumbledore(although I accept it to a degree since that is part of his character, as long as it's not taken too far).

For Fanfiction in general, one thing I personally hate is stupidly long authors notes, expecially in fics that have the MC have a lot of powers, or something like the Gamer. It annoys me greatly that a third of a fanfic is just repeating shit we already know.

I also hate when they add a song to it, but include the bloody lyrics several times. I can accept a one off if it's important to the story, or if it's a musical type of story like High School Musical, or Glee. I don't personally read those stories, but I can see the point, but padding up fics like Naruto, HP, Worm(this one has exceptions though as, in the words of Clockblocker, powers are bullshit. I think there are a few Worm stories that have taylor with a musical power), and such with songs is also annoying.

I guess when a writer adds a bunch of things that aren't story related, or just repeating the same stuff annoys me greatly. Stories that have 100k words should mean I enjoy 100k words of story, not 60k, and music. This is a book, not a musical. Put the title of the song there, sure, give us a choice. Don't fill half your story with songs though, it's annoying.

** While I can take the occasional misspelling/grammar problems, if a fic is full of them it makes it very hard to read which will probably make me stop bothering to read the fic.

I also take issue with certain themes and ships, or methods of portraying ships. For example, I stay away from noncon -- while it can be written well (hurt/comfort as a result of a traumatic event), 99% of fics portray it very poorly, and sometimes in outright bad taste (a somewhat common theme in HG/Death Eater). I also don't read mpreg, and stay away from abusive relationships. There's also a lot of ships I don't read, but few ships are outright dealbreakers. LV/anyone (if that is the main focus of a fic -- I don't mind background LV/BB or such as long as I don't have to read about it in detail), teacher/student. For a time, this included Jily, but while I still don't read it as main focus, it's no longer a complete dealbreaker for me. I also (usually) don't read SS slash fics or Severus/Minerva, but don't mind him shipped with a female OC, Narcissa, (non-teacher/student) Hermione, Lily or most other females in fics that make the ship work (the ones mentioned are the ones I see most likely as workable). I typically read Snape-centric, which is why there's additional dealbreakers shipwise for him in particular.

I have read fics violating my "dealbreakers", but only in rare circumstances -- if a fic has one of the things above, it is very unlikely that I'm going to read it.

2) Characters being a dick because- all those Dumbledore being a complete dick fanfics honestly almost never bother to find a realistic explanation for his behavior, for example, he already have many positions in which he rules the government and has access to the money collected from taxes, ignoring the fact that he don't really expends that much money to begin with, why would he need to steal from Harry.

3) Every other characters becoming bloody idiots powerless just for the MC to seen better in comparison.

4) The plot being pushed away to make space to the romantic interest.

3) FemHarry. (Note that I am okay with it if canon!Harry exists in the story as well, like in a dimension-crossing story where he meets his alternate, or canon!Harry gets genderswapped or something.)

2) visual annoyances: wall of text, all bold/italic/underlined (the entire story), all capitalized, etc. Mostly since I read late at night, anything that makes fanfic hard to read is usually a deal breaker.

3) really really long fanfics with no plot or lack of conflict/tension: cute one shots without these are fine, but when I'm facing a 100 ch fanfic and I get the sense that it's either going to take a really long time or be a really slow burn, I usually just skip to the end

4) really really long fanfics with around little writing (i.e. 100 words) per chapter. Annoying to read on mobile, even more annoying on the computer. Especially since I usually only read on [[https://fanfiction.et][fanfiction.]]net and they don't have the option of reading the entire text all at once

5) Canon: also more of a personal thing. For me, fanfiction is for deviating from canon, so if it's just repeating what's in the books, why bother reading again?

6) When someone is wildly out of character and it's unexplained or badly written.

7) crossovers? usually I filter it out, but I haven't liked any of the ones I've read. I've nothing against them, just not a big fan so I try to avoid them. Feel free to recommend ones you like though and I might check it out.

Additionally, I can't stand in romance fics where it's a slow burn, and just as the characters seem to like each other, instead of a slow realization of mutual feelings, the author switches POV for one paragraph to explicitly tell the reader. I'm all down for POV switch if it's well written and adds to the story, but it usually makes the writing thinner when I've seen it.

** Hmm deal breakers...

The author not knowing the difference between ancestor and descendant. Oh wait, that was canon.

Lets do one for each horcrux.

1. Bad spelling/typos. Spellcheckers exist for a reason, use them. There is no excuse not to pass your chapter through a spell checker before posting. Most spell checkers also allow you to add words to the dictionary, so you can add Hogwarts. After triple checking you have to spelling right. A beta would be even better, but I can understand not everyone can find one.
2. 99% Canon rehashes.
3. If the summary uses "Watch as Harry...."
4. If the story doesn't explain the premise in the summary, or at least within the first chapter. And no "Something unusual happens when Harry enters the first task." Is not a premise, it's click-bait.
5. Harems. Just... no. The only reason to read them is because they tend to feature EVERY vaguely female individual even hinted at in the books, so they sometimes catch the rarer pairings that just don't show up in single romance fics. But that doesn't change the fact they are universally shit.
6. Slash. Not even going to start. Do you know how hard it is to find a decent Tom Riddle of Voldemort mentor fic, that doesn't deteriorate into slash at some point? And some of them insist on compounding it with Harems. All male harems. That consist of every male wizard ever mentioned. Also mpreg has a tendency to raise it's ugly head when/if the author ever realizes that a society cannot survive if every single member is gay.
7. Genderbend. The vast majority seem to just be an excuse to write slash without ACTUALLY being slash.

There's a reason why S.P.E.W. doesn't work in the books. Hermione was 14 years old at the time and was basing all of her assumptions off of one point of view. Because that's what young teens do. They tend to stick with what they know until they learn to search out other opinions.

In regards to sex, I hate underage sex. Any characters having sex before 17 makes me feel gross reading it. Also any sexual or romantic relationships between newly 17 year olds and their professors/adults in their lives. These people literally witnessed them grow up. Any bamboozling with time turners/magical blood/etc. to make a character actually 17 to justify an of age relationship is also creepy. If a character is outwardly presenting themselves as underage, then adults around them should treat them as such.

All of the things I've said above are deal-breakers for me but the thing I truly loathe to see in fanfic is rape. It's never done right and used as a plot device for two scenes. The scene of the rape and the scene where The Hero comforts them. Never after that unless it comes up in an argument. I instantly will stop reading if rape comes up in any way now. Especially if it's added to a scene that otherwise stays canonically the same. Why, in your post war fic, are you adding that Hermione was raped in Malfoy Manor on top of the torture? Does it actually add anything to the story other than a stereotypical ‚ÄúI was raped so now I don't want to have sex or have men show comfort towards me‚Äù (not that that doesn't happen when people are raped, but it seems to be the only way fanfic authors write victims of rape)?

** agree with numbers 2 and 3, and sometimes 1. I've read a very good fic where there was no grammar mistake at all, except of your/you're. that was so weird, that they knew how to write anything else but made errors in these. and it was a repeat occurrence, not just one time mistake. (this one didn't bother me though, but it does bother me if there are too many mistakes) I can stomach a few.

I always take the name mistakes are by someone who only saw the movies... Mr. Long Bottom. lol. there was a fic I stopped reading because of the names. but that was like 70% of the names spelled incorrectly. and it also had bad grammar.

OC's are my deal-breaker tbh. I just don't like them, I don't read them, I don't go searching for them. they just exist.

second person POV. "you wake up in the dormitory...". why does that even exist? I also prefer third person to first, but I will still read first person, since that's a reasonable POV. but second? I can't even stomach one sentence.

bad format; lots of crossovers (or just one crossover with a fandom I either don't know or don't like); million tags.

summaries that start with a "what if...". aye, nope. and it isn't about that I don't like AU's or stories that are what if stories. isn't every fanfic like that? but in a summary it just sounds silly and I keep thinking that they can't write a good fic when they start their summary with a what if, so why bother.

** Excessive angst. You see it a lot in fics where romance takes a focus, but having your protagonist hamstrung by something stupid does not appeal to me.

Author notes treating something fanon or that they made up as canon or going after reviewers.

Divergence fics that just change everything.

Love potions as a plot device, especially from Weasleys.

Forced insertion of characters.

Too many OCs. One or two might work, but 5, 10. Especially those OCs that are overly skilled.

Stealing dialogue, ideas, or actions from other characters to give to your favorite character. I didn't like it in the movies with Hermione, I'm not going to like it in fanfiction.

Using the movies too much.

** Kids being abundantly more intelligent than adults and being able to outwit adults easily.

Sorry, but a great deal of the joy of re-reading the books as an adult comes from speculating about all the things the adults were plotting and aware of behind the scenes, that the kids were completely oblivious to. Especially in the earlier books - it's great to be able to look back at Book 1 Dumbledore, knowing how his character developed.

This overlaps a lot with bashing - of Dumbledore in particular. I haven't come across any Weasley-bashing fics, but I suspect that's because I'd drop them instantly.

I also agree with people saying they don't like Harry/Hermione. I appreciate that being a good example of platonic male/female friendship, and it would have to be extremely sensitively handled for me to enjoy a fic that did away with that dynamic.

** 1) alphas/omega/betas in werewolf packs. Stupid repetitive trope based on a pack theory that was disproved 30 years ago. No, your werewolves won't be fighting for "dominance" every 3 seconds or bullying each other into submission, or there wouldn't be a pack, and no, no dog animagi would be either, especially if they still had a human brain. At most they wouldn't be able to communicate very effectively.

2) Animagi dogs/wolves/werewolves that can hear/smell way better than all the other animagi despite them all being deer, rats or cats, which all have equal or better smell/hearing. And while we're at it, yes dogs are colorblind. No, that doesn't mean they only see shades of grey.

3) Over board bashing. As in, Dumbledore locking someone in his office to starve them into agreeing to do something. It's overboard, and completely against character, not to mention completely unnecessary. You want to bash, go ahead, but do it in a way that still fits with both logic and that character.

4) "WHAT?!" He exclaimed... every 2 sentences. Find another way to show surprise and make realistic dialogue.

** Fics that dedicate a full novel's worth of writing to what the main character is doing /before they even start Hogwarts/. There is literally nothing that a 10 year old or younger can realistically do thats worth writing 100k words about. This is also usually a good indicator that the entire story is going to be slow and overwritten, or run out of plot points after 1st year and don't know where to go from there.

** Weasly

Parseltongue and Parselmouth used incorrectly - honestly the amount of fics that do this! I'll be reading a great fic and I'll be genuinely surprised when they mix the words up.

Stupid/Arrogant Harry- Even if Harry's canonically not the most dedicated to his schoolwork, I like my smart Harry's

Reading a Snape Mentor or even just a normal fic, and then suddenly SNaPe iS hArrYs bIo DaD. In the middle of the fic. I don't know if it adds any plot points but I usually nope out by then. Seriously, if such a major divertion isn't in the summary or in the A/N or mentioned near the beginning of the story, it turns me off :/

I would also say bad grammar but I'm pretty proud/disgusted at the way I can power through bad writing

** Some hard no tags for me: 1) mpreg - not sure why but this is an immediate pass for me 2) Snape/student. I haven't seen any Dumbledore/student but that would be another pass. 3) explicit sexual abuse is just not something I want to read. I can sort of deal with it as a background element for the emotional fallout.

Edit: 4) WBWL - again not sure why but I can't start reading these.

Edit2: 5) fem!Harry. I don't want to read about little girls suffering the way canon Harry does.

** Mpreg and underage.

I'm a slash reader so I've happened to fall on some mpreg stories and I don't understand why it's necessary, if you want them to have a kid make them adopt. They never even clarify where the baby comes from, my guy doesn't have a vagina so is the kid coming out of his ass?

Also underage seems to be glossed over in a lot of fanfics? Like "Harry licked his blood red lips, the light hit his luscious body as he moved through the room", meanwhile Harry is 11.

I don't remember having a luscious body at eleven? Describing a literal child as sexy is the grossest thing you can do.
