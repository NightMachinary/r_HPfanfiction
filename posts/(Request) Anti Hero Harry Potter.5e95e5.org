Has anyone written a version of Harry in which the Horcrux has a greater influence?

Not to the point where he becomes murderous rapey scum.

Just a more Malcolm Reynolds type person, if you stay out of his way and don't cross him your fine. But if you do your going to get hurt or killed.


** That idea makes me think of deadpool xD Harry as deadpool would be hilarious

*** Not quite Deadpool!Harry, but in "Thinking in Little Green Boxes", Deadpool raises Harry. It's quite hilarious.

** How have you not read linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) ?????? I just finished reading it and I think it fits what you're asking for perfectly. I found Harry to be very sympathetic, but he is most definitely an anti-hero.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

  Growing up on London's streets and having nobody to rely on has led to a different from canon Harry Potter start his first year at Hogwarts. Add an ancient and mysterious pendant (a Gorgoneion), pureblood pricks, a scheming headmaster and a goddess as his mother-figure in the mix and you have a genuine Alternate Universe. Slytherin, independent, grey Harry. Neville is the BWL.
