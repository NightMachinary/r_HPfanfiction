So I've been reading some old fanfics again (just finished the methods of rationality) but I've forgotten the name of another favourite of mine.

In it voldemort won, he's the the school head. In it he helps Harry Potter, I believe there was quite some dialogue where they are involved in political stuff with some European countries. Voldemort is also quite a pagan, Harry learns stuff from him, later on he flees and I believe goes to durmstrang where he also learns runes and what not.

Maybe it rings a bell with anyone?


** Sounds a bit like Prince of the Dark Kingdom, been a while since I last read it (it's also abandonned at this point)
