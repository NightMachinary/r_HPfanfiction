The vagaries surrounding the tournament annoy me. Any fics out there where Harry cheats, tricks, and otherwise works around the rules of the tournament?

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** Assuming Harry just wants to survive against a dragon and doesn't care about anything else at all: can't he just walk in, set foot in the arena and then concede immediately? Sure, he'll get all zeroes, but who cares? Certainly not Harry.

*** Someone please tell me this really exists. Harry has no business competing in the first place. The adults should be telling him to concede, and Harry should go along with it.

**** I've seen a couple where either Harry tries this and doesn't get away with it, or the adults want him to but Harry is â€˜so independent and takes orders from no one' and as is common in those types of stories OPs his way past all the obstacles. (Probably leaves Ron to drown too because Weasley bashing :/ )
