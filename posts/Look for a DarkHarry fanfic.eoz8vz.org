I'm trying to find a fanfic I once read featuring a dark, or at least morally ambiguous, Harry. If I remember rightly it was on [[https://Fanfic.net][Fanfiction.net]], was a one-shot and had Dumbledore's Army develop into Harry's own private militia. I think there was something about a phoenix tatoo. Can any of you help me please?


** Anything else that might help narrow it down?
