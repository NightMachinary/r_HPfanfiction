** In addition to...well, the baffling premise being what it is... None of these are general bird behaviors.

Birds don't lay eggs when frightened or startled (a ton of work goes into an egg, it's not spontaneous).

Most birds don't really obsess over shiny items - that's what makes it a key feature of magpies, crows, and ravens.

Additionally, for the most part, a bird only feeds baby birds like that - not their partners.

*** Yeah. I know what you're saying and agree but the frightened egg-laying kind of exist as a thing in cartoons and stuff.
