I'd like to read a work that's six chapters of fluff and then turns into a hardboiled thriller partway through the work. Or something that starts as a romantic comedy and ends up a horror story. Any length, any ships, any completion status, preferably good.

Thanks in advance!


** I'm going to be slightly controversial and mention A Black Comedy. It starts out as a fratbro slapstick sort of comedy, but ends up developing a surprisingly solid plot around chapter 10 or so. And while it never really stops being, ultimately, a comedy, there are a few darker scenes, and the more serious aspects of the plot are all the more jarring in tone thanks to the contrast.

Obligatory warning that the fic's comedy is in a very specific style -- that fratbro slapstick I mentioned earlier, with all it implies -- and is very much not PC, so, uh, fair warning for that I guess.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) -- let's see if the bot's working again.

*** The duel between Harry/Sirius and Voldemort shocked me in how straight it was played.

*** I already read that one, but thanks for the rec! :)

Yes, the jarring aspect is what I'm looking for, although I'm looking for works where the jarring aspect felt a bit more permanent, kinda like a reverse of RubbishRobots' /That Which Holds the Image/, which starts out as a horror but changes tone as soon as>! Dr Who enters the picture!<.

** The classic: HPMoR. The scene in Madame Malkin's with Draco (Chapter 5) is one of my all-time favorite funny moments.

​

#+begin_quote
  Professor McGonagall slowly turned to look at Harry, her expression chilly. “I leave you alone for six minutes. Six minutes, Mr. Potter, by the very clock.”

  “I was only joking around,” Harry protested, as the sounds of hysterical laughter went on nearby.

  “/Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted into Gryffindor!/ Joking around /isn't enough/ to /do/ that!” Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking breaths. “What part of ‘get fitted for robes' sounded to you like /please cast a Confundus Charm on the entire universe!/ ”

  “He was in a situational context where those actions made internal sense---”

  “No. Don't explain. I don't want to know what happened in here, ever. Whatever dark power inhabits you, it is /contagious/, and I don't want to end up like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam Malkin and her two poor assistants.”

  Harry sighed. It was clear that Professor McGonagall wasn't in a mood to listen to reasonable explanations. He looked at Madam Malkin, who was still wheezing against the wall, and Malkin's two assistants, who had now /both/ fallen to their knees, and finally down at his own tape-measure-draped body.

  “I'm not quite done being fitted for clothes,” Harry said kindly. “Why don't you go back and have another drink?”

*** There were so many hilarious scenes in that work. I'll never understand why so many people are absolutely enraged by it. Even if it's not everybody's cup of tea, it's still much better than the average long fic in this fandom. I felt it captured the whimsy of the original series and has by far the best Voldemort in fanfiction. (Though if anybody wants to throw down a counter example I'm always happy to read about one :)

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
