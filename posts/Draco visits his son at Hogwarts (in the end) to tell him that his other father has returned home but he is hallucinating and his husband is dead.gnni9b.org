Might have been a drarry fic, definitely on Wattpad, AO3 or fanfiction.net. Most likely on Wattpad or ff.net. Draco goes to Hogwarts and visits his son to tell him his father has returned home after being missing for a while, but the son is confused and then they realize that Draco was hallucinating and his husband never returned.
