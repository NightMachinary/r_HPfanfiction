Hermione doesn't have to be the main character, but can be. No perfect Hermione in every way.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, can be any length. Can be old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated. But if not that's fine.

NO Weasley Bashing. No Ron abusing Hermione, no Ginny giving Harry love potions, no Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune cliche.

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes

  He glances at the boxy too-uniform numbers flashing on the face of Richard's radio. It's nearly noon, and he should be getting ready to leave; but there is still a harsh tension in his shoulders and neck that he wants to work out before Hermione finds him. It is, after all, Tuesday; and while his Tuesdays were designated ‘tea with Helen' days previously, they are now ‘lunch with Granger' days, ever since the chance meet-up with the Weasel's wife and the insufferable swot herself.

  When Hermione agrees to go to Bulgaria with Sirius to help him in his hunt for Peter Pettigrew the summer after third year, she never imagined she would discover herself, make new friends, and fall in love with Viktor Krum. However, the golden warmth of summer has its shadows, and Hermione finds herself on the edge of something much bigger and more sinister than she ever could have imagined.

** I have a go-to rec list specfically for this request. I selected the critical fics from the bashing ones.

I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

-This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. She gets better though. Ron/Daphne pairing. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

-linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5269970/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Third-Key-Reloaded]]) OP!Harry, Hermione's a bit controlling in this, Ron's a good friend.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione in 6th year. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]] but I can't say all of them are bash-free.

  Just what the world needs, another Harry and Hermione fall in love in the tent fic. But! Hopefully this is done with heart and definitely no bashing.   They were a few spots away from the last location they were together with Ron, but it didn't stop Hermione from glancing up at the sound of breaking twigs, or the rustle of leaves, or the quieter whispers of wind. By some animal instinct, every time she glanced up he did too. He couldn't help but think of frightened deer, their ears pert and rotating, eyes focused, alert, listening for wolves. The main difference for them was that they wanted the wolf to come. His glanced away from the empty forest to Hermione's dark eyes, still searching. "He won't find us." He used the sharp tone again, he still didn't mean it that way. Her eyes moved to his, injured, her mouth bowed in pain. He felt a stab of remorse. To his surprise she moved closer to him instead of turning away. Their spheres of sadness had been separate the last few days, their moroseness quiet, however loud it felt inside his head.

  She was their best friend, a third of them; she made them whole. There was nothing they would not do for her or her for them. Not a single thing.

  Neville Longbottom took in a deep, satisfying breath and looked down at his feet. His new shoes broke up the yellow warning lines at the edge of the platform, but he didn't move back. The pristine brogues made the mottled, old paint on the ground look worse and Neville wondered if he had ever looked better than any place he was before, but he still didn't move. He couldn't.

#+begin_quote
  When Hermione Jean Granger was one year old her parents died in a car crash. She knew all about it because she asked a lot of questions and her aunt and uncle believed in answering them.Why is the sky blue, auntie? Why are b's and d's like in the mirror? Where do songs come from? Why did Jenny Hopkins call me a--?Her father had accelerated into a green light, like you were supposed to. (By the time she was eight, Hermione had the driver's rulebook memorized). A truck driver, going the opposite way, hadn't stopped at a red.Hermione had been strapped in a car seat in the back, her aunt and uncle told her. She hadn't been hurt at all except for the scar that stood out, jagged, on her forehead.As Hermione grew up into a gangly, bushy-haired, buck-toothed wonder, she thought she could remember it-- a glaring green light, a rush of cold air.

** You have a good list here! I bookmarked a few that look up my alley. Idk if we are allowed to post our own work here, but I'm writing a dramione story right now and my Hermione is nosy, quick to speak her opinion without thinking about the impact of her words, and has a bit of a temper. She is also still dealing with the consequences of the war, but that is not a main focus. I've got 7 chapters up so far, 8th one will be up tonight, and I update every few days.

** I remember the Sugarquill having a great collection of flawed but believable Hermione stories. It was a Ron/Hermione-based site, but they prided themselves on being "canon-friendly" so keep that in mind. However, some of the best HP fics I've read were hosted on that site and I felt safe because I prefer canon-friendly fics (at the time). Also, keep in mind many of the fics were written pre-Deathly Hallows. Some were even written pre-Half Blood Prince, and many were pre-OotP because there was that long period in-between the publication of GOF and OotP where the number of fics sky-rocketed.
