Just finished reading ‘Secrets' by Vorabiza on Ao3 (sorry don't know how to link the Ao3 stories) and I'm looking for more Drarry stories like that. Stories where they take care of a child while still in school, but please no de-aging fics. They don't necessarily have to be romantically involved. Preferably with a semi good relationship with Narcissa, Lucius and Severus. Or even stories where they don't care for a child, but keeping with the main plot somehow.

Long stories, over 100k wording, but the time is spanned out. I loved ‘Secrets' but it's almost 400k words and it's only spanned out over the summer.

Haven't read many Drarry stories, and I skip the sex scenes, but I know there is some good ones out there.


** I suggest asking that here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/]]

Just because this reddit isn't really popular with slash and femslash, or so I've seen.

(I've changed the wording, hopefully that is better. Didn't mean to offend anyone since I love reading slash and femslash pairings myself).

*** I agree that OP could ask on [[/r/HPSlashFic]]. They'd probably get more recs there.

However, there's a problem with you saying slash isn't allowed in this subreddit. What you said could be interpreted as saying all the queers and faghags can go and take themselves elsewhere. I suggest you take another look at the many posts in this sub. You'll see that recs for slash and femslash aren't that uncommon. What's more is there are no rules stating that slash and femslash aren't allowed.

**** I agree I shouldn't have said that, that was poor choice of words. (Especially since I love reading slash and femslash). I just meant that most people in this reddit doesn't seem to like slash and femslash very much or maybe not as much as someone else might.

***** Ah, totally understandable. I've mis-worded things far too many times to count.

** Make sure you read all of her other stuff, especially Malfoy Flavor (I promise it's better than the title would indicate). Also look for lomonaaeren's Drarry stuff. She's on Ao3.
