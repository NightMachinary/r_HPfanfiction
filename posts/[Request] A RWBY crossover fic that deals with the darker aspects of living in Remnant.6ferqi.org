Basically, a fic where the fluffy side is minimised at best. Most of the RWBY crossovers seem fixated on just going through the motions of the webseries-life in Vale, occasional run-ins with the White Fang, oh look it's Cinder/Torchwick/Ozpin, bla-whilst completely eschewing the more terrifying aspects of actually living in a world overrun with psychic predators. Is there a (good) fic that actually deals with this or is it completely unexplored ground? And if it does exist, where can I find it?


** Linkffn(9857558) is the only one I can think of off the top of my head, and part of the plot involves Harry absorbing Grimm essence and having it affect his aggression.

  In 2013, Aria and Ezra are a blissful couple, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their surprise baby. In 2017, they're living separately, the only intimacy being the small touches they exchange when passing their four-year-old daughter back and forth. What happened to them? And is there anything left buried beneath the rubble of their destroyed relationship?
