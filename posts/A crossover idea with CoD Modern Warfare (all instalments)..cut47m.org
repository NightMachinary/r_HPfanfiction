Do you think our boy, Draco Malfoy could ever survive the SAS? Especially under Captain Price.

My idea is revolving around Draco deciding enough is enough and that he has to man up. Seeing that no one would ever trust him in the Magical world, he decides to join the British Army following a tip he got from a muggleborn Hufflepuff student he bumped into by chance.

I know it's a /very/ crazy idea, because normally it's always Harry in the SAS and the idea has gotten stale lately.

Edit: He doesn't necessarily need to be part of Task Force 141, but can be one of the soldiers taking part in Operation Kingfish, where Price was captured and then sent to "The Gulag".

Justin Finch-Fletchley. He's from a really rich family so he's probably the only muggleborn that Draco might somehow secretly get along with.
