I was rereading linkffn(Make a wish) and I kinda wanted a fic where Harry is a vigilante that does all this badass stuff but no one thinks for a second that it might be Harry. Hell, I'll even take political Lord Slytherin with mask fic, kinda like DPSW. But yeah, anyone know something like this?


** Makes me think of ripping off V for Vendetta and adapting it to HP.

"Beneath this mask there is more than flesh, Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creevy, and ideas are spellproof."

"A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. Alone, a symbol is meaningless, but with enough people, blowing up a building can change the world."

*** That would be interesting. A weary Harry Potter finally realizing how much power the mass public can have and utilizing that to defeat the reign of Voldemort as the Prophet continues to discredit him. And instead of 5th of November, he talks about 31st of October and slowly destroys Voldemort and his followers with the help of Public support. But where would Harry fit in all of this? People would automatically suspect it is him.

**** Harry is killed by a fire spell but finds out that not only is he Voldemort's horcrux, Voldemort is his horcrux. He is able to re-possess his charred corpse and dig himself out of his grave to live again.

He also discovers that while dead he can sense 'his' other horcruxs. Lots of suicidal plans that get him killed but each time he prepares a body to take over before hand to continue to hunt the next horcrux. He wears his mask and persona to hide the fact that it's a different body behind the mask every time.

***** That is brilliant. And he doesn't stop after Voldemort has been gone for good because it was not one man that made the wizarding world as it is, it was an idea it was the century long belief that has and will continue in the future. He knows that he cannot remedy it by killing those who are vocal about it because many people are silent but adamantly support the pureblood ideals. So he sees to change it, one step at a time. He has undertaken this task for himself and he will not rest until he has accomplished it, no matter how many bodies or Horcruxes it takes him to accomplish it.

  An older and more experienced Harry and Hermione return to their first year at Hogwarts. Their goals? Assassinate Death Eaters, destroy Horcruxes, and deal with Voldemort's hidden contingency plan... by any means necessary. And maybe they'll fix a few other things along the way.
