Lately I've gotten interested in bashing fics. I would love to know what you guys think are the best (and funniest) Weasley bashing fics are!


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion)

Most stupid and unfortunate Ron I've ever seen.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

*** I felt so bad for laughing at this one but it's genuinely hilarious! Unfortunately, but as to be expected from bashing fics, otherwise it isn't very good.
