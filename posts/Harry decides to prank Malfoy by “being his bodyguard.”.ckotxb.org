Wands?

Too pointy. Let's just snap it and throw it away to prevent any future occurrences of Draco poking himself with it.

People passing Draco food in the Great Hall?

Could be poisoned. Best to knock it back into the potential guilty party's face to protect Draco from any harm. While Harry's at that, banish away Malfoy's fork and knife so Draco doesn't accidentally cut or stab himself.

Owl delivering mail?

Could be an Animagi in disguise. Best to burn it with fire along with the letter incase the letter was charmed or the owl was attempting to divebomb Malfoy.

Potions?

Not a chance. So many accidents waiting to happen. Best to just locking Draco into empty cabinet in the corner of the room to prevent harm from any potion mistakes.

Friends?

At what cost? They are could be setting themselves up to stab Draco in the back! Safety is paramount. Toss Crabbe and Goyle into the Black Lake and keep Draco away from any possible human contact. Decreases any chance of Draco being assassinated by these “so-called friends.”

Pansy being Draco's girlfriend?

Please, Pansy could be a succubus in disguise! Draco must be kept pure and safe from potential gold-diggers or seductresses. Of course this is all for Malfoy's safety. If Draco was to receive some magical STD, how will he continue the Malfoy lineage?

Go wild!

Edit: Added a few more ideas

*** There's a lot of overlap there, in canon. One of my favorite bits of Prince of Slytherin is Ron being manipulated by the Diary through his resentment of all the "pranks" his brothers played on him, which were entirely canon.

**** Fred and George pranking people constantly isn't canon. I couldn't get through that fic but I assume you're alluding to the incident where they turned his toy into a spider, and when they tried to get Ron to make an unbreakable vow. If so I'd remind you that those events took place when they were kids, all three of them. The twins are only two years Ron's senior and none of them had a wand or had attended Hogwart's yet. Transfiguring a spider intentionally would be impossible for them, and they've shown no maliciousness that would indicate they understood the danger of an unbreakable vow.

*** It's all perception. If we refer to canon, would Mad-Eye call turning Malfoy into a ferret bullying or teaching?

SPOILERS BELOW

Then there is Bellatrix taunting Harry about Sirius's death. Would Bellatrix call that teasing or bullying?

Personally, I think that Harry should have done something more. He put up with the badges in fourth year. Harassment in fifth year. Both caused/ taken part of by Malfoy. And let's not forget the cruicatus curse Malfoy attempted in sixth year. This definitely warrants being an asshole to an asshole in my book.

I never said what year it had to be.

Edit: I have no idea how to do the covered text

Of course Hedwig will rally her brethren to stay away from the VIP.
