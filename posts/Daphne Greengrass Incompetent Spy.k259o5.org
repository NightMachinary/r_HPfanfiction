Inspired by this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k1nuvk/daphne_knows_her_duty_to_be_a_loyal_death_eater/]]

Daphne Greengrass believes in the pureblood "cause" and supports Voldemort (or the purified view of him held by the younger generation, who aren't disillusioned as Draco became in canon), mostly thanks to being in Pansy's sphere of influence.

She's pretty and articulate. She's witty and eye-catching.

...But she's also as incompetent as Johnny English.

Tasked with befriending and then dating the Boy-Who-Lived by the Dark Lord to act as a spy on the "Other Side's" activities, Daphne unintentionally gets a bit too much into the role of being Harry's girlfriend/love-interest, despite being true to her "mission".

The kicker? Harry, his friends, and Dumbledore sussed her out from the get-go, and are using her as a double-agent to feed false information back. As she genuinely believes what she's passing on as true, she's not suspected by her 'superiors'. Unfortunately, Harry does develop feelings for her, and also works to keep her safe.

After the War ends, and Voldemort is defeated thanks to a lot of the info she passed on (much to her horror), and she's hailed as a hero by the wizarding public, like how fanon sometimes depicts Snape if he survived DH.

Daphne now finds herself in the unenviable (or enviable, for a lot of witches out there) position of being Harry Potter's serious girlfriend (which she's torn about, as she has come to love him, but he's Harry Potter, ffs!), an unintentional key element in Voldemort's downfall, and being lauded as a hero by those she's supposed to philosophically detest.

...Well, at least her sister is speaking to her again.


** I love this so much. Wholesome and amusing, and only insufferably smug in small, perfectly acceptable doses

eta: I would add bonus points for Daphne seeing some muggle things and actually liking them. Maybe there is even a sleep over at Hermione's (without the Daniel and Emma granger schtick, hopefully) and finds that there are some things that are good in the muggle world, even if plastic still weirds her out.

*** It was the soft-serve ice cream that corrupted her to the muggle side, wasn't it?
