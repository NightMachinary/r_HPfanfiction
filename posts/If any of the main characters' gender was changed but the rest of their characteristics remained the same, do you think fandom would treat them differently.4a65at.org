How popular for example would be The Girl Who Lived, wise woman!Dumbledore or obese and abusive fem!Dudley Dursley?

This thread is inspired by a discussion I read on another sub about Hermione. Although she's (I thought) one of the most popular fandom characters, some people were dismissing her positive qualities because Harry was better, and it got me thinking, if she had been a guy, would they still be doing that? Wondered what you all would think about different reaction to other characters. The one's I've picked are just examples, feel free to mention whoever you think might be reacted to differently with a different gender.

***** Rowling drew a clear link between Sirius and Bellatrix - They both went to Azkaban at the same time, offering no resistance, after the one they've been very loyal to (James/Voldemort) had fallen. Bellatrix was obviously more unhinged, but not by a large margin, and Sirius did hold a sadistic streak, though not as great as hers. Harry described their looks very similarly, both before and after Azkaban, they both were especially talented, and they even died the same way. Of course they aren't exactly the same, but they mirror each other very strongly, to the point that Bellatrix comes off as his female "evil twin".

But the vagueness, the preoccupation, the flashes of insight, the woolgathering, the belief in imaginary creatures, the apparent randomness, the unself-conscious honesty - I can envision a male character with these qualities, especially one assigned to Ravenclaw. That kind of absentminded oddball intelligence sorts very well with certain kinds of artistic or creative, slightly shy or retiring or oblivious male characters. The difficulty (I say this with tongue in cheek) would be writing a Luna-esque teenage boy who doesn't come across as a stoner or a latter-day hippie.

** If it's Harry, the whole dynamic changes because she would be spending time in the girls' dorm, relating more regularly with the other witches and probably having very little to do with the Weasleys.

Flipping Hermione into a nerdy sixth dormmate would put the main cast into a particularly male-minded state. I think the story would lose quite a bit of perspective and 'Horatio' would be competing with Neville for sympathy.

Flipping Ron to Veronica might have less disruptive impact and more positive outcomes, as her courage would be lauded and her moments of selfishness and distrust might be ascribed to being affected emotionally. Girls turning attitudes on their friends isn't seen as exactly the same sort of betrayal as Ron's breaking loyalty was.

The best option might be to reverse all three, as Harriet and Veronica might still bond more for being the sporty sort compared to Lavender and Parvati, and a scruffy but smart Horatio might be accepted more readily as taking a brotherly concern for Harriet and carrying a torch for the loud, clumsy but ultimately funny and supportive Veronica.

So many interpretations are possible.

******* Honestly, it's not that their naming theme is subtle, but rather that we very rarely hear the full versions of their names. On one hand, you have names like “Bill”, “Charlie”, or “Ginny”; and on the other hand, there is the seldom-heard “William”, “Charles”, or “Ginevra”. Fred and George are also a part of the theme, albeit more subtly, as there was a king named George who ruled immediately after a king named Frederick (which “Fred” is a diminutive of) due to the latter's early demise; I'd think it a fitting set of names for twins if one were to try keeping with the naming theme. Percival, likewise, since his name is also of the princely sort.

The one who doesn't fit the theme naming fully is actually Ronald, but only because his name is a Scots one and I suspect that anyone trying to go for theme naming of this sort would lose their steam at the 6th kid of the same sex.

By this definition Veronica would count as well as Ptolemaic is a /Greek/ (Greeks are European) royal family who happens to rule Egypt.

Personally I suspect that the name is supposed to be "counsel/advice to a ruler", as someone who gives counsel or advice to a ruler will always be in the shadow of a ruler. It also happens to be that all of Ron's siblings, parents and best friend are named after English or British rulers. Furthermore the meaning of Harry's name, whether it's diminutive of Henry or Harold, can mean "home ruler" or "army" "ruler". This fits Ron's character as he is forever overshadowed by his best friend and siblings.

Do I think Veronica is a perfect match? No, as it lacks the same subtle meaning. But as a non-British/English ruler name it would still work.

** In the vast majority of fictional properties - especially the really popular ones - characters tend reflect and promote traditional gender role expectations. This is true in HP, too, though HP is a bit better than many.

So what happens when you flip genders? You violate gender norms. Male characters become more reserved, more nurturing, and to play supportive roles. Female characters become more adventurous, take more risks, and save princes from dragons.

Would fandom treat the characters differently? You betcha! A lot of fandom would be outraged, quite frankly, though most either wouldn't consciously understand why or, if they did, they'd deny it. Or maybe try to rationalize it.

Change all the genders in the Avengers. Or Star Wars. Or Harry Potter. A lot of people will have trouble accepting it. It will just "feel wrong" to them because the male and female characters are suddenly behaving contrary to expectations.

This is one reason why I tend to write female Harry stories - to put a female in the role of taking risks and saving the day. I find it amusing how often I've seen the objection of "what's the point?" to flipping Harry's gender, as if there weren't any problem in how gender is treated in fiction.

As to the specifics you raise, I suspect that "Herman" wouldn't be derided as a bossy know-it-all. He'd simply be assertive and confident, like a boy is supposed to be. Competitive, too, and while it's in academics instead of sports, that's also acceptable for boys.

The lack of a Dumbledore beard would be a great loss, but I think the changes there would be the least; it would still be the archetypal wizard, but as a woman. (Obviously flipping Dumbledore's gender should flip McGonagall's, too.)

A imagine a female Riddle would cause the majority of Death Eater recruits to also be female, and it would have (un)intended "feminism" overtones instead of racial.

*** Dumbledore would be interesting, actually. For one thing, the Dumbledore/Grindelwald relationship would probably be made canon, even if JKR decided to keep it one-sided (because as far as I recall, she never said Gellert returned Albus' feelings). The backstory of a powerful female character being so blinded by love that she falls prey to an authoritarian daydream, gets her younger sister killed, and then swears off love for the rest of her exceedingly long life would be somewhat regressive, though. Much like the celibate gay headmaster narrative. Especially since, according to Pottermore, we already have McGonagall swearing off relationships after Elphinstone dies. Two powerful senior witches with no sex life? Eh.

Also, I suspect Dumbledore's ruthlessness in the face of hard decisions would bother readers more if Albus were a woman. Leaving Harry to be abused by the Dursleys? Not being honest with him? Not being there when Harry needed her? Hesitant to show affection? Not stopping Draco even when it became clear that Draco's attempts to kill her were endangering students? Even the gaudy robes and twinkling idiosyncrasies would have a different impact. It would be like making the smart and level-headed version of Trelawney headmistress.

Most elderly characters are perceived as more or less sexless, but "grandmotherly" and "grandfatherly" still stir up different expectations. A female Dumbledore who's not maternal would probably get more backlash than a male Dumbledore who withholds outward signs of affection.

Not gonna lie, the showdown in the Department of Mysteries between Dumbledore and Voldemort would suddenly get a lot more interesting to me. It's one reason I love the Sacking of Severus Snape - not only is it dramatic, and full of dramatic irony, but it's got McGonagall being bad-ass. (Demerits for the Snape-shaped hole, though.)

I don't see that at all, actually. There's an already existing stereotype of ugly, nerdy, brainy girls who get bullied and endlessly mocked in school, and as a student Snape would still be the swotty morose weirdo with bad hair. Snape's poverty might be a little more obvious because people tend to scrutinize and rate how girls look and dress; there's more wiggle room for boys to be ragged and unkempt.

"Performing feminity" is a descriptive term for a certain kind of learned behavior. It's not innate, and it doesn't apply to women as a class. I don't see Snape performing femininity. She grew up during the sixties and was the right age for the rise of punk rock. Snape in the books seems to ignore his physical body; ambition, intelligence/power, and resentment are what drive him. Female Snape would be just as obstinate about her looks, and just as indifferent, as her male counterpart. She'd want to kill her enemies with her brain.

The Marauders would undoubtedly insult her and torment her with minor jinxes and be sexually demeaning about her appearance, but I don't think they'd go anywhere near the lengths they do in the books. Hanging a girl upside-down and inviting the crowd to view her much-laundered underwear is too obviously a sexual attack, and JKR wouldn't let James, at least, go that far. It would be really, really difficult to make him sympathetic after that.

One problem with gender-swapping Snape is that she instantly becomes the Wicked Witch of the West - skinny, greasy-haired, hooked-nose, with beetle-black eyes, thin fingers, and flapping black robes. This was the popular image of Hallowe'en witches until HP and Buffy and the urban fantasy genre came along to make witches sexy. At the time it would have seemed strangely unimaginative if the meanest teacher in the school were described as your standard-issue evil witch.

Nope, I don't think James would flip her upside-down for a gawking crowd, and more to the point, I don't think JKR would write that and then make the perpetrator a good man. And I suspect Sirius wouldn't actually send female Snape into a werewolf's den, although I'm less sure about that. Sirius was given to flamboyant gestures. But the extremity of those instances aside, yes, I think James and Sirius and Peter would still have looked down upon Snape and made her life a living hell. She would have been the ugly girl it was okay to tease mercilessly because she had none of the sex appeal or sportiness or conciliatory behavior that redeems the average teenage girl in the eyes of the average (straight) teenage boy. Or at any rate, the teenage population as portrayed in fictional boarding schools.

One would certainly hope not. Although Dumbledore allowed fake!Moody to teach Cruciatus in class, and that's pretty appalling. And he didn't rein in adult Snape's cruelty as a professor because he believed (according to Word of God) that bullying teachers were just another life lesson and students should get used to it. Still, I'd expect McGonagall would kick their asses, and I doubt Dumbledore would brush it off as just boys being boys.

So, basically, they wouldn't treat her the same/as harshly as they did in canon? Especially since far from being an extremity it's heavily implied that /Levicorpus/ saw far more use than just the incident at the lake.

Unless you think all bullying is the same, it's quite obvious that their relationship would have a very different dynamic. Hell, they wouldn't even interact half as much in the first place, being different-gendered children in different houses of a boarding school. Case in point: Harry's relationship with Pansy vs. Draco (and vice versa)

That's quite the condensation of what's a rather complex issue.

Cross-gender bullying has always carried [more] horrifying connotations, what with straightness being overwhelmingly visible in traditional society. Fem!Severus being stripped by fem!James and fem!Sirius would not garner as much attention either, unless they took off her bra or some shit.

Partly because the Levicorpus scene and the Shrieking Shack "prank" go beyond harassment for me, even if the former is considered business as usual among the members of feuding houses.

And yes, the extreme instances might not have been so extreme, but I do think James and Co. would have been sexist shitheads to a female version of Snape, to the extent that they would make her life equally miserable. She could conceivably have had more support from the staff, which might have toned down the worst of the bullying, but Snape's written as someone who doesn't appeal to authorities for help because s/he assumes (in canon, rightfully so) that she won't get any. Also, this wanders off to the other side of the OP's question - would JKR have changed the way she wrote the characters if she gender-flipped them? The OP asks how /fandom/ would respond to a change in biological sex. Presumably, JKR would also take that into account and revise the interactions between her characters accordingly, starting with the point you make, that they'd be assigned different dorm mates (and here things branch off into - just one genderswap? a full-cast genderswap?). But in James and Sirius' cases, she clearly didn't want them to be irredeemable assholes, so I wager she'd modify their actions.

  That's quite the condensation of what's a rather complex issue.

It's a nod to acknowledge the existence of issues beyond this discussion, and a signal that I'm not about to launch into a sociological treatise. I'm not condensing in order to minimize the complexity. Anyone who wants to run with the topic is free to do so. I've done it in the past; I'm not doing it here.

  it's heavily implied that Levicorpus saw far more use than just the incident at the lake
#+end_quote

What makes you say that? I'm not asking because I think you're wrong, but because that would be an interesting addition to the whole Snape/Marauders history, and I don't personally remember picking up that implication. Although, even without textual proof, it would make sense.

With the joking comment out of the way, why have the society be monolithically patrilineal or matrilineal? Why not either or both or neither? If you're going to AU it up, why not have it so the new generation's family name is a mash-up of the parents'? Like, the Weasley children could have been Preasley/Presley (Weawett would have been an option, but sounds like something a baby would coo).

****** Yeah. That's what I was going for with the list of names, except without the monumental fuckup that was "Distaff Side"'s names. Seriously, "Dionysidoros" and "Veronica" and "Malcolm"? Those were fucking lazy and half-assed.

Also, mashing up the parents' names really isn't something that's done in any society around the world, so it would be highly unlikely in this circumstance. I think matrilineality would be far easier to deal with in an AU like that.

Though I have to say, I don't feel like Lysander Thomas Granger is quite pretentious enough for a child of a pair who named a girl Hermione. Though I can't think of anything else that would be suitable off the top of my head, no matter how much I wish it was Prospero.

** They'd probably treat them the same, seeing as the main reasons why characters in this fandom are treated the way they are is because of their personalities, not their gender. Or at least by the majority of fans/authors in my experience.

If Hermione had been a guy, Ron might not have initially have been so immature with her in first year, sure. But he'd have still had all the comments about her (or him, in this AU) being a bossy know it all. But it would also probably skew the Ron/Hermione endgame. Because as far as we've seen both characters are straight, so they'd end up with different characters.

As far as fanfiction goes and I hate to say this, but I feel that if Snape was female there might be more acceptance of Harry/Snape fics. Because half the time people who shout it down are people who aren't fans of slash, let alone the pedophilia concerns and the abuse of trust in the student-teacher relationship. All of that morality tends to fly out of the window when you have a horny fetishist author writing their fantasies with themself being one of the two characters featured, albeit called by a different name.

*** Yes, with the trio you might have to gender-flip all of them to get the same or a similar dynamic. An interesting AU might be to gender-flip /all/ of the Gryffindors in Harry's year, or maybe even all the kids in his year. That would avoid any gender complications in the existing character relationships (as in, how they get on or don't, not pairings) like Ron-Harry or Harry-Malfoy.

** *Harry*: Will most likely be named after a flower, as I am 99% sure that it's canon that the Evens' named their girls after flowers (Lily, Petunia) so it's likely Lily would have named fem!Harry after a flower, my personal favorite is Iris, Harriet or 'Hari' just sounds stupid IMO.

Appearance wise I like to imagine she would look like male Harry, black hair and green eyes, but the hair wouldn't be as messy and wild.

*Ron*: Ronnie or Ronalda would probably look a lot like Ginny but more chubby, eventually developing large breasts like Molly, she will most likely chose to keep her hair short, since she would be too lazy to manage long hair.

*Hermione*: I really like the name Hermes, he would be tall and skinny, with wild short curly hair, eventually choosing to grow a beard since Hermione really admired Dumbledore and I picture Hermes trying to grow a beard as long as Dumbledore.

*Draco*: Draconia is an acceptable alternative though I'm sure someone can come up with something better. She will heavily resemble Narcissa, copying her way of dressing and her hair since male Draco copied his father as much as he could I like to imagine a female Draco similarily emulating Narcissa, I shudder to imagine female Crabbe and Goyle so I won't even go there...

*Voldemort*: Tom Riddle was described as incredibly handsome in his early years, likewise I imagine a female Tom (or Tamsin/Tamsyn) would be very beautiful before she sacrificed all that for immortality, eventually looking like Voldemort, with pale skin, bald head and snake eyes and nose, but more delicate, most likely with deep and full red lips.
