[[/u/torak9344][u/torak9344]] made interesting points about Grindelwald's ideals that I'd like to tell you a little more about, since they are intrinsic to the themes of the Harry Potter series.

As mentioned in the post, many consider his motto to be 'morally grey'; his ideology has substance that one could make arguments for.

/''For the greater good''/ very closely resembles the Jesuit creed /''the ends justify the means.''/ This is also how it's written in most translations of Harry Potter.

JK Rowling, a pacifist (or so she claims), rejects violence outright. This becomes clear through Harry rejecting the use of violence many times throughout the later books. Although Bellatrix kills Sirius in the fifth book, Harry doesn't hurt her when he has the opportunity to. In his fourth year, after Cedric dies and Harry has to face Voldemort alone in the graveyard, he chooses a disarming charm. He does the same thing again during the final battle.

This is declared as a kind of ''moral victory'' in the books. The good guys never use violence, and if they do, it's justified. This is an extremely problematic stance. To understand why, we need to examine the true meaning of the Jesuits' creed.

*The means are only ways to reach an end, and so, if the end is justifiable, so are the means.* So in order to find out if the means can be justified, we need to examine the end they serve. Harry's goal is to defeat Voldemort. In doing so, he would be saving countless lives. Voldemort is a maniac that uses a fascist ideology to get people to obey him. So is Harry's non-violent way of defeating him justified? *No.* Giving Voldemort and his followers the chance to escape again and again is a massive detriment to defeating him.

By taking an idealist approach rather than a materialist one, it's easy to lose sight of the facts. This is exactly what happens in the series, as Grindelwald's ideology is twisted into a parody of itself. Let me know if you guys have thoughts or questions!

*** This is the exception that proves the rule. This move, as metioned by [[/u/turbinicarpus][u/turbinicarpus]] was very impuslive. Rowling uses it to show us that she believes violence to be wrong, and that it doesn't serve a purpose. But as illustrated by my post, in a war situation it isn't quite so simple.

*** My sense is that Harry's violence is impulsive. He is not someone to carefully weigh his options, then plan and execute a violent act with premeditation and malice aforethought. (That's more of a Hermione thing.)

** I agree, Dumbledore lack of tactical and direct approach led to many unnescessary deaths, hell even the trio obliviating Dolohov is a terrible idea that costed more lives in the long run.

*** Precisely. Dumbledore is often villanized in fan fiction for being manipulative, instead of being incompetent, the latter which I think is worse. I think this is a direct result of Rowling's own lack of experience in this situation, and her tendency to rely rather heavily on the 'love and kindness' narrative.

Why keep the knowledge of the Horcruxes a secret? Why lie to the Order about Snape? The Order of the Phoenix had already developed a foolproof way of confirming someones identity. Almost no one knew about Voldemorts Horcruxes. So even if they were caught, most Death eaters or even Voldemort himself wouldn't think to look for that information.

And Snape would have been a valuable resource during the second war. By killing Dumbledore, no one questioned his loyalty. Why not capitalize on that?
