Laying here scrolling through random stories just to see the summaries, and the thought popped into my head:

When Harry died, Dumbledore was there to greet him on the other side. Everyone gets someone that they meet on the other side to help them with the transition from life to afterlife. So why, in Salazar's name, is it Sirius Black standing around waiting for him when he crosses over? Lily would have been the first person he'd have expected, heck, maybe he could even have expected his mother despite their lack of close relationship in life, but no! It has to be Sirius Arsehole Black, with that stupid grin on his face and that ridiculous leather jacket that he most definitely doesn't look cool in!

Are there any stories like this around? If you had to choose an unlikely candidate to meet Snape on the other side, who would you think of to do the job?


** Other than Lily, the first person I thought of was Eileen or another Prince relative. But that's hardly unlikely, although it would be sad. Or someone else he knew in Cokeworth, maybe, someone he didn't know was a Squib/wizard.

Characters we/Snape doesn't expect: Quirrell (the real Quirrell) would be an interesting one, for sure, although I'm not sure if Snape would be particularly happy. I want to say Cedric, actually. I don't know why. I think he'd make a good guide to the afterlife.

** James Potter would probably be the most awkward guy to meet. Snape essentially sacrificed himself for his wife

*** Yeah, but in a weird way, because of the fact that Snape risked himself to beg for Lily's life, gave up his own life to be a spy because of her murder, and then spent all those years around Harry... I dunno, I guess I can see how James would be a justifiable person to meet. It would so definitely be awkward though, that's for sure!

**** Except Snape ratted his wife out to Voldemort. If I was James, I'd want to break his ethereal nose

***** He didn't wish to do so, and spent the rest of his life trying to fix that. That certainly doesn't excuse his other actions, but I highly doubt James will only see Severus telling the prophecy and not him trying to atone for it.

****** What do you mean, he didnt wish to do so? He was perfectly happy to betray an unknown woman to wizard Hitler. It was only when he found out the woman was Lily that he balked and pleaded for her life (tho not that if her husband or child). Anyone else could have died with his blessing,

******* He was perfectly happy to betray any other woman but not Lily, right? I'm not trying to justify Snape's actions I'm trying to point out that he did not want Voldemort to target Lily.

******** And I'm saying that the fact that he was prepared to betray an unknown woman and baby is enough to earn him a broken nose, the fact that it was Lily and Harry merely makes it more broken-nose worthy.

The fact he tried to plead for her life ( but not that of her child) makes him more disgusting, not better

********* Or it makes him someone with realistic expectations. What possible chance would Snape have of convincing Voldemort to spare the primary reason he's going after that family in the first place? About the only thing that could have come out good about that situation was a single survivor and no one could have possibly predicted what actually happened.

Also despite what a lot of people think I don't think Snape actually thought Lily was going to forgive and love him back after James and Harry died. I'm pretty sure he was resigned to her hatred forever if she lived but it's better than being her being dead in his mind.

********** Again, these don't seem like reasons for James not laying an epic afterlife beatdown on Snape. Initially, James mainly despised Snape because of how deep he was in the Dark Arts, which were being practiced by Voldemort. I don't think he ever knew in life that Snape was the reason for the Potters going in hiding, or else Snape would probably be dead.

I think the main reason why it's annoying that Snape begged for Lily to be spared is he didn't think about how Lily would feel. I'd say Lily would be traumatized if she was the only survivor, and probably would have ended her own life a couple of years later. It was possibly unintentionally /less/ cruel of Voldemort to kill her as well, because if he hadn't, then she would have lost her husband and child on the same day.

** I'd think Dumbledore would be appropriate, not because Snape carries any great love for the man, but speaking with his master without the need for secrets would give him the catharsis needed to take the train onwards.
