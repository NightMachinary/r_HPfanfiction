I just read this little oneshot linkffn(11118965) "Always Read The Fine Print", and loved it. Both for its casual amusing/funny nature, and its premise.

I am curious if there are any longer (non oneshot) stories like it. Basically where Harry Potter finds a way to absorb or steal magic from others to make himself godlike or at least overpowered. It can be via sneaky magical contracts like the oneshot, or other means.

I would prefer if it had at least some comedy or lightheartedness to it. After all, a godlike Harry could do whatever so why not go pick up women, or travel the world, or play with magic, or play pranks, and so on...

But if its rated mature and has darker undertones thats fine too. Dark, Light, or Grey Harry is fine. Smut is fine. Lemons are fine. Violence is fine. No male slash though please. Thanks!

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][/The Sacrifices Arc/]] --- Harry is an “absorbere”, which basically means he can make his magic eat someone\something else's. Warning: it eventually becomes a HP\DM slash.

  - Pros: 1. writing in general 2. characters 3. duels 4. lore
  - Cons: 1. Voldemort also has such a power and tries munchkinnig his way to victory, but the author artificially keeps him nerfed both in his actions and his abilities (AFAIK). 2. (ending spoiler) The story ends on a frustrating description of how Harry spills all the magic he had absorbed from VD into the oceans for some stupid reason or another. 3. Whenever an idiot-ball or a plot-ball requires handwaving, a prophecy kicks in and basically removes the free will of characters. 4. Manipulative --- but extremely stupid --- characters, including Dumbledore. The story often reads like an exploitation b-story for the emotions of rightful indignation, rage, fury, exasperation, etc. Seriously, no other story managed to piss me off so much as this one with some of its characters and the way they behaved, and I think that's precisely what the author's intention was (no idea what for, though).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][/A Third Path to the Future/]] --- /HP/ × /[[http://x-menevolution.wikia.com/wiki/X-Men_Evolution_Wiki][X-Men: Evolution]]/ crossfic in which Harry is also a mutant whose power is to steal magic from magical creatures or artefacts.

  - Cons: 1. The story is somewhat similar to /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing][With This Ring]]/ but is of a much lower quality in general (though later on there comes an Asgard-related plot arc which is at least a little more interesting \ better written). 2. Regarding the magic-stealing power itself: the author places limits on how much magic can Harry's mortal body hold; and the magical fights are often one-dimensional, with spells used like bullets and magic used as a muscle. 3. The story features a technically poly, but factually harem relationship. 4. The story has some cheesy \ badly written smut scenes.

*** I really dont enjoy main character slash... especially DM/HP slash so likely would struggle to enjoy the Sacrifices Arc, although its premise does sound intriguing.

A Third Path also sounds mildly interesting but am not a fan of "superhero" crossovers whatsoever and if its also poorly written...

I may take a look at both if i run out of reading material or there are few other suggestions but neither strikes my fancy.

Thanks for the suggestions anyway.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm]])

A really good fic that deals with this. Harry is essentially sent to a parallel universe where he discovered an ability he never knew he had in canon (due to his parents not surviving and him not being in contact with other magical people in his youth (when this ability typically revealed itself)). It does many things better than any other fanfiction imo.
