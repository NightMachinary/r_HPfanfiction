I read this a year or so ago might have been abandoned after 7 or so chapters but Harry had been captured by the Death eaters who then controlled him using a (collar)? Something like that but Harry manages to escape and shows up at Hermione's house I think she was living alone so they're both older at this point. I do know that he had magic tattoos that helped him that the Death eaters gave him to make him stronger while they used him to attack others.
