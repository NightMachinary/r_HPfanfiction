I've always wanted to read a story where Harry is actually evil. It kind of makes sense to me the sorting hat thought he would be a good fit in to Slytherin. His adoptive family made him hate muggles. Just kinda want to see where that story would go.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

*** I wouldn't call him evil in this fic, more of a chaotic neutral character who just does whatever he wants. I do love this fic though.

** Harry, though not evil in this story, does dislike Muggles and uses dark curses. And, obviously, he's also sorted into Slytherin.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** While one of my favorites, OP did ask for a fic where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and is evil and PoS is decidedly NOT such a story.

***** For another Slytherin Harry fic, but with a more morally ambiguous Harry, try linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux). Similar length and quality to PoS.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
