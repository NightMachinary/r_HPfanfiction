:END:
Here's what I do remember about this fanfic:

1 Harry and Hermione stay together at the Privet Drive for a short period of time, but the Dursleys themselves aren't at home

2 They learn swordsmanship and a lot of other magic

3 They each unlock a spirit animal

4 The little girl is actually someone who is as old as they are

5 The little girl dies at the end but Hermione has a daughter with purple eyes.

EDIT: Don't know how to remove that â€˜spoiler' tag. Didn't notice until I posted.


** I think you're referring to linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lost Demon by Angry Hermione).

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.
