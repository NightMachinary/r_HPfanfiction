Most of the time I read fics straight off the site that they're posted on, but I'm going away on vacation in a couple days and was wondering what the best way to download fics is. I know that there are plug-in you can use on a computer, but I would prefer to download them to my phone. Thanks for any help in advance!


** If you're using FF.net, they have an app that lets you download them and read them offline. I mainly use the app for all my reading, it's great.

*** Yeah I downloaded tons of stories from here, and then I can just open it in I-books and read, just make sure to make it e-pub.

** If you find something on Ao3, you can download as mobi or epub, then get an ebook app to read.
