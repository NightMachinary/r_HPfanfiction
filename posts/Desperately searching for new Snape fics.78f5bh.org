So...I just love to read about Snape, obviously. But having started about a year ago, to again read fanfics, it is getting harder and harder for me to find anything decent.

I am thankful for every suggestion, even if it does not quite fit my interests or I already read it. My most loved fic so far (Snarry): For Auld Lang Syne

*What I am actually looking for:*

- NO Snape/Hermione

- NO time travel

- NO m!preg

- Snape as a love interest

- Long fiction (if possible nothing under 100k words)

- NO absolute chars (i.e. absolutely powerful) [often seen on Harry]

- Story (!), not just Slash

*Nice to have:*

- Marauders time

- Snape/Lily or Snape/Harry

*I don't care:*

- rating / violence

- non-cannon

- car bashing


** With Eyes Wide Open ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/610909]]) is an introspective and quiet romance between Severus and Harry, though it is told from Harry's PoV.

** How about this new fic called Puzzle linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]])? It's not 100k words, but it's regularly updating and is interesting so far. It's Snape/Lily.

linkffn(A dream carved in stone) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8134710/1/A-Dream-Carved-in-Stone]] An AU Snape Lily fic

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) The boy who died a lot. It's involves time loops of Snape having to go back and keep saving Harry from dying in all kinds of ridiculous and not ridiculous ways but it's great and really hilarious at times.

** I can't tell if you mean new as in "recent" or simply "new to me," so I'll just toss out some recs.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629/chapters/23404335][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] by Wyste. This is a series, and here's the first part. It turns out Harry finds potions fascinating. Snape mentors him despite misgivings. Seems to be setting up H/D later in the series. Short chapters, easy, sardonic narrative voice. No Snape romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/96429/chapters/131926][Everybody's Fool]] by Cluegirl. Snape/Harry, includes magical warding and virgin!Snape.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/55402][Subjectiverse]] by potionpen. Snape/Rosier. Starts more or less with Snape getting a wand and then being sorted into Slytherin. Another series-in-progress. This one may be an acquired taste, as it's very much the fan author's version of Snape rather than Rowling's.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of A Linear Circle]] by flamethrower. Yet another series-in-progress. Snape/Salazar Slytherin's brother, who starts out as a 1000-year-old portrait.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439/chapters/210857][Into the Fold]] by Pasi. How Snape becomes a Death Eater. Involves a great deal of potions and Dark Magic practice. Unrequited Snape/Lily, not very shippy at all.

*** So I just read Into the Fold and I'm honestly blown away by it. I shouldn't have been considering this is the same author of Penultimate Acts, and I'm kicking myself for not googling them from Snapecase. First War Death Eater Snape fics are so hard to find, especially one that keeps everyone in character. This is one of the best Snape character studies I've read, inciting both feelings of heartbreak and disgust, and I've usually found Snape fics to arouse one instead of the other. I am so pissed off that this has only 28 kudos over the crap that gets 1000s. Thank you for the recommendation!

Do you know of any more similar Snape character studies? Especially long ones?

**** Sorry I'm always so late on replying! But I agree that Into the Fold ought to be much, much better known than it is. It's so insightful and interesting, and I love that we learn about Snape's moral erosion and blind spots by watching him devise spells and assist Healers and interact with magic, rather than it all being laid at the doorstep of woobieness on the one hand or innate evil on the other. It makes the world Snape moves through feel so rich and plausibly obstacle-laden and adds layers to his behavior and his reasons for making worse and worse choices - until he makes a right choice and is trapped by the lack of mercy he's earned (although even that is more complex than it appears).

And I'm aggrieved that it lives in the shadow of fics that are, to put it bluntly, barely readable - I notice you mention DebstheSlytherinSnapeFan in a different post, and I'll add elvirakitties. Someone - I think actually in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] - said they loved how wild and unpredictable Debs' plots were. Different strokes, I guess. But good God, the writing's atrocious. Pasi is leagues beyond them, and nobody knows who she is.

Pause to flail a moment: Penultimate Acts is a miniature work of art and on my favorites list forever. It's a really beautiful example of how much can be compressed and suggested in short form. The ending always gives me that feeling of wanting to cry but not being able to because it's trapped in my chest.

I'm afraid I don't know of any other long character studies. Most of my favorite authors tend to write under the 50K word mark. I can offer a handful of shorter fics that are worth a browse, although I suspect you've read some of them already:

Speaking of authors who should have thousands more kudos than they do: Delphi. If you already know her work, then skip these recs, but here are a couple that take place in the year or so after the the First War ends. Snape's moods and reflexes constantly refer back to either his Death Eater experiences or his childhood, and the psychological astuteness Delphi displays is stunning, not just in keeping with the character but aesthetically as well. The first link is bleak, the second hopeful.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/65865][In Memory of Sigmund Freud]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/317755][Father to the Man]]

There's also a non-magical WiP about which I have many overwrought feelings, because I think it's bloody brilliant (although warning for underage):

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/55644][The Snape of St. Brutal's series]] This is the portrait of a horrifically intelligent and very disturbed young Snape who has the makings of a serial killer. He's sent to a reform school and, while learning to pass as 'normal,' proceeds to seduce Filch the caretaker. As a character study, it may be outside the lines of what you're looking for, but it's so absolutely worth reading.

(Ditto her WiP series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/49532][Fantastic Beasts]], particularly the twelfth and currently last installment, which is devastating.)

I seem to remember that you've read Duniazade's trilogy of short fics all taking place in Snape's pre-school and student days? They're not canon-compliant, but who cares? They're utterly magical. If you haven't read them, I'll rustle up links.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3082463][To Dwell on Dreams]] by musamihi.

Again, a fic set just after the First War, during a period where Snape's grief over Lily has turned him into a drug addict.

[[http://deeply-horrible.livejournal.com/10811.html][Hrth'a'Tet]] by of-anoesis.

Set during Chamber of Secrets, but with flashbacks. A glimpse into Snape's ambition and love of potions and how slow his finer sense of self-knowledge is to grasp subtleties.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/342011][The Azote Principle]] by Caecelia

A claustrophobic and beautifully described look at Snape shortly before Harry arrives. It's very intense and almost Gothic, and Snape's attitude courts a diagnosis of mental illness.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304333/chapters/486613][The Sins of Severus Snape]] by Lariope.

A series of short fics focusing on the Seven Deadly Sins as applied to Snape's life.

[[http://hoggywartyxmas.livejournal.com/24152.html][Into the Silence]] by lyras

Covers the same ground as Pasi's "Penultimate Acts" in the way it deals with Severus' last year. Less perfect a story, but still affecting.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5713][Playing for Keeps]] by vissy

Another brilliant fic that has reduced me to babbling in the past, but it's not for everyone. It looks at Severus' last visit home the term before his student years at Hogwarts end, and every detail of it feels right. Eileen's voice is so pungent, and her treatment of Severus rings so true. It's only toward the end that everything goes awry. Warning for incest, but please risk it anyway.

And one last rec, although it's only reachable through the Wayback Machine, which isn't always reliable. [[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302113913/http://predatrix.slashcity.org/fiction/everyday.htm][Every Day This Week]] by predatrix

Severus' first year attending Hogwarts and his burgeoning friendship with Filch. Predatrix writes him here as nearly autistic in his literalmindedness and sensitivity to stimulus. It says pre-slash, but I don't read it that way; Severus is too young and oblivious.

I hope you enjoy some of these, and wish I had longer recs to offer. I'm picky about Snape's characterization and about common fannish writing styles (i.e., I'm a snob), so there aren't many I've bothered to bookmark.
