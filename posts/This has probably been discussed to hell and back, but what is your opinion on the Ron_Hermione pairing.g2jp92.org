I'm... not quite sure what to think of it. I /guess/ I'm fine with it, but it just seems... weird and rushed.


** I suppose it's unpopular but I honestly quite like it. I saw it coming from book one. They do complement each other. I don't understand Harry/Hermione because Harry can't even find that much enjoyment in being friends with her without Ron. Frankly, I blame the movies for butchering the Ron/Hermione relationship.

** I personally don't enjoy Ron/Hermione at all. Unlike Ginny/Harry, though, I don't consider it a failing of the writing so much as a mismatch in my own preferences with the tropes and idea behind the pairing. The whole belligerent sexual tension and bickering equals love tropes just don't do much for me in most cases. When reading the books, I was never convinced these two characters could maintain a friendship outside of Harry.

Plus, friends-to-lovers pairings only rarely work for me, so the odds were against them.

** I think they could work out but it would take a lot of effort from both of them. There would have to be lot of compromises and probably some counselling but they are best friends and have been through a lot together and I think they can work out.

As for how they were written. There was foreshadowing in the earlier books. then the whole HBP was them being as nasty to each other as they could because they were attracted to each other? I never really understood that part. I would have preferred it if Ron did not leave if J.k. wanted to write a Romione pairing.

** I love them. I always have. And I was SO MAD when JKR said that time she regretted making them get together. I love that Ron got the girl, and I really don't think they're as mis-matched as most people think they are. They are different, but opposites attract. My own parents are so different from each other but have been married nearly 40 years, so I suppose for that reason I don't find it a stretch to believe that two characters with different personalities can fit together and be happy.

*** I mean, I can understand that. Opposites do quite often attract, but only to a point. It's just that neither of them seem to have any interest in anything that matters to the other person. Ron thinks Hermione is mad for caring about creature rights and studying, and she has no interest in quidditch or chess or pranking. There has to be some degree of common ground for them to build on, and all they seem to have in common is Harry.

**** I understand what you're saying, but I think in general teenagers like what they like and have very litle time for anything else. As you grow older and more mature you begin to appreciate and take more interest in your friends and partners interests.

***** Quite true, yes, though I would argue that there's a difference between actively prioritising your own interests and actively denigrating those of other people. And to be clear, I'm not favouring Hermione over Ron in that regard either - they both do it to each other.

I mean, I know that we tend to broaden and develop in that way typically, but do you think they actually would develop to the degree that they do take an interest in each other's interests? I certainly can't imagine Ron trying to take an interest in academics or Hermione trying to care about pranks/Quidditch myself. (That's not rhetorical btw, I'm genuinely curious on your thoughts).

** Hate it. To this day I have no idea how they could possibly have a healthy and happy relationship or how they even became interested in each other in the first place. If it wasn't for harry they wouldn't have become friends, and if he had disappeared at any point after it I can only imagine that they would have stopped hanging out very quickly.

Hermione and Ron should have been with people who actually compliment them and their personalities (and no, 'opposites attract' is not a valid basis for a long term relationship) and with who they actually share interests and goals with.

My only exception to that is in stories where they're the bad guys (e.g. harry is falsely sent to azkaban and they're in on it) and therefore you want them to be unhappy.

** I hate it. They don't have anything in common aside from shared war experiences - which is admittedly a lot but not necessarily something to build a life on - and personally if I was Hermione I would /never/ be able to forgive him for leaving during the horocrux hunt especially since this wasn't the first time he was willing to abandon his friends (her during the broom/scanners fisco, Harry 4th year) Aside from that she hates quidditch and doesn't think that much of pranks (his only real interest + his eventual job) and he has no interest in learning for learnings sake or the concept of reading for fun. I just can't imagine them having anything to talk about after both kids are at school. It makes me sad more than anything because they both deserve someone who loves them for who they actually are not for who the other person wants them to be.

** J.K. did Hermione dirty. Actually she did Harry dirty too. Did they really have to end up with their first crushes (well second in Harry's case)? You grow up to be a brilliant,smart witch and end up with Molly's spawn, Ronald Weasley? Not someone who challenges you, makes you grow but friggin Ronald Weasley? As for Harry, the only reason I think he was drawn to Ginny stemmed from his desire for family and the subconscious fear of losing Weasleys as adopted family I think :/ I am deeply disappointed with the epilogue. (I am deeply disappointed with many things but the epilogue shippings take the cake)

** I think it's fine, better than the alternatives. Rowling and romance just aren't a combination that spells for good writing. I'll take it over pairings that the fandom came up with for sure. Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, etc. are not especially good either. Gen is my preferred, but Ron/Hermione is the best alternative for me. I'll even take Harry/Hermione/Ron if the mood strikes me.

** I can see them dating at Hogwarts, but it not working out.

Marriage? I don't see them making it five years, and probably ending after one of them snaps and puts the other in St. Mungo's.

Hell after he ran off during the hunt, I'm not even sure why she'd date him afterwards.

** in canon, i'm not a fan of this pairing at all. while i could go on and on about how they don't complement each other as characters, that isn't what annoys me the most: i hate when characters end up with their high school sweethearts. it's an unhealthy expectation, especially in a series meant for children. and it's unrealistic- statistically, couples who marry young or who are each others' first relationship are more likely to have marital problems or to get divorced.

in fic, there are plenty of ways this pairing could be done well, but you'd have to ignore things implied in canon, go OOC, or give it more time. i agree with you that it's weird and rushed in the books (although it could partially be attributed to Harry being oblivious.)

** I truly hate it. Another example of JKR not sticking with her plan and folding to pressure. It is rushed, She was planing for HP/HG from the start. But then people got in to her ear that Ron "30 silver sickles" Weasley needed a romance. And opposites "that do not even care that, you care about your interests" attract!!!! But what about Harry "no passion for MAGIC" Potter, well we get Miss. Butter Dish Ginny "In love with an Idea" Weasley, Oedipus complex, friends little sister from left stage to date her Boy-Who-Lived prince. So there goes the "Things more important..., the hug, a rescue flight, the friend who was always their, ect. Hermione "Smartest Witch of her Generation, next Minister of Magic" Granger to Hermione "I love the boy who always hates learning and improvement" Weasley. The Epilogue from Hell and some of what been added after has only made me dislike canon even more. But that's why we read and write fanfiction.
