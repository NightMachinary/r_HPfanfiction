We get this question every once in a while. Seems like it's been a little bit. Lets get some new recs out there. If you've already answered, maybe include your favorite up and coming fics as well. Here's some of mine, all are pretty lengthy and at least fairly well written.

Code Geass:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9779574/1/A-King-Without-a-Crown][A King Without A Crown]] by Halt.CPM

#+begin_quote
  The sound of clinking metal was as oppressive as the cuffs that bound her hand. "How far do you think you can go without my power?" she huffed at the Prince. Purple met amber in a silent, violent clash of wills. Lelouch leaned into his chair, the small smile that twisted his lips gave him a look of arrogance. Arrogance and superiority. "Far enough."
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9204949/1/Ice-and-Fire][Ice and Fire]] by Alsmash

#+begin_quote
  When Lelouch decided to stay in Britannia and become the Demon of Britannia, he did so to protect his sister. When Kallen assumed the mantle of Zero it was to avenge her family. And when the two meet on the battlefield that is Area 11, their struggles will culminate in a sweeping revolution that will consume the world.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6175861/1/Dauntless][Dauntless]] by Allora Gale

#+begin_quote
  Lelouch had been quite happy with his life. Sure they were living in obscurity, but he and Nunnally were safe. All of that changes however, when his identity is revealed and Lelouch is forced back into the fold of the Imperial family.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3816236/1/Lelouch-of-Britannia][Lelouch of Britannia]] by Cal Reflector

#+begin_quote
  History often hinges on a moment. What if young Lelouch avoided the fate of exile and remained with the royal family? All roles become reversed. The tale of Lelouch's quest for power and vengeance as the Black Prince of the Empire.
#+end_quote

Incidentally, Code Geass has a surprisingly high ratio of good fics for such a small fandom. If you like the series (or even just the world, which is my main draw), it's worth looking for more.

Star Wars:

Pretty much everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1584073/blank101][Blank 101]] is worth reading. I'm not even a huge Star Wars fan, but he really is a fabulous writer. I follow his update schedule semi religiously.

How To Train Your Dragon:

Fair warning with this fandom: It's got about the same ratio of bad to good fanfic as the HP one does. So pretty shit. There tends to be a couple really popular trends that crop up. The one I see the most is "Hiccup leaves instead of confronting the dragon after he wins the right to kill it, going on an adventure". Sometimes it comes out really well, most often not. If you like adventure stories, this fandom is actually pretty damn good. I love travelling and am filled with wanderlust even after spending a good portion of my life on the road, so this is totally my thing. If it's your thing, it might be worth checking out more of the fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024873/1/Lei%C3%B0][Lei√∞]] by The Antic Repartee

#+begin_quote
  Astrid and Hiccup's "romantic flight" comes to an abrupt end when the Red Death follows them out of the nest. Following an unexpected and desperate fight, Astrid finds herself stranded on an island, injured, with a crippled and comatose Hooligan heir and his overprotective Night Fury. She's going to get them home---all three of them---or die trying.
#+end_quote

Fair warning: Not a romance fic. It kind of sounds like it could be. It's not.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6318423/1/Hitchups][Hitchups]] by The Antic Repartee

#+begin_quote
  Hiccup didn't see the point in stopping Astrid as she ran off towards his village---towards his father---with his most desperately protected secret. He was leaving anyway. A coming-of-age tale. Deviates from movie. Borderline bromantic-comedy.
#+end_quote

Warning: The next two are extremely similar takes on a very similar plot. The first is a more lighthearted (kind of) take on it. The second is rather more dark way of going about it. Probably more realistic as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740714/1/Persephone][Persephone]] by Sunflowerb

#+begin_quote
  She was meant to be the price for peace; her life in exchange for the Dragon Master's mercy. Her captor wasn't supposed to be a ghost from her past, and she wasn't supposed to become his ally...or his lover. And when news spreads of a blonde-haired girl at the Dragon Master's side, there will be repercussions for dragons and Vikings alike. AU. hiccstrid. multichap
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11567973/1/Scars-We-Gave][Scars We Gave]] by HiILikeDragonsArchive

#+begin_quote
  Sacrifice AU. She hates him for everything he was and everything he's become. A traitor. Apathetic. A vengeful spirit devouring the cliffs of Berk. In his volcanic dragon nest, it's hard to tell which Hiccup she hates most- the boy who left his village to die, or the man who stole her from it.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11000580/1/To-Boldly-Flee][To Boldly Flee]] by John Mccallistair

#+begin_quote
  Hiccup had intended to run away quietly, to leave Berk without notice or confusion. However, an incident at the cove results in him "accidently" kidnapping Astrid along with him as he flees. He, she and Toothless now embark on an odyssey across Dark Age Europe, learning what it means to grow up, live, and to love. A new take on the "Hiccup runs away" AU. Hiccstrid.
#+end_quote

Pokemon:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7354757/1/The-Game-of-Champions][The Game of Champions]] by L. Lamora

#+begin_quote
  There are many trainers in the world; they exist in degrees, from dabbler to legend. But only one can be the very best - one man, one Champion. I am that one. I am that man. My name? Red.
#+end_quote

Everyone saw this coming probably. Only Pokemon fic I've read, it's really fucking good.

I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of it off the top of my head. So now that I'm through, what are your favorites?


** Aww, I thought I was going to be able to just mindlessly quote The Game of Champions again:

#+begin_quote
  No. Fuck no. If my 'no' was a pokemon, it'd be a legendary, made entirely out of hyper beams and hate, annihilating entire regions at a time, leaving only blasted craters in its wake, all shaped like the word NO.
#+end_quote

Anyway, clearly you already know that one. A big one I found recently is /Sudden Contact/ by A Very Thirsty Megalomaniac linkffn(11034056). It's a Starcraft/Mass Effect merging, but I treat it as original fiction because I've no experience with either.

As a straight sci-fi, it's a damn good one. 5/5

#+begin_quote
  At the dawn of the Great War, first contact was made between the protoss, imperious firstborn of the xel'naga, and the turians, proud militarists. As the galaxy catches fire at this sudden conflict, unlikely alliances are formed while ancient directives are carried out by the oldest minds in the Milky Way.

*** Funny you should mention this author's work, because I was about to link one of his as well. linkffn(Beyond the outer gate lies)

Dresden goes to the dxd universe, where as per the usual he 'kicks ass and takes names'.

So the crossover is with dxd that is essentially a harem anime (which I don't even like beyond its somewhat comic value) however its world mechanics and magic system are very interesting to mess with.

  Harry Dresden had thought he'd seen it all. So had the voice inside his head for that matter.

  Tsubaki snorted slightly, having that look that only someone who was initiated into something secret could have when they were talking to someone they thought wasn't in the know. It didn't really work when the person they were talking to really was in the know, though I'll admit that I wasn't quite as in the know now that I was in a world completely alien to my own. Still in the know enough to know that I knew more than most know.

** *In the Avatar: the Last Airbender fandom:*

linkffn(Retroactive by loopy777) is pretty much my favourite AtLA fic. The author is one of the most accomplished in the fandom - he wrote "Mai's Ramblings" - and his style is crazy good. The suspense in "Retroactive" is what absolutely makes the story. I haven't read it since it was actively updating, though.

linkffn(Avatar Aang: an Annotated Bibliography) is a wonderfully dry and "academic" fic that's a blast to read (it's pre-LoK, so it's not compliant with that), and linkffn(Bring Me All Your Elderly!) is a gloriously hilarious slice of meta-upon-meta, with an extremely fragile fourth wall.

*In the Orphan Black fandom:*

Tumblr user "Sharkodactyl" has written hundreds upon hundreds of little scenes and vignettes and minifics, and they're generally quite good, which makes the sheer number of all of them impressive.

  A seal had managed to defeat and imprison the Kyuubi no Kitsune, the strongest demon to ever exist. It was just ink on paper-or a stomach, as the case may be-and it held so much power... 'Yeah,' Naruto decided 'I gotta get me some of that.'

** I highly enjoyed linkao3(167 Rane of Aniss), for its look at Yeerk society a generation after the war. I also liked linkffn(The Husk), for a look at how Eva felt felt as the host of Visser One. And the Daemorphing series, the first of which is linkao3(Make a little birdhouse in your soul), a crossover with HDM, provides new perspectives on canon and makes the Animorphs act smarter.

On the MLP:FiM side, I really like Friendship is Optimal and The Great Alicorn Hunt.

******* Yes! I've messaged the author a couple of times, and he (she?) says that the plan is to focus primarily on OCs. I can see why it's under LOK though - it deals a lot with that culture mixing, in a clear break from ATLA which seemed silo'ed from a cultural standpoint. Oh, and yeah, I definitely plan to check out Embers. Tbh, I haven't found a ton of great stuff for with ATLA or LOK on FFN.

******** Trust me Embers is the most plausible and well researched fic that you'll find on that site. It focuses heavily on world building and the theme is picking up your own shit and not having it done for you.

The thing about the fic is it differs from the norm of fics that currently populate the site: shippy fics. This focuses on family and, as I've said literally the world.

Edit: forgot to mention that it encompasses both Books 2 and 3.

  Kinkmeme Prompt: Fenris and Hawke are bound together by magic.Artemis Hawke is not only a mage, but one who is impossibly sunny, incapable of shutting her yap, and doesn't quite understand the concept of boundaries. So, naturally, fate saw fit to magically bind Fenris to the woman.Of course, there is much more to Artemis than a big smile, grandma robes and magic -- just as there is much more to Fenris than his hate.You can learn a lot about a person when you're forced to be with them every second of the day. You might even like what you find.

** Well, last time there was a thread like this, I was super late to the party, so I don't mind repeating myself, especially since I still think this is the best fanfic, from any fandom, of all time, and I never get tired of rereading it:

linkffn(The Loyal Daughter by Doc M).

Mind-blowing levels of research, layered characters, and /it saved the movie/ for me. Like, I like /The Patriot/ because of this fic, rather than the other way around. Possible squick warning for American Revolution medical practices. Edited to add: Technically incomplete, but it ends at a good stopping point.

Also, this Star Trek: TOS fic never gets old, either.

linkffn(Impromptu Bondmates by Nemo the Everbeing)

This fic is so good it has converted people to Spock/McCoy. Brilliant for many reasons, but especially notable for taking the well-known Star Trek trope of getting Spock together with anyone by forcing them to bond in an emergency situation and giving such a situation some consequences. Still manages to be fun, too!

** A few Pokemon stories other than /The Game of Champions/ that I really like: linkffn(Pedestal by Digital Skitty; Pokemon: The Origin of Species; Harry Potter and the Master Ball; Ree Majors' Wonderful Journey by Digital Skitty; Triumvirate by Renaerys; The Sun Soul) in roughly the order I'd recommend them in. I love Pokemon stories with heavy worldbuilding, so they're the most common recommendations from me (same for Naruto, but in Harry Potter, I don't have quite the same preference for some reason)

linkffn(The Metropolitan Man) is an AU Superman fanfiction, set from the perspective of Lex Luthor. If there's one story from this list that you should read, it's this one. Requires no knowledge at all of any DC or Marvel storylines, and includes only Superman, Lex Luthor and Lois Lane. The author's other stuff is good too, especially a Star Wars oneshot about construction project problems which is much better than that sounds as a summary linkffn(Instruments of Destruction by alexanderwales)

Naruto is the fandom that I probably have the second most recommendations for, but most of it is in the wiki on [[/r/narutofanfiction]] - I'll just mention the top five, in my opinion. Number 1 is [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]], an AU that's supposed to be somewhat rational - but it's not that much like HPMOR (other than being shorter, it's much less preachy and doesn't emphasize the rational aspects as much, the main character isn't modelled as much after the author, and the plot is stronger and easier to follow). If you don't enjoy it after the Chunin exams, you should probably drop it, but read until Neji's fight.

Number 2 is linkffn(Team 7's Ascension: Blood Wings by Eilyfe) and the sequel, which is currently being written. Number 3 is linkffn(Shinobi: Team 7 by galleyrat) which is a vast AU that /heavily/ modifies canon. It's especially good when you're looking for something original after all the same-ish stories that congregate near the top of the search function if you sort by favourites/follows/reviews. Number 4 and 5 are both 'Naruto is changed and the world is harsher', and co-incidentally both have a second story by the same author where that character/team is switched into canon: linkffn(People Lie by Nugar; The Empty Cage by Rathanel)

A few other stories that are good, but from other fandoms: linkffn(A Voice Across the Void by Zoltan Berrigomo; Worm d20 by throwaawy) and various Worm stories on primarily spacebattles:

If you haven't read [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] yet, don't read these recommendations as they have some minor spoilers for canon - go read Worm first, it's really great! A superhero story that feels /real/ in a way comics or movies don't - like the 'capes' are actual people.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]] - what canon could have been if Taylor had joined the Wards [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-tale-of-transmigration-worm-au.292403/][A Tale of Transmigration]] - slightly less dark than canon, and a fairly nice story idea\\
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-techno-queen-ii.303290/][THE TECHNO QUEEN]] - crack with a bit of fluff, good after a heavier story

  Ree Majors issues a challenge to herself: get eight Unovan badges in under a year. Fifth time's the charm, right? But she's not really cut out for training, not like her boyfriend or her sister, and it's not like she can rely on anyone but herself. And her pokemon, she should probably remember that it's a team effort. So they can go on a wonderful* journey together. (*not at all)

** If you know absolutely anything about *Life is Strange* then you absolutely have to read linkao3(5096726) and linkffn(11677179). Both are fantastic, and will stand on their own so long as you know the basic premise behind the characters (though they will both spoil various aspects of the game) but are simply sublime with context.

Also, because so many people seem to love *Avatar* here, I'd also recommend linkffn(10615403)
