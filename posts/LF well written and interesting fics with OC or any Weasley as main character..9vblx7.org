Pretty much title. Looking for well-written OC or Weasley centric fics. Any Era is fine.


** A lot of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Efloreatcastellum][stories by FloreatCastellum]] fit your request, including "The Aurors" (and its sequel), which has an OC protagonist; "Not From Others" follows Ginny during the last year of the war; "Tired" is a lovely/sad/funny one-shot about George after the war.

Here are a couple great Percy Weasley stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel][The Scarlet Pimpernel]] (Adventure/Humor) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4800046/1/The-Unwinding-Of-Percy-Weasley][The Unwinding Of Percy Weasley]] (Drama/Romance).

I'm in the midst of writing a story that follows [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723602/1/The-Ollivanders][Todd Ollivander and Maggie Gibson]], who are both OC creations of mine. They both work at the wand shop during the late '70s, early '80s.

Typical recommendations for OC characters also include [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] (a D&D crossover) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][the Alexandra Quick series]] (which takes place in America).

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Annerb/pseuds/Annerb][Annerb]] has a lot of great Ginny-centric fics, the most recced example being [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189][The Changeling]] linkao3(189189).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/882572][Secrets]] linkao3(882572) is CoS from Ginny's POV.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300][The Very Secret Diary]] linkao3(2345300) is Ginny and Tom's "conversations" during CoS.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7681432][blood will tell but often it tells too much]] linkao3(7681432) is a nice post-War, Percy-centric oneshot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2752982][Taking Stock]] is a short fic from George's PoV, shortly after the war.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9932798/1/Weasley-Girl-Secrets-of-the-Past]]

This series comes by Hyaroo to mind. The POV is Harry in the first story, Ronnie in the second one. There's a proposed third story coming as well, and some spin-off stories, including a funny "how to write gender flipped characters"

The trope is "what if Ron was a girl?" and the repercussions of that story change is actually done well imo.

Edit: The bot down again? Seems not to work with ffn links.
