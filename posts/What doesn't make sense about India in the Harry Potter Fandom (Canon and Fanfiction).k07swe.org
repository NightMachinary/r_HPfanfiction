In the official wiki, it used to be written (before it was changed apparently) that India's magical populace was distrustful of broomsticks and instead, flying carpets were more popular and was the preferred mode of travel.

No. It has to be remembered that India was under the rule of the British East India Company from 1757-1858, and then the British Empire (known as the British Raj) from 1858-1947. That's 190 years for the British to introduce their culture and sports to India. Is canon telling me with a straight face, that while the non-magical British could introduce us to Cricket and Hockey, the magical British could not properly introduce us to Quidditch and the broomsticks because of 'distrust'?! That's just not possible. Look at India's legal system! While an amalgamation of common law, civil law, and religious law, the major parts of our legal system /is/ British Common Law! More importantly, flying carpets is not Indian, it's Arabic. There is a mention of one of the characters in the stories of the Arabian Nights going to the Vijayanagara Empire to buy a flying carpet, but again, it is more Arabic than Indian. An argument could be made considering before the British, India was under the rule of Muslim Kings and Emperors from 1206-1526 (Delhi Sultanate) and then 1526-1857 (Mughal Empire. The last Mughal Emperor was exiled to Burma due to his role in the 1857 Rebellion). Of course, in between as well there were many other dynasties like the Sikh Empire, Maratha Empire, etc.

In reality, Indian magicals would be using broomsticks. Not only that but considering the massive size of India, instead of one line of an Indian version of the Hogwarts Express, there would be at least 5-7 special railway lines taking students from all across the country to India's Magical School (For the sake of this discussion, let's pretend it is located at the [[https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-most-haunted-fort-in-india/article20231373.ece][Bangarh Fort]]). On a not so important note, the Indian National Quidditch Team would have also won the World Cup a few times.

The official wiki mentions the Indian Ministry of Magic. That by itself I don't have much of a problem with, as it can go two ways. One, a separate Ministry of Magic for the Republic of India (again, taking it from Britain), or two, the Ministry of Magic is instead known as the Department of Magical Affairs under the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India][Indian Ministry of Home Affairs]]). Of course, then comes the question of how would the laws relating to Magical India be drafted and passed. Would they be drafted by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India][Parliament of India]], or is there an Indian version of the Wizengamot (If yes, how are they elected? Because India does not have the system of Lords, Ladies, Sirs, Dames, etc., and the landed fief systems, jagirdari and zamindari systems, were done away with)? I'm cool with the fact that snake-charming would be illegal under India's magical law (breaking the statute of secrecy), as in a way of speaking, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs_and_Magic_Remedies_(Objectionable_Advertisements][there is legislation where using magical remedies as pretense for curing disease]]_Act,_1954) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Superstition_and_Black_Magic_Act][and the practice of Black Magic is prohibited]].

If you have read this post till here, you're a legend.

Finally, I read a fanfiction where Harry moves to India (fair, nothing wrong there), and he finds out that using magic willy-nilly won't even get him a slap on the wrist, because, 'Magical India has different laws then Magical Britain and everyone can use magic however they please'. Now, I do respect the authors' creativity (which is why I won't name the fic), but that makes zero sense! What's the point of the Statute of Secrecy then?! Again, maybe not now (or when the Harry Potter franchise is set) the laws on the performance of underage magic, performing magic in front of non-magicals, and other similar magical offenses, but at least at some point following independence (definitely until 26th January 1950, the date the Constitution of India came into effect), the punishment for these offenses would have been on the same level of harshness as that of Britain. If I again compare it to the non-magical laws, criminal law in India still finds its roots in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act][Government of India Acts passed by the British Parliament]], and more importantly, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India_Act_1935][Government of India Act 1935]]. To get to the point, the three main acts of India's Criminal Law, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code][Indian Penal Code 1860]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Evidence_Act][Indian Evidence Act 1872]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Criminal_Procedure_(India][Code of Criminal Procedure 1973]]) have heavy elements of the British Colonial Law, and for sure India's Magical Criminal Law would also be the same.

If you have read the *entire* post till here, you are an absolute unit of a legend. Thank you for reading my entire post (though wouldn't be surprised if it's seen as a rant, cuz it kinda is). I would love to know what is your opinion on this matter in the comments below!

Edit: Just made a few formatting changes.


** The statute of secrecy was instituted nearly 100 years before that, so there's a very strong possibility that magical India is exactly the same as it was before the east India company came along. If so, then their distrust of brooms could very well be due to the failed attempts by British magicals that came with the non-magicals to invade India.

*** Yes. But what makes you think that the Ministry of Magic in Britain and the Wizengamot wouldn't pass laws to streamline magic in India, to get the various tantriks and all under proper law and order? An invasion was not needed to get India under control. They came in as businessmen, doing business, and then through various tactics, which did include direct military action, the EIC was in control of India. The ministry of magic could easily set up their presence with the permission from the Governor-General.

***** Considering the Europeans were trading in India since the 1600s, which would have seen a few brave magical adventurers come to India. By 1692, the EIC already had a firm foothold in Bengal and Surat, and following the death of the last of the Great Mughals, Aurangzeb, the decline of the Mughal Empire already started. Also, the Mughal Empire was /not/ as strong at that time as one would believe, as Chhatrapati Shivaji (1627-1680, crowned in 1674) had started a full-fledged war against the Mughals. By the time of Shivaji's death in 1680, the Maratha Kingdom (or Confederacy, whatever you wanna call it) comprised of *4.1%* of the Indian Subcontinent, and by the time of his grandson's rule, it was a proper Empire.

Yes, all of this happened before 1692, but by that time the British EIC (and the French EIC to some extent), were already firmly entrenched in Indian soil and weren't going to leave easily. So by the time the British EIC started going gung-ho in its conquest, the Indian wizards should have given loads of fucks.

I don't see Wizarding Britain conquering Magical India. Not enough manpower, bad supply lines, and "oh, the Indian wizards allied with them" seems a little too convenient.

What's up with the supply line argument? Mokeskin pouches in the books and movies showed that you could transport a nuke and no one would be the wiser. GoF showed that the interior of tents could be magically expanded, and you're talking about supply lines? I'm sorry if I sound a little rude, but the supply line argument is not an argument at all.

You are correct on the Anglo-Mughal War, but by the time of the Battle of Plassey (1757), the Mughals were dwindling to the point where it was not even funny, and the British East India Company were the de-facto rulers of India.

******** I'm talking about the supplies you can't easily duplicate - potions, other mmagical goods such as wands and brooms, and, most importantly, replacement personel. There's also the communication issue. Even with magic, it takes time to get anything from Britain to India - especially with other countries in the way. Also, some of the goods aren't interchangeable - if you lose your wand, you need a compatible one; not any old wand will do - and limited; you won't get to pick from Ollivander's whole selection. The more wands you ship to India so people can pick a replacement wand there, the fewer you have for your people in Britain.

Further, I don't think the British wizards had any advantages such as the British muggles had (better ships, better weapons, tactics etc.). (And I don't think that the Mughal Empire as actually opposed to wizards in this world - before the Statute of Secrecy, no country would have been able to conquer another country if they didn't have wizards on their side but the other side did. So, the mere existence of the Empire means they didn't persecute wizards. Either case, the Indian wizards have much shorter supply lines. And much greater numbers, too. Even if you assume there are a few sepoys, that won't be enough. And if the British manage to hire enough wizards to fight the locals, then they just outclassed themselves - wizards aren't muggles, a wizard trained for combat can't be as easily controlled as a sepoy.

********* Of course, you cannot easily duplicate potions, magical brooms, and wands. Which is why, at least for potions and brooms, there would be extras in reserve. Losing wands? Even amongst non-magicals, the officers who commanded the armed regiments of the East India Company were men who had a history of service with the British Army. Why do you think that the battlemages that would be sent would be a bunch of amateurs? The battlemages won't be losing their wands as a non-magical soldier would be losing their rifle. Heck, losing a rifle is enough to shut down an entire military installation to find and retrieve it.

Yes, the non-magicals have better ships, rifles, etc., but at most, wizards would be facing down on fellow magic practitioners on land. Of course, it can go either way and it could be brutal.

The Mughal Empire is not opposed to wizards? The Mughals were Muslims, and according to the Holy Quran, [[https://www.islamawareness.net/BlackMagic/magic.html][magic is to be condemned, as it goes against Muhammad's teaching]]. An ultra-orthodox Emperor such as Aurangzeb would have definitely instituted a purge on the level of Stalin's (or worse) if he ever knew that magic practitioners existed.

Why on God's Green Earth are you, again and again, saying that magical India would have been united as a separate Empire at that period of time?!

The number of Indian wizards who would resist the British wizards would be small. If they wouldn't join up with them, they would completely ignore the British, until the laws passed by the British Ministry of Magic or the Wizengamot or the magical representation of the EIC started interfering in their affairs.

Again, your supply line argument does not make sense, also do you think a magical sepoy couldn't be controlled? Dangle a regular pay, comparatively better benefits, and some more goodies, and watch that dude fight against his own brethren. That was how the EIC managed to do their conquests.

********** First, there's a huge difference between a trained wizard and soldier. A trained wizard will be a member of the upper class - not a mercenary who needs the work. You can't compare hiring sepoys with hiring wizards because you'd need to pay Indian wizards a fortune for those "better benefits" to get them to fight for you - and you'd have a hell of a time to keep them from kicking you out afterwards anyway and taking over. You might be able to hire some lower-caste wizards if they were discriminated against - but they generally won't have the training to be of much use. And even there, the question remains: Why would the wizards fight for Britain and remain loyal, unless they were rewarded with power and status better than they had before? They wouldn't easily accept being second-class subjects of the British wizards in that case.

I also don't think the Indian wizards would ignore foreign wizards conquering their lands. That's not how things work.

Don't forget that in the 18th century travel times for mundane people was still measured in weeks and months for travel across a country like India. While for magical people it was hours/days with the ability to teleport vast distances, or fly over obstacles like rivers, mountains, and gorges.

***** Again, direct military invasion was not the only trick in the hat for the British East India company also, at the time the British East India Company was really starting to go on a conquering spree, India was not at all united. If you look at India's history of the time period, there were tons of petty princes who wanted to settle minor scores against each other and would bring in the Europeans to help, in turn, the Europeans would pass ridiculous doctrines (Like the Doctrine of Lapse, by Lord Wellesly, I believe) to have those princes swear their loyalty to the British. The number of battles the EIC actually fought was considerably small compared to the number of people who would have a bone to pick with them. Just like how non-magical India was not united, similarly, magical India would also not be united. Even if they were, history has proven time and again, that it only takes one traitor to bring the house of cards falling down.

Also, passing laws for a different country does not count when the territory in question was internationally recognised to be part of Britain (Until 1947).

I'm not sure what you mean by the 18th Century travel times. How could wizards apparate from Britain to India, if they've never been there? Actually, how on could they cross the seven seas and massive landmasses through apparation? Portkey? Again, the location and source have to be known on both sides. Abraxan pulled carriages (Like for Beauxbatons Academy in GoF)? Possible, but that would only be for high ranking individuals. Broomsticks? Again quite possible. But there's no evidence to prove that broomsticks can span continents and seas. At least without stopping. Therefore, even for the wizards, they would have to come by ship.

As for your travel part, you are correct, I did not see that 'across India', my mistake. Nonetheless, the least you could do for apparation is to use apparation points and not just pop in and out wherever you like.

******** The point I keep trying to make clearly and apparently failing. Is that there is no reason why magical India should be under British rule simply because muggle India is. They've been separated for 100 years by the time muggle India is subjugated, and they also have a longer and deeper tradition of mysticism than the UK does, with a society that was concurrent with Ancient Egypt. The only surviving comparable society is China.

They could easily have carved out an area the size of Ireland and kept it separate from the muggle world, then bring in the families that have magical children to live there, so that their genetic diversity stays strong.

********* I get your point. But that has a bunch of problems on it. Your first point said that the Statute of Secrecy came into effect 100 years before the EIC. I do admit that I did not write it clearly enough, but from 1757, the rule of the EIC was more or less set in stone following the Battle of Plassey. Europeans were trading with India since the early 1600s.

From a certain point of view, you can say that magical India should not be under British rule like non-magical India. However, considering that there will always be /that/ one guy who is enticed by the British, it wouldn't be long before Indian wizards would flock to the British banner. One of the main weapons of the EIC's initial conquests in India was the use of Sepoys. Local men trained to fight for the Company. Wouldn't surprise me if the magical conquests would also happen in the same way.

Again, it would not surprise me if the EIC (the magical side of it anyway) used the Indian wizards for conquering that hypothetical, magically closed-off city. All it will take is one traitor from there to reveal the location (if it was in some mass fidelius charm or something similar).

Also, you are correct on the fact that Indian culture easily compares with Ancient Egypt and is now only comparable to China. But we all know what happened to the Chinese when they got on the wrong side of the British (Opium War).

**** Magical Britain in canon is enough like non-magical Britain that I assume British wizards would be colonial-minded as well. Also, it's convenient to assume wizarding geopolitics resemble Muggle geopolitics, otherwise the maps would be completely different.

I mention India in my fic more than once. Nineteen-year-old Harry has a teammate on the Chudley Cannons who's an Indian pure-blood who grew up in England but still has strong ties to India. He was there during the final year of the war, playing for a Quidditch team in Bangalore (I didn't give the team a name, since it obviously wouldn't be in English). I also refer to a canon Death Eater family having gained its fortune plundering the subcontinent (a running theme in my fic is that families like the Blacks got rich by stealing from and/or exploiting Muggles).

In another scene, Harry gets lectured by a bunch of Irish wizards about English oppression (he's at an Irish pub with a rival Seeker after a Quidditch match, and they guilt-trip him into buying a round):

#+begin_quote
  The pub erupted into cheers, and Harry paid at the bar. When he returned, the older wizard said, ‘That's a start, Potter. Now what else are you going to do to fix Anglo-Irish relations?'

  ‘Er,' stalled Harry, unsure how to reply.

  ‘Support some Irish charities,' said a witch. ‘Muggle charities.'

  ‘Muggle charities?' said Harry, surprised.

  ‘You said it yourself, it's hard to starve as a wizard. But Muggles are perfectly capable of starving, and the English have a history of helping it along.'

  Thus began a long lesson in Irish history, which left Harry appalled. ‘Why couldn't Irish wizards help more?'

  ‘Secrecy,' said a scowling witch. ‘Fucking English secrecy.'

  ‘But it's the International Statute of Secrecy, not the British Statute of Secrecy,' said Harry.

  ‘Yeah, and who spearheaded it? The British!'

  A bookish-looking wizard spoke up. ‘Indeed they did. Including a certain Ralston Potter.'

  ‘Who?' asked Harry.

  ‘One of your ancestors, from the 1600s. He pushed hard for the Statute of Secrecy.'

  ‘To be fair,' said a witch, ‘he was arguing against wizards who wanted to declare war on Muggles.'

  ‘Then why did the Irish oppose secrecy?'

  ‘We got on better with Muggles than you lot did. Irish Muggles were less afraid of magic and knew better than to persecute our children, and we helped them in return. But the British made a mess of things in the colonies---and at home---which they believed justified secrecy.'

  ‘And that's why the Irish starved?'

  ‘There was more than one reason,' said the bookish wizard. ‘But secrecy was a big part of it.'

  ‘Then what's the best way to help poor Muggles?' asked Harry. ‘I don't see much hope in overturning secrecy, nor am I convinced it's a good idea. It might work in Ireland, but I can't see America pulling it off.'

  ‘No, they'd never agree to it,' said the witch. ‘Not even the Irish-Americans, who call themselves Irish but wouldn't know a Porlock from a Moke.'

***** Yet common sense at the time would indicate the desire for expansionism to satisfy an imperialistic mindset, regardless of whether it's Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, etc. Take North America for example. According to Rowling, when European wizards started arriving in North America, they had to deal with hostile natives, harsh environment (the American Frontier), the lack of specialist wizarding shops and apothecaries, the scourers, etc. Yet after the Salem Witch Trials, the Magical Congress of the United States of America was formed? How? Where did the idea of the United States of America in *1693* even come from? Considering that the colonies only started expanding after the 1690s, and were eventually called the Thirteen Colonies until the American Revolution.

Also, this idea that the wizards and witches are more forward-thinking than non-magicals needs to be dropped quicker than a bad habit. If they truly were as forward-thinking as they claim to be, Voldemort would have never been a problem. Families like the Blacks, Malfoys, etc., would have laughed off Voldemort and called him a delusional idiot, regardless of how good of a persuader he might be. At most, he would have just be seen as some radical hack like Oswald Mosley (except Mosley wasn't a hack, but crazy nonetheless for saying Hitler was correct).

Rowling has done a disservice by not properly exploring magical history by taking the non-magical history into account because as much as no one may want to admit it, they are interwoven with each other. Not only that, but someone must ask questions on how exactly the wizards' government (in this case the British Ministry of Magic) conduct their business. Informing the Prime Minister of stuff whenever the damn well you please with no prior warning does not make any sense. Two options seem much more viable. Either the Minister of Magic is part of the Cabinet, or instead of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Magic has weekly audiences with the Queen as the Monarch is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.

** I'm pretty sure that book-canon says nothing about India, so as far as I'm concerned, any author who wants write about it can do pretty much anything they want. But of course, it is better to look at actual Indian history and culture to figure out what magical India might be like.

I think the one point I have to actually disagree with you on I'd the influence of Britain on magical India. Remember that the Statute of Secrecy went in to effect in 1692, over 60 years before the date you gave for the British East India Company taking over. So while I'm sure some amount of British influence would bleed in over the years, I think it is entirely reasonable, and perhaps even more likely, to have magical India take much stronger influences from those Muslim empires you mentioned.

Of course, an author could just as easily explain that the British rule of India on the muggle side was a side effect of British and/or Indian magicals doing some colonialism or governmental reform or something like that, leading to a much stronger British influence.

So basically, as long as the author has thought it through and come up with a plausible explanation, I think it's fine.

*** That's what I'm trying to say. In the books, there is no mention of India. However my first part was from the fandom wiki. My assumption on India's magical history is by taking India's actual history into account.

You are correct on the Statute of Secrecy part. Which is why I said that the British magicals would have literally 190 years to develop the legal scene according to their liking, which could then easily adopted by India, who can then make amendments depending on how they see fit. I'm not sure about the Muslim empires. Why? Because the Quran doesn't exactly have nice words for magic practicioners, and considering how orthodox the Muslim rulers were, I'm pretty sure the magicals would have definitely burrowed themselves underground.

Rest, I agree.

** Just wanted to drop in to say I really enjoyed your post. This was totally not a subject that had ever crossed my mind and I'm delighted you brought it to my attention. My personal intuition is that Magical Britain probably did have ties Muggle Colonial Britain. I've recently rewatched the movies after a very long time of not seeing them and what struck me most was the strong, *STRONG* undercurrent of Orientalism in the aesthetics and I kinda find that fascinating. The easy explanation is that it was just an unconscious aesthetic choice made by prop and set designers etc etc, but if we wanna have fun with it and take it seriously in-universe, that hardcore Orientalism speaks volumes about colonialism in the magical world. In short, I agree with you, magical India is probably super into Quidditch and brooms.

*** Thank you very much. You are correct on the 'strong undercurrent of Orientalism' as you put it. My reason for writing this long post was that I had bumped into a few fanfictions that made zero sense about how India's magical society could be. Now I don't expect the authors to thoroughly research the place they're writing about, but sometimes even Indians, in their zeal to write good fanfics, make such mistakes. Another inspiration is from my criticism of the portrayal of the United States in the Fantastic Beasts franchise. As much as I liked the first movie, the second one wasn't that fun. Especially as I researched more into it, it looked like the Americans were basically behaving like the British on steroids. Something tells me in real life, until World War One at least, the American Wizarding Authorities (who could comprise some key people of the original signatories of the document of independence) would deliberately set up their institutions to be /under/ the U.S. Constitution and U.S. Congress just because the Brits did it the other way, and they want to spite them even more.

Just like how non-magical (and maybe even the magicals too, who knows) Indians are crazy about cricket and hockey, I'm pretty sure that the magical Indians are crazy about Quidditch as well. Of course, they can't exactly practice anywhere in fear of being caught. But still, I'm definitely sure they're mighty crazy about it. Won't surprise me if there's an Indian Quidditch League as well.

Money? they don't have any vested interests in spices or resources - most of those can already be either found at home or can be bought once and replicated by Magic. You're incorrectly assuming that Magical Britishers would have same reason to colonize Magical India as muggle Britishers had for muggle India.

*** Yes. My entire argument is coming from the fact that Magical Britain is able to subjugate the magical scene of India. You are seeing Magical India as if it was one big united country. Which is not possible. Because of your username, I'm assuming even you are an Indian. Tell me this, you might have read reports in newspapers (in the little corners in some middle page) of how the police arrest someone for practicing Black Magic. Do you think these so-called Black Magic practitioners have some form of governing cult? No. Same concept over here. Before the British Ministry of Magic set up a colonial government that was ruled directly by them and the Wizengamot in the UK, the practice of magic in India was scattered, done individually or in small groups in fear of religious persecution. It is not at all possible for magic in India to be united prior to British colonialization. After independence, definitely (okay the mess with Pakistan's magical government would also have to be dealt with).

Also, what do you mean that spices and resources can be simply replicated by magic? What was the point of Snape asking Harry where would he find a Bezoar (In the stomach of a goat, BTW)? A guy like Snape would have definitely overturned a cauldron in anger if he was given an answer that why not just replicate it with magic.

Given a huge chunk of Indian history, imagine that kind of purist beliefs and disregard for things not confirming to your existing society magnified times ten. British magicals, if any who might've ventured into India, would practically have been as good as inferior muggle-borns in Britain and therefore hardly been able to gain any sort of foothold let alone take over magical India.

******* Well yes, but also no. Again, there's a lot of other factors to take into account. Namely, religious sentiments. At that time, India (regardless of religion) was a very superstitious place (still is in rural India). Anyone practicing magic in the open in India at the time would have been flayed alive (if lucky) or would have things done to them that would make the Salem Witch Trials look like a courtroom drama on Netflix. Even if say, a King was open-minded about magic, and that's a big if, his court would have exploded into chaos, and that king would have been overthrown (by a myriad of people who love to see the guy gone for their own benefit) quickly. Therefore, I'm pretty sure before the British would have firmly put India under their control, the wizards would be in hiding, practicing individually, or in small groups, which might even create an entirely new branch of magic (Kinda like Native American Magic).

******* Considering how orthodox the Mughal Emperors used to be (Like Aurangzeb), instead of a magical Mughal Empire, all suspected wizards and witches would have been dismembered and other horrible things done to their corpses. So, it is nigh impossible for there to be a magical government under the Mughals. Heck, even under the Marathas or the Sikh Empire or other smaller states, because at that time, Religion and State were one and the same in India. The EIC strategy would be enough for the EIC. All the British Ministry of Magic has to do is set up a colonial government (maybe by first awarding a charter to the EIC or its magical equivalent), and then ruling it directly from 1858 onwards to 1947.

** Nice post, is a interesting question and i also think about the spanish/portuguese colonies.

If we think that with the International Statute of Secrecy the magic world cut all ties with the Muggles, we can think that in the Magic World somethings are different. We Know that the EEUU is not in the magic UK, but we do not know how they gain their indepence. In my headcanon, for example, the Central/southamerican nations didnt have the same success that their muggle counterpart. One reason why the great nations lost their colonies was that they were too far to fight in good terms. But with the Magic, the europeans could travel to America in a few time.

We dont know how big is the magic world in population, ¿did any country have/had a army? The witchhunt didnt happend in all the countries, for example, in reality, in Spain or Portugal few "witches" were burned, but in England or Germany the number of deaths was superior to the Iberian nations...

So, i dont think that India is part of Great Bretain, ¿There is a Commonwealth in magic world? Its a interesting question.

*** You may be right on the Spanish/Portuguese colonies. You are correct on the fact that in the various wars of independence in Central and South America, it would take half the time for Spanish and Portuguese battlemages to combat the agitators of independence, similar to how in the Indian War for Independence 1857 (Also called as the Sepoy Mutiny), there may have been British Battlemages dispatched to deal with the Indian magicals causing a ruckus. Same for the American War of Independence. However, I also believe desperate times would call for desperate measures. It is highly possible for the Magical independence fighters to collude with the non-magical independence fighters to pose as a united front. I'm pretty sure no one would give a flying rat's ass about the Statute of Secrecy when you're fighting a war for your independence. Of course, that would even give Spain and Portugal enough ammunition to go ham with a united approach.

Just like how there's a Commonwealth of Nations for the former countries of the British Empire, I think there would be a magical counterpart of that as well, where all the Ministers of Magic would meet.

** There's a few open ended questions here that I'm also interested in.

1. Was Magical Britain as colonialist as their Muggles? War is dependant on technology so if you assume that British Wizards were able to develop better spells/potions then they may have been able to succeed with colonies.

I'm Aussie so I'm interested in if a wizard among the first settlers would match up to the Magical Aboriginal population. They could have been as racist as the Muggles and slowly taken over.

1. Are Magical populations perfect counter parts to Muggles? If Wizards in Britain didn't care for their Muggles it could be similar to other populations. British wizards who travelled to India at the time of the EIC might not have had any special treatment/hostility due to the Muggle conflict. There might be neutral migrations (Patils) and trade in goods and culture.

This paints a picture that since the Magical populations are smaller the conflicts are at an interpersonal level. 95% of the time meeting another magical person can only benefit you (learning more, trading supplies).

1. We are the ones who get to decide in the end so do we want to be closer to real history (can be good for acknowledging where we come from) or do we push for it to be further from our history (maybe we want to tell a fun story with a diverse cast who don't hate each other, there are good stories here too).

**** Not a war really. There was undoubtedly conflict but most of it was irregular and very small in scale, but I didn't study it behind the core classes in high school and that can be unreliable. Also, aside from exploration the movement of settlers was based on resources and land for new arrivals. The main surges were the gold rush and then in the 20th century, especially after the world wars and conflicts in Asia.

In terms of Magicals everything is up in the air. (I've put my interpretation in brackets)

Do Magicals believe in the same racist ideas that made them hate the native population? (No)

Were British Magicals desperate to colonise? (No, not on behalf of the Ministry and most preferred to stay at home. There would be some who were interested in discovering new animals/plants, and others who wanted to meet the Magical Aboriginals. There were possibly others who wanted to escape Europe, but the trek is a lot further than Apparition or Portkey allows.)

Are Magical Aboriginals recognised as part of the International Community? (Depends on what the history of Magical Cooperation is. I don't watch Fantastic Beasts or Pottermore so I don't know what the rules are. We could just say that they have their own respected magic but haven't interacted much with other nations. So Magicals that arrive in Australia would have normal relations and don't bother Magical Aboriginals too much.)

Do any Magicals care about Muggles really? (No, especially before the 20th Century no one cared about Muggles because even if the culture has a positive view on magic, the very nature of it scares Muggles and they want to control Magic back. So even if Magical Aboriginals have a completely different approach to interacting with their Muggles they don't have the kind of kinship to get outraged when European Muggles do anything. [I have no clue how America deals with History and Magic so I'd rather keep it simple]

What does it look like now? (There are two halves to Magical Australia. The Native Aboriginals who have their own kinds of magic, which are really just forms of teaching and language rather than a completely different system. Like they use something other than a wand, components are used differently to potions, the southern star map is different. But they might have some more formalised structure so that they can interact with the other half of Australia.

The other half are from all over the globe and are interested in living very independent from home. They might farm unique plants/animals, I think there are unique dragons, and they do all the regular things for a Magical community. They are based on the British model and English is the main language. They get the majority of Muggleborns in Australia and have smaller schools. In my head the five major cities have their own schools for high school level (OWL's) while there is a single school for advanced study (NEXT's) and then you can get Mastery's or Apprenticeship's independently.

** Perhaps your initial statement, gives the greatest answer. What if India's magical population absolutely was afraid of brooms? Perhaps that was something that might have either offset the relationship between the two magical communities - or have been used to cause damage and harm (amongst other tactics that might have been at play). Maybe, the British magical community did try to get a piece of the pie, but actually fell short for whatever reason - with magical India hating anything British. Sentiment that is actually shared by some Indian youths whom I have met during my studies - who actually want an apology from England.

More importantly, Harry Potter was a soft world build - where more information was added throughout the books and even after it. I'm not sure whether you're arguing for the colonisation of magical India or not - if I'm completely honest. Either one is viable, personally - I would find it difficult to believe that magical Britain had the power/strength to control the entirety of magical India's population. If we assume that magic is uniform throughout the world and that an England wizard or witch isn't somehow more powerful naturally (like some white supremacy type of propaganda).

*** You may be right. But that distrust would only be at the most beginning of the introduction. But if not brooms, I can assure you, it sure as hell wouldn't be magical carpets. Everything you say can or cannot happen. I will not comment on whether the Indian youths you met, who want an apology from Britain are correct or not, because that's a whole different ball game. However, it is highly possible that Indian youths from upper-middle-class magical families (around the time of the British Raj) would willingly work in the British Indian Magical Government for a myriad of reasons.

You are correct on the fact that Harry Potter has a very soft world build. A few Japanese people I know told me that the name Mahoutokoro literally makes no sense. As if Rowling just typed in 'Magic School' on Google Translate and came up with her Japanese magical school name.

I am not arguing for, or against the colonisation of magical India. I am an Indian myself, and I personally think that the colonisation period was one of India's most shameful moments in history. Nonetheless, I'm also an avid admirer of history and am willing to accept the good and the bad of it. The reason why I say that it is highly possible for the British Ministry of Magic to use the colonisation efforts of their non-magical counterpart's, is because if the magical world was real, it would have definitely happened. Despite Rowling going on a safety-first approach (which is fair, it was originally a series for children), common sense of the time would definitely see various European Magical Governments taking part in or taking advantage of the colonisation efforts.

There's also one more reason why I say the magical colonisation of India is highly possible. It was because of British rule, India is united (not counting Pakistan or Bangladesh here). It is because of the laws passed then, the subjugation of Indians, and the valiant efforts of our freedom fighters, India stands united. As much as I hate to say this (and I can assure you I'm not an Imperialist apologist), it was the British rule that gave us that sense of purpose of never again falling under a foreign boot.
