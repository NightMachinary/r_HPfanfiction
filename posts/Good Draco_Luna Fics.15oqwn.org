Do you have any suggestions for good Draco / Luna fics? They do not have to be romances. I also like the idea of them as secret friends, or of Luna as someone that Draco secretly admires.

I've had a plot bunny for a multi-chapter Draco/Luna story for some time, but I have not yet written it. I've only written a drabble, as follows:

  Title: Stolen Moment Challenge Word: Unfettered Word Count: 100 Characters/Pairings: Draco Malfoy/Luna Lovegood

  Luna flinched as a copper basin clanged against the stone floor. She peered through the filthy strands of her once-blonde hair. Malfoy hovered nearby.

  "For you," he gestured, turning away as she reached for the soap to wash her skin and hair. When she finished, he leaned over and wrapped a blanket around her. His eyes were bloodshot.

  "I---didn't know---how it would be."

  "Then join us, Draco."

  "I can't." His hand shook as he pulled a key from his pocket and reached for the shackles around her ankles.

  ** "There," he whispered, "Now I'm the only one in chains."

The way I see it, for some reason, Luna has chemistry with EVERYONE, yet she is very difficult to write. I'd love to read some /good/ examples.


** I love Draco/Luna! They're two of the most difficult characters to write well, I think, and definitely have a lot of potential chemistry with everyone, Draco being so volatile and Luna with her general take on people.

I suggest this one here every so often; it's my favorite one-shot, and my headcanon as far as events during Luna's captivity in Malfoy Manor goes: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas In Prison]]

** Are there any others that you can think of, folks? Or is this pairing really unpopular?
