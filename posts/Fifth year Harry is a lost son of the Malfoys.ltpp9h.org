:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello! Im posting on here hoping some of you could help me out.

Im looking for a fic where its about a revelation about Harry being the son of the Malfoys. I think I remember he had detention with Umbridge and he found some way to reverse the blood quill on her so he called upon magic. In doing so it reversed on him and I think he started glowing and floating and there was a loud sound that Snape heard. He saw him and then called Lucius and Narcissa, Draco and they somehow helped him?

I remember the door was warded off and Dumbledore tried to get in.. This all sounds bonkers but i just really want to read that story again. I also dont believe it was finished.. or it maybe was. Thank you in advance :)


** linkffn(3771961). That scene occurs in chapter 9.

  Harry is sick and tired of the way everyone is treating him. Realising that drastic measures are needed, Harry stages a Potions accident. How was he to know that his actions would unravel secrets long hidden? And just whose son is he? AU year 5 HP/SS
