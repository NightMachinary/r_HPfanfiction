Hello, All,

It's been a hard week for me, what with school and everything else that's been going on, I haven't been able to work on the project at all.

I just found time to do some recording, and I got absolutely nothing done. You see, I have a stutter and a slight lisp, and, until I get over the stutter (the lisp is only a minor issue) I will not be able to produce adequate work for the community. Believe me, I love what I do and l want to keep doing it, however, I also want everyone in the Harry Potter fanfiction community to be able to listen to my work without cringing.

Does everyone still want me to do this?

Regards,

ThePianoProdigy


** I would love to hear fanfic as audio books. I listen to audiobooks while i'm at work (its the only reason I haven't quit my job) I'm quickly running out of "real" books. If you are concerned about your stutter you could get a few people to help with the recordings and focus more on organizing the project?

** I would love to help in any way I can. Also I would never cringe because of any sort of stutter or anything like that, I want to hear your words. If it takes an extra second because your vocal cords aren't cooperating it isn't your fault. Your giving your time, and that is so lovely.

** I am really excited for the audiobook project. A stutter or lisp would not deter me. I am happy to help out with more character voices if you need any help. :)

*** I see on the google doc that Molly Weasley is still up for grabs. I could give it a whirl?

***** I also wanted to say that no one will care if our voices or accents aren't perfect - it's like a cool project between friends! You've done a brilliant job coordinating this, no one will complain :) :) sending you Molly's bits now via email.

****** After hearing Molly's voice lines (or at least Chapter 1) I'm wondering what that rustling in the background is. It sounded like the rustling of bedsheets but I'm not sure.

Do you think you could re-record it without the rustling? (Sorry, I know it's a lot to ask)
