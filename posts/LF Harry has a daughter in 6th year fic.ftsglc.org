:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember where I had read it, but I do remember a fic where Harry went to some party and during the beginning of his 6th year, he finds out he has a daughter and receives custody of her from her mother, renames her, and resolves to take care of her himself if only to stop whatever abuse the Dursleys would do while he would be at school. I remember the description of the fic saying that he would have a lot on his plate already with trying to stop Voldemort, and now his daughter being thrown into the mix adding a lot of already jumbled confusion.

Thanks for any help!


** This fits your general description, but Snape plays a part and you might have mentioned him.\\

*** This is it! Thanks so much for finding it! I had barely started it and only remember up to Harry being at the Weasley's trying to take care of his daughter and hadn't gotten to Hogwarts yet.

** Sounds familiar, but I can't come up with it at the moment. Does it have Susan Bones helping him with the infant in the Hogwarts infirmary?

*** I've found the one I was thinking of. It's linkffn(Steps in Life by potter8668). However, it doesn't match your description - it's 5th year, there's no party, and no renaming of the daughter.
