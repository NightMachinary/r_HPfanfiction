#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** The Second String has the best Harry for every reason.

Harry is an adorable himbo. Brave and clever and loyal and stubborn. But also completely wreckless and goofy and an insane moron

The Harry Gideon pairing I think is my favourite pairing ever. I hadn't read a gay Harry story before and couldnt picture it, and then I read this and yep. Yes yes yes yes yes. Yep. It's great. Harry as a character is fantastic and his story/sexuality/personal dialogue is just perfect He's so brave and then Gid walks In and he turns into this sappy, grinning idiot and it's just so good. It's so much fun.

This story is my favourite Harry. All over, it's so much fun and I completely adore the pairing. The pairing isn't even the focus, it's not relevent to the story but damn I love Harry so much. My heart melts and big dumb himbos and Harry is the most Gryffindor Gryffindor in this and it's just fantastic. I adore it
