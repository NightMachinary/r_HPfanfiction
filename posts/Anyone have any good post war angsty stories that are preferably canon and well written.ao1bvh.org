** You might be interested in my Auror Harry series. The first one is a thriller/police procedural, and the second is suuuuuper angsty. Canon compliant, but it does have an OC.

#+begin_quote
  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.

**** I don't think it has that much angst, honestly. It has more personal conflicts than the original, but it's nowhere near as angsty as things like Fulfilling Obligations.

****** I think I'm working with the wrong definition of angst. When I think of angst I think of lots of arguing and conflict and drama that doesn't actually progress the plot that much, sort of like the anti-fluff.

If anyone else is reading this thread and knows what I'm talking about, Harry had an addiction to a dreamless sleep potion, and it had terrible side effects so he was basically a junkie.

  Alternate Universe. Two hurting, almost broken people reach toward the sunlight. This story has implied sexual violence and a Ginny who is two years younger than she was in canon.
