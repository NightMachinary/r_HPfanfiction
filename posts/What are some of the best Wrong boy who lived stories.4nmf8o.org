  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, hiatus

#+begin_quote
  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  COMPLETED Harry Potter enters his 7th year at Hogwarts ignored and friendless because his brother Daniel is the Boy Who Lived. *** Badass Horcruxes. *** Read the author note on profile before you start. Thanks!

  When, after that fateful Halloween night, the wrong Potter twin is hailed the Boy Who Lived, how will Harry's life turn out? With a power he knows not, an ancient prophecy and one Severus Snape practically raising him, interesting at least is a given.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Ellie Potter was never the boy who lived, she just happened to be in the same room at the same time, and yet she can't help but grow and notice that it is never Harry Potter who must fight his own demons. Side fic/Spin off to "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus"
