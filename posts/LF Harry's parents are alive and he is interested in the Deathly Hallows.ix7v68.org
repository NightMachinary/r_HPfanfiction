Both Lily and James are alive in this fic. They was never a prophecy, so Voldemort never attacked the Potters. I can't remember how Voldemort was defeated though.

The Triwizard Tournament is brought back. Harry becomes a champion because he is old enough in this fic. Hermione has a crush on Harry because in this fic, Harry is very studios, and academic. During the Triwizard Tournament Harry dates Susan Bones instead. He also gains an interest in the Deathly Hallows.

Voldemort is also looking for Deathly Hallows.


** I think you might be referencing linkffn(Hallowed by ShinySavage), except Harry (a Ravenclaw in this fic) dates Lisa Turpin, another Ravenclaw. Interesting pairing, but we don't see that much of it.

  Once upon a time, three brothers came up with a plan to change the world forever. Centuries later, wizards still fight over the scraps of their power. However, only one person can truly lay claim to their destiny. AU. Harry/Lisa Turpin pairing in later chapters.
