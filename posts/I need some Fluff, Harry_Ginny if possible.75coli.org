doesnt need to be canonical, can contain a bit of smut (if it stays, so to say, classy :P, sorry if i do that sorting and thematical calling wrong, im pretty new to that fanfic stuff), that is rather fluff.... but not too short, basicly that fleshens out their bond, that was left out to our imagination in the books mostly...

id love if it was during or close to - after school. I've read some that i could find yet, and some where really good! but as im new to this kind of thing i might not be able to find the hidden gems out there :3

(yes, i've looked through fluff section at HarryandGinny but there was not THAT much, i mostly already digested those u could say ^{^{)}}

Im NOT really that much into angst and stuff, the permanent presence of fear or uncertainity, my ex was bipolar..... i had enough of that in my life


** It's more funny than fluffy, but if you want light-hearted Harry/Ginny, then I will highly recommend this one.

** If you're interested in Harry and Ginny, they are mainly what I write. I started writing fan fiction before OOTP came out when the ultimate fates of the characters wasn't yet known and it wasn't a sure thing that Harry and Ginny would end up together.

Anyway, I have a whole raft of stories that sort of traces the arc of their relationship in my Potterverse, mainly one-shots but there are few multi-chapters including at 39-chapter monster over at AO3. Be advised, I write them as adults doing adult things so if "smug" was a typo for "smut", then you should be all right.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewuser.php?uid=577][St Margaret's]] writes good fluff. I find her portrayal of Ginny to be somewhat OOC, but she writes well enough that you get used to it within her fics. I'd suggest /Magic Within, Magic Without/ and /The New Zealand Chronicles/.

  Ginny Weasley pulls a PeggySue after Harry dies in the final battle. Featuring a determinator!Ginny who doesn't care how the previous timeline went, she's going to save Harry no matter what. Also, a minor not-really but sort-of crossover.
