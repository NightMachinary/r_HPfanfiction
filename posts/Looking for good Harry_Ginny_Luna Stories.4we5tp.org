This is probably the only threeway pairing that I could sort of, kind of see happening. It would still be a leap, but less of a leap than other threeway pairings. Don't mind harmless smut or harmless fluff, but ideally I'd like lengthier stories that actually try to make it at least a bit real.


** [[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewuser.php?uid=18][Antosha]] has several of these, most of which are heavy on smut. [[http://mujaji.net/%7Emujaji/repository/viewstory.php?sid=173][Back to the Garden]] is his most well known work, which is alternate 7th year fic written pre-DH.

** I don't think that I've ever actually found one. I looked a long time ago. I think there were a few oneshots but no longer fics.

** I suppose I'm a bit late to the party, but there is a whole livejournal community dedicated to this. It's pretty much defunct at this point, but it was damn active back in the day. [[http://flamingnargle.livejournal.com/]]

  Formerly Defense for Two. Adopted from Perspicacity with permission. They thought Lockhart was a fraud. They were wrong; he was their guide into a world of danger, adventure, intrigue and other Unspeakable Things.
