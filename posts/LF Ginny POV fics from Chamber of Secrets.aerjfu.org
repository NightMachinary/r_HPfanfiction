Specifically something darker than the light and blase treatment of the books. I feel like what happened to Ginny in her first year was extremely significant and extremely dark, and I'd like a fic that goes into the details of all she went through during that year.

I've always thought it was bizarre that Ginny was immediately "perfectly happy" again after the diary is destroyed, and then she just drops off the radar for the next two years. Fic does not have to be 100% canon compliant. I don't mind about pairings particularly either, though I'm really not into cross-generational ships.

  CoS according to Ginny. Nobody noticed anything wrong for an entire year -- how did she slip so far from her family and friends? Angst and betrayal, but also mysteries, jokes, an enchanted suit of armor, and a guaranteed happy ending.

** I know this is recced to death in this community - I found it through a rec here myself - but The Changeling by Annerb goes through CoS -> from the point of view of a Slytherin Ginny.

And this one is an adult Ginny, but deals pretty directly with how CoS impacted her. Ginny Weasley: Dragon Slayer by lettered:

** linkffn(Identity by MarauderLover7)

2nd year sequel of linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Half of the story is told from the perspective of Ginny as she slowly loses control of her mind. The story is a bit different than canon since it starts two years before hogwarts.

  Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy, even among wizards. The most noteworthy thing about him, however, was his talent for getting himself into trouble, which surpassed even that of his godfather. Sequel to "Innocent" and "Initiate".

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
