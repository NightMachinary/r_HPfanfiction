Like 90% of it seems to take place with underage children in the more graphic was possible and seemingly no one has any issue with it. There's even requests on this sub for it regularly. It's bizarre.


** It's the nature of the beast- fanfiction is publishing without Editorial oversight (or any other sort of objective criticism), so writers can anonymously let loose all the thoughts that they're taught to hide in polite company.

** As someone who started reading fanfiction for the smut. I quickly realized that the really good fanfiction writers, For example Taure, Seriouscribble, and Shezza to name a couple don't write graphic sex scenes. They have a well thought out story already any any sex that is included is mostly background noise and the people are usually adults. Some sex fics I've read like " Harry Potter: Amoral and Amorous" or "Mad Snorckacks and Englishmen" and even "For Love of magic" by noodlehammer may have smut up the wazoo and Harry is only 14 in that fic, but the author writes well enough that I find I don't really even think of the age of the characters. More importantly though this is fanfiction the characters aren't real so there really is nothing wrong with whatever is written if that's your thing.

** Actually, I find the really strange thing is how canon and many fanfics tend to completely gloss over the normal teenage hormonal rampage. Teenage co-ed boarding school....?

That said, the really underage and graphic stuff is creepy. But the amount of it, by itself, suggests that it's there for a reason. People either (A) want to write it or (B) want to read it.

*** 1) bothers me more than anything. I can't read anything forced. It sends chills up my spine and to be honest makes me want to puke.

2) is why I stay away from a certain site that also has a lot of well a quite different Harry. I will admit I had my fangirl moments when I was younger... well okay I will do, but whole stories on how girls want to meet their crush are creepy. It's also why I generally stay away from OC characters which are often thinly disguised self inserts

3) I actually don't have a problem with if it's written well. Like if the story stands on its own and the smut is obviously for the author and the reader just happens to get to see it too.

My number 4 is that I can't stand if they are under 15/16 and going at it constantly. You can have a good romance without sex in a lot of stories. I understand that isn't the point of smut, but still under that age bothers me and I can't really explain why other than I think they are too young

** Teenagers have sex. Hell preteens are having sex with each other. Stories about teenagers and their serious relationships should eventually involve sex. They don't have to graphically describe it though. To pretend no wizard or witch has sex before they're an adult is idiotic in the extreme.

Straight up smut fics with no plot...Meh. That's a different kettle of fish and is up to the individual reader as to if it's ok.

I personally don't care one way or the other. Sword of Gryffindor was quite funny for something that had a lot of sex in it. There's also been plenty of stories that had no sex that I enjoyed too.

** Well... teenagers have sex in real life. They tend to want to have sex, or do sex related things, just as much if not more so than adults.

Underage as far as sex is concerned can mean very different things depending on where you are.

Thus, I find your question just a little confusing.

Unless of course you're talking about those stories where a 11 year old Harry is sleeping about in his 1st year. That's slightly concerning, but since it's all fiction in the end I turn a blind eye to it.

**** Sketchy though it may be, it's really not that awful. There are far worse things depicted in fanfiction that people rarely take issue with.

And something like that I wouldn't consider problematic in the context of fiction. Fiction can always be the best case scenario. Best case scenario of romantic entanglements between teenagers and adults /can/ end well.

In real life the odds of that are extremely low. In fiction, not so much.

** I mean to be fair if you want to realistically write about teenagers you also need to write about sex or at least their sex drives. Personally I don't find it that weird to display a 15-16 year old thinking about sex a lot I mean do you remember being that age? Though there is a difference between how an author like say noodlehammer writes it and someone who has 2-3 sex scenes every chapter, that probably isn't going to make for a good story.

I do and that's why I don't mind it. I mean it's one thing to have them think about it and maybe even have some experimentation. We were all that age once if not still at that age.

** I think more like 5% takes place with underage children, unless I'm reading *way* different stories than you. i can't remember the last time I even ran into a story featuring someone under sixteen having sex. Although, I read mostly fests which tend to not allow underage characters to have sex in them. Still even on AO3 - I don't run into it much.

As for the title question, there is no more sex in fan fiction than in original fiction. It is just that in original fiction we have it all separated and fan fiction is gathered all in one place. If you filtered out romance and erotica as genres, I'm sure you wouldn't run into it as much just like with original fiction. (Although, it's still there.)

They were talking about incest and parent/child incest in the comments and that reminded me that my first reading of brother/sister incest was an original published book (a very popular one) when I was thirteen. The first time I read parent/child incest was an accident on an erotica fiction website. I had just got an account and was stumbling around and just read the top rated stuff instead of searching out genre I actually liked.

Not my thing, but it's not real.

Is it weird and creepy that people read about these things they'd never do in real life? Meh, I'm pretty sure that's why everyone reads. The dirty wrongness of a lot of this stuff /is/ the appeal. They'd still be disgusted with it in real life.

** When the entire canon for your fandom takes place when all your primary characters are minors (ok, 90%), most sex that takes place is going to be underaged. And yes, a lot of fanfiction is going to be about sex, no matter what. Fandoms with canon adult primary characters don't generally de-age them for stories, so it's primarily working with what canon gives you.

** Teenagers will be teenagers, frankly I attribute the lack of sex in the series itself to the fact that it's for children/young-adults.

So yeah, there would be sex if you "lock up" a bunch of teens for most of the year in a castle somewhere isolated (Hogsmeade is near, but that's a smallish village and even the older students can't just go there whenever they want (kind of strange if you ask me...I was allowed to take the bus to the next city at 10 if I wanted to, so why aren't the students allowed to just go to Hosmeade once they are done with their work for the day or on weekends without it being a "Hogsmeade-Weekend"?)), it's inevitable!
