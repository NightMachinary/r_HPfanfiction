Hey! I'm looking for some nice Harry/Luna fics, that are told from Luna's perspective. Preferably third person.

What are some of your favorites? Any length is fine!

Preferably multi chapter.

Thank you!


** Linkffn(protection from nargles)

It's not exclusively Luna's POV, but it does use it. Absolutely the best / fluffiest Harry/Luna out there

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.

** The Harry/Luna ships are called lunary, thats the most common name. Just dont get it mixed up with the Larry ship, since some people do
