I'm looking for a Slytherin!Hermione but not Pureblood!Hermione. I prefer if it's not a story where she get's immediately accepted because turns out, Slytherins are okay with mudbloods so long as they're slytherins and because they "protect their own". I want to see something where she's strong, confident, and powerful. she has to stake her claim and prove herself and fight with politics and magical prowess and win. Stories like Sweets and Studies, maybe? lol

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** The classic:

Linkao3(Hermione granger, Demonologist)

Voldemort's horcruxes are running rampant. Hermione is adopted by the Malfoys because of a law, it has a fem!harry (but still a total tomboy and true to canon), and Sirius black has a daughter, but it's a good fic and has a Slytherin hermione.

Linkao3(certain dark things)

Also, have you read the changleling? It's about a Slytherin Ginny and meets all of your other requirements. I usually don't care for Ginny but I really liked this one.

  They sought her out for conversation sometimes, cornering her in the garden or at the park, not that they ever had much to say. Really, Harriet thought snakes were rather dull.---------Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with grass snakes, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing to happen to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. Harriet attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she makes new friends, encounters a prickly Potions Master, learns about the Boy Who Lived, and meets the enigmatic Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor, Professor Tom Slytherin.

*** This one is technically not Pureblood Hermione but also not "Slytherins are okay with mudbloods in their house". She basically spends her entire time convincing everyone that "New Bloods" are super rare ultra-Purebloods born to muggle parents, when actually she's making the entire thing up and using Quirrel's dark books to make herself more powerful.

**** My reading of it is that in-universe New Blood is actually a thing, rather than something Hermione had made up. I would rather the author had gone the way you are suggesting, with the whole thing being a huge and growing bluff. However, she chose to attach a prophecy to Hermione that had "New Blood" capitalised, which pretty much confirms it. (Truth be told, I don't think the author is sophisticated enough to pull off what you are describing.)

******* I mean, she is making everything up and bluffing. The Prophecy only told her that she'd be New Blood but didn't say anything about what that actually means. She made all the lore up and bluffed like crazy in order to fulfill the prophecy.

Her super fast Mana recovery rate is explained through her draining it every evening, her ability to create rituals is logically explained through her having read a lot of rare books on the subject and just being skilled. The prophecy is explained as being a self fulfilling thing, a bit of information with a closed worldline (just like time turners canonically (PoA, not CC) work). There's nothing that would require the whole "Magic is sentient and personally helping Hermione" to explain it.

Magic seems to follow logical rules, the made up lore behind New Bloods is more like a religion or a cult. Just like many cult leaders, Hermione even managed to convince herself that the lore she made up two years earlier is true.

********* If you like my headcanon here's some more:

Prophecies, divination and time turners are all fundamentally based on the same principle, things moving into the past to form a looped world line. All cannot change things that would prevent themselves from happening as there's just 1 timeline, but they can change other things.

In the PoA time turner scene they could not have prevented the axe sound from happening since that would have changed their past selves, but they were able to influence what it was caused by as their past selves weren't casually connected to that bit of information. It's not possible to make a prophecy not come true, but it is possible to change details not mentioned. Divination generally is so vague that it's very easy to make it come true in some way.

Prophecies always coming true, divination eventually turning out to be true in some way and time travelers unable to change their pasts selves are all caused by the same underlying laws of physics (nonmagical time travel would likely behave the same way).

The difference is what's causing it: Time turners are activated from the future and send the user into the past, divination is caused by the user in the past "scanning" the future and bringing back a limited amount of information, and prophecies are caused by important information spontaneously getting sent into the past and getting picked up by someone. It's not necessary that there's a sentience behind prophecies, it's possible that it's a case of accidental magic: Lots of magical people find out about an important bit of information which causes that information to be magical and gives it a chance of getting sent back in time. This also means that prophecies are always about important things that lots of people care about while active divination can be about completely boring and unimportant stuff.

At this point Hermione's gotten to the point where she convinced herself too that New Bloods are real and not something she made up.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.
