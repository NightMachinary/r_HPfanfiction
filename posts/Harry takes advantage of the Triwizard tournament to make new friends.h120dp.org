I always found it odd that he didn't and make new friends. Especially not with say Krum whom he probably looked up to as the best seeker in the world and who was a fellow champion which meant they had quite a bit to talk about, with Cedric too.


** Well I mean the people in Hogwarts already hated him cause he was entered unfairly. Probably being friendly with the other champions that aren't Cedric probably isn't the best idea.

*** Or it's the exact answer, no friends from your school? Branch out, take advantage of a bad situation. Not the point though, I'm just looking for some recommendations :)

** Ohh, that sounds super interesting! Because honestly, we don't know anything about other Durmstang students beside Victor or Beuxbatons beside Fleur and Gabrielle, so it should be relatively easier to write separate interesting characters.

** Well, there's a bunch of Harry/Fleur fics I know that have this to some degree. Like linkffn(Ingenio ab Artifex), which is still either WIP or abandoned and possibly linkffn(The Lie I've Lived) as well, though I'm not too sure about that, since it's been ages since I read that.

  There have been many rumours surrounding me and my life---especially my love life. So, after due consideration---and a few well-aimed words from our resident bookworm---I have decided to publish my autobiography. For any questions and questionable charms placed on your copy of my self-updating autobiography, feel free to owl my publisher, Jaime.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
