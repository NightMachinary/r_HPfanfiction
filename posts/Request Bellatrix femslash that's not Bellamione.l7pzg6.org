** I'm a bit embarrassed to say this but a few years ago I read Narcissa/Bellatrix fic. I don't remember it's name or what it was about really, but it was a fever dream and a psychological thriller. I couldn't sleep for a few days but I remember loving it.

** I don't read Bellatrix-centric stories but from what I recall Bellatrix and Rita Skeeter were in the same year at Hogwarts (and the general fanon consensus is that Rita was a Slytherin) so... you might have some luck with that.

** Uuh.. By all means, keep me posted..

As an aside, it is kind of shocking to me that Ginny, from memory at least, never saw anyone regarding what she went through, despite being regularly possessed by a Dark Lord over the course of the school year.. Just psychologically, what she experienced would leave just about anyone some kind of fucked up, and then you throw in whatever effects you want/need from the strictly magical side, e.g. the possession, and you end up with someone way more likely to bed Bellatrix than the Mud blood that was eventually tortured and permanently scarred by her..

** I remember there was a Ginny/Bellatrix written by the same author as the one who wrote the downward spiral series

**** Having Ginny be messed up from the diary could work though.. Certainly easier to see happen than BellaMione..

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9723356][a bellatrix/lily evans ficlet]] by FreshBrains. Same author has a Bellatrix/Lily kinky one shot, but I don't know if explicit sexual content (with good characterization) is your thing.
