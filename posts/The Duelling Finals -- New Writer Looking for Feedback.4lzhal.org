** I'm planning on writing a fanfic about an OC, Kvothe, who is fascinated by magic and obsessed with magical research and uncovering secrets, a habit that gets him into a lot of trouble on his journey of discovery and invention. Here's a snippet (1.8k words); a magical duel in the Lockhart year (still debating what year Kvothe will be in at the time).

I'd love some feedback on the writing style. Have I managed to capture the speed and physicality of the duel properly? Any advice for writing (plot, formatting etc.) is welcome. The final version will require less exposition by being imbedded in a longer story. I use Australian English; if anything's particularly jarring please let me know.

Additionally, what's the legal and social consensus about â€˜pick-and-choose' derivative works? There's bits and pieces (mostly spells and theory) from other fanfics I really like (The Arithmancer, HPMoR etc.) and I don't know whether it's okay or acceptable to use or reference those (with credit, of course).

Who'd be interested in this expanded?

** Generally well-written, but I'd like to know more about how it fits into the Potterverse. For example, it takes place in Hogwarts, in Lockhart's year. Is Harry & Co. still there? Is Voldemort lurking in the background? Will the protagonist interact with them and with the canon A Plot --- perhaps indirectly, by, say, entering the Triwizard?

*** I'm still in the process of worldbuiding (worldediting?), and this duel is something I decided to fill out from the middle of the story. When I actually start the story, that will all be mapped out.

I'll be keeping the conflicts small (inside Hogwarts), at least at first. Voldemort will either be mysteriously missing or gathering forces in mainland Europe (or both!). Harry & co will still be there, and Kvothe will interact with them (positively and negatively) but they won't be the focus of the story, mainly because I'm not terribly fond of canon Harry's character. He's interesting, but eh, personal preference.

Hermione will definitely show up, though.

**** No worries. IMO, Harry's character is meant to be a bit of a cypher --- pretty generic and reactive, to make it easier to set the scene and tell the story through him, as well as to make it easier for readers to identify. Take away Voldemort, and what're his agenda? Play Quiddich professionally? (Nothing wrong with that, but not much of an adventure plot hook, either.)
