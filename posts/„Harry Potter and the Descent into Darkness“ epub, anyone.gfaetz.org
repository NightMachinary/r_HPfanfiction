Hi Guys.

I used to be a silent lurker in this sub until now, so thanks in advance.

I asked a friend of mine if he knew something similar to ‚ÄûHP and the unlocked knowledge‚Äú, in which Harry‚Äòs horcrux starts talking to him after his 5th year. My mate recommended Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness, but I fail to find a download. I hope someone still has his copy.

If someone has another recommendation, I‚Äòm all ear.

Thanks!


** Hey! I had it saved so I just uploaded it to google drive: [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/17wCwWkBWeflTEBLVq8YOJeKAXdtkJEnZ/view?usp=drivesdk]]

I think you can just save it directly to ibooks as an epub from there.
