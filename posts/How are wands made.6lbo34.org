** Very carefully, and not as easily as every single fic that shows "custom wands" portrays. I imagine part of it is alchemical, merging the parts into one whole. There is that fic where Harry is sent to Azkaban wrongfully, and when he escapes (I believe), he basically ends up apprenticed to Ollivander. I want to say it is linkffn(Griffin Reborn by Ytria). There's other stuff in it that I think is bonkers magic wise, but at least the wand creation is viewed as easy.

  Side story/sequel to Specialist Potter. Offered the chance to step away from the war and learn about the magic of Tir Nan Og, Hermione grabs it. She learns about more than just magic; along the way, she's forced to examine the true nature of knowledge, friendship, courage, and even herself.

** I recently read a fic (I believe it's linkao3(9821300)), where Ollivander makes wands in a magical trance state. Wand-making is not a big focus and this is only mentioned in passing in the fic (at least as far as I know, I only got up to Chapter 29 before I gave up the fic), but the idea is certainly an interesting one.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** in the pottermore article about the american magic school illvermony it is mentioned that a muggle named James Steward carved a wand out of wood and had it enclose the horn of a Horned Serpent . [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ilvermorny]]

** I'm not sure why Hermione needs a custom wand - maybe Ollivander's shop has been destroyed or he doesn't have access to it, but I was reading the wikia today and it said Garrick Ollivander (the current wand maker) was the first to stop making custom wands. He decided to use only quality wand ingredients, instead of using whatever was brought in by the client, and let the wand choose the wizard. It seems he was the first to think of wands as semi-sentient, rather than a mundane tool.

All it has to say about his methods is that they a)revolutionized wand making and b) were tightly guarded. So I'd suggest that he uses a variety of charms and spells to find the best trees to harvest from, and the best branches, and probably harvests them at a particular time, day, and season. After all, some potions ingredients are also harvested at particular times and in special circumstances.

As for cores, he chose the three he works with after long study and experimentation. I imagine using anything else would be painful for him, like an artist using sub-par paints.

I'd like it if he used hand tools rather than his wand to carve.
