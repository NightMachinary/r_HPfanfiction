Looking for a fic focusing on Neville's life after book 7. How he became an auror and then Herbology professor.


** Have you read Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness? Well, it's centered around Neville during the 7th book, and the author wrote another fic later Sluagh that is about his time as an auror, before he becomes a professor.

Sluagh [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4384697/1/Sluagh]]

Also, I don't know if you would be interested, but in case you are I have a WIP that is centered around Neville. It's AU, takes place 6th year, and is Neville/OC.
