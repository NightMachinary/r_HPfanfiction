I've had this in my head for a while.

Years into their relationship, Ginny (whilst playing Quidditch) has an affair with a teammate and Harry catches on immediately but keeps it to himself.

Heartbroken, angry and bitter (but with no reference for how he's even supposed to respond) he begins subconsciously and eventually consciously letting Ginny know he knows in very passive aggressive ways.

*E.g: Harry knows Ginny is coming home from "practice" months in and has already planned to go out, Ginny leans in for a kiss but Harry smells her breath and decides to pull back with a dazzling grin. Teases her that her breath stinks, ruffles her hair and tells her not to wait up. Ginny is left feeling very cold as she, in some way, knows he knows but can't talk about it.*

It's just Harry and Ginny are this picturesque, perfect relationship in the eyes of everyone around them, the two then feel trapped and unable to tell anybody else about what's going on (the curse of shared friends) and they're just suffering in silence until the relationship falls apart after Ginny admits what's happening.


** Another story about Harry-The-Pushover?

Why does he wait? The only reason is to collect evidence and prepare his case for the divorce and it won't take months. When he gets everything together, Ginny is out.

If you want to feed your hunger for Weak Harry read some Potato19 or [[/u/starfox5]] stories - their Harry is golden standard for a doormat.
