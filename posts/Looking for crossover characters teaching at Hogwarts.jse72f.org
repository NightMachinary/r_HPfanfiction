I figure this is a pretty popular crossover trope, so I wanted to see what's out there that people like.

I'm more looking for the crossover character teaching a new class relevant to their interests/skills, rather than as a teacher to an existing class, like DADA, but I'll accept those here as well.

Inspired to post this prompt by reading these two stories back to back-

linkffn(12498125) and linkao3(6870892)

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.

  "The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world." Some would say that Hogwarts is the wrong place for Umino Iruka, and he's about to find out. With new students, he hopes to light the Will of Fire in this new world while new dangers lurk in the darkness. No overpowered ninjas running roughshod over the Potterverse in this fic!

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

**** Hmm... I'll see if I can find some. If you know the basic idea of PJ you should be able to understand it. Sometimes writers will list their achievements (ex. ‚ÄúPercy Jackson: hero of Olympus, Slayer of Minotaur, slayer of literally every other Greek monster ever, etc), but not a lot. And if you don't know the plot of Percy Jackson I think you'd like it, assuming you like Harry Potter (I think they radiate a similar vibe, and personally I think PJ is the better series)

Many of the ‚ÄúProfessor Percy‚Äù things are centered around Percy, and a lot of them have Harry Bashing as a fair warning though, so if you don't want that, it'll be a bit harder to find one you like. I'll find you some fics to try out, but if you want to know some words that come up a lot, here they are, since I know not all fics explain it. Since PJ is based around children of Greek (and Roman) gods, keep in mind a lot of names are probably things from Greek mythology

Charmspeak: some children of Aphrodite are born with the ability to make people do whatever they want with just their voice

IM: iris message, it's a way for halfbloods to communicate since phones attract monsters

Cabins 1-20: these are the cabins in which Demi-gods sleep in at Camp Half Blood (a camp for demigods) 1 is Zeus, 2 is Hera (she doesn't have children, the cabin is honorary), 3 is Poseidon, 4 is Demeter, 5 Ares, 6 Athena, 7 Apollo, 8 Artemis (she doesn't have kids either, also an honorary cabin), 9 Hephaestus, 10 Aphrodite, 11 Herm√®s, 12 Dionysus, 13 Hades, 14 Iris, 15 Hypnos, 16 nemesis, 17 Nike, 18 hebe, 19 tyche, 20 Hecate. All of these probably won't come up, but they're the ones that would. If I got any of these wrong you can correct me.

There's not much else. It's just a lot of Greek monsters and gods that might come up other than that.

  Loki the god of mischief and mayhem is bored as hell. Since the Winchester brothers are more inclined to kill him, pranking them is out of question. But wait isn't the saviour of magical Britain and son of one of his most devoted followers attending Hogwarts soon? Weren't there also twins who worship him? That sounded a lot more fun but will Hogwarts survive it? NO SLASH! fem!Lucy
