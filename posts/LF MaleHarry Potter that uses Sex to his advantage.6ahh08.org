#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's world is flipped upside down when he is unexpectedly visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare species of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of Harry's problems when he discovers just how drastically his life is about to change. How will our young hero deal with an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive?! Join Harry on an epic tale of love, lust, and innocence, as he battles against much more than just dark wizards and learns just how strong bonds can be.

** Not bashing or anything, but you literally stole my Request and Description. I quote description from my request: "Basically I want Fem!Harry Potter that uses Sex to her advantage. For example she wants something and she has a few choices. Steal, buy, sex4item. Basically I want a fic in which she acknowledge that there is the third option to get something(sex4...), and she uses said option. Thanks" Not mad or anything, but you could have worded it a little differently. The title to is stolen. Then again, Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Beyond that, I agree with deirox that Incubus linkao3(1173705) is a great fic.

** What?

No, wait, What?

I don't think i quite understand what you're asking for.

The closest thing i can think of is [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097955][this one]] where Harry levels up through sex in an game-like situation, it's basically smut however.

I think you could explain better what are you asking for, because from what i understand you want an story where harry is an gigolo?
