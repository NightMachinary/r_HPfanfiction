** It is not exactly but something very similar I am in the process of writing in linkao3(Brother and Sister by mcepl). Unfortunately the published version is not finished yet, and it is in the process of complete rewrite (it will be the format of the theatre script).

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.

** In linkffn(Best Laid Plans by Don Sample), Sirius decides to protect Harry by swapping him with a randomly-chosen infant in the US. As the infant he swapped Harry with was Xander Harris, it didn't really work.

And I can't remember the name of the story, but there's one that has an almost throwaway scene with, if I remember correctly, Dumbledore explaining to Draco that he's actually the real Harry Potter and had been swapped at birth for protection. After Draco leaves Dumbledore's office, we discover that it was a prank by Harry using polyjuice while Dumbledore was away from the school.

  Karin was going to help her brother and best friend become parents if it was the last thing she did. [[["God, just picture a kid made of a combination of me and Toshiro.
