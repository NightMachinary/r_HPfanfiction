Partly inspired by people saying she and Ginny look alike. I've always imagined Lily with deep red-brown hair, possibly highlighted from 4th year or so on, and Ginny with, well, more ginger, orange-red hair. Thought it would be interesting to see how others imagine the characters.

Ginny is also quite wiry in my head whereas I've come across people imagining her as curvy before. I'm sure official descriptions might differ but these are my first impressions of the characters.


** Ginny was described as short on multiple occasions, and if I were to guess, I would say that she was intended to be the short/stocky variety of Weasley sibling. I can easily picture her as curvy, especially given Muriel's complaints that Ginny's dress was too low-cut.

Her hair is described as "vivid" and "flaming." At one point, Tonks turns her hair waist length and tomato red, and Harry thinks she looks a bit like Ginny's older sister.

On the other hand, Lily is described as having "dark red hair" on four separate occasions, so I definitely picture her as having darker hair than Ginny. We also know that at 15, Lily had shoulder-length hair, whereas Ginny's hair is repeatedly described as long.

We don't know much about Lily, but I've always pictured her as tall/skinny. For one thing, Petunia is definitely described as tall and skinny, and Lily comes from the same gene pool. For another thing, Lily is never described as "looking up" at characters like Harry, Snape, and James, even though all three are known to be on the tall side and she has several up-close-and-personal confrontations with James and Snape. I also like the idea of her being skinny because it fits with the aesthetic of the time.

**** Eh, Bonnie Wright is built a little differently. She's more petite (I think she's roughly the same height as the main cast).

When I imagine Lily, I imagine her as tall and skinny. Not thin or petite, but /skinny./ All knobby knees and long limbs and not being able to hold up a strapless dress, and insecurity tinged with guilt because you know that others want the body that you sort of sometimes hate.

Whereas Ginny I definitely imagine to be more curvy. As an adult, she would definitely have an athletic build given her choice of career.

*** Where do people get this idea from about Harry being tall? Any time his height is mentioned, it's only in regard to him being shorter than other people.

**** Harry himself isn't described as tall (though in HBP Hermione does say he's grown about a foot over the summer) but /James/ is described as tall on multiple occasions. 15-year-old Harry is described as the same height as 15-year-old James in OP and 17-year-old Harry is described as the same height as 21-year-old James in DH.

So by the power of transitive property, Harry is tall.

** Well, Ginny is probably athletic (thin, some muscles etc.) and Lily is/was probably less so (as far as we know Quidditch (or another sport) wasn't something that interested her), despite that they could look somewhat alike...maybe her hair was a darker, fuller red (at least that's what I think)?

We don't know, but a case for them looking alike can be made IMHO and if it serves a fanfiction to do so - why not make it? ;)

** Lily wearing James's glasses

[[http://tinyurl.com/zxp9s7k]]

I picked from that age range because this is who I would cast as Lily right now for the Mirror of Erised scene and she looks somewhat like how I picture Lily, especially the hair. Obviously no emerald green eyes but those are rather uncommon anyway.

*** If you want to be truly pedantic, it's /not/ Lily Evans Potter, it's just Lily Potter (née Evans, if you want to differentiate from harry's daughter).

Nowhere (afaik) is her middle name after marriage listed (except for the dubiously canon "Harry Potter: The Artifact Vault" which gives her middle name after marriage as "J."), and there's no substantial reason to believe she made Evans her middle name instead of keeping whatever name she was born with.

That being said, as someone with a hyphenated last name, I wholeheartedly agree that hyphens≠spaces. Whether OP deserved your ire.... \o/

***** I know -- I checked the Lexicon first, but they didn't provide a source for it. Since they're usually quite fastidious, I assume they did the same thing as you and just extrapolated. They also refer to her as Lily (Evans) Potter, the same way you might refer to Bellatrix (Black) Lestrange-- nothing to do with their actual middle name, just indicating what it used to be.
