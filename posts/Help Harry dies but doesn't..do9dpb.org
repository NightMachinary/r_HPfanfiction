:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
That sounds trippy but basically Harry commits suicide after Sirius dies and his body is basically destroyed. However, the unspeakable manage to put him into another body except no one else knows that he isn't dead. Years later he is tasked with protecting the Bones' and falls for susan. Anyone know what fic it is?

#+begin_quote
  Despair over the loss of his godfather in the Battle of the Dept. of Mysteries, followed by abandonment, isolation and hopelessness drive Harry to try and end his own life. Though death itself cannot halt his just vengeance against the Dark Lord, nor keep him from attaining that which he has ever been denied; someone to love and be loved by.
