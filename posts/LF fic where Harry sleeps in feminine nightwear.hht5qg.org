:END:
There's this one fic where Harry is a Slytherin and is picked alongside Draco to go through some test by the older Slytherins. Usually they pic one female and one male, but instead they picked Harry and started teaching him something thing about feminine manners. For the test they tied him up to a chair and threatened him. Harry escapes the chair and attacked the Slytherins threatening him and they stopped the test and informed him what was going on.
