By someone who isn't Umbridge, Fudge, DE, or corrupt (necessarily). Some teachers get called out on their pratices (cough) Snape (cough), lack of safe measures like no lab equipment with dealing with potions etc.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** linkffn(Best Served Cold) Hogwarts gets Audited. Harry helps out Hagrid, Snape, and Filch. (Mainly so they can reallocate funds, while making Dumbledore suffer in the way only a bureaucrat can inflict.)

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  What if... One of the other students who had detention with Umbridge wasn't as prideful and selfish as Harry, and actually did something to rid of Umbridge, which causes a effect that they couldn't have foreseen.
