*** Often it's a lazy excuse to pair two characters where the author can't think of a more realistic way to get them together. I can't claim to be a fan of the trope in general, but I don't think they're universally terrible. I'm following [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10649604/1/The-Legacy-Preservation-Act][The Legacy Preservation Act]] at the moment and enjoying it.

*** My first thought was Marriage Law Challenge (MLC) fics. Even though I have read them, they are probably my least favorite trope of what I do read.

On the one hand, Forced Partnership can be fun because the trope is an easy way for the author to put a pairing together intimately that would not necessarily get together on their own.

However, most MLC fics, at least the ones that I've read (SS/HG), don't really take the time to develop the relationship properly. Most of them have them both initially hating the situation but that quickly changes once they consummate the marriage. After the sex, it's like, "Why did we hate this arrangement again? LOL" and then their 'relationship' is really one based purely on the great sex.

So, MLC fics can be good for smut and sometimes angst with smut but oftentimes the story itself is very weak.

Bond fics can be similar in concept but I tend to like those better than Marriage Law fics.

It's like arranged marriage, only government mandated. A good writer would take the time to develop the characters towards liking each other. Unfortunately, I'm not sure any of these exist.

The only time I've enjoyed this was in the fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7781192/1/Harry-Potter-Without-Harry-Potter][Harry Potter Without Harry Potter]], since there are implications of this that might be explored later but no outright abuse of the concept.

** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill][Thou Shalt Not Kill]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim][If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him]] --- these two always have pissed me off.

I get that it will be hard for a regular person to make themselves kill, but when a book is ~80% over already and the good guys are still aiming to only render their foes unconscious, it makes them look either like idiots or like someone who just doesn't value the lives of their allies. Either get over it and start killing your enemies or just give up and flee the country because you're obviously not fit to survive in a war zone. The most absurd example of this was when the main characters received a chance of killing Voldemort himself (he was passed out at the moment) but instead did nothing and aimed their attention at /trying to escape/ the area.

Same applies to attempts of “capturing” the enemies. In case of HP fanfics, this usually means a Pacman-style shenanigans where the heroes repeatedly capture the same enemies and send them to Azkaban only to get surprised each time when the captured units manage to escape from the prison yet again.

Also, Potterverse does seem to run on karma of sorts; it's the only way I know of to explain (in-universe) the sequence of coincidences needed for DH to end the way it had. Unfortunately, this is one of those weird situations where the standards for canon are lower than standards for a fanfic.

**** That's actually why I don't like the Batman franchise much and think it's overrated. Individual films can have nice plots and often good actors too, but because of the way how “regular people” are so weak there and how the “good guys” go out of their way to not kill the bad guys makes it very hard to feel anything for the people in that universe.

And [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kscfb9XzPs][the scene you've mentioned]] still doesn't explain why Batman prevents /others/ from killing the villains too. And the way the guy holding the gun of course had to catch the VillainBall and not just kill the Joker and leave the scene is a typical example of what makes me frustrated with Batman screenplays.

** Character bashing. Inevitably, not only are all faults magnified to ridiculous degrees, but add "incompetent" and "stupid" to the descriptors of the character. If you want to eviscerate a character, do it according to their character, not by tacking on everything you hate about anyone to them.

Dumbledore is a machiavellian manipulator who puts aside all of his moral qualms when it favors his plans and regrets it later. Voldemort is psychotic and cruel, has no loyalty to anyone but himself, and wouldn't understand kindness if given a century to study it. Snape is a grade A asshole and possibly a sadist (he's a bastard because he enjoys being one, not because he lacks the mental discipline to act any other way), and while he was dedicated to the extreme, that does not excuse him enjoying making people suffer. All three of them are not stupid, and perhaps the three cleverest people in canon (with Hermione and Lily possibly joining that esteemed list). All three of them are extremely capable. And no sane wizard would want to mess with any of them without overwhelming odds in their favor.

One really good one I read mentioned that it used to be a thing that wizards could do but homophobes and the statute of secrecy stamped it out. It was pretty politics heavy.

All that aside, it can be just a fetish though that's as rare as a completed mpreg fict. Most gloss over the birth and much of the actual pregnancy because really their focus for the fict is the ship, drama and 'happily ever after'.

** *Training.*

I get that training scenes are used to elevate Harry from the slightly-above-average and pathetic state that Rowling keeps Harry in, but damn, training is /so annoying/, since it's almost always the same thing in every fic.

Either have a slightly AU fic where Harry is smart, ambitious, and intelligent enough to the point where you don't have to write more than a few sentences about it, /or/ just timeskip the whole damn thing.

I really, /really/ don't care how many practice dummies Harry destroyed in the Room of Requirement. Find something more interesting to write. Actual plot development, for example.

 

However, the same doesn't apply for mentor fics. Because Harry under the tutelage of Dumbledore just seems so cool, you wonder why it never happened in canon. They have timeturners, and could have easily found the time to do it.

A fic that does this and training really, /really/ well is Magics of the Arcane.

  Because Harry under the tutelage of Dumbledore just seems so cool, you wonder why it never happened in canon. They have timeturners, and could have easily found the time to do it.
#+end_quote

In canon, Harry does not appear to have Dumbledore's sheer intellect or magical talent (however measured), nor his drive. Their temperaments are different (even at the same age), and Harry would have little interest in assuming Dumbledore's societal roles as his successor. So, is tutoring Harry really a good use of Dumbledore's time? Sure, he can make some with a time-turner, but could he spend /that/ time better than tutoring Harry? Almost certainly, yes. Frankly, /Hermione/ makes for a better candidate; though probably not worth Dumbledore's time either.

You know the type. Harry is some magical creature with a made-up name with way too many silent vowels which makes it really hard to pronounce, but everyone important magically knows exactly what that is, and what it means for Harry. Except Harry. And no one's talking.

Cue many chapters of Harry trying to figure out what the fuck is going on while whichever grown male character the author thinks is hot doggedly (see what I did there?) pursues Harry because his Creature nature makes them connected, even though they share only tangential interests together, have a generation between them, and possibly come down on different sides of the decisive issues of their society! Let's not even get into the fact that neither of these characters has /ever/ expressed sexual interest in their own gender, let alone one another!

*** Yeah I don't like it when they do the whole 10-bedroom Potter manor and 6 house elves, but I don't mind when Harry has money. It's pretty reasonable, since James was so wealthy that he and Lily didn't need to work. Given that L/J had a baby, and didn't know they were going to die in a few years, they wouldn't have opted out of working and bought a house unless they legitimately had enough to support themselves and Harry (while living conservatively) for the rest of their lives. And since they died only a few years out of school, nearly all of that money would have passed to Harry.

And while I don't like the "oh you have a dozen vaults including all four founders" thing, it's clear that Dumbledore is the custodian of Harry's finances, and it makes perfect sense that Dumbledore wouldn't want Harry to know exactly how much money he had. Not out of nefariousness, but because Dumbledore doesn't want Harry going off the rails, losing focus, and/or getting a big head when he finds out his net worth. He has little motivation to keep Harry in the loop, especially since Harry isn't really interested anyway. Plus Harry hasn't been to his vault since he was 12, so he has some catching up to do.

So while it's unlikely that Harry has 3 vaults and a Potter manor, Dumbledore probably wouldn't have told him if he did and Harry hasn't exactly done his research.

***** It's never really mentioned directly in book 1, Bill calls it "your [Harry's] vault" at one point.

It's possible but it seems a bit counter-intuitive to the wizarding world/Gringotts for someone to own a dozen vaults. It makes far more sense (to me at least) that when Sirius died, the contents of his vault were transferred into Harry's primary vault, and the vault itself reverted to Gringotts to give to another customer.

Bellatrix's vault was referred to as her vault rather than the Lestrange vault, and while her vault was obviously well-stocked, the Goblins never asked her which of her vaults she would like to visit.

So maybe wizards don't have separate bank vaults.

It's possible that there are enchantments that only allow Harry to take out a certain amount per year or something, but Gringotts seems pretty laissez-faire.

The Lestrange family Vault had apart from Gold, relics like gems and stuff, and harry's vault had only gold. this raises the question where are the gems, crowns and other stuff? of course it could be that the potter's gold was exhausted during the war and only enough galleons for harry where left in his vault.

How would fem!Harry react to the abuse at the Dursley's? Would she develop an eating disorder due to not being allowed food and self-hatred/poor sense of self-worth? Would she become a tomboy in hopes of having a better chance at facing her cousin, fists first? Would she be awfully shy and introverted? Would Petunia hate her more for being a girl and thus, reminding her more of her sister? Or would she be nicer to her, simply because of that? For example, is there any sexism in the wizarding world? Male Harry would not encounter it, and Hermione hasn't said anything about it, but would fem!Harry have to deal with it? Would the tactics of the dark lord be more....nefarious, given that there's one thing in plus with which he can hurt fem!Harry? Mainly rape, etc? Would she still become best mates with Ron, given that she's a girl, and evidently, has cooties? Would the tension with Malfoy turn into a hate-crush type of thing? etc etc etc

- Unless Harry's treatment by the Dursleys changes with her gender, why would she develop an eating disorder or become a tomboy? It's just, the way that you phrase it, it sounds like Harry's gender is what changes her fundamental reaction to her treatment by the Dursleys.
- Men can be raped too, and the associated stigma is, in some ways, worse, since people are so much more dismissive. Perhaps rape would be more likely to occur to Voldemort, but really, the guy supposedly tortures and murders before breakfast, so I find that doubtful.

In reality there's no difference. Our mind and experiences are part of and stored in our bodies. In a fictional world where someone underwent a magical full body transformation while somehow remaining fundamentally the same person... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I guess it's down to authorial fiat. I just find the frequent assumption in these fics that 'female body = attraction to guys' troubling, especially when the character was a straight guy beforehand and accepts this change with a shrug so the author can write the /notreallyslash/ pairing they really want.

Also, when in doubt just go with femslash. There's more than enough slash and het in the fandom. :P

** The "Harry lives through the war and ends up getting sent back to his younger selves body while retaining all his memories" trope.

So, I half get the appeal. I have no doubt that every single person on this sub has imagined going back in time and fixing some of their fuck ups. God knows I have.

The problem is, this is fucking /boring/ in an actual fleshed out story that's not 100% wish fulfillment. There's no where for him to go! Harry /already/ won the damn war. He's already played the game, the stakes will never be nearly as high as the first time, because there's no question of whether he'll win.

Also, 99.99% of the time, Harry ends up a Mary Sue by chapter three. It makes sense in the context, but it's still boring as shit. Harry is always ahead in magic, always making good decisions. While there are a few exceptions, this is in general true.

Seriously, I just don't get this trope. To me if you're going to write a time travel story, it's better to have Harry (or whoever) go back in the body they possess, and end up with two versions of the same person in that time line (how cannon does it). It just ends up being more open and interesting than the other way around.

*** If you want to see this trope done really well, read, [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18831]["Time and Time Again"]] a short story by H Beam Piper.

Not HP, published in 1947. When Dobby appeared in HP - I thought of Piper's Fuzzy characters (they aren't in the short story linked above).

*** Yeah, Peggy Sue-ism is pretty a guarantee in this trope, but I got to admit that I like it anyways.

I also hate time-travel fics that think they have to keep everything the same as what happened in cannon. Or stories where Harry is still so emotionally crippled and /needs/ Sirius.

It seems to me that a good time-travel piece is more a character piece, than it is about defeating Voldemort.

*** You should check out The Temporal Beacon. Harry and Hermione keep sending their memories back to the end of 3rd year iirc. Nothing goes right though and they have to keep trying again and again but their actions always end up with a totally new story each run through.

** Any story where Harry's free will is removed, and he's suddenly magically attracted to so and so, because magic, or possibly wings. It's just- ugh. It's not the laziness that bothers me, so much as the implication that taking away a person's free will is okay, or that you don't need permission so long as they "like it" in the end.

Also, rape as a motivator is just awful to read. I don't care if it's well written. It's just- I can't even put to key what's so terrible about it, just that it's /awful/.

*** They're great if you don't have an easily accessible copy of the books though.

And they're pretty easy to write.

10000 word chapter, a few bland jokes from the characters when something happens, and you've got a nice juicy 11,000 words.

** Just to clarify, are we only supposed to bring up tropes that we genuinely don't understand, or are tropes that we understand all too well but don't like OK too? Because, I have many.

** I've never been a fan of the highscool trope in fanfiction. I suppose it makes sense within the Harry Potter fandom, but they tend to be a bit ridiculous in my opinion.

*** I've only ever read the one (ever, in all my fandoms, and one college AU) which was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1209036/1/Hogwarts-High][Hogwarts High]] and I remember enjoying it, but that was many years ago so maybe I'll have to read it again to see what I think. TBH I think the major interest to me was the non-magic side of it rather than the high school part; I'd never read a non-magic AU before and wanted to see how it went.

But I agree the concept isn't greatly appealing, especially as an adult. Had enough of the high school drama when I was a teenager; don't need to be reading about it all now. Also, for me at least, I'm put off by the fact most of them seem to be based in USA schools and as an Englishman I get a sense of disconnect. I can't get any realism from it because I've never been to an American school. (But now I'm thinking about it, it might be nice to read a non-magic HP AU set in an English boarding school. Have to AU a bunch of other stuff because the Dursleys would never send Harry to one... unless L/J arranged the payment for him to be sent to non-magic!Hogwarts prior to death, then they'd be glad to get rid of him for most of the year... Sorry, mind's getting away with me, I'll shut up now.)
