Hey everyone, was wondering if anyone could recommend any good crossover fics where Harry is transported to the other world either by himself or with Hermione and ends up being a powerful figure in this new world? Thanks for any recs :)


** Currently waiting for updates on this beauty:

linkffn(11157943)

However, it might not meet your tastes as it plays between years, centuries or even millenia after Harry's arrival (I'm not sure as the author never specifies) and doesn't have the "arrival scene" in it.

I also had a lot of fun with this one:

linkffn(8501689)

Its first person and has a criminal Harry who threw noble out the window.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9443327/1/A-Third-Path-to-the-Future][A Third Path to the Future]] might be what you're looking for if you haven't read it already.

You don't really need to know much about the Marvel comics to be able to follow along, and I found quite a few of the arcs pretty interesting. I enjoyed the Harry that initially came out of the portal because the journey left him a bit loopy. He mellows out before it became a crack fic, but for a while it was amusing.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
