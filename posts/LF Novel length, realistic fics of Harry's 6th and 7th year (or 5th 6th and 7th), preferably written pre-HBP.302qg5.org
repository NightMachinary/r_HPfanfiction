My personal favourite is Harry Potter and then Refiner's Fire & HP and the Time of Destiny, so if you've read those, something along that vein. If you haven't, I'd recommend it, it's amazing. I'm not picky on pairings but am not super interested in slash unless it's really well done. I prefer it to remain fairly canonical so H/G, R/Hr, etc are preferred but not required. I just really like the way the story was at that time of the series and love seeing how people branch it off into different endings. Adult content is a-ok. I'm having a hard time finding good ones that are this old, most of what's written now is post-DH, so I'm hoping for some recommendations :)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within][HP & the Enemy Within]] (sixth year) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3490702/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chained-Souls][HP & the Chained Souls]] (seventh year) are old favourites.

** This was written post HPB but pre DH. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636819/1/Soul-Searching][Soul Searching]] Chem Prof is one of my all time favourites. It's got a sequel also!

*** Oh! I sort of know who that is - the author of the fics I mentioned named a character after him because he named one after her first. I'll check his stories out!

** The best is probably Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]]. Alternate Sixth Year. Harry/Ginny. Some really awesome duels. Give it a read.

*** I'm definitely interested, BUT... I see that ur only has 6th year, not 7th. Is it going to break my heart that I don't get the last book? I don't want to start if if I can't finish it!

  Why is Snape acting so oddly? Who is causing the mysterious disease sweeping Hogwarts? What's wrong with Draco Malfoy? And what is the Dark Lord planning for Harry Potter's sixth year?

Year 7 is also up (and complete but maybe there was a planned third book?) but I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

*** That looks like it could be good. How are the action scenes? Does Harry ever pair up with anyone or date or anything? Thanks for the rec.

**** As far as flavor goes, it's not that far off from canon: Mysteries are explored throughout the year. There's action, mostly near the end. There's a romance, but Harry's romantic involvements aren't central to the plot.

I /will/ go as far as to say that it's neither Harry/Ginny nor Harry/Hermione.

** Try HP and the Psychic Serpent and the rest of Barb's trilogy (sorry no link on mobile). Refiner's Fire and its sequel are also my favorite but Barb's trilogy is a close second.

*** Reading it now! It's WEIRD to read one that's pre-OOTP. A lot of big things happen in that book that I didn't even really realize! I'm enjoying this story so far, thanks!

** Does pre-OotP count?

If so, you should read Carpe Diem and its sequel, Alpha and Omega.
