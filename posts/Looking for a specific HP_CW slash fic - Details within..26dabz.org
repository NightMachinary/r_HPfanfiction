I used to have this saved to my FanFic Reader, but I can't find it in my stash.

Here's what I remember for sure:

- Harry has a phoenix animagus form, and some affinity with dragons.
- Sirius is brought back through the veil by Snape.
- Near the very end, Harry moves Potter Manor on to a remote island.
- Harry has issues with very basic magic due to damaging himself while defeating Voldermort.
- Harry has a bottomless coffee cup. (Gamp's laws of elemental transfiguration be dammed!)

It's odd what you can remember, when you can't remember the title. ;)

Thanks in advance to anyone who has any clue what I'm looking for!


** Can't remember the specific one you mean, but I know that it was part of a series with the first being "Unlocking The Key".

Edit: Found it. It's called "Closing the Door" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2617038/1/Closing-the-Door]]
