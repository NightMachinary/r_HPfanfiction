I swear to God, everytime I check [[/r/HPfanfiction]] I come across a new, fucking stupid misspelling of Minerva McGonagall's name - McGonagl, McGonagle, McGonagal... One day, I will look at a thread who calls her MickGoneOnThePull or something equally obscene, I'm sure.

What are the favourite misspellings you've seen in fanfiction?

***** Lol that was actually funny.

"Flap flap went the owl" -how do you even come up with that?

The funniest thing is that he's still referred to as prof.lupus.

I've never been quite sure how someone managed to so bastardize the names of Professor Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort.
