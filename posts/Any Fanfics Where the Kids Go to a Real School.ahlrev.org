Harry, Hermione and Blaise all go to the same muggle primary school and become friends there in the years before hogwarts. It's a side plot though after the main plot of "kidnapped" Harry.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** Haha, you can give mine a shot if you like. Harry doesn't exactly go to a "real school" but he does go to several on-set classes, in which I had way too much fun writing about his attempts to learn calculus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

When a devastating attack on Hogwarts causes Harry to switch places with his on-screen counterpart, Daniyel Bluelake, Harry is thrown into an unfamiliar Muggle world where his life is just a fantasy. His job? Acting. Meanwhile, Daniyel will discover what it truly means to be a wizard as he learns to separate the magical fantasy world he's always known from its dark reality. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, Dan's happy days at Hogwarts are certainly numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable. But what can Dan do, in Harry's place? And how high will the cost be... to switch them back?
