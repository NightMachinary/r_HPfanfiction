** Well, the Hat is canonically able to hold conversations, so that suggests that it is at least as sapient as other enchanted objects like portraits. I feel like taking that away just makes the world of the story worse without providing any benefit.

What does bother me is when an author copies one of the Hat's songs into their fics. That is just pointless filler that can easily be glossed over with something like "The Sorting Hat sang its song."

*** And that's fine so long as it's not a SIOC or time travel story, but if the Hat sees Voldie return through your memories then maybe that should have tangible consequences. Or just avoid it completely by making it not sapient.

** I don't know how I feel about that. I kind of enjoy the interaction. To me the AU stuff is all about seeing how the differences between the two worlds change things or how the character goes through that kind of different scenario

*** And I'd of agreed with you for the first few years of HPfanfic I'd read. But lately it's just been irritating me, like it's usually, usually, not funny or creative or interesting, and while it's not enough of a peeve to make me stop reading, it does detract from my enjoyment. Which I know sounds entitled af.
