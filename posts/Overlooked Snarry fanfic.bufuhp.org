I read Memoria Secludo today, liked it and noticed that it doesn't have many hits on ao3. It's older and imported from elsewhere so it might have had plenty of readers, but I would still like to recommend it. I loved how the story (and the intimacy) progressed. I thought the characters were portrayed well. Definitely worth a read, if you like Snarry.

Also, if some other overlooked Snarry fics come to your minds, can you share the links?


** You might want to repost this to [[/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic/]]. This comm hates Snape and particularly loathes Snape/Harry, so it's not going to reach a sympathetic audience and will just end up getting ignored or downvoted.

When the fic was first posted on LiveJourna, IIRC it was well-received; Drachenmina is a good writer, but she left fandom and her fics have languished since then, especially with the rise of Tumblr and the eclipse of LJ and DW.

*** Sorry that people dislike a pairing with a 20 year age gap and with characters that obviously hate each other already. Nope it has to be the fact they are gay that makes people hate it.

**** Ah, and the haters show up on cue.

I didn't say the comm hates the ship because it's slash. I said the comm hates Snape (which it quite vocally and repeatedly demonstrates) and that it hates Snape/Harry (which is also true, as evidenced by your comment and every instance in which the ship gets brought up here). You're the one projecting "because it's gay" onto my recommendation.

I pointed the poster to [[/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic/]] because it's a community that welcomes all sorts of m/m and f/f ships, Snape/Harry included, even if the members aren't fans of any given ship. Slash is a rare item on /this/ comm, and there are a lot of straight male posters who simply don't like it or aren't interested in it. So anyone posting about slash fic, regardless of ship, might want to know that there's a slash-specific HP comm on Reddit that's worth checking out.

And I don't really give a flying fuck why /you/ hate the ship. Don't like, don't read. Other readers and writers who /are/ fans of the pairing might like to know there's a more tolerant and less self-righteous space to discuss fanworks without bizarre moralizing that conflates fiction with reality.

So I'm a hater for pointing out a flaw in your logic. People don't hate Harry/Snape becuase it's gay relationship. They dislike it becuase A) Huge age disparity. This is also true with Snape/Hermione ships. B) They do not have any basis for a relationship. It also doesn't help that most fics that do pair of either of these pairings make it happen mid-canon or post-canon. Which means they have the relationship they had at the time. With all the baggage that that includes. But that is usually hand-waved away with a "But it wasn't really meant that way" or something to that effect.

Yes. Not like that this thing called reality is where we get our morals and ethics. I've had plenty of debates before on why projecting our modern morals and values into fiction set in a feudal era is stupid. But that doesn't mean I can't see why people who hate each other should have more than a token line for why they are able to even consider a relationship.

You read my comment regarding gay and flew of the handle. Don't take a single line and start to project. You want to know why I hate this specific pairing: I'd never contemplate getting together with somebody that's abused me for 6 year of the 7-8 that I've known them. Nothing to do with anything else.

****** Where did I say anything about "this comm hates Snape/Harry because it's gay"? I recommended the other sub because it's fine with Snape/Harry and because slash readers and writers usually like to have places to talk about their ships. What's your problem with that?

Why does it matter what you would or wouldn't do in a real life relationship? I'm not talking about you or any real human being's ideas or choices about relationships. I'm glad you wouldn't get involved in an abusive whatever. But that has no bearing on make-believe. These are stories. The abuse isn't real. The hatred isn't real. /The characters aren't real./ Magic isn't real. And so on and so forth. I'm talking about fiction, where you can do anything you like with worlds that don't exist, that get posted in little sandbox communities where people chat about (and get wildly overinvested in) endless variations on favorite canons. You can kill the characters, and no one will get arrested. You can do anything you like to any of the characters, and it means absolutely nothing about moral fiber or intent.

I like foeyay ships, enemies-to-lovers, age gaps, dysfunctional relationships, anti-heroes, grey morality, etc. - among many other, sometimes completely different, things. You came into this thread to be contemptuous, and then accused me of flying off the handle. I don't get the level of rage you're expressing here. What are you trying to accomplish? To change my mind? Convince me that I'm a bad person for shipping Snape/Harry? All I see is someone playing fandom police.

******* Because both the writer and the reader need to be able to put themselves into the mindspace of the characters they are reading. And it says something about people that want to read abusive fiction.

You can argue about the fact that it isn't real all you want. But it signals something about not just those who write them but also those that read them.

​

And all of that needs to at least be dealt with carefully. Which even for the usual 99% of anything is shit. Is at least twice as true with these things because people just go "I'll skip this part. It's not that important." I've seen writers literally use that in a lot of fics both gay and straight. Doesn't matter. If you skip 99% of the relationship building you are lazy fuck.

Yes. So much rage. Definitely. I told you you were flying off the handle because you wrote three paragraphs to defend against a snarky two sentence reply.

Really? What does it say? And by what authority do you make a claim like this? Is the same true of all the power fantasies about Harry as killing machine? Where do you draw the line?

Imagine all the horrible things you want about a casual fanfic writer on a Harry Potter subreddit. It won't make those imaginings true. To me it seems considerably more morally reprehensible to insinuate that there's something unspecifically wrong with a real person you know nothing whatsoever about than it is to make up sexy fanfic stories for the entertainment of fellow fans.

********* Hello,

please notice my comment to RedKorss, the PS in particullar is relevant to you as well.

I'd also like to point out, that to the characters of a story the things happening are real, so there are reasons to have them react realisticaly even though it's only fiction. But even if they do not, I agree the fics can be enjoyable and the readers (or authors) shouldn't be judged by the cover of their books.

Thank you again for recommending the other subreddit.

******** Hello,

it might just say that these readers have a more resilient stomach than me and don't shy away from reading about things that unfortunately also happen in reality.

But I do believe that trivialising such matters in fanfiction is the wrong way to go. The way they are dealt with in fanfiction is relevant to reality.

As for Snarry, they DO have things in common, unique but similar perspectives they could share with each other. The intensity of their interactions is intriguing. If they could wise up to their prejudices, recognize their misconceptions and untangle misunderstandings and past wrongs, then there would be basis for a relationship.

I suppose it is a pairing that is difficult to do justice to. Especially in a way that acknowledges their past and yet allows them to heal, understand each other, forgive, find love and build a relationship that is healthy. I can see how "waving away the baggage" would make the relationship far-fetched, but usually as a reader I imagine the characters came to terms with it of-screen and it doesn't make the fics less entertaining.

As for the age gap, I like to think that it is less of an issue considering wizarding life expectancy and that, recklessness aside, Harry is rather mature for his age, especially post-war. (And that holding grudges the rather extreme way Snape does is rather immature, so maybe it's actually Snape that needs to grow up.)

PS: As an outside observer of your conversation: I think your initial comment was more biting than necessary to get your point across and contained an untrue assumption, but calling you a hater was an overreaction. The following escalation was painfull to see, because both you and beta_reader strike me as tolerant people with differing opinions trying to share/explain your perspective, but making assumptions about each other, getting overly deffensive and generally rubbing each other the wrong way.

  Severus Snape survived Nagini's bite, but as punishment for his crimes, he has had his memories excised and has been exiled from the wizarding world. Harry can't resist the opportunity to get to know Snape without their past getting in the way. But what will happen if Snape regains his memories?Warnings: Object insertionHarry is 18 in this fic.Disclaimer: This story is based on characters and situations created and owned by JK Rowling, various publishers including but not limited to Bloomsbury Books, Scholastic Books and Raincoat Books, and Warner Bros., Inc.
