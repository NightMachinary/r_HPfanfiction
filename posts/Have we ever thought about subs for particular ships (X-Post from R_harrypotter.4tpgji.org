X-Posted from [[/r/harrypotter]]

So it seems like the HP fandom is pretty divided around ships, to the point of intense disagreement (an understatement) between shippers of contrary couples. So I was wondering if having separate subs for fans to show off fanfiction, fan drawings, or theories without risking downvotes from people who disagree might make sense.

In fact some of most controversial posts on [[/r/HPfanfiction]] are about unpopular pairings (Lucius/Harry or Snape/Harry), and in a recent post about ships people didn't understand, there were several popular ships(Draco/Hermione and Hermione/Snape) which were mentioned frequently as ships people didn't like/didn't understand, and if I was a fan of those I know I'd like a place where I could discuss it without fear of disapproval. So has this ever been considered? Is there demand for something like this?

Additional Edit[Not in original post]: Furthermore, having a sub for particular ships means you don't to worry about continuously asking the general populace of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] for more fanfics about your ship and those posts can be focused into a specific community based around that ships.

Additionally, it turns out [[/r/Dramione]] is a thing...although rather dead.


** I think the community is too small to sustain 20+ different subreddits. They'd all be dead. I feel it would be more worth our time to make this sub a space were anyone can share their pairing of choice.

I believe that the sub has largely achieved this as I personally haven't seen anyone attacking others for their requests.

It's *fan*fiction for Merlin's sake. Let people enjoy what they want.

*** This sub is better run than most - but the attacking tends not to be done openly. I've had some repulsive msgs.

**** That's cowardly. I can't imagine why anyone would care to be honest. What does it matter what pairing people find compelling?

**** Well, I'm new, so I can only guess, but I would think you could get a subreddit for your Hermione/giant squid pairing, and feel really cozy and open up about your feelings about tentacles, and then someone could take the time to troll all of you, because folks are sad like that sometimes.

** I would love a space dedicated to my OTP and would throw myself into participating. I'm not sure however if there is enough demand. Those of us who have "controversial" pairings as favourites tend to find one another and congregate in whatever forum we're part of anyway.

**** The more common pairings dominate whatever the forum because of their popularity. The controversial and rare pair shippers who could really *use* a place to talk without being swamped by the more common ones probably don't constitute large enough quantities of traffic for individual subs.
