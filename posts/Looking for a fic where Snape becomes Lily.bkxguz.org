As the title states, I'm looking for a fanfic where Snape becomes Lily. The method doesn't matter and can be through Polyjuice or just a body swap. Thanks.


** Now you gave me a silly idea: canon Snape still wants to be with Lily after everything, so the Powers that Be, just to fuck with him, sends him back for a re-do -- except that he's forced to re-do /Lily's/ life, because from that, "solving" the dilemma is trivial.

I've seen a couple of SSHG bodyswap fics (mostly with romance endgames, but not always), a HPSS one (non-romance) and a JPSS one (non-romance -- James wanted to spend a holiday with Lily and didn't see Tobias coming) but no LESS ones.

** there is a fic of this nature for Harry and Hermione. A switched Chance ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance][www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/1/A-Switched-Chance]]) They attempt the ritual to travel back in time and Harry ends up as Hermione and Hermione becomes the boy who lived ast age 11. It's rather interesting as they try and adjust to each other's magic and there's some wand lore and soul magic mixed in.

It's the only transgender fic I know about. It's not a common theme at all.

As for Snape turning into Lily there was only one fic I read where there was a scene where after his arrest or death they clean out his spinners end house. There's a hidden trunk where he's got old 1970s Hogwarts girls uniforms and labeled jars of red hairs of every redheaded student since he's been a teacher at Hogwarts. I think it was meant to imply that he would Polyjuice himself as a female redhead so that he could look like Lily.

I wish I could remember the title but it's been so long well before deathly Hallows exonerated him so he was very much a villain still.
