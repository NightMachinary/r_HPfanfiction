I vaguely recall reading a stargate x Harry Potter fanfic where Harry somehow becomes Daniel Jackson. Basically Harry somehow ends up at the museum the night his parents die (I think maybe like a ghost? spirit?) and possesses/merges with Daniel's dead body (or i think he was dead...). If anyone knows what I'm thinking of, I'd love to hear what it is!

P.S. I thought maybe it was A Place Where I Belong by Corwalch but that one has Harry just pretending to be DJ and not actually being him in body. I then thought it might be Truth and Revelations by Marcus S. Lazarus but that just had Daniel Jackson as a made-up identity.
