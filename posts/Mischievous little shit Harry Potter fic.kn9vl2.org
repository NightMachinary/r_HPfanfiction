Okay so I'm looking for something where Harry isn't evil or anything of course, he's just up to no good. He likes causing trouble, just to be a little pain in the ass. He could be in Slytherin, because he'd be cunning and stuff, but it doesn't matter really. He just keeps causing trouble, pranking people, and no one can prove it's him, but it is. So humor, I guess.


** Harry Potter and The Master Of Malicious Compliance does this pretty well!

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE. A/N: Slytherin-Harry.

8 In which Slytherin! Harry Potter is the most mischievous little prat in the world, and he uses his knowledge of Muggle things for a great cause. This is in no linear order, though certain characters or dates may appear that show what year it is. The others, you can decide for yourself.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen][Poison Pen]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1013852/GenkaiFan][GenkaiFan]] - Harry has had enough of seeing his reputation shredded in the Daily Prophet and decides to do something about it. Only he decides to embrace his Slytherin side to rectify matters.

I actually like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot][Rorschach's Blot's]] writings. They're rather crack fic but they're a lot of fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3248583/1/Ground-Hog-Day][Ground Hog Day]] - Harry lives the same day over and over again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784785/1/Lets-do-the-Time-Warp-Again][Let's do the Time Warp Again]] - A potions accident throws Harry back in time into his younger self's body, he decides to go nuts and do everything he's ever wanted to do . . . and get revenge on everyone.

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] where Harry doesn't intentionally cause trouble but it follows him around which is fun.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2370561/1/The-Founders-Heir][The Founder's Heir]] - Where Harry returns from being back in the Founder's time much to the annoyance of Dumbledore he keeps revealing Dumbledore's secrets. This is fairly light and humours and Incomplete.

** Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7279137/1/]]) is a good one for this, though it is pretty short.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3535620/1/]]) is also a pretty funny one, but it might not quite match up with what you're looking for.

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1755901/1/]]) is a longer one with both mischievous Harry and a good plot, with the slytherins making a big role in the story as well.

  This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes in random order from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Feel free to adopt.
