By strange, I mean Blood Magic, Elemental Magic, creature magic whatever you can think of. I would prefer it to be completed or on-going. Over 20 chapters. Well-written. Not insanely overpowered from the first chapter.

Just to let you know, I have read A Cadmean Victory, and a lot of the other common ones but recommend them just in case.

Thank you!!

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

** Holy moly, I have several in mind, but this one takes the cake:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501][The Train to Nowhere]]

It all starts out well and dandy and then it just gets... wow. Harry is quite powerful we find out throughout and there is some really cool magic. I think even stranger magic will be explored further. The writer hasn't named it yet, but it's one of the plot threads in this amazing story. Updates still come in regularly. When I first got into it, I spent just an hour trying to summarize the first chapters for my friend, so please excuse my sucky summary.

*** Fuck.

I am not a slash hater, It's not my thing in general but neither is gryffindor harry and I don't really mind those either

But Tom riddle/harry? That's a little yikes if I am honest, and it's a bummer since the fic looks really good ):

**** Oh dang! I didn't even consider the pairing aspect in my enthusiasm to rec this story. Although, I have to add here, we're about 400k+ words in and there has been nothing untoward between Voldemort and Harry --- but it is headed that way. But like I said, nothing sexual or even romantic between them so far and I think Harry is now in his 6th or 7th year. Harry is gay in this story. But his sexuality is not the core focus of this. Honestly, this story is so good, so well-written and so well-plotted, you'll buy whatever this author comes up with.

***** I'll give it a shot.

Maybe I'll drop it when the pairing comes to fruition

It's not really that he is gay, it's more the 50+ year gap between a young boy and a deranged old man that gives me the creeps about the pairing

****** I completely understand, and agree, and yet here I am championing this fic haha.

If, at any point, you start thinking â€˜yikes', yeah, back out. But I hope it won't hit for a loooong while.

There have been few fics that have really impressed me throughout the years, and this one definitely hits the top fics.

Aaaand now I've gone and hyped it up too much ðŸ˜‚

Is written in a way that makes everything feel a bit off, and while I myself didn't finish it it does have magic also being strange.
