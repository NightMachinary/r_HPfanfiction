  I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer ...

I actually checked if it was true. It is. Feels very choppy for a last line, I had never noticed before.

Unexpectedly good test, good job friend.

** 18/20...

I just wish that you could see which ones you missed....

/Edit/ I missed the fact that I could scroll down, and I obviously have been reading too many fanfics....

**** My logic was that I think Harry and Dumbledore land on the Astronomy tower when they get back from the horcrux hunt, and later when Harry is thinking about Snape's "betrayal" he calls it something like "murder at the top of the tallest tower". I can't remember the exact line, but I thought he called it the tallest.
