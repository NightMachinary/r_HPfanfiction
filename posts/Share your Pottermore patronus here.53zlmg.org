*** I remember one evening where I spent it redoing the sorting over and over, just to see. I did this by creating and deleting the same account over and over. I think I'm gonna try this do test out the patronus test. Should be fun.

** Mine's a Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound). Despite being a dog person, I was bummed because I heard that St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, and Huskies were options. But then I read up on this little fella, and he's pretty neat. I think it's a good pick. Also the test itself was wonderful and well designed, so good on JK!

** I got a borzoi. Very disappointed at first because a dog was the last thing I'd expect formy patronus (cat person+mild cynophobia). I've been slowly warming up to the idea after I read up about the breed though. I do have a little bit of family connection to Russia and some of my best memories are associated with the winter and/or cold places.
