I'm looking for a specific fanfic I read about a year ago. I don't read fanfics so this particular one was kinda memorable for me being one of the few I read. Now I can't find it again .

It had a lot of chapters, all of them started with a time of day and date. It was kinda like a diary. Most of the story was from Albus' POV.

I'll just bullet mark the points that stood out for me. Hope it helps.

• The story also had a few OCs.

• Story starts with Albus and his siblings getting ready for their first day at hogwarts. Album is not impressed while the rest are very happy. Scorpius on the other hand is very excited with his history books about the legends of the previous war including Harry who he looks up to a lot.

• Albus and Scorpius meet on the train (first year) and Albus shares some chocolate frogs and smoking candy with Scorpius and they have a talk about Hogwarts' famous figures. Both were alone in the cabin.

• Scorpius admires Harry a lot and is a history geek.

• Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and he absolutely hates it. Scorpius on the other hand is overjoyed as he can stay with Albus even more.

• Both Slytherin and Griffendor kids make fun of Albus driving him crazy because he's Slytherin. He often cried along with Scorpius in the bathroom ;_;

• Albus and Scorpius share a room in the dorm.

•Albus is bullied a lot and James (being a bit mean to his brother, in the book) still helps his brother.

•James has an OC girlfriend who's the dorm leader.

• Albus and scorpius are always together and spend time alone near the bashing willow..it's kinda forbidden to go there.

• They eat food together and once James challenged Scorpius to a bean boozled type challenge and Albus gets jealous.

• They sort of had a Halloween typish night where they all ate loads of chocolate and Scorpius confessed to Rose but got rejected.

• Rose was gay in the beginning and had an OC girlfriend who she broke up with on dance night.

• She later starts dating Scorpous who has a crush on her after being rejected twice.

• Around their second year, Scorpius' mother dies and he's devastated by it. He collapses and Albus gets worried sick.

• Scorpius is in the Quidditch team while Albus isn't. Here was scene after a match where Albus finds himself attracted to Scorpius' (sweat) scent.

• Albus starts to like Scorpius but he's oblivious to his own feeling.

• He gets jealous whenever Scorpius is with Rose and gets himself an OC girl friend while learning to fly some mystical creature (I forgot what) in Hagrid's class.

• Lily and a cousin join Hogwarts the next year and Lily immediately notices that Albus likes Scorpius...like they play footsies and are stuck at the hip together.

• She tries to get them together by making a love smoke/potion.

• Albus doesn't find the spark in kissing his girlfriend anymore. Once he's together on a tree with Scorpius and he desires to teach Scorpius how to kiss. They both kiss and get caught by Lily who was standing under the tree with the love potion/smoke thingy.

• They come home for vacation and Scorpius stays with the Potters. Albus realises he feels more than just friends with Scorpius and wonders what he'll do now.

I think the part where I stopped reading, they were in fourth or fifth year.

In the story, Albus has temper managemant issues. Scorpius is an adorable dork. Jame acts like shit but he's protective of Albus when it comes to bullying. Lily is really bright and famous in school.

The date and time thing + them playing footsies stood out for me with regards to the layout of the story.

Also, I don't remember if I read it on archive of our own or fanfiction.net but I'm sure as hell it had an Original character tag on it. I don't know how to search with tags and I've tried my best to find it but I'm at loss here. Thank you for taking your time to read this post.

Any help is deeply appreciated.

** Sounds like something I've read on ao3 once. Sort by Albus/Scorpius and filter it with word length over 20,000.

Further filter it by Albus x OC

That should help
