I guess it really depends on what you consider bashing.

I just want fics where he is held responsible for being a death eater and supporting death eaters and having the views you have by default by supporting them ( the blood purity stuff)

Where having a one sided crush on Lilly doesn't make him redeemable and having a bad childhood doesn't excuse or justify joining Voldemort.

And Marauders bullying him isn't the cause for him joining Voldemort. And all the other bs he does through out the series like outing Lupin, or bullying the students isn't excused. The bad things are seen as bad and maybe has consequences.

I don't want like Harry lecturing him or anyone about how Snape is bad .

Or like a revenge fantasy necessarily.

He's just not sympathetic and not a good person but not necessarily the villain.

I do want him in character not like super exaggerated but it doesn't have to be canon only can be an au or something.

Preferably Marauders centric ( tho not necessarily Marauders era)

But doesn't have to be

No non Snape Bashing No oc or super minor character x major character No incest No huge age gaps ( Aka like Marauders x Hermione) No one x Bellatrix No Snilly everything else is fine slash fine too


** So, this isn't /quite/ on point, but if you want to deconstruct Severus' mistakes, and Lily's, and Petunia's, and James', and Remus', etc, etc, then linkffn(The Path not Tread by boxyp) is all about them grappling with their issues, reflecting on their own behaviour, apologising, continuing to make mistakes, making changes, and generally following a very bumpy upward road. It is eventual Snily, but only after a /lot/ of work and a lot of obstacles on both their parts.

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated row. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause holds the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future. A What-if AU

** I think it's possible to have both full recognition of his misdeeds, and also redemption. (Actually, if it doesn't fully acknowledge what he's done wrong, there can't be true redemption, can there?)

His redemption is a slow process in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised), and he is intensely aware of his own failings; if anything, it's a Snape-bashing story inside his own head. But as per canon, he is dedicated to Lily, and he is capable of great endurance in the service of his duty, whatever unworthiness he may feel. She is quicker to forgive him than he is to forgive himself, and he definitely has longstanding issues that are only very gradually addressed.

Note that I think it's only fair to acknowledge that his attachment to her, though unhealthily codependent, was both more than a crush, and arguably unselfish. Just wanting her to himself would not explain what he went through for years in service to her memory, nor would it explain protecting her son when she herself was certainly beyond his reach. Even if it was no more than a desire for revenge upon Voldemort, that's not such a terrible cause, all things considered.

(Btw, the "you don't care if Voldemort gets her husband and child, so long as you get her to yourself" scene is frequently misinterpreted IMO. That was an accusation made by Dumbledore, but Severus' only response was "Protect them all, then." And he couldn't reasonably have asked for Voldemort to spare the life of the Chosen One prophesied to destroy him, could he? Nor would he have expended his limited influence to stick his neck out for his old nemesis James Potter, and Voldemort would have been puzzled and dangerously curious if he had tried. But if Dumbledore's method of protecting Lily was to protect the whole family, Severus raised no objection and immediately agreed to that. Hardly seems like a selfish attitude.)

Well the point I think was that when Snape realizes Lilly might not survive he is willing to go straight to Dumbledore. But when he knows her family is being targetted and even if he manages to negotiate a deal with Voldemort to save her they won't be saved she'd be devastated and he doesn't really care.

He doesn't go straight to Dumbledore then. When Dumbledore calls him out on this he doesn't really deny anything. Just says keep them all safe then because that would mean keeping Lilly safe. The not caring about the happiness of the person that you claim to love is the selfish part. And the kinda thing people usually point to when saying he didnt really love her at all)

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
