Idc if it's a oneshot/short or long fic. Open for crossovers, particularly Sherlock crossovers. I prefer slash but I will read any good fics you rec me. I would love for Percy to be the main character


** Well, one of my favorites is linkao3(8393899) Paperwork, which is a one-shot where Percy isn't the main character, but is featured.

One that I started reading but haven't caught up with yet is linkao3(14033613) Percy Take the Wheel, which is a still-updating long fic that moves very slowly. Percy is forced to become the head of the Weasley family after a terrible accident happens to Arthur and Molly.

  Though nobody would be able to tell --- it was winter, and she had official Ministry robes on over her other clothes --- she was, for the first time, wearing a skirt to work.And today, she was going to ask her coworkers to call her Audrey.-In which efficient bureaucracy gives Audrey a much needed confidence boost about coming out.

  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
