Are there any fics out there where the Order has to 'take care' of the younger Weasleys?

In OotP, Molly is questioning what would happen to the kids if she and Arthur died. Remus then says that the Order wouldn't just let them starve.

I was wondering if there were any fics that go into that. Perhaps a tag on AO3 I've never seen?

(I don't know what to flair this. It's not a looking for fic because I'm not looking for a specific fic. It's not a prompt because I'm not expecting anyone to write it for me. I'm going with request...)

They did such a swell job with Harry though, didn't they? I wouldn't really count on the Order to look after them; the kids would end up fending for themselves.

Good prompt, though.

******* As the old saying goes 'Where there's a will, there's a way.' Dumbledore would find a way to ensure that the Weasley children would be housed with their loving +sour+ aunt after all he isn't Chief Warlock & Supreme Mugwump with friends in high places for nothing! To be honest I'm going with the manipulative/senile Dumbledore trope for my idea. After all cupboard-Petunia & stamping-out-Vernon are the epitome of a loving family.

Most likely they'd just house them all in #12 Grimmauld Place like they did in canon.

*** To say nothing of if they /did/ try parenting. No idea who would be worst suited for the job: Snape, Mundungus or Mad-eye

**** Mundungus would be worst -- he's seen shirking his duties on several occasions, and I don't think he'd be any better when it comes to taking care of children.

Snape's biggest problems stem from his past and his emotional problems. If he did a honest attempt at it, he would at the very least make sure that the children aren't outright harmed, but how well would they be off in the end? He's not exactly the warm and cuddly type.

Moody would probably be the best emotionally of the 3, but with how unpredictable children can be at times, his paranoia could potentially cause the children to set off booby-traps or similar, which could lead to major harm.

So to summarize, I think Dung would easily be the worst. As for the other 2, it's a toss-up. Moody wouldn't be able to handle their unpredictability, while Snape wouldn't be able to give them the emotional support they'd need.

This is all assuming we're talking about small children who are still dependant on adults to a degree. Those at Hogwarts age and beyond would probably be able to cope best with Snape, because emotional neglect is probably less harmful for them (since they can get the emotional support they'd need from friends, etc) than Moody's traps.

**** Harry can disapparate. It might be illegal for him to do so but when Death Eaters are coming at you, you don't think about that. So no, he can escape easily, just like Mundungus escaped Voldemort.

****** Nope. That's plain false. It's not possible to track Apparition that way and I'll take Lupin's word on it over yours. Here's the source from the Deathly Hallows.

******* Lupin is wrong about this.

Earlier in Deathly Hallows we literally see Death Eaters talk about it with Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Trans-port. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”

  “He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.”
#+end_quote

I assume the Death Eaters know better than anyone if they couls have caught Harry when he apparites.

******** They may know if he Apparates but they have no way to track him to his destination, especially if he Apparates multiple times. Coz otherwise Voldemort would have tracked Harry and Hermione after Godric's Hollow and I doubt their protective enchantments would hold up against him.

All this is basically Rowling trying to shoe horn an aerial battle into the book and doing a shit job at the required worldbuilding.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
