I am wondering whether there are any stories where Hagrid turns out to be the main bad guy.

In the meantime do you want one where he's actually a massive hero?

  A real prophecy involves Rubeus Hagrid. In Harry's second year, the giant spends his days planting a hedge around Hogwarts. Story takes dark turn every once in a while with "wait... what?" Lots of bashing of Dumbledore, McGonagall, Fudge, and Umbridge. There'll be seven parts.

Just a one shot with Hagrid being an accidental genius mentor.
