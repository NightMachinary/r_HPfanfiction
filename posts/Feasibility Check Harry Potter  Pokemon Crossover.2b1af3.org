** There are a lot of moving parts to what you've described, and it seems a bit too bombastic for my taste. For example you discussed the society, and gone some into the magic system, but you fall into the trap of not having any plot, or at least not one that you put forward in this post.

The problem I would see with this type of crossover is that the two worlds are fundamentally different, in that Harry Potter has much darker overtones to its society whereas Pokemon is a sugarcoated world. You'd either have to bring Pokemon down or the HP universe up to either one's level. It seems that you are going with the latter, in which case I would suggest making the pokemon in the world more feral particularly in the wild and require more rigorous training if captured (if you are going to have a capture system), and domestic Pokémon (e.g. the starters) being on the same training requirements as cats to dogs. Moreover, Pokémon are largely location locked e.g. the Pokémon in Asia area (red, Blue, yellow etc) are different to those found in the American and European areas (white and black, X and Y). So you have to decide whether you want all Pokémon in one area (which wouldnt make sense in the 'real world') or maybe have the students travel?

I would also be tempted to have a limit on how many Pokémon you have available, particularly to young wizards/trainers, partly for logistical reasons because having multiple characters (which Pokémon would be if they are conscious and sentient) becomes very difficult to write.

A way of getting around this might be that wizards have a Pokémon inside them and at the sorting ceremony this Pokémon is brought out of them that reflects their personality or portion of their soul or however you want to spin it. Therefore, as the wizards/trainer get stronger this is reflected in their soul pokemon (evolutions, new moves, levels etc). Hogwarts could then be a licensing school (gym), where wizards/trainers learn to hunt and capture wild Pokémon (who often attack muggles or something like that). I would also consider nerfing magic considerably so that Pokémon can take an active role in wizards society. Maybe to the extent that Pokémon become the new wands e.g the mediums in which spells are cast.

Animagus (although you have a bit of a hard on for it) seems like redundant ability in a world full of Pokémon particularly if your training one, however perhaps you could have a spell in which to trade places with your Pokémon? Patronus could simply be an attack that the Pokémon learns.

Moreover ,although it's a bit lazy, I wouldnt mention particular Pokémon unless they are vital to the plot, and it would be realistic for them to be in this position that are seen, no point in overreaching.

TLDR: Plot first, details after.

*** Right at the top of the post, they mention it will be a forum based RPB, meaning more than one player, so the plot would happen as the different player's characters interact with each other and the world around them, possibly around the plot of the books, possibly not. They mention's legendaries would be played by mods, for instance.

Anyway, while it sounds interesting, it's not something I see myself taking part in. I might read it after it was done and cleaned up, if such a thing happens.

***** It's cool, you made some very good points regardless. The parts about the difference in tone, limit on number of Pokemon, and animagi, which looking back makes up most of it.

** For a forum-based RPG... it could work. Care of Magical Creatures would have to start at first year, and would be just as important as Charms or DADA. The problem is that you now have a huge balance issue: Pokémon are hard enough on their own, and magic on it's own (and specifically, the Hogwarts version would be a nightmare), but put both together? Ridiculously exploitable combinations of Pokémon and spells/potions will make this a management nightmare: Wingardium Leviosa is learned in the first lesson in charms and all physical melee attacks of a Pokémon are rendered useless, Augumenti creates water and Pikachu just strikes with lightning, some shield from a Pokémon and some darker offensive spells, and so on.

The temptation for going all-out 1-2 punch based combat characters with Pokémon will turn it into a very violent world... unless trainers are not wizards, or would have to give up a lot in order to make that work. I know I'd take a violent route if I'd be a player there.

It would take a lot of serious thought into how to make the two worlds combined not become a tyranny of mathematical/logical creativity.

** Okay, you asked for a feasibility check so here goes: it's NOT doable.

The two universes are just entirely too different. I can't see how Pokémon would mix with Harry Potter and not leave everything a giant broken mess.

They don't match in mechanics, they don't match in overlapping theme and they definitely do not match in atmosphere.

I just don't see any way this could work while still being true to both source materials
