So having just come home from the theater, I'm suddenly into the idea of reading some HP/SW fics. I've never really tried crossovers before, so I was hoping I could get some good recommendations.

On the whole, I would prefer fics that have little to do with the prequels, which are movies I intensely dislike. But I will make an exception if the fic is good. Anything else goes. Thanks!

- Harry and HK-47 bro it up and mow people down. Really fun. Probably the best crossover between the two.

- Harry's a galactic historian in the same way Indiana Jones is an archeologist. He recruits Ashoka as his sidekick/minion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]]

- Harry's a bounty hunter. I think this was shaping up to be a HarryxAsaaj ship but it got abandoned. Still fun though.

edit: And what'd you think of that whole deal with Chewbacca being the reincarnation of Emperor Palpatine? That shit surprised the hell out of me.

What really surprised me was when we learned that Yoda and Jar-Jar were the same person all along. It makes so much more sense that Anakin turned on the Jedi now that I know that.

  An aged, broken Jedi general came to Earth hoping to retire. However, when he went to a park and saw a young boy with unlimited Force potential getting the snot beat out of him, he knew the Force was not through making his life interesting.

** I saw the movie yesterday and I totally feel the same. I hope to read some TFA x-overs very soon. I felt [[/spoiler][Kylo Ren could be a Slytherin Death Eater, but more in the Severus or Regulus way where you don't exactly know how dark they truly are. On the other hand, when talking to the Supreme Leader he seemed very Malfoy to me. And then the conversations where he's more Ben Solo than Kylo Ren.... His character felt as someone who could belong in the HP universe to me.]] I don't know, I just hope people start writing x-overs with the new stuff soon!

*** I totally agree, and in fact after a second viewing I felt really tempted to just plunk Harry Potter into the start of the movie, [[/spoiler][right as Poe Dameron gets the map pieces, and then have a Harry Potter vs. Kylo Ren showdown]], could make for some great stuff. J.J. did a really good job with this one.

**** Saw it twice too! [[/spoiler][A showdown sounds really good, I felt the battle between Rey and Kylo at the end was a bit predictable. Would love to read an improved version of that (with Harry instead of Rey? Or fighting together?)]] Keep me posted if you start writing, I am curious.

***** I liked the [[/spoiler][fight at the end against Kylo, but it did strike me as odd that a non-force sensitive but trained stormtrooper and untrained but force sensitive scavenger could keep up with a guy who trained under Luke Skywalker. There are so many things you could do with it if you added Harry into the mix, like having Kylo deflect spells with his lightsaber, or freezing them in mid-air with the force.]]

One scenario I had in mind was to have [[/spoiler][Finn try to escape with Poe during the starting battle while Harry kept Kylo busy. Harry could deflect blasts away from the stolen TIE fighter, then maybe Kylo could try freezing it in mid-air with the force, and Harry could break that as if it were a spell, just lots of cool scenarios like that.]] I'll try writing something up.

****** I meant the way [[/spoiler][the planet fell apart. I just knew they were going to end at a different side each and that it would end the fight for now, instead of it being an actual showdown of strength/force.]] This could really be improved by some spells or magic. Definitely want to read your take on it! Good luck writing.

****** It looked like [[/spoiler][Kylo didn't really use the force like in past movies, more so he cast spells. Like he could freeze blaster bolts and people, and then walk away. It honestly felt to me that he was casting spells, which would make it ripe for dropping HP characters near him to have them fight. His interrogations seemed a bit more active and involved. So it would seem that he is less trained to fight with the force too. His saber is supposed to be poorly made and thus the cross guards are actually to bleed of energy so the main blade doesn't destabilize completely. To me that implies that he has little to no experience with saber fighting, and thus active force power usage during the fight might be beyond his skills; So Finn can fight with him on more equal footing.]]

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
