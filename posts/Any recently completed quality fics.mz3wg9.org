** A Place Apart, and The Second String were both completed within the last couple weeks.

Of A Linear Circle's most recent instalment, Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay and The End is the Beginning are all one chapter away from completion (you could argue that Dragon is finished now, as we're only missing the epilogue).

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

#+begin_quote
  Death was not what Harry thought it would be. An empty train and a being proclaiming himself to be the Death, telling him that, ‚Äúsorry, no afterlife for you‚Äù certainly wasn't anywhere near his expectations. And having his soul and magic crammed back into his four year old body, being told that he can never die... That was another painful kick to the groin. But Harry is British, and the phrase ‚Äúkeep calm and carry on‚Äù is practically a part of him by now. He realises that this is a second chance at life. To actually live and do whatever the hell he wants without being someone else's pawn. It is a new beginning, and things are going to be vastly different this time around.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
