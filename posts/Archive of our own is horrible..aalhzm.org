There is a lot of disgusting stuff out there with no proper ratings, You would be reading some fic and suddenly weird unnatural sex. I am never going to visit that site again. Honestly, some of it is just illegal according to me. Like seriously someone should alert JK Rowling of these smut fics. When she allowed people to write fanfiction, this was not what she had in mind.

** Um... no.

I'm pretty sure JK Rowling is aware of the smut, and as far as I know she is pretty tolerant of the fanfiction in general.

Just because you personally don't like smut (which nobody is forcing you to read), it doesn't mean that there aren't people out there who enjoy such content. Most of it /is/ properly labeled and easy to filter, so I don't see how its existence affects you.

I don't see the point of this post. No one is holding a gun to your head, making you browse through Ao3. While I agree that the tagging system is somewhat flawed, it's definitely a lot better than on many other fanfiction sites.

That's fine, we can just add it to the list of Rowling pronouncements to ignore, joining the entirety of Pottermore, /Cursed Child/, and the epilogue.

** There's a lot of explicit, weird stuff on AO3 because it was specifically founded to be an archive that would never restrict or purge content, unlike ffn.net or LJ or now Tumblr. But it also has an extremely extensive tagging system - you have to rate your fic (or mark it as not rated), you have to give the major warnings (graphic violence, character death, non-con, and underage; or again mark it as unwarned), and the additional tags section and author's notes make it easy to include additional warnings. And now with the "exclude" function, it's never been easier to filter out things you don't want. Obviously, as with any system, not everyone perfectly follows the rules, but I genuinely can't remember the last time I came across "weird unnatural sex" on AO3 that wasn't tagged.

Furthermore, JKR didn't "allow" people to write fic. Her generally permissive attitude towards it definitely made things easier for fic writers and helped fic go (more) mainstream, but fanfiction is legal even when the author doesn't like it - look at all the fics based on Anne Rice books you can still find on AO3, for example.

*** "[...] but fanfiction is legal even when the author doesn't like it - look at all the fics based on Anne Rice books you can still find on AO3, for example. "

​

have you bothered to actually get hold of some proper legal studies on the case? Fanfiction is not blanket legal, not even in Canada which has the most permissive attitude based in the law towards it with Section 29.21 of the Canadian Copyrigth Act. US law is a lot less permissive, and European Union law is especially unpermissive regarding fanfiction, and always has been. If you have studied this piece of law it would be nice to see some sources as to why it is legal and in what jurisdiction.

​

" Conclusion

Fanfiction is a phenomenon which is here to stay, that much can be seen in the sheer amount of it which can be found. If it is non-infringing however, is less clear, and must be decided upon on a case by case basis [...]. Each and every fanfiction follows its own style and even though one work of fanfiction may resemble another, it are the creative choices made in each individual work which makes it infringing or not. Some works of fanfiction will as such qualify for protection based on for example the parody exception, whereas others -- unfortunately perhaps -- fall short of the protection of such an exception.

The basis for this problem lies in copyright itself. Copyright is the right allocated to the author and subsequent rightsholders after having made an original work [...]. [...]

The moment a work qualifies for copyright protection the rightsholder -- which generally is the author, but in many a jurisdiction such rights can be transferred -- gets guaranteed certain rights. These rights are summarised in many a different ways, but in the EU are the reproduction and adaptation right; the right to communicate to the public; and the distribution right. The USA however assigns six rights to rightsholders, as found in 17 USC § 106. [...]

These various rights are however not unlimited, and are subject to copyright exceptions. These exceptions are nationally based -- just like copyright itself -- and will differ from nation to nation. Canada has introduced a very special exception in 2012, being the UGC-exception, granting farther limits than most countries currently. The way these exceptions are enacted happen in two types of ways. The US has chosen to use a general exception, fair use of 17 USC § 107, whereas the EU has chosen to create a catalogue of specific exceptions -- in article 5 InfoSoc -- which individual EU member states may choose to implement in their own legal system or not. Should however an exception from the catalogue be implemented in a member state's law, those exceptions will generally still be seen as being harmonised.

For a second work, such as a work of fanfiction, to not infringe upon an older work's rightsholder's rights, the work has to either not be a reproduction in any kind of way, or to qualify for protection by an exception available in the country in question, exceptions such as fair use or parody. Under Canadian law this is considered to be a balancing of rights, with for example parody being a user right, which has to be balanced against the rights of the rightsholder of the older work. Under US and EU law it is too much to say the same, but exceptions are certainly a limitation on the reach and scope of the rights granted to rightsholders. Though this is not to say that (human) rights play no part in such a balancing of rights in the EU and the USA.

Any fanfiction must, for it to not be infringing, therefore not copy enough of the original work(s), or be able to qualify for an exception. As shown in the two case studies, two works -- both of which are Star Trek and Babylon 5 crossover [fanfictions] -- can have surprisingly different end results. Star Wreck can qualify for various exceptions and as such is non-infringing, provided it remains non-commercial. Taskforce 43 however, cannot qualify for fair use in the USA, nor for parody in the EU and Canada. The only exception it may qualify for is the UGC-exception of § 29.21 CCA. "

** You just have to learn how to search properly to filter out what you don't want, it takes some getting used to over the FFN search options and there's a plugin called AO3rdr that lets you blacklist tags so you don't have to set the filters every time but there is some good stuff on there

** I have had the opposite experience. Most of the fanfic I read on AO3 (admittedly not a lot in the Harry Potter fandom) tends to be over-tagged, to the point of ridiculousness.

Although I really appreciate it when authors think "Harry and Ginny are 16 and 15 respectively in Book six. If I have them get a little tipsy and make out at Slughorn's Christmas party, I have to put underage and dubious consent (or nonconsent) warnings".

I don't appreciate it when they have 30 tags that essentially give away the entire plot of what you're about to read.

Some of it is illegal by German law at the very least. We have a penal law which deems the possession of all "realistic" depictions of underage sexuality (below 14) illegal.

Not that OP is not overreacting, but they accidentally have a point.

** I do think that AO3 is essentially just the dumping grounds for the dregs of fanfiction that don't have a place anywhere else. BUT, FFN is hardly the bastion of quality fanfiction that we like to think it is. Every site has heaps upon heaps of bad fanfiction, so it's really hard to draw a line somewhere without seeming hypocritical.

** I have accounts on both FFN and Ao3 and, as a writer, I find Ao3 to be the best available site there is Why? Because tags are extensive to the point where, if you ae not very good at summaries, people can still find and read your story IF you use tags properly.

​

and therein lies the problem.

​

As far as I can see, wrongly tagging a fic has become a problem. You have people who actually don´t tag too much not to spoil a progressing story with major twists- which, IMo is FINE; you have people who apparently does not think tagging is important and yes, you have people purposedly tagging their story wrongly to attract more readers.

​

Now, regarding your rant: there is nothing Ao3, JKR or most of fanfiction writers can do to "solve" this problem. It is up to you, as a reader , NOT to read thos fictions. Believe me, untill I realized how the tagsworked and the kind of people that would abuse it, I read TERRIBlE fics and even then I KNEW that, despite of my opinion, the author had the right to purge all his/hers terrible ideas on paper and that some crazy people out there actually like to read trash.

​

PS: there is also a problem f unmet expectations I myself faced... some readers would try to discuss with me how to tag my fics and had strong opinions about it. So, yes, even if you , as an author, think you are tagging correctly, there will e people thinking you are not.
