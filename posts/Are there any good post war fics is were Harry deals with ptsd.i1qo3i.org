:END:
I always felt like since Harry thought that he would be dead for good he just never confronted his trauma and always pushed it to the back of his mind. So now that the war is over and since living is sometimes harder then dying I would really like recommendations with Harry having to confront this trauma.

The pairing doesn't really matter to me it could also be gen but I really don't want romance to be the forefront of the story if it's possible.

Also a lot of times I've noticed that the characters always act patronizingly toward Harry as if he's still a child when dealing with his vulnerabilities and that really bothers me so I would really appreciate some more mature and nuanced fics.

Also pls no unnecessary character bashing

  The second anniversary of the war dawns on Wizarding Britain and Harry Potter still does not feel anything approaching normal. He had really thought waking from that 24 hour nap after the Battle of Hogwarts would fix him once and for all, but two years on, he's still unable to sleep through the night, so jumpy that his girlfriend is worried about him, and he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life after he failed the psych evaluations necessary to become an Auror. He had never expected to feel perfect two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, not that he knew what that was like, but he *had* expected to be okay.Good thing Harry Potter's well used to disappointment.

** linkffn(Wizards Fall by Bobmin356). Harry is self-destructive and has tried to isolate himself, but the wizards won't leave him alone. Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but I liked it.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  How will Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys' deal with the loss of so many? Everyone is dealing with their own issues so how will they all get there lives back on track while rebuilding Wizarding Britain? Rated M as a precaution. Strong language and disturbing scenes.

** If you're okay with slash / Snarry, linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl) deals with PTSD Harry very realistically. He has trouble sleeping, can't deal with crowded spaces and lashes out at his friends. The way he gradually overcomes these obstacles is moving and believable.

  In which Harry is a tad messed up after the war, but Snape gives him a run for his money. Or: an epic tale of PTSD, recovery and gay porn! (For detailed warnings, please see author's notes.)
