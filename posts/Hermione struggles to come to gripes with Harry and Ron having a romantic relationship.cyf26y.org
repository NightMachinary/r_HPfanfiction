Based on her background,I believe she would some reservations about stuff like that


** I think she's more likely to be an overenthusiastic ally. She seems like the type. She'd probably drown them in embarrassing amounts of sex ed material and shout her support to the rafters. She's probably kept tabs on all kinds of social movements in the Muggle world.

** Like together? Harry/Ron or Harry/Oc Ron/Oc?

I think she'd struggle either way, see book six, but yeah, I agree, she'd struggle to accept Harry and Ron dating especially if she still has her crush on Ron
