  “And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror, look a little closer, stare a little longer, because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit.” --Shane Koyczan, “To This Day”If someone told Percival Graves he'd spend his fortieth year as a fugitive on the run from MACUSA, in the company of an Obscurial, a smuggler, a Legilimens, and a No-Maj, he would've put them in an institution. But now, after a near-miraculous survival of captivity at Grindelwald's hands, he's become a wanted man because he can no longer in good conscience uphold the laws he'd once vowed to protect.This is the story of a man on the run, haunted by more ghosts than he cares to count, on a journey that will span an entire continent. This is the story of how Percival Graves saved Credence Barebone from execution; how he fled New York in Newt Scamander's suitcase; how he got something he never thought he needed: a family. Complete.

  Congratulations, you have been officially reinstated as an Auror in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. It is my hope that you will take seriously this second chance that you have been given.

  Your first assignment will be to accompany Percival Graves to New Orleans under the guise of his mistress and, therefore, the former mistress of Gellert Grindelwald. To the underworld you are to appear to work counter to Graves, but you must obey him in all things related to the case. This is dangerous ground, Miss Goldstein, and I advise you to be careful.

  Keep him safe, and yourself as well.

  Seraphina Picquery,President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/works?fandom_id=7625681][Esama]] has written a bunch. I couldn't really say how good they are because I didn't read them but I like the author's Harry Potter stories so they may be worth a read.

Edit: I just looked through them an none are over 100,000 words. Sorry. The longest is 42,000.
