I'd like to see how the Harry Potter cast would do in a zombie apocalypse (or any type of apocalypse). It could be by anything from magical accident that spreads diseases or a huge battle between two powerful wizards destroying the entire world and leaving survivors to fend for themselves in a harsher world.

I really don't care. As long as it's well written, and is mainly character based.

Any suggestions?

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

  The end of the world has come. Millions dead, magic waning, Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley are the last people left in Britain---left to pick up the pieces of their once great civilisation. Why were they spared? Who is responsible for the death of a nation? These are the mysteries left as a legacy for two lost and lonely people. DH-EWE, character death, non-canon elements

  It's a crazy world torn straight out of a horror movie - the undead roam the earth and destroy everything in their wake. When Harry Potter narrowly escapes a horrible death he finds himself a companion in Tom Riddle - a mysterious, heartless man who doesn't hesitate to take lives to save his own. Savage as the man is, Harry still finds himself enthralled... He quickly starts developing strange needs and feelings.When they decide to finally find a safe place to settle down for a while they encounter dangerous enemies on their path. Tom's past demons come back around to haunt the both of them and it becomes very clear that even after the years they spent together, Harry really doesn't know Tom at all.
