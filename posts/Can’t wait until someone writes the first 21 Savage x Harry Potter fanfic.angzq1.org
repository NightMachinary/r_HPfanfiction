** /After a long day of studying, Hermione walks into the common room to find Savage, the 21st, standing with his back to the door wielding an unknown, albeit familiar item. Being ever so curious, Hermione asks Savage what is in his hand. With his signature monotone voice and murderous look in his eye, Savage simply resonds, “Issa Wand”./

** This makes me wonder if there's any good and badass fanfics about a more gangster version of Harry. I mean american gangster, not the UK version. Alternatively, if there's any buddy cop or dynamic duo sort of fic starring Harry and Ron.

It'd be ideal if, besides these changes, that they were otherwise canon compliant.

  The summer prior to 6th year Harry deals with Tom in a decisive, if accidental manner. That summer Harry gets a girl friend in Susan Bones, and sets about some self improvement. It is after this change to himself he discovers something a bit disturbing about the Wizarding World, something that Hermione Granger is determined to use to her advantage.

Considering the enormous number of Dark!Harry fics, I'm sure that this isn't true.
