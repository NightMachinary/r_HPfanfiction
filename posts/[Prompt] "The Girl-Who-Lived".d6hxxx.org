Alternately, instead of taking up this challenge, if you happen to know of a fic that already meets the requirements, share it with me!

*Year:* Any after 2nd

*Ship(s):* Mostly any, just so more people can work on it, but preferably Harry/Hermione (H/Hr) or Harry/Hermione/Luna (H/Hr/ L), if there are any relationships. Though, Harry/Ginny is obviously possible, and indeed likely with the changes presented here.

*Rating Limit:* None - Author's Choice

*Genre:* Action, Comedy, Drama, Erotic, Erotic Comedy, Horror, Mythology/Folklore, Romance -- Author's Choice, any combination, including forgotten. No slash/yaoi/crack-fics

*Plot Requirements:*

/The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark them as his equal, but they will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies..../

In a twist of fate, Ginny is born exactly 1 year after Harry, on July 31st, "as the 7th month dies". However, her birth mostly escapes notice when Voldemort attacks and kills the Potters, survived by their only son, Harry. While Harry is marked with his scar, and becomes a Horcrux, he is NOT in fact the child of prophecy. Rather, it is Ginny who shall be the child of prophecy, due to the slight change to the prophecy noted above, and marked not as a baby, but in her first year, when Voldemort possesses her.

*Author's story from here:* Where the story goes from there is totally up to the author, but feel free to take this idea in any direction you want! You can go all the way up to the end of Voldemort, or only show how this changes things in the short term, perhaps 2nd and 3rd Year. Totally up to you.

Replace all the "she" with gender neutral pronouns and the sequence of events makes more sense. Dumbledore, knowing the full prophecy, would act differently than in canon. so:

*** That's a good point, and one I hadn't thought of. Good catch.

EDIT: Tweaked the OP to reflect this fix. What are your thoughts on Ginny being the chosen one in this prompt?

**** Is definitely interesting (in a good way). Am a Harmony shipper myself but don't see how this prompt meshes with that well.

***** Which is why I specifically say any ship is good, and even admit Harry/Ginny is the likely one to work, even if I'd still prefer Harmony or Lunar Harmony XD
