** There are too many that do exactly that to know which one you mean. Any further information? Because Harry going back in time to kill LV early is one of the most popular tropes of the fandom, and it is basically all you wrote.

Also, don't worry about the automod message. It has been set up by someone that has no idea what they are doing.

Someone must have posted something inappropriate, it's on all of the HP fanfiction subs I subscribe to.

**** I don't think you know how the auto mod works. You can set it up for your sub as you see fit. In this case it was set up to flag all posts that mention the word "smut" as NSFW. Which is a very basic way to do it. Since it also flags posts asking for "No smut please" as NSFW.

But at least the bot message says it itself:

  This bot is not very smart, so don't be alarmed if you don't think your post actually violates the rules.
