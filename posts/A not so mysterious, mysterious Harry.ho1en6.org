Or request.

Harry was missing for a while and when he returns he is not what people expected. While everyone tries to figure out who Harry is and peice together his past Harry is oblivious but continuously does weird stuff that throws everyone out for example he is oddly good at Calculus, sketches in his free time, somehow knows alchemy but not potions, doesn't know what a magic carpet is.

While everybody is guessing about Harry's past he really had a very normal childhood but he's just a slightly strange and very focused kid.
