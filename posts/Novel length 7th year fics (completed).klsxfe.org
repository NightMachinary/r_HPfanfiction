I'm stuck in covid isolation and decided to re-read through the series and now fancy a 7th year story (preferably in a similar style) to feel like the series carries on. Any recommendations- I don't mind pairing at all but would prefer not too full of angst.

  Harry is called up to Dumbledore's office at the end of his fourth year and told he is to go and live with Severus Snape. Severus does what no one else bothered to doâ€• he takes care of Harry. Watch as Harry flourishes to all that he was meant to be: A Slytherin with a heart of a lion. No slash. Will Harry be able to beat Voldemort and save the people he loves? Read and find out.

** Thanks for recommendations, I will give them a try. I originally meant a story where they return to school after deathly hallows to finish their 7th year if anyone knows a story like that?

*** You may want to request eighth year fics then, because that is what they are generally tagged as.
