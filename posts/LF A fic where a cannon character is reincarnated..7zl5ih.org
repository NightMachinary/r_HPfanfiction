Preferably a cannon character who died during the Marauder's Era. Even though I read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] by Tsume Yuki and find it enjoyable, that is *NOT* what I am looking for.

No time travel or Master of Death kind of thing either. Please no bashing. Just a past character who died and got reincarnated. AU's are okay as well. A good example is like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221773/1/Unlocking-Doors][Unlocking Doors]] by LaRadium where Regulus Black got reincarnated into the Weasley family as Ron's twin brother.

  Regulus Black knew he had forgotten something in the "Let's Defeat the Dark Lord" plan. Well, at least he's able to go back to the land of the living after making an agreement with the god of the underworld. But maybe he'll end up wishing he had never agreed, especially with the wild ride. [Cover image from @upthehillart]

** linkffn(The lie I've Lived) has James merged with Harry but that doesn't seem to be what you're looking for. Also linkffn(Dragon Lily) has Lily put into a coma and wakes up in 2nd year, but also comes with the caveat that Harry is fucking both Lily and Narcissa Malfoy so that might not be your cup o' tea either XD.

  Harry Potter finds himself right in the middle of a raging war - caught between two very ambitious women and two warring sides. The very secrets of magic are coming undone at the seams... and Harry finds himself caught right in the middle of it all. Originally published by WerewolfWarrior on hpfanficarchive.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
