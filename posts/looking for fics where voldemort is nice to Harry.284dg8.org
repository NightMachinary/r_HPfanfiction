** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a dark kingdom]] was pretty interesting.

A world where Voldemort won the war and is obviously a bad guy, but not the over the top evil stereotype from the books.

**** it has a bit of smut (hetero mind you, no slash) in it much later on, but it was surprisingly ok. Normally too much of that destroys my story enjoyment, and yet I look at this story as one of the "highlights" of my fanfic reading.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5957714/1/The-Darkness-Within-The-Rewrite][The darkness within]] has a fairly nice, relatively, Voldemort. First of a trilogy, only the first had Voldemort though.

*** question(s) for anyone - is the rewrite recommended? is the rewrite only of the first or will it encompass the other two? (deepest reflections/ a part of me)

been looking at it as my next possible 'to read' for a while but always pass as I don't want to get caught inbetween rewrites and original stories.

**** The rewrite is mostly identical in content, only for the first one, and is mostly cleaning up grammar and spelling.

***** I appreciate the very quick response! I think I will wait for the rewrite to complete and jump in! :)

****** It was a coincidence that I checked reddit immediately after that, but you are welcome. When I read this, about 6-7 months ago, I simply read the rewrite until the break point, then skipped to the original. However I am an impatient bugger. Your choice, of course.
