** To be honest, it's not really something I've been pondering. Maybe? Does it even matter? Plenty of people go through life without sex, it doesn't make anyone less for it. If Snape legitimately cared (which I doubt), and he never got around to it as a teenager, he probably visited a prostitute at some point.

I doubt he ever fucked Lily, if that's what you're asking. If they did, I don't think he'd have ended up with the Death Eaters, because I could see Lily threatening to leave him way before it event went as far as the explosive canon break-down of their friendship if they were that close.

*** Is visiting a prostitute the worst way to lose your virginity? I just feel like when you finally get down to it with someone you care about and don't perform due to inexperience it would ruin the moment so much. So maybe doing a few practice sessions with someone non-romantically might help.

P.S. Asking for a friend.

**** Depends on multiple factors. I was one of the souls whose father bought their first time when I was 15. That's an experience I don't recommend.

If you're the type who thinks it should be special? Then definitely not. But that's fairly obvious.

However if your first time is something you're anxious over, a prostitute is a decent method of getting past those jitters imo. It won't be awesome probably. But realistically first time sex rarely is. With a prostitute you're in a controlled scenario. You know if you don't perform, worst case you're out max a couple hundred bucks. (It varies wildly depending on region, legality, employee quality, and work performed). Unless the employee is an asshole they won't care. Lot of them try to be nice about it because like any service job repeat customers make the business.

More impractically. Don't think of it as performing. It's just a fun thing to do with someone you care about. Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's just a quick hit of Oxytocin. Focus on having fun with your partner, not the act itself. Sex isn't special. Making each other feel good is, regardless of how it's done.

Or ignore this entirely. I'm just some anon on reddit. Nothing I say matters.

******* Really? /I/ believe that's because he had a deep streak of a conscience, honour, and an understanding of what love was or wasn't. That quote you pasted... from Snape's point of view, it's exactly accurate. He thinks James died because of his faith in Sirius, and he has indeed just ran into the shrieking shack to save Potter, and unlike the sorcerer's stone incident, he is doing it in Harry's plain sight.

My question, you see, was ironic. If you assume Snape is evil and obsessed and entitled, he becomes nonsensical. Why would the Dark Arts and Potions genius (and Slytherin) not use his gift to get what he wants? As for attaining Lily organically, false on both counts, I'm afraid. He never even asked her out. And JKR confirmed that Lily might have chosen him if he had not been drawn to people like Avery and Mulciber.

"Yes. She might even have grown to love him romantically (she certainly loved him as a friend) if he had not loved Dark Magic so much, and been drawn to such loathesome people and acts."

So I guess Snape should have pulled a James and gone on ahead with whatever bullshit he was pulling before, but lied to Lily about it.

Speaking of bitter entitlement:

#+begin_quote
  “What is it with her?” said James, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him. “Reading between the lines, I'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate,” said Sirius. “Right,” said James, who looked furious now, “right ---” There was another flash of light, and Snape was once again hanging upside down in the air. “Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?”

I won't say being a DE and delivering the prophecy was honourable, but it was honourable to spend the rest of his life atoning for these things, saving as many lives as possible, at no benefit to himself.

Dumbles did not have a Dark Overlord phase but a Overlord phase .. he did not trust himself with power due to that and Tom is his problem likely because of no one else that powerful ready to stand up to him and yes I am willing to judge him based on his actions too .. he is as flawed as the rest of them.

The Death Eaters weren't that much more prejudiced than was mainstream, and Sev's been groomed into them by Lucius since he was 11, on top of being abused by his Muggle father and having crimes against him enabled and covered up by the Leader of the OOTP.

I can definitely say he's an honourable man because he is. Snape is the only one who lifts a finger to keep students at Hogwarts safe. He didn't have to take an unbreakable vow, and he didn't have to promise to euthanize Dumbledore, and he didn't have to do anything, including going to Dumbledore in the first place, because all of this meant grave personal danger, but he did it anyway.

You say he did everything he did out of love for Lily. Then he does something that cannot be explained by his love for Lily, to defeat Voldemort. So you're wrong and his main goal was to defeat Voldemort, regardless of Lily. This point is also driven home by Cursed Child, which you can ignore if you want, but JKR didn't.

He definitely had a Dark Overlord phase because Grindelwald was his co-tyrant and Grindelwald is Dark. Not that I care about this classification because it's meaningless. By the logic you present, Snape is more honourable than Harry or Dumbles because Snape could have thrived under Voldemort's reign and Dumbles and Harry couldn't, and yet Snape chose not to.

Snape may have started working for the good guys eventually, but he's a horrible person. Gives off pretty major misanthropic vibes as well. Even if he wanted to be near another person long enough to shag them, it's unlikely they'd be interested.

  Smolly Weasley. Molly is Kermit the Frog in his role as Captain Smollett in Muppet Treasure Island.

  I just had a mental image of Kermit/Smolly in a cross between his captain uniform and a French maid outfit, plus a redhead wig, getting railed over the Burrow's kitchen table by Albus Dumbledore.

  Is miss piggy Albus

  With gonzo as a strap on and rizzo as a beard?

  Gonzo as a strap-on... Like, his head strapped to her crotch, bucking Smolly with the nose? Or with his nose up her to hold him in place, bucking Smolly with Gonzo's back end?

**** Lol no... My version of Snape is in platonic love with Lilly. He's just a human... Faulty and confused. He did what he thought he wanted to do... If nothing else, he tried... Always.

I don't worship his character or anything and definitely don't want to see two of them ending together (if somehow James dies and Lily lives). I'm just a fan of angst and as much as an accomplished occlumen Snape is, he has a lot of potential for angst.

** These are the kind of questions that shouldn't even be asked much less assumed. It's unnecessary. Almost like jkr trying to force inclusivity after years of the books being published. His sex live has absolutely nothing to do with his character. Absolutely nothing is implied on that account. It would be interesting to see how in fics that would be portrayed but honestly- it feels invasive. Making these kinds of assumptions taint the character, his development and everything that is canon.

** This thread is disgusting. I do not understand the obsession some people had with Snape's sexual life.

That said, almost certainly not. As Harry Potter is a children's book series, we get basically no evidence that /anybody/ has had sex unless they have a child. Snape is one of the few exceptions.

Snape loved Lily, truly and purely. Voldemort's downfall came from the fact that he couldn't understand that, and believed him to be both obsessed with her and only lusting after her. (/"he desired her, that was all"/) Snape had to convince him that that was the truth and that he had moved on to be able be an effective spy and get Voldemort to believe he was still loyal. That involves feeding him memories. We do not know exactly how Occlumency operates, and while we do know that one can make fake memories, the only example we see in the books of a modified memory is easy to distinguish as fake. While it is possible that Snape had the skill to do this, it is not certain, and will always have been more risky than just providing him real memories.

And indeed, Voldemort seems convinced that Snape had moved on. /"and when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him-"/

So yes. We have evidence that Snape did indeed had sex, with more than one pureblood woman, for the purpose of being an effective spy. Is this /proof/? No. But it's more evidence than any other adult in the series who has not had a child.

This doesn't mean that Snape had relationships (sex != relationships). I don't believe he would ever willingly enter one unless by some miracle he had survived the end of the war. The specter of Voldemort's return and his return to spying would haunt any potential relationship he might have. Additionally, he doesn't really have the free time for.
