  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** linkffn(11826429) Worthy of Magic- Harry is straight out insane and wants to kill everyone every other chapter. He got REALLY annoying, actually. The little shit needs to calm down.

linkffn(11585823) The Art of Self-Fashioning- Harry is a sociopath and ruthlessly pragmatic. He's completely unhinged as well. I'd recommend this story above WoM, because Harry is actually somewhat likeable in this.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is disappointed by the Wizarding World. A society wielding powers beyond imagination and it is wasted on Politics and Games. A psychotic Harry Potter aims to remind the world what it means to be a Wizard and to judge who is Worthy of Magic and who isn't.
