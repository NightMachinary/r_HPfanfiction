** I go poke around HPFFA every so often, but I'm usually on mobile and its mobile site leaves much to be desired, so I generally stay away from it.

** Used to be Twisting the Hellmouth but they went under construction a few years ago and I have no idea if they're still active... there was MediaMiner? Which primarily had anime and manga fics but also had other fics too. Livejournal, Dreamwidth, tumblr... if you could find them DeviantArt had some people posting fics too. And the discord servers I'm on are primarily for fanfic writers so there's that too

*** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/][TTH]] is still active, but some of the more prolific authors have decamped to other sites due to ongoing issues with certain moderators, issues which in quite a few cases included real-word political views.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9801437/1/Origin-Story][Origin Story]], (Buffy/DC/Marvel Xander-centric-kinda) for example, was targeted by a TTH Moderator because it showed a certain President being too stereotypical. The fact that a few chapters later, the President was shown to have been replaced by an impostor was not seen as a valid reason.

** You can try dark lord Potter forums.

I Personally use space battle forums, or sufficient velocity forums. Not much in the way of Harry Potter, but both have a lot of other sci-do and fantasy fics.

*** Man. That site's been around since at least 2003 and it does't look like it's had an update since.

**** Well, the formatting is not the most sexy, true, but content is constantly fresh. For example it has been the best place to follow the freshest chapters of [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129036]] (finally finished), and (WIP and stuck on the clifhanger, sigh) [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130180]] . Yes, I am a big fan of Northumbrian, and I am not ashamed of it. Given I usually read only EPubs downloaded with [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] I really don't care that much about the web design.
