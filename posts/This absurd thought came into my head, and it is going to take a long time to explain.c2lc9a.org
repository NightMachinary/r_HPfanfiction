Info : Dumbledore's full name is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

In the wizarding world, people who are not close to each other call each other by their last names. Once they become friends they can call each other by their first names.

Could it be that

Acquaintance / enemy of Dumbledore called him Dumbledore

Then a little more friendly and you get to call him Brian.

Then Wulfric.

Then Percival.

Then Albus.

I know this sounds absolutely absurd, but just bear it.


** None of the rando classmates Harry interacts with call him Potter or James. They call him Harry

*** Malfoy calls him Potter. Maybe just enemies then.
