I've been focusing on college, light novels and work over the last 3 years so I fell out of the HP ff scene like 3 years ago even though I was an avid reader. I wanna get back in. What are the must read fics posted over the last 3-4 years? FF.net only lets me view the most reviewed fics posted in the last year and I've never read any fics from AO3. Open to anything not slash or super cringey.


** Harry Potter And the Accidental Horcrux.

People seem to love that one.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter), Linkffn(renascentia: from the ashes), Linkffn(Black Luminary), Linkffn(Grow Young With Me), Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), and Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/1/]]).

Those come with some caveats, though, so in order: Accidental Horcrux is complete with a sequel which very much isn't. The characterisation is great all around, but the plotting is pretty spotty, and it jumps around far too much for my liking. The Many Deaths of Harry Potter has a novel premise that's used fairly well to explore some genuinely interesting scenarios, but it's once again held back by its writing.

Renascentia I just haven't finished; I read the first few chapters, greatly enjoyed them, and decided to come back when it was complete, but I never wound up doing that. I've been meaning to finish it for ages, now, but I just haven't gotten around to it. Black Luminary wasn't written by a native English speaker and it shows: the prose isn't grammatically incorrect, but it /is/ weird and /very/ purple. Plus, the story is kind of, for lack of a better term, anime-y.

I'm pretty sure that Grow Young With Me is more than three years old, so you might be familiar with it, but if not, it's definitely worth a read. I'm recommending Prince of Slytherin not because I think the story itself is particularly good, but because it's so widely discussed and imitated as to be worth familiarising yourself with. Finally, Rent a Hero is a deadfic that ends on a cliffhanger, so while I personally think that what's there is worth reading, that might be a deal breaker for you.

Edit: took the bot about five minutes to link all those fics; longest I've ever seen by a wide margin.

*** Thanks for all the suggestions. I remember reading accidental horcrux a little, I stopped for some reason. I read rent-a-hero to completion (I've read it maybe 4 times now) and it was great even though it's dead. I think my next post will be requesting fics that are dead but definitely worth reading because of what they were before they died.

The rest I'll take a look at. Thanks again.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

** linkao3(5986366) Yes it has a Harry/Regulus tag listed, but over the course of 48 chapters and over 200,000 words there's nothing you'd find that indicates that relationship forming without already knowing of its existence from tag. To quote the author:

 

#+begin_quote
  Also, though I initially said I figured I might as well write something with a pairing for once, the pairing unsurprisingly turned out not the focus of this fic. Any romance will be extremely, extremely slow. The focus is more on the friendships between all the characters tagged in this fic, as made evident in the relationship tags, and the emotions and thoughts and development of the characters, as made evident by the additional tags.

**** For whatever it's worth, I rather like time/dimensional travel and characters from different times/dimensions interacting is something like my pet pleasure (ie opposite of a pet peeve). Including the tension that can be drawn from differences of knowledge between characters (in this case, Harry's knowledge[or lack thereof] of his life and the past/the readers' knowledge of canon vs what Regulus, Lily, James and Sirius know and the precarious balancing acts that happen between all of them.) So therefore this fic appeals to me in spades. Actually, a note on that latter point: there is a companion fic by the same author with alternate PoVs of some early chapters which by its nature helps in fleshing that aspect out.

 

The pace is admittedly slower and while I have no problem with that I understand that others strongly prefer faster/more concise stories. While there are fascinating revelations later in the story, I suppose that if you get through the meeting in the graveyard and absolutely nothing you've read appeals to you it would be fair to set the fic aside.

** These are some of the best stories I've seen in the fandom over the last three years.

Lesser Evils was started earlier and has a rough start but it gets a lot better after. Same with A Beautiful Lie.

Bobika's story has crazy world building in a world where Voldemort won the battle of Hogwarts.Neville PoV but don't let that detract you.

I loved The Never-ending Road in spite of the initially off putting pairing. Harriet x Snape urgh. I don't even enjoy reading romance. It's a bit heavy on the Snape and Narcissa wank but probs the best HHr friendship I've seen. Same with the patronus arc in PoA.

Old Blood is spectacular. Start with that. Or Victoria Potter.

** *Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw*

One of the coolest stories I've read that's been primary written in the last 3 years! Mighty be a bit cringey depending on your defenition of cringey.

Started 4 years ago but still being written, very much alive with a writer that also does an audio book variant and live editing streams.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
