So I've been hard at work creating more sorting lists for the other Hogwarts years. At the moment, spots are open for years 1982-1987, 1989-1990, and 1992-1994.

The end results will look like [[https://kyuubinopuma.tumblr.com/post/183316684699/the-1988-sorting-list-class-of-1995-every-name-on][1988â€²s Sorting List]].

You may be wondering why I'm doing this to myself? 

To which I would answer: 

I don't know. I think I'm too ambitious for my own good, I guess. I want smooth sailing and pantsing has not been helping, so I've taken to plotting now. 

P.S. Fictional names ONLY. I hope I don't need to tell anyone this, but I'm doing so just in case.

***** The Ministers' list is turning out to be a gold mine. Thank you.

Edit:

I now better understand the First Wizarding War's timeline. It began somewhere around 1970s and ended on 1981.

*** Hey, do you happen to know the name of the Witch from the Lake District? She claimed to have dooms day prophecies and died near the end of the 20th century. It can't be Mary Baynes, because she died in the 19th century.

***** Darn. I remember reading about it on a Wikipedia page. I can't remember which village, town, or hamlet it was listed under.

I was writing a fanfic where some Muggle-Born wizards built townships around the British Isles in conjunction with some Squibs and poor orphaned Pure-Bloods. Three of the settlements were located near Scaffle Pike. I'm gonna have to look into my notes from that abandoned story. I never did post it since it's just notes.

The gist of the story was that these Muggle-Borns founded their own hidden society outside the Ministry's jurisdiction. They took in the orphaned, disowned(Squibs), and abused(Muggle-Borns in witch hunting areas).

****** I feel it's worth mentioning that I was alive for nearly a third of the 20th century. I'm fairly sure that the doings and pronouncements of a local prophet would have made the local papers at least, and it's the sort of thing that sticks in the memory.

*** I wonder if Peregrine is international? I actually ended up switching Peregrine Derrick's name around. I couldn't picture a Slytherin having Derrick as a surname, but now that I think about it, it makes sense. I think I'll split the name in two.

I'll definitely use Picquery. Don't think I didn't notice you got it from Fantastic Beasts. Thank you for the suggestion.

** For Muggleborns, you might review popular baby names in the 1970s and 80s in the UK: [[https://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2011/06/1974-to-2009.html]]

I also like the idea that some of these British surnames might be 'rare' in the muggle world because they had a strong magical gene arise in the early-mid 1900s: [[https://blog.myheritage.com/2011/04/rare-british-surnames/]] [[https://blogs.ancestry.com/cm/is-your-rare-surname-about-to-go-extinct/]]

And this is just a great list of UK surnames: [[https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/christian/fairnames/surnames.html]]

That said, I like Otto, Barnaby, Victor, Asher, Atticus, Edmund, Fletcher, and Hector for boy names, and Clara, Cora, Felicity, Louisa, Maggie, Nell, Pippa, Sadie, Tabitha, Verity, Vivienne and Thea as girl names.
