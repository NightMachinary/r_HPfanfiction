So, Lily was pregnant, very close to giving birth when Voldemort killed her.

Because of lovemagic! and love, the baby was able to survived for a bit in the womb, at least long enough for Someone to save her.

Someone for reasons! decide that she can't grew up with Harry, so the baby girl was given for adoption, to be loved and care for to a nice, kind and loving family, who desesperatly wished for a girl.

No one but that person knows about Ginny being a Potter. The Weasleys accepted the baby, without knowing where she came from. They just find her, on their doorstep, with just a note asking them to take care of her, and to love her like their own.

Since the Potters were in hiding, very few people actually knew that Lily was pregnant.

The one who knew thought the baby died with Lily, and just didn't talk about it, for reasons!.

Flash-forward 15 years later. SOMEONE learns that Harry and Ginny started dating and seems to really be in love...

OOPS ! Or not.

So, this just popped in my head. You can take add everything and anything and leave anything from it, but the core idea that Ginny and Harry are siblings but didn't know (or will never find out, if that's how you want to play it).

SOMEONE can be good or bad, or both. Their motives for doing this can be good or bad, or both.

You can treat it as crack, or as seriously.

I'd love to see how people can spin this.


** Strictly no incest, but I was working on something similar: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bevfuu/lf_harry_ginny_are_brother_and_sister/][prompt]] and working on the actual execution [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][here]] ([[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/_build/html/][old version]]).

** I've seen a fic or two where Dumbledore took Harry's little sister and gave her to the weasleys with maybe some memory charms? Can't remember what stories though.
