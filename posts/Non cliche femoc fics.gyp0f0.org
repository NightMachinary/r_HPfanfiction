basically I don't want the typical go-to-hogwarts-and-immediately-fall-in-love-with-harry-or-draco. I would like it set during the golden era, I just don't want the main MC to be tag along on the golden trios adventures without her own plot and development if she is friends with the trio.

I'd love some worldbuilding, I mean witches are by far not the only beings you have, you have vampires, veelas, sirens etc and I barely see anything of that part of the HP universe being mentioned in any fic I've read. Hell, maybe the MC could be a half breed? or a muggle? Or a plain witch. The fic What's her name in Hufflepuff is a good example, with the exploration of minor characters, Hufflepuffs in general and even featuring a made up wizarding pop band Charmed4U, exploring the fact that wizards do have a pop culture after all.

TL;DR: a well rounded OC that's life doesn't revolve around romance or the main events of the golden trio.


** This is the exact idea that's been floating in my head for years... time to get started on that!

** It sounds like you're looking for a more slice of life that explores world-building a lot, right? While linkffn(three black birds) isn't a literal match for your request, I think it also fits in a lot of ways. Feel free to drop it if it's not your thing, but I think it could work. Harry is still a main character, but because it's WBWL, he's honestly more of an OC. The main events are still definitely there, but in a way kore background way IMO

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Well, it's probably not what you were expecting, but linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) absolutely fits and is an amazing fic.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** I'm not sure that this would fit exactly, as Draco is the main pairing with her, but it definitely fits her not just being a tag along at least past the fourth year segment, she has a life and friends and her own mentor figures, while still having a fair bit of action and adventure. I should add that the whole romance part starts about 1/3 of the way through, and any romance before that you know is casual and not really serious, just a teenage girl taking someone to a ball.

  Like every sister, I love my brother no matter what. Even when he's an idiot. Even when he's in the spotlight and I'm forever waiting in the wings. That's life as Lorena Potter. Can't complain, really. At least I don't have a psychopath out for my head. OC-centric DracoXOC
