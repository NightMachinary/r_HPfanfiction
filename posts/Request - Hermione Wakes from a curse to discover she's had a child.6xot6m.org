Hello, I've read a few fics where Hermione wakes from a curse to discover she has a child that she didn't know about, like in The Potion Master's Baby on AO3. In so many of the stories, she embraces having a child, no questions asked. Well, I'm looking for one like that where she rejects the child, especially if the child came about without her consent, like what happened in Potion Master's Baby. Any suggestions?
