Hi all, I am looking for an enthusiastic and hands on Beta reader for a (Post D.H) SS/HG story.

I'm looking for someone willing to go on this ride with me from go to whoa. Starting from an outline through to a finished novella.

This is a project I'm hoping to smash over Camp NaNoWriMo, so I'm really hoping someone out there would be willing to help out with quick turn around of 72 hours or less per chapter - I won't need total tear downs or huge coverage just highlighting run on sentences or "telling not showing".

Happy to reciprocate.

Cheers!
