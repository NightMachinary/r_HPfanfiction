**** That said, it is a bit less understandable if you actually get that there's a theme naming going on in the Weasley family, with a kingly theme. Once you get that, it's easy to get that “Guinevere -> Ginevra”, whereas “Guinereve” very much is not a thing.

And it all boils down to people not researching the characters they write about properly. Which is kind of sad.

Ron raping and murdering Hermione just because she has an unrequited crush on Harry? Vernon raping Harry because /clearly/ the Dursley's aren't abusive enough? That kind of shit doesn't fly.

*********** It is a Japanese comic, I feel better not making assumptions about the genre based on a single panel, especially what with the fact that it likely is translated by fans so even a serious comic can get a weird panel occasionally. Heck, I know there's at least one (seemingly somewhat serious) translator who occasionally does basically troll jobs instead of serious translations.
