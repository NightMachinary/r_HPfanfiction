I want to read something tragic and depressing.

Death Eaters are far more brutal and murderous and do not hesitate to kill all of Harry's friends one by one during their fight in the Halls of Prophecies. In the end Harry is the only one who survives. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna are all dead. Of course Sirius still dies too ...

What comes after, how will Harry cope? Will he be able to cope? Guilt over dragging them to their death, will he seek bloody revenge or to at least attempt to? Will surviving Weasleys blame Harry?


** Oh my god that'd be horrible. Holy flying /fuck/. That's an interesting idea, and if I have time I'll definitely try it. Thanks

** In a way, that's what should have happened.

If he doesn't kill himself or in a suicidal way immediately, I can definitely see him going mad and all out for revenge.

When he eventually learns that he's last the Horcrux, he will not offer himself up for execution, but will strap himself with enough Muggle bombs and magical explosives before challenging Voldemort for a duel. Then he blows everything into smithereens within a 500 meter radius.

Once in after life, he says his mission was accomplished and sorry to his friends. They all forgive him and go on happily together into their afterlives.

Meanwhile in Britain, Dumbledore still lives, and if he has learnt any lessons (which I hope), he will finally stop manipulating his (Ex) students to do his dirty work and take the lead himself. He can use the last decade of his life to thoroughly cleanse Wizarding Britain from all remaining Death Eater filth.

** I can't even imagine how his scene raging at Dumbledore would be here. He'd probably strangle the Headmaster.

*** Emotion and shock can express itself in many ways. He might be so utterly out of it that he'd be completely despondent ...
