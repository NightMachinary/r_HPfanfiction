I was thinking about a fic that I think would be cool.

SO it goes like this:

Fred and the reader are close, then one day they get in a big fight, Fred saying that girls couldn't prank as good as he and George, but Reader is stubborn, so when she says she's going to make an all-girl (Including transgender ofc) club, she does.

She goes all out too, even calling the club The Hunters of Artemis. (HoA)

But like, instead of swearing off boys, they swear to prank boys, and it's really cute.

So like, it's like a second generation of Marauders but bad-ass girls and Hogwarts is going crazy of all of this, and just want Fred and Reader together. (There's a money pool going around including the full of HoA (except Reader), George, and the teachers)

â€‹

So, one day while they're pranking the twins (mostly Fred), it goes haywire, and Reader and Fred kiss.
