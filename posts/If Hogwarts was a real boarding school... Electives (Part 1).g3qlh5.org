Basically, I've been thinking a lot about Hogwarts and how it runs as a school with a wizarding population that could support the infrastructure that seems to exist in the books (i.e. much larger than suggested by Rowling).

In this installment, I will be discussing the ELECTIVES I would want added to the curriculum.

There would be more electives, and additional electives at higher levels.

Introduced at lower levels - ART: which would start off as tools/techniques/craft and basic enchantment and slightly more complex enchantment as of the complexity of the art increases, languages (e.g. french, German, Italian) with aspects of cult ural differences and history thrown in.

PERFORMANCE: drama, dance and music both theory and performance. Magical performance such as crafting, casting and interacting with Illusion. A lot of the magic would be related to stagecraft such as lighting, props, costume and makeup.

Some trade based units which at schools I taught in were Under the umbrella of 'TECH'. This would include things like woodworking, metal working and textiles basically, like art it would start of with tools and techniques and simple enchantments and then move into more complex ones. As students move up the years classes would become more specific to the type of tech. E.g. in second year, students do one semester each of wood working and food technology, and then in third year they do a semester each of textiles and metal work. Then in fourth year students pick what they want to do specifically and work towards owls and newts.

THE WIZARDING WORLD - a kind of emalgamation of social studies type things where they would learn about economics, legal studies, geography etc as it applies to the wizarding world.

For upper years: HEALTH AND HEALING - a basic introduction to healing but with more emphasis on health and development, it would cover items like reproduction, puberty, anaerobic and aerobic exercise, disease, cellular function and healthy human function, and then move into health and Healing as it applies to population Dynamics. Throughout the years students would also learn both muggle and magical first aid of increasing levels of complexity.

WARDS AND CURSEBREAKING - students learn the application of charms, runes, potions and Arithmancy as it applies to long term defense of an area and then methods of detection and removal of wards and curses.

ALCHEMY - basics of transmutation and elemental studies. Would be mainly theoretical with a lot of philosophy about the nature of the self, soul and universe. Would essentially cover the very basics of European and eastern alchemy.

Two additional core subjects: MATHEMATICS - mostly as it applies to reality so calculating area and volume, percentage, financial things like managing a budget, ratios and very simple algebra. COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION - essentially an 'English' unit. A lot of subjects have students write essays but there is no class that teaches students how to write with different purposes or articulate arguments.

The other core subjects would stay the same as they provide the most basis for the electives (possibly with the exception of Herbology)

I don't really want to add too many muggle elements as Wizarding Britain is mostly apart from Muggle Britain and I like the idea that Wizards don't have an ounce of logic so wouldn't really get Muggle sciences and things. Each class should have some kind of Magical application to it.

Let me know what you think? Are their any electives I've missed?

Next time I'll be covering - Co-curricular activities


** From your use of the word 'semester', I'm guessing you're American?

*** Nope! I am from a state in Australia where there are 4 terms which are organised into 2 semesters. They often do handover of the electives at the end of the semester. The books seemed to have two teaching periods separated by a holiday break at around christmas, so I used semester as its the term I am most familiar with.

I actually don't have any familiarity with American schools or curricula.

**** Ah, okay. I didn't know they used Semester in Australia too.

It's just that electives are waaaay less of a thing in England than people's interpretation of Harry Potter sometimes suggest. eg. At my secondary school, we had eight core subjects and only got to choose three 'electives' for our GCSE, and my A-Level College had no electives, just core modules for the A-Level and about a dozen clubs (film club, science club, art club, etc), for example. Adding too many does risk falling into the 'class credits' system the Americans have.

***** I think that a lot of schools have more Core subjects than are offered at Hogwarts, and a bunch of others have electives within the Core units. For example, One of Eton's blocks requires students to study English, maths and then one or two selected from a bunch in a particular category e.g. 1 or 2 modern language from a selection, 2 of three choices of science, 1 of a selection of 'creative' subjects etc.

A lot of schools bundle electives into blocks so students will have core classes and then three blocks to choose electives from.

I like to imagine that the wizarding world functions primarily in a guild mastery sort of system and Hogwarts Upper classes would provide students with the opportunity to have foundation knowledge in these areas...

****** That was kind of what I was trying to say. You'd have certain absolute core subjects you needed (ie. the magical version of the STEM classes), then some core classes you could vary up (eg. the magical version of a single 'Science Class' vs three separate classes in 'Chemistry, Physics, and Biology'), and then three blocks of electives.

And to the best of my knowledge - though I admit it's been awhile since I looked at primary sources, just my notes made for making guilds in D&D games - a Guild Mastery system in traditional England was sort of a mix of our modern Apprenticeship system (young untrained learns from institutional-knowledge-having and experienced older teacher) and the Degree/Doctoral-exam system in certain subjects where you have to create something semi-original to prove your knowledge (eg. for my psych bachelor's degree, I had to create and run my own original study). You'd get trained on the job as an apprentice, then once your teacher felt you were able to work on your own/had learned everything they could teach you, they'd make you prove it with a test and if it was good they'd make you a journeyman, then you'd have to create something Original to become a Master.

I'd recommend you maybe make a thread asking whether your system would work/be Brit-pickedly appropriate first, otherwise you're just coming up with a lot of ideas that you might not end up using. And I know there are actual teachers from England here in the sub, so you'd get better answers on that than I could provide having only been a student and assistant lab tech.

*** I don't think it really matters though, the point was that for the tech subject, students would rotate through the options before choosing to specialise.

**** Fair enough. It's just really not how we'd do things in England, but if you're not looking to be overly Brit-picky, it's workable. :)

I would say that 'Wizarding World' would be a core subject - the 'Muggle' version is a compulsory subject IRL.

***** You are correct, it is very easy to find this information online, and we're I to plan this out properly I would do a lot more research. I was initially only writing my thoughts down on what additional subjects I think would fit the school based on the other things that are in the world.

For example, portraits and art feature heavily in the books, yet there is no art class. I was mainly trying to fill what I saw were inconsistencies.

****** Ah, okay. My apologies for the misinterpretation. Well, I think you've got a good range to start with - I'd maybe check out other magic systems for more ideas of what Rowling's rather lax system and even more lax details doesn't cover.

I'd probably add something about foreign magics (World Magics, maybe?) to teach how they do things in other cultures. Could link in a bit of geography and sociology there too.

Personally, I'd have a separate Runes class for practical application while Ancient Runes is just languages - given how intensive an actual living-language course can be, learning a set of dead languages would be waaaay more difficult, especially for someone who speaks a language where Fish and Ghoti can be pronounced the same.

Probably some kind of coding/chaining class where students work to put spells together to make new effects (eg. Wingardium Leviosa plus Lumos = Floaty Light).

I'd add in a 'theoretical/esoteric magic' class where students examine new ideas and unusual stuff.

Definitely some kind of physical education class - one sport with eight players is not enough to keep a whole school healthy, no matter how many stairs the place has. :D
