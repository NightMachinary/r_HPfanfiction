Can be any kind of Healer.

Anyone can be the MC/Any Site/Any Length/Old or New.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

No Weasley Bashing. No Stories where Weasley's are using Harry for his fame and money cliche.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes etc. Doesn't have to be focused on a pairing.


** Try Beginning of a New Life by rlpj4 it's a time travel fic that has Harry and Daphne learning lots of skills with Healing being a major one. I don't recall any specific Weasley bashing though I do recall where Harry gets pissed off at Molly due to the "timing" of her "interference".

** linkffn(Healer Harry - A Fanfic by SalTalStudios) has Harry as a healer, but it's a crackfic where he basically acts like House. I found it very entertaining. It updates regularly, but it's also very episodic, so it would have a satisfying ending even if the author abandoned it.

linkffn(Basilisk-born by Ebenbild) Harry becoming a healer is a relatively small part of the story, but it does seem to keep popping up.

I know there have been posts asking for healer Harry stories before, so you might find some good options by searching the sub.

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

** [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=araceil&sort=title][Against my Nature]] by Araciel. Harry accidently time travels to the 1940s. He runs away to africa to avoid messing up the timeline, but he meets Newt Scamander and gets mixed up in a magical creature adventure. Very good.

Part of the story is that all parseltongues are natural healers, but because of his upbringing and the horcrux, Harry's healing talent is permanently damaged... But as a result he learns about Muggle healing, and invents new ways to help People.

Story was deleted of FFNet so the link is to FF2EBook.

** Well, linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has an interesting take on that. Harry doesn't personally have any great interest in healing, but ends up learning a fair bit about it because she's pretending to be her cousin, who is passionate about it. She gets to the point where the two of them work side by side to save someone's life when he's stabbed and poisoned. There's also the Revolutionary Arc spinoff series, which includes a book from Archie's point of view, linkao3(From America With Love by kitsunerei88).

Actively updating, but sometimes with long gaps between chapters, because the chapters are /huge/. There's definitely no Weasley bashing, the Weasleys are great. (Ron is initially suspicious of Harry just for being in Slytherin, but he doesn't take long to come around.)

Edit: Ugh, the bot grabbed the wrong book from the Revolutionary Arc, but it's still the right series, so you should be able to track it down from there.

  Alexander Willoughby is not entirely human. Some would say he is entirely inhuman, but it is with an entirely human sense of curiosity that he sits down beside Aldon Rosier in their very first Magical Theory class. (Liar Liar)

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
