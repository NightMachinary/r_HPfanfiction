I really like reading about the characters stories after DH, their childrens lifes, etc. If the stories can be nice and long that would be great. Here is a link to little0bird: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird]] I would like it to stick to cannon or stay close to it as much as possible. Thank you in advance.


** If you liked little0bird then you will love any story by [[http://m.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian.]] They are all actually based in the same universe and he has a list on his profile of them in chronological order.

I would suggest starting with:

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days]]

#+begin_quote
  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. The following day Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals. Grave Days.
#+end_quote

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5521420/1/Aurors-and-Schoolgirls][Aurors and Schoolgirls]]

#+begin_quote
  The wizarding war is over. Harry & Ron are in London, Auror training has begun. Ginny & Hermione are at Hogwarts School. Do these parted pairings have divergent destinies? When, where, & how can these separated souls meet?
#+end_quote

And my favorite:

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]]

#+begin_quote
  The locals in a sleepy corner of the Cheviot Hills are surprised to discover that they have new neighbours. Who are the strangers at Drakeshaugh?
#+end_quote

Happy Reading!!!

** I think seeker68's [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][Learning to Live Again]] is one of the most amazing post-war fics I've ever read. It also has a great sequel, [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][31 Bottles]].
