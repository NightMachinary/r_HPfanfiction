I haven't read as much fanfiction as some have I know but dear God I can't seem to find any fic to read that don't have bashing, are of good length 100k+, (preferably Harry as main character) somewhat AU/Canon Divergent, and not a list of overused tropes. I feel like I spent an hour or two searching for something, only for it to dissolve into bashing, follows Canon exactly, end up abandoned, or turn into the most outlandish MoD!Harry Lordwhatever!Harry with child politicians, Harems, etc. I don't know maybe I just am picky but I feel like when I started reading fanfiction there was a new intriguing story a few clicks away and now I haven't read a story past a few chapters in days. Sorry for the rant, if anyone can help me I'd love you forever lmao

** If you don't mind self recs I have a female Slytherin Harry series that is canon divergent that I've gotten some good feedback on (people seem to like it)

Linkao3(Swiftly Falling Snow)

If you don't mind Hermione centric fics, I suggest The Arithmancer by White Squirrel. It's also canon divergent and has a lot of good ideas.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

No bashing, and that is what i love the most about this fic. It is written from Tom Riddle's POV and Dumbledore is in character, as is everyone else, and somehow no bashing so far.

The premise is Voldemort goes back in time and raises himself. Tom is very, very well done and so is Voldemort. Story is at 100k, but still in pogress, author updates frequently. Grammar is solid, the pacing is great and the concept is unique. From all the Harry/Hermione/Dumbledore etc going back in time to change Tom for the better, this has never been done. Voldemort goes for him, without any intention of raising him to be a "good boy" and it is just fascinating and so refreshing,

Sirius decides to break up Petunia's marriage so he can marry her and raise Harry, but still offer him the protection of the blood wards. Sadly, it has only three chapters and it hadn't been updated in a long time, but it was also a unique concept, as far as I am aware.

** I've been rereading bits of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series lately, because book four updated after six months (just one chapter to go!). It's very AU, diverging 40 years earlier when Tom Riddle decided to pursue politics rather than war, resulting in a very different landscape by the time of the story. Lots more characters are alive and/or healthy, including all the Marauders, the Longbottoms, the Lestranges, and Riddle himself; several of them have children who didn't exist in canon, such as Caelum Lestrange and Arcturus Black. However, there is more legalised oppression/segregation of muggle-borns and half-bloods, excluding them from government work (with a lot of the private industry following that lead) and banning them from Hogwarts.

Harriett herself, having been raised by both parents, is a very different person, but quite interesting in her own right. She has a deadpan sense of humour, is very driven, and passionate about potion brewing; there's no real question of this Harry going anywhere but Slytherin, and she's happy about that, because she greatly admires Severus Snape. Who is still sharp, harsh, and demanding, but not /quite/ as jaded as in canon (because Lily is alive) - unless you happen to be a Marauder.

The plot itself has nods toward canon, but it feels like the author started with a whole new storyline and merely drew some inspiration from canon elements, rather than using canon as a starting point. With Riddle never dying and Sirius Black being an upstanding member of society, the first and third years are very different indeed. And even when something is recognisable, like the Diary, it's almost always significantly expanded and reworked.

There's a potential pitfall (personally, I wasn't bothered), in the fact that Harriett is much more skilled and powerful than canon Harry. For me, it didn't disrupt the storytelling, because a) quite a bit of it is justified by her having known about magic from an early age (and there's no underage restriction on potion brewing), plus having a strong work ethic when it comes to achieving her goals; and b) when she's genuinely exceptional, such as having unusually large magical reserves, it creates as many problems as it solves, both raising her profile (which endangers her ruse) and making her a target for those who want to control her or steal her magic outright.

There's no character bashing; even Riddle himself is commendably complex. Voldemort, on the other hand, is a psychopath, but that's canon.

It's Draco/Harry and is more Draco than Harry-focused (it's actually in the 1st person) but still absolutely worth reading. Draco is living in New York 12 years after the war when his and Harry's lives interconnect. This is the story that made me realize fan fiction can be great quality storytelling.
