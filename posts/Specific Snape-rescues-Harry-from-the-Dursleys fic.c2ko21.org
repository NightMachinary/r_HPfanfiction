:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
My all-time favourite example of the trope, but I can't seem to find it anywhere, no matter what I google. Hopefully I haven't confused two fics and that's throwing off my results. Here's everything I can remember about it:

- Snape overhears Harry talking to himself/the memory of his mother shortly before the end of the school year, I think on top of the astronomy tower? Or maybe just outside. Anyway, what Harry alludes to gives Snape an inkling that something is not quite right at the Dursleys'. Snape worries that he is failing Lily.
- Snape follows Harry back to Privet Drive from King's Cross. On the way there, the Dursleys refuse to help Harry with his luggage so Snape casts feather-light on his trunk without betraying his presence.
- Snape finds out that the Dursleys are awful, takes Harry away from the Dursleys, as this trope typically goes.
- I think Harry lives in Snape's quarters at the castle for most of the fic.
- A recurring issue early on is that Snape is providing e.g. clothes and food for Harry and Harry keeps offering to pay for it all (since the Dursleys always made him feel like a financial burden) and Snape is like "what the heck you're a kid, no you're not expected to pay for things". I remember Snape buys Harry a nice coat.
- Lupin and Sirius are also in the fic, Harry visits them a couple times but there's a lot of tension between Harry and Sirius because Harry finds out that James was a dick and Sirius makes excuses for him. At one point Harry comes back through the floo to Snape's, unscheduled, and that's a big deal for some reason.
- At one point they go to the beach, ostensibly to gather some potions ingredients, but later at a staff meal it's suggested that there was a much easier way to get the ingredients and Snape was being secretly nice, oho.
- Harry gets a gift of a practice snitch.
- At one point Harry has Ron & Hermione visit the castle during the summer. By this time Harry and Snape can stand to be in each other's company but they pretend to still be at odds, because Snape is still a spy for Dumbledore. This comes back when school starts back up, and Harry is miffed about it but ultimately understands the reason for it.
- I think at some point Harry gets injured because someone curses him or pushes him while he's on a flight of stairs and he... maybe hits his head? And Snape is very upset about it because by this point he considers Harry as good as his son. This isn't one of those fics where Harry's actually his biological son, though.
- At another point Harry gets abducted and Crucio'd and for some reason some Hogwarts staff, including Dumbledore and Snape, can hear what's going on where Harry is, though they are still at Hogwarts. There is a lot of yelling from Snape.
- At the end (or maybe in a post-fic short sequel? I can't remember whether this fic was finished, I think it was finished but there was a planned sequel that never got off the ground) Snape finds out that Harry has to die to take down Voldemort.

You'd think with that amount of info I'd be able to just google the thing but so far, no dice. Would appreciate any help you can offer.

*** I actually found it, because of course I did, once I finally give in and ask for help lol.

So Close by Halfbloodprincess21: [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=3040&chapter=1]]

So far not quite as good as In Care Of but I enjoy the tropes just as much as the first read.
