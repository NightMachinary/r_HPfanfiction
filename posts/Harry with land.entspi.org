Looking for fics where Harry either inherits or purchases property, and actually does stuff with it (leaving Dursley's to live there, setting up a farm, growing potions ingredients, etc. etc).

Here are some examples that I've read and enjoyed:

- Dobby's Deceit: he purchases a cottage and a field to live in & grow fruits/vegetables (magic ones duh) with money from the sale of the basilisk.

- Cupboard Series: he inherits (and maybe purchases too) land that he then uses it as a safe haven / school.

- House of Potter Rebuilt: he doesn't really do much with his land here but there's still plenty of time focused on rebuilding his family home and whatnot. Also camps out there over the summer.

Bonus points if no one else knows about the land, a la Dobby's Deceit where he has to do it all in secret (save for his trusted advisors / goblins / Sirius, cause what's a trope without more tropes) in case evil-Dumbledore wrests control away from him.


** Personally, my favourite 'Harry owns property' fic is probably Witches of Westfield. It's not so much about the property as it is about the things he does with it and the outcomes of those things, but it's pretty good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11071872/1/Witches-of-Westfield]]

There's also Novocaine, where Harry comes into ownership of a hydroponic winery in Australia.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine]]

One I find interesting is either Passageways or Charon. I know they both have the Nightshade family being a thing, but I can't for the life of me remember which one deals with estates and has a town of Nightshades that Harry looks after. Fair warning, both feature a collection of typical Indy!Harry tropes and I mostly enjoy them in the same way I enjoy B-Movie horror/action movies and schlocky comedy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12880185/1/Charon]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8378840/1/Passageways]]

There's also a couple of Robst fics that deal with Harry buying property, but I don't particularly want to link those. Same with the myriad 'Harry inherits a million things'/'Harry finds Potter, Black, or Emrys property has been wrongfully hidden from him and he gets angry before living on it for a while' Indy!Harry fics.

  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?

** One of the best I have found is Harry Potter and the Harem War by Radaslab. It is as the title says a harem fic, something I have mostly moved away from, but I still quite enjoy this one. The Harem and a fight against Dumbledore is part of it but the biggest part is about an entire island/country Harry inherited and it really goes in-depth with a back story for House Potter. It's almost 750k in length but it is unfortunately unfinished as well. I definitely recommend it if you haven't read it or rereading it if you have.

** There was a quite popular fic where Harry buys a land in Africa (it was a bit crossover, I think?), the seller was relieved because nobody was buying it for a while because it was really dangerous there. Harry harvests ingredients from wild animals and has a garden and exchanges letters with Sirius, I think. I clearly remember the part where Snape sees the new potions ingredients catalogue, gets shocked by quite low prices, wants to order many of these things but there's a tax added on the cheque saying smth like "greasy git tax - N galleons"

Don't remember the name though

** Providing links from original post.

The first one (Dobby's Deceit) I'd never heard of, but I found it and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088][here's the link]] ^{(AO3}).

The second is on FFN and the first story is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Series-1-The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs][found here]] (the series is complete with 7 parts, go to the Author page to find them).

The third ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][House of Potter Rebuilt]]) is also on FFN and complete.

Moving to mild self-promotion, in the first of the Kal-El!Harry stories ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][The Last Mage Of Krypton]]) I wrote, Harry has the Pottery rebuilt and upgraded hugely (with the Fortress of Solitude as its basement). He later invests in Tegg's Nose (Yes, it exists, it's the site of a former quarry) where he has come caves expanded and outfitted as a Wizarding village/shopping district with switching-room links to Diagon and Hogsmeade. Sirius joins in the fun by turning one of the Black Family islands into a [[https://www.deviantart.com/honorablebaldy/art/Regulas-Park-741563828][magical theme park]]...

​

Harry has an OBSCENE amount of land in this one. I'm talking Newt Scamander levels of land. Mind you, this was before Fantastic Beasts came out too. He effectively has his own country? State? Dutchy? Anywho, he has farms, animals, Elf Villages, sports, houses. The sequel looks to be abandoned though. But the first story is worth reading in any right.
