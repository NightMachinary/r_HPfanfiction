Bellatrix becomes Harry's follower or believes him to be real Voldemort. She gets to hogwarts where she polyjuices as Madam Pince. One of the chapters had her dueling Moody, when he attacked Harry and friends (it is Dumbledore bash). Harry and company ride a basilisk out of great hall.

****** Nah. I would not recommend anything by PL. And this one goes over the top. They (Harry and co) kill Dumbledore and Snape pretty frequently. Become Fae. Time travel to save Lily. Get Trelawney to rule a country. Too much.

********** I'll take it! It's like each Dumbledore commented at the same time not realizing the others were as well, well, one slightly slower Dumbledore. He was having a more troublesome day obviously.
