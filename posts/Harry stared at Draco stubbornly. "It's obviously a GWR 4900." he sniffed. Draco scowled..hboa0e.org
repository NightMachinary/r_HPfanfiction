"I knew you had no taste, sitting with the Weasel, but I didn't know you were daft as well. The Hogwarts Express is most definitely a Pere Marquette 1225." Draco replied coolly. Ron, who had prepared to defend himself from the latest insult, looked totally lost at the course this conversation had taken. "Idiot! The Pere Marquette 1225 is an 2-8-4 Berkshire type. Did you not even look at the wheels? If anything, this is clearly a 4-6-0, like the GWR 4900." Harry sneered. At that point, Hermione came back into the cabin. "Are you two fighting? You'll be in trouble before school even starts!" she said bossily.

"Stay out of this, Granger. This argument is of the utmost importance. Just because Malfoy is too dim to tell the difference between a 4-6-0, like this train, and his imaginary 2-8-4, doesn't mean I'm going to sit back and listen to his nonsense!" Harry snapped. "Blind as a bat, Potter? It's clearly a Pere Marquette 1225!" he fired back. Hermione blinked. "You're fighting about... trains? What are you, 5? You should be ashamed of yourselves." Hermione sniffed. Harry looked ashamed, but Draco was enraged. "What does a girl know about trains anyway? Butt out!".

Ron and Harry gasped, and stepped forward, ready to defend her honor, but Hermione shot them a look. She could handle this. Turning to Draco, her eyes narrowed and lips pursed, she set a truly impressive sneer on her face. As Malfoy paled, she began to speak in what was, for her age and size, a very terrifying voice. "In my house, there is a room. Before my childhood, it was the upstairs master bedroom. In this room is a large table, room to stand, and the rest of the room is floor to ceiling bins. Bins full of model trains. I have studied all of them, from the pilot to the boxcar. I have blueprints, history books, technical manuals, some historical documents my Daddy bought at auction. I've studied all of those, too." Hermione growled at him, slowly advancing on the now terrified boy.

Draco whimpered. "If I wasn't doing schoolwork or reading a book, I was at my club. Did you know, Muggles actually have clubs for train enthusiasts? I've visited rail museums in the United States, Spain, France, and Germany. I was once awarded Miss Boxcar of Crawley, though that was before my hair got so bushy." she grinned, now truly in his personal space. "Now, what were you saying?" Hermione got into his face. Draco could only shake his head, too terrified to speak. "Excellent! That's what I thought. Now, we'll be arriving soon. I suggest you return to your compartment.".

They rushed out without another word. Turning back to the original occupants, Hermione was shocked to see a look of adoration and a goofy grin on Harry's face. "What?" she snapped irritably. "Do you really have a massive train collection?" Harry asked giddily. Hermione relaxed; he was interested in a fellow train enthusiast, and it was kinda cool to be stared at like a goddess for once. "Indeed. I still remember the day I got my first one. My Aunt Gertrude has hearing loss, you see, and she thought I was named Harvey..."


** Little did they know, thanks to a glamouring jinx (was Peeves involved? Who knows?), the Hogwarts Express appeared ever so slightly different to everyone.
