** Many many angsty teens wrote stories with suicidal and/or cutting Harry. You might try just using a tag search on AO3.

But don't just do a Google search for "Harry Potter is a cutter" because that will just get you +hundreds+ thousands of 3d-printed cookie cutters.

** I dont know if this fic I worked on is what you are looking for. Harry does attempt suicide towards the end but it might not be what you want

** I think my vote would go to linkao3(Sing a requiem) where Hermione realises that Harry is a horcrux in 6th year and horrified that he's so accepting of martyrdom, kidnaps him away from Hogwarts and Dumbledore with Ron's help.

Harry's journey from a groomed child martyr to finding self-love and discovering that life is worth living and fighting for, /that he's worth it/, his friends' horror and anger on his behalf is very very touching.

Especially in a fandom that fetishizes child soldiers and martyrdom and that what happened to Harry in canon was not only good but necessary, this story is a breath of fresh air.

  Harry is a Horcrux, isn't he? Hermione reads over what she has of her essay so far, ignoring the way her hands have started to shake. She circles some sentences here and there that she thinks might be stronger in a different part of the paper. Don't be silly. What a strange thought to have. Anyway.  Anyway.  During 6th year, Hermione has a realization that Harry is a Horcrux while doing some homework in the library. Things spiral out from there.

** Harry self-harms in a Year Like None Other, but not until quite a bit of plot has happened, it's a long fic (but good).

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** I've only read ones on a site called potionsandsnitches (it's like a Snape and Harry one but not snarry, like the kind where Snapes Harry father or mentor or something) Idk if you know the site I've read a whole bunch on there of those kinds If you go onto the site, go onto the browse part and pick warnings, either the suicide themes one or the self harm one they're both usually on the fics anyways. Then press search or whatever but then at the top press ‘all stories' and change it to completed only. I can't remember most of them, and I don't know if you want short or long, how much you want to focus on the self harming part or whatever But there are some good ones (In my opinion -however much that may or may not matter-) there
