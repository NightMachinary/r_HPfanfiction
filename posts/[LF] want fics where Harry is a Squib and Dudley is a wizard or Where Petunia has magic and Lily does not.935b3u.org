It matches the requirement of Petunia having magic and not Lily. It is a one shot.

** Oh shit, can you imagine a scene where magical Dudley finds out that squib Harry is a horcrux? Then you have this scene where his helpless, abused cousin is standing at the business end of Dudley's wand while Dudley has this huge internal conflict over whether to /kill his own cousin/.

** So basically Harry is thrown out (or killed and burried somewhere) because a witch like Petunia Evans (who wants to advance in society, despite her muddy-blood (in the eyes of the Malfoys and similar families)) can't be bothered to deal with a worthless squib like him?

Seriously, Harry a squib? Yeah, the normal canon Dursleys might love him, but if Petunia is a witch and Vernon a wizard? You bet they wouldn't want to be associated with a squib (hell, even the bloody Weasleys shun their squib relatives!)
