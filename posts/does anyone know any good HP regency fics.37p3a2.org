I've read the post american civil war one with charlie weasley. crossovers are good too!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6608051/1/Of-Muggles-and-Magic][Of Muggles and Magic]] (SS/HG) is really good.

** Would you link us to the post-civil war fic with Charlie Weasley? It should be Victorian, but I'm still interested.

**** Thanks for getting back to me. Any clues so I can search for it?

I adore Charlie Weasley fics--some of them are so well written.

There was one where he was chatting up a muggle woman in a bar, and gave the muggle equivalent of his career. I know it was A03, but couldn't find it when I looked.
