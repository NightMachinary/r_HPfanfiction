:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I read a while ago but I can't remember the name. I'm almost certain that I read it on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] but I haven't been able to find it. From what I can remember, Harry is taken and raised in another galaxy or universe by different parents and given special training. I think Ginny was also taken as well and she was given a new name and also raised by another family. I think the universe had something to do with stars or the celestial. I have a feeling that they both end up going to Hogwarts but I could be wrong because it's been a while since I have read it. If someone knows which fic I'm talking about I would be so grateful! Thank you!
