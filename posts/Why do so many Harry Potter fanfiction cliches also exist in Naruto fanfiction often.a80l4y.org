** The stories have a lot of similarities, so it's not that strange that some of the cliches carry over as well.

** It depends on which cliches; for the specifically Harry/Naruot-scentric ones, both franchises feature lead protagonists with attributes in common:

1. adolescent male
2. orphan, but inheriting extraordinary abilities
3. mistreated and manipulated by authority figures in his life (to an arguable extent)
4. instinctively disrespectful of even justified authority
5. doesn't hold grudges
6. merciful---or not ruthless---towards enemies ("power of love", so to speak)
7. not very book-smart himself
8. have a book-smart female sidekick

This can motivate a number of cliches:

- 1+7+8 -> Author identifies with the lead protagonist, values intellectual achievement, resents lack of it on the part of the protagonist, especially in comparison to the sidekick. -> Smart!Harry/Naruto
- 1+2+3 -> Author identifies with the lead protagonist, feels that the protagonist has been hard done by by their background. -> Lord Potter/Black/Gryffindor/Slytherin and similarly with Naruto (though AFAIK, Naruto's canon bloodline power-ups ended up exceeding even the most extreme fanfic).
- 1+3+4+5+6 -> Author identifies with the lead protagonist, resents the protagonist not properly avenging himself on those who have wronged him. -> Edgy!Ruthless!Harry/Naruto, Manipulative!Dumbledore (and its Naruto analogue)

That's what I have so far. I am sure there are others.

** I'm guessing that most cliches aren't fandom specific and probably didn't start with HP either.

** I think it boils down to the immense popularity of these two fandoms. They have the highest number of fics in their respective categories on FF.net and with hundreds of thousands of these floating about you're bound to find clich√©s or at the very least similar narrative tools that are repeated and reused by everyone and gets repetitive as hell and ends up ruining the reader experience.
