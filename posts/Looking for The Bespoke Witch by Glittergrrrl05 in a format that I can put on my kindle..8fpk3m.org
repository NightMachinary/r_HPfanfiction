I found the story here: [[https://glittergrrrl05.wordpress.com/the-bespoke-witch/]] but when I tried to put it into calibre to make it a mobi file, it didn't work, so I assume that site isn't supported. I do have the FanFicFare plug in.

*** The calibre app for windows/linux/mac can convert epub files to mobi - used in kindles.

** I'm not sure what you did, but if fanficfare works (which it might not), then you should get an epub. Calibre has a feature to right and convert individual ebooks. Change the setting to mobi and you should have it.

I presume that's what you did though...

** [[http://ff2ebook.com][This site]] stores fics that are downloaded on its server, so if you can track down the defunct fanfiction.net URL, you can still download a personal copy. You can also search its archive for previously downloaded fics.

I used this link to download a copy a few weeks back.
