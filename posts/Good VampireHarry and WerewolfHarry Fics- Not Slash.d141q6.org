Looking for some good Vampire!Harry and Werewolf!Harry fics that don't have Harry in a slash relationship. Haven't been able to find many. Would love to find one I read years ago where Harry was turned into a vampire. He flies to Hermione's house on his broom and ends up saving her from vampires attacking. I think her parents were killed and she was seriously injured so Harry turned her. They end up holding up in an abandoned house. Any help finding some good fics is appreciated.

** You might be slightly misremembering [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]]. She's turned by a villain, not by Harry but the rest of it sounds similar.

** The fic you are remembering is Blood Bound: A Vampire Story.

It is probably the only good vampire story out there. Vampires are undead abominations, not sparkly and cute.

  Harry Potter becomes a vampire. Which struggle will be the most difficult? The war with Voldemort, or the struggle to hold onto his own failing humanity? Takes place right after HBP and makes an immediate detour into the Twilight Zone. Beware a HHr story.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) is passable. It has some tropes that were groundbreaking... in 2007. It is however complete and reasonably well written.

  Harry becomes a vampire and in doing so sets out on the path to fulfilling a second prophecy that carries far darker consequences than the first. Secrets, lies and changing alliances force Harry to trust those he never wanted to. Snape backstory. HarryOC.

** Not exactly werewolf. Fem!Harry is a animagus who spent too long in her animal form. No pairing.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.
