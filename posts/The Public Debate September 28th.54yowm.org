** Stance: the Statute of Secrecy would hold up in the 21st Century

Regarding the whole CCTV/muggles would discover it idea, I agree that the Statute of Secrecy would not hold up only IF it was maintained by wizards. Knowing that in canon the muggle government does know about the wizards, it stands to reason that there is a governing body that safeguards the secrecy of wizards on the muggle side since as it has been pointed out that the consequences would be bad in the short to mid run if the two societies were to merge, i.e. Hellsing preventing widespread knowledge of vampires for instance.

Furthermore because of growing government monitoring of data, it would be easier to shut down information leak to the point where magic sightings get relegated to conspiracy theories.

Ultimately, the Statute of Secrecy has to hold up because there is insufficient unity amongst disparate governments to ease the transition of magic into the global population so it's in everyone's interest (wealthy businessmen and governments, muggles and magicals alike) to keep it under wraps. Although magic would be a great multiplier for the human race as a whole in the long run.

*** You've talked mostly about motivations for trying to maintain the Statute. You hinted at early detection and disinformation campaigns. But on the whole, you're low on mechanisms for maintaining it. You don't have anything that would help a country in the middle of a civil war, or a country without the resources for mass spying, to maintain the Statute.

** Stance: The Statue of Secrecy would hold up in the 21st century.

It boils up to the two points.

Firstly, it's in everybody's best interest to keep ISOS in place and the two worlds separate. Why? Let me explain.

The wizards have means to significantly monitor and affect muggle world, whereas muggles doesn't have means to affect and monitor wizarding world.

Imperius, confundus, memory manipulation and all other mind affecting spells allow for controlling people. Polyjuice potion allows to take their place. Invisibility and anti-muggle spells allow to stay hidden from them. Wizards could easily rob, cheat and manipulate muggles, destabilising economy and society in process. Therefore it's imperative for muggles to keep wizarding world separate from their own.

On the other hand, wizarding world is mostly unreachable for normal people, and so they can't affect it. But, in case where ISOS would fail, and the two worlds would be connected, the muggle instabilities caused by wizards, would also hurt magical world. Public knowledge about magic would also mean that there are random attacks that may hurt young or less proficient wizards. This means, that's important for wizards to keep muggle world separate from their own.

This leads us into my second point - there is no major avenue for secret to come out. If people in power could only lose on ISOS fall, then they would do everything in their power to protect it, including limiting informations. This would be also partially done to avoid being proclaimed as crazy (like already happened with Lord North, source: [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/ministers-for-magic]]). We also need to remember that as HBP shown us, muggle governments are infiltrated by wizards who also would try to minimise potential leaks.

There are also people to consider. With eventual leak not being verifiable due to anti-muggle protections in place, the chances of general public believing in existence of secret magical societies all around would be minimal.

Ergo, there are no reason for trying to end ISOS, and there are no many ways for it to happen. And so, the ISOS would stay in place.

#+end_quote

This paragraph is precisely why any muggle government would attempt to collect data on wizards. Having a population like this, which contains a fringe element that absolutely hates muggles, within your borders is an enormous backdoor into the security of your nation. Think of all the carnage one Death Eater could cause if they were to walk into a city centre; to not have a contingency for such a thing beyond "Let's trust the wizards to keep to themselves", would be gross negligence for the wellbeing of their citizens. To suggest that a muggle government would realistically let wizards run themselves with no oversight, secret or otherwise, when they're a possible danger, is a profound misunderstanding of how governments respond to threats on home soil.

And if the muggles find a few muggleborns who were angry enough at their treatment during the events of DH and well-placed enough to be "in the know", then you have sleeper cells within the wizarding world monitoring the actions of wizards, witches, the Ministry, etc. and they'll report it back to the appropriate branch of the English government.

And that, IMO, is where the avenue for the secret to come out, comes in, because the muggle government will document their findings somewhere. And that somewhere will most likely be some government server. Which, as we've seen in recent years, may not always be secure. Wizards can do absolutely nothing if muggle governments secretly (and they very well should, for their own safety) transcribe information about the magical world down on a server that gets hacked. You can discredit a person and call them crazy, but you can't discredit thousands upon thousands of redacted government files being spilled across the internet.

Jo attempting to put wizards in the government to stop leaks is cute (and fucking terrifying when you think about it), but they'll ultimately be grossly ineffective at containing the hard data of the internet.

The probability of this is absurdly minuscule. Being muggleborn doesn't mean that they have any connection to the muggle world. Or that they would in any way profit from muggle's intervention. Not to mention they would need to be able to contact goverment. Which is again infiltrated.

But hey, let's assume that somehow they slipped some information.

You're underestimating the abilities and resources of our governments. Having magical plants in our governments means nothing, because no matter how skilled a wizard is, they cannot monitor every facet and institution within the government-- it's absurd to assume they would. A muggle government could conceivably create a shadow bureau that deals with these sorts of things, and has little to no oversight from larger government and operates as a rogue arm of a government (since you're dealing with people not protected by the Geneva Convention, they have no rights for you to violate, or so the rationalisation can go). They could recruit or approach young muggleborns by monitoring for cases of accidental magic when they're young, or something that might seem like accidental magic. Get rid of the parents, a little bit of retraining, and you'll soon have muggle-allied plants within the magical world. It's a sad fact that when we're not constrained by ethics or morality, we're capable of quite a lot. Even, conceivably, gathering data on wizards.

Most people are not enough people, if even a few people believe the reports, they'll go looking for further evidence. Soon, too many people will find too many oddities that they wouldn't pay attention to otherwise, and the obliviators can't stop that, in my opinion.

That's why you only monitor the possible sources of the leak. If they talk about this to someone who shouldn't know - obliviate. And considering most of the people shouldn't know you limit yourself to a few targets.

Great. We aren't concerned about them. We're concerned about the muggleborns who /do/ have a connection to the muggle world -- for instance, by having muggle relatives or neighbors, or having taken several years of muggle school. This should be the vast majority of them, possibly all of them.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Lucius Malfoy was pardoned. Lucius Malfoy enjoyed torturing and killing muggles for being muggles. Protecting my fellow humans, which includes my family, from a monster in a human suit is profit enough.

Magic can solve a lot of problems. If I could figure out how to enchant a nozzle to emulate the /Aguamenti/ charm when I pull a lever or push a button, I can provide clean drinking water to people who don't have it. (It makes them dependent on magic, you might object, but nobody seems to think it's worth *people dying* to avoid a dependence on a desalination plant.) But I can't lift a finger to help them if I'm constrained by the Statute of Secrecy. Not unless I'm casting memory charms left and right.

(Yes, I can disguise /that/ form of aid somewhat. But there would still be people who know what should and shouldn't be possible, who can identify that I'm not operating within those bounds. Other forms of aid aren't as easy to disguise, and it's a resource drain in any case.)

Anyway! The point is, people can care about others; magic helps you act on that; secrecy hinders; so there's an incentive to violate the Statute of Secrecy.

#+begin_quote

To what extent? How well defended is it against an attacker who can use magic? How does that work in areas without a government, where the person tries to advertise their existence to as many people as possible?

Belief in mystical things is surprisingly common in some places. If HP magic /were/ real, I expect there would be stories about mages in many cultures. Much like fairies in Ireland and elves in Iceland, except backed by reality and not even a secret as recently as 1400. Even without any whistleblowers, a lot of people would be half-convinced it's real.

Most of the muggleborns won't have much of a connection to muggle world anymore. After seven, crucial for forming your adult personality, years spent almost exclusively in the magical world, after only learning thing that will be useful in the magical world, after not being able to talk to your old friends about what are you doing for the most of the year, after having your parents not understand what are you doing for most of the year.

With a handful of muggleborns helping, specifically.

There's the question of what happens when it comes to blows. That's a whole 'nother debate. There's the question of how much non-violent pressure muggles can put on mages before it comes to blows. There's a question of how much clothing or armor a spell can go through, as a barrier to mind-altering spells with mages who think no more of confunding a muggle than you would of shooing a fly away. There's a question of how much muggles would get to organize and how much intel they would get before they were discovered. There's a question of whether a muggleborn helping Her Majesty's government would be able to protect certain areas or people from magical influence, like the inverse of a muggle-repelling charm. There's a question of whether protective magical devices could be manufactured, if you've got a handful of mages working on it.

At this point, there are a ton of unknowns. An optimistic muggleborn mage would try to move ahead, hoping that some of these would have favorable answers. A pessimist would not.

You should have led with this idea that there's some sort of passive, global magical force that stops muggles from knowing about magic as long as it's not too obvious.

But since mages were public in the 1200s, then subject to an attempted genocide across Europe and its colonies in the 1400s to 1680s, it apparently didn't exist back then. And it obviously doesn't cover things that are sufficiently obvious, otherwise Obliviators wouldn't be necessary and the Statute of Secrecy wouldn't require enforcement and Seamus Finnegan's father never would have found out about Seamus's mother.

Magic can protect from muggles with basically 100% effectiveness because magical reality can overwrite physical reality, but magical reality can't reliably overwrite magical reality and thus you can't make magic that is 100% effective against magic. The best bet would be probably some variations of the Shield Charm, like those that were used in battle of Hogwarts. But those were temporary solution despite being raised by very powerful and experienced wizards.

Shield clothes are proof that you can create something like that, but their usefulness were vastly limited. Maybe it can be improved upon, but the scale on which it would have to be produced to be of any difference would require large amount of wizards working on it.

But it's not applied evenhandedly. It's only applied to magic. In Ireland, they still route roads so as not to disturb faery rings sometimes. In Iceland, a quarter of the population believes in elves. In the US, tons of people believe in ghosts. In Europe, even though a few centuries ago it was common knowledge and plain observable fact, suddenly nobody thinks mages exist.

And if you apply it to science, you would get a rather different muggle world.

Primarily this is due CCTV. What happens when new cameras are installed in places that used to be safe to apostate to, and slowly, hundreds of instances are recorded of people appearing out of thin air? It wouldn't be enough to obliviate people since the footage would still be stored somewhere. Even if there are wizards paid to work in muggle companies and edit the footage, IMO there would happen too often so eventually enough would fall through the net that 1) people would start to question it and 2) it would find its way into the Internet The existence of one file can be disputed as just being photoshopped but loads of them would be enough to convince people of the existence of humans who can teleport, at least.

On a different side, I think the sudden disappearance of muggle-born children from records after they leave primary school would be noticed. Since JK's strength isn't maths, it's easy for there to be varying opinions in fanon of how many muggle-borns join Hogwarts every year. Also, muggle-borns going to Hogwarts isn't exactly anything new. However, I think that there enough muggle-borns for it to be significant enough difference to be picked up and with new technology, data is being analysed more and more so eventually their absence in any secondary school will be noticed, even if it does take a long time.

Wizards apparate mostly to wizarding places, where there would be no cameras. Also they would just use more anti-muggle spells. Video footage is no use if their operators can't see anything wrong with it.

#+end_quote

Like you say, the unknown is how many muggleborns there are per year. If there are a thousand Hogwarts students, which is what Rowling said, 200 muggleborns would be a reasonable guess. That's across seven years, so we have maybe thirty muggleborn students in each year group. Maybe double it for population growth for today's count.

In the 2011 census, there were 350,000 eleven-year-olds. New Hogwarts students account for 0.017% of all students. Try noticing that trend in the historical records. Probably an order of magnitude more people decide to homeschool their kids but forget to report it properly each year. And go back to, say, 1945, and the records will be especially spotty and gnarled.

Individual investigations are another side of the issue. The first people hit will be the parents of muggleborns. A few parents might lose access to their children -- and then the Obliviators step in and the parents ask for a reasonable excuse to tell the local officials. So this would affect a few people in modern times, then there would be some solution in place.

** Stance: the Statute of Secrecy would not hold up.

The challenges mages face involve increased, decentralized surveillance with things like drones, hikers with GPS, and wildlife transponders, with data aggregated by computer systems. It's unclear how the Unplottable Charm would interact with that, but it's likely that it would allow humans to become suspicious. At one time, you only had to worry about a handful of cartographers, and later just a couple government agencies, but with cheaper GPS systems, drones, and telecommunications, you're talking hundreds of thousands of people with incidental contact with the magical world. The Fidelius Charm might be strong enough to turn away that many people, but it probably wouldn't be feasible to cast over as large an area as Hogsmeade.

To make things worse, there are dozens or hundreds of locations to protect across the UK.

A first pass for improvement would require centralizing the population, which would be unpopular with people who live outside Hogsmeade. This would not significantly increase the amount of effort required to defend Hogsmeade, but it would reduce the amount of traffic through muggle-filled areas, standardize the protections, and allow for better monitoring of potential breaches.

A second pass would involve moving everyone to a location that won't be tracked -- underground, off Earth, a flotilla in international waters. This would require moderate advances in magic (resource generation, oxygen supply, that kind of thing) that I suspect are possible but might require significant investment. Not a Manhattan Project, but a strong concerted effort.

This also requires consolidating or eliminating magical creatures, or hoping that they arrange their own way of disappearing.

Justifying both that effort and moving people from their ancestral homes would probably be politically infeasible until secrecy was broken. Most mages feel derisive and contemptuous toward muggles, and that won't change until Hannibal is at the gates. At that point, it will be too late.

** Stance: The Statute of Secrecy will not work in the 21st century.

Realistically, no, the Statute of Secrecy would not hold up in the 21st century. We live in a world where governments can, and in some cases do, spy on everyday citizens under the guise of protection, but let's keep it in the UK.

So, understanding that our governments want to 'protect' its citizens, and requires a near endless stream of intelligence and maintaining security measures to do so: is it realistic to assume that HMG would simply abide an "deep state" of possibly-dangerous and most likely-undocumented citizens, run by a shadow government, living within UK borders? Especially after they've had a violent civil war? And they're supposed to trust them based off a few scant meetings between the Prime Minister and the head of an invisible state? It's not only reckless not to keep tabs on these individuals, it's outright goddamn /dangerous/.

So, MI6 or some other intelligence branch of the government starts monitoring wizards and witches, especially after 11th Sept. attacks in America and the 7/7 attacks, because just like jihadists in the Middle East, these 'shadow people' are just as capable of terrorism or terrorist-like actions. And, since evidence is being collected in the muggle world, all information will be transcribed in digital space, an area that magicals are woefully inept at understanding. That, however, can be a problem, because all information transcribed in digital space can be hacked or stolen by other muggles. All it takes is one whistleblower, or a hacktivist collective to steal the information and hand it over to Wikileaks, and the Statute of Secrecy is blown wide open, no matter how many people get obliviated.

But, since HP is inherently fantastical in nature, and muggles in the series aren't nearly as paranoid as they should be about a population of undocumented, armed people who could be living quite /literally/ in your backyard, it's likely that the muggle government would continue trusting the Ministry of Magic to moderate their own affairs.

Consider this, magic and technology really don't go well together. It gets fried if you get in too wide of a breadth range of magic. The same would happen when recorded with muggle camera, they won't see the magic, but only what the magic intends muggles to see.

Heck, they've cooperated with the prime minister to be the only muggle to know and make sure that other muggles would be unaware of their existence, other than perhaps the muggleborn's relatives, and even if someone muggle with no ties to the magical society gets wind of it, they won't believe it. If they do, well, there's a reason why they have Obliviators employed in the Ministry of Magic to deal with such events that are a part of the:

I agree that government surveillance would expose the magical world, but this would not become public because it is in the governments' best interests to conceal it.

There would be a competition between governments to recruit magicals for use in espionage and black/special ops. Just like military or political secrets that are tacitly known between rival governments, publicly all knowledge of the magical world would be denied or suppressed. Reports of magic or wizards would be treated as conspiracy theories or the new UFO craze.

*** Your scenario is one way in which some muggles might reasonably try to maintain secrecy for magic. But it doesn't take into account how others would act, or how well they could maintain secrecy.

Lucius Malfoy isn't likely to sign on after a lifetime in the aristocracy, engaging in muggle-baiting when possible. Is the government just going to ignore him? Hardly; he's as skilled at espionage and wet work as all these other people they're eager to sign on. Is he going to hide while the vermin he tortures for fun tear down his world around him? He signed on with a dark lord to stop muggle influences before. And he's not the only one like that.

A muggleborn pacifist might well turn whistleblower. Success wouldn't be guaranteed, far from it -- you'd have to convince the person that magic is real, offer proof that they can show others, and avoid Obliviators. But people explicitly trying to break secrecy increase the odds that it's broken.

Other mages would be against their use as weapons because it's compulsory, not because it's violence. They would fight back. (Imagine how Molly Weasley would react if the muggle government tried to draft Ginny and Ginny didn't want to go.) And if they're not supremely cautious, a fight between muggles and mages will become public.

If mages do become common as operatives, then governments who are on the short end of the stick in terms of magical talent have an incentive to make it public that magic exists. It might hurt stronger countries' reputations or prompt some uncomfortable questions, at the very least.

It takes caution to hide the magical aspect of a secret agent's involvement, to disguise it as something that won't be remarked on. Anything that relies on people being cautious will fail rather often.

A magic secret agent program would produce a fair amount of documentation and a larger number of people in the know. (It's a government program, after all.) While it's classified, classified data does get leaked from time to time, so this adds an additional avenue for secrecy to be broken.

** Stance: The Statute's done for. To quote Order of the Phoenix:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Where are [the giants]?' said Ron. ‘Mountains,' said Hagrid unhelpfully. ‘So why don't Muggles --?' ‘They do,' said Hagrid darkly. ‘On'y their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin' accidents, aren' they?'
#+end_quote

What happens when muggle mountaineers encounter giants, and have a satellite phone in their possession? Or a scenic flyover of the Alps spots the giants and they radio their base?

Addendum: The Ilfracombe Incident. This was an incident in Harry Potter canon; in 1932, a Welsh Green Dragon swooped down on a beach full of muggles, and was only repelled thanks to a group of wizards being on holiday there at the time. And Welsh Greens are relatively gentle for dragons. What happens if, say, a similar incident occurs, in a place where tourists have mobile phones? What happens when the police and news helicopters arrive and livestream everything?

Argument 2: Magic isn't magic; performing the same spell with the same words, the same will, and the same wand movement, makes the same result, and brewing 2 potions the same way will result in two potions of the same. The main setting of most of the books is a school where children are taught to perform these spells/potions/etc and learn the theory of how their magic works; by definition, 'magic' is reproducible, and thus, scientific, a part of nature. ...Now, what happens if muggle scientists in the Harry Potter universe, get hold of an object with magical properties (even just a self-pouring teapot), and figure out how it works?

One more thought: "That wasn't really a hurricane." Weather satellites can disprove that particular excuse; either wizards get to meteorologists and modify their memories AND change their satellite images to match (although apparently Hermione Granger knows a Photoshop Charm...), or face reporters pointing out that 'no, no hurricane/tornado happened there'.

** My stance is is no, the statute of secrecy would not hold up.

Lets be real. The government is big, and even if Wizards/Witches can do things to hide themselves (Wards, Fidelus, Oblivation, ect) eventually the government would find out about this. They would notice the inconsistencies. Obliviate a government official? Fine, okay, but when someone asks how it went during that time, there's nothing they can do. Fidelus? As far as I can tell, there's nothing that says Satellites can't detect it. At the very least, they would detect people suddenly disappearing.

I just can't see any way that they would be able to survive without Obliviating days, weeks, even years from entire continents. Personally, I don't see that happening.

Now, some people can say that the Ministry works for the Prime Minister, and the queen- while I don't know if that's canon or not, do you honestly expect everyone in the government to say nothing? There's going to be someone that tells, whether on purpose or drunk at a bar.

Slightly off topic, this is my first time participating in the debate \o/.
