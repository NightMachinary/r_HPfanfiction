I'm looking for this fanfiction I read a year or two ago. I'm pretty sure it was on fanfiction.net. The premise of the story was that McGonagall finally dies and she joins the afterlife and is greater by the Marauders and Lily and Marlene I think. And she tells them stories about Harry. I can't find it anywhere. Please help


** Sorry, I don't know the fic you're looking for.

I do know End of the Line, linkffn(3673824) , or as I prefer to call it, Leaves on the Line. It's a snippet-y fic with different (dead) characters trying to resolve their respective regrets before heading on to the afterlife. You may be interested in it.

** That doesn't sound like something that would interest most people on the sub, so you'll have a hard time finding it. I wish you luck though.
