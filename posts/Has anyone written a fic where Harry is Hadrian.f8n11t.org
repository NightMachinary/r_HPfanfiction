A twist on the trope of Harry being short for Hadrian because Harry isn't “cool” enough of a name for some writers. Has anyone had Harry get cast back (or travel willingly) through time to the second century, falling in with Trajan and becoming Emperor of Rome after his demise?

Was listening to a podcast about the Five Good Emperors and thought it was an interesting premise.


** Or he ends up in late 14th century, overthrows Richard II and becomes Henry IV, King of England and France, Lord of Ireland. His father's name was John of Gaunt ( a name that Harry promoted in homage to his deceased foe Tom Riddle).
