Based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bfybro/we_need_a_review_flair/][this thread]] post flair has been updated with the following changes:

- Request has been renamed to "Seeking Recommendations"
- Fic Search has been renamed to "What's That Fic?"
- Recommendation has been renamed to "Review"


** I think if you've renamed "Fic Search" to "What's That Fic?" that changing Request is superfluous. That's a hella long flair for the most common type of thread in this subreddit and, honestly, the problem was how often they were confused, which has already been solved by renaming "Fic Search".

Additionally, and this is a much more minor point, would it be too much hassle to just have an additional flair altogether for Reviews? Positive reviews could obviously be considered recommendations, but /not all/ recommendations are reviews. When I made the thread that you quoted in your OP, I was hoping for an additional flair which would spark joy in my heart when I saw it in those rare occassions because it means someone has taken their time to make an awesome write-up of their thoughts and opinions on a piece of literature that I, perhaps, had read. Now there's a chance I'll be raising my hopes for no reason, especially given how often non-review recommendations occur over /actual/ reviews.

But /either way/, I'm glad that our moderators are listening to our wishes. This is one of my favorite communities on Reddit, and your guys' quick responsiveness to things like this is one of those reasons why.

** u/zerkses:
#+begin_quote
  Recommendation has been renamed to "Review"
#+end_quote

Wrong. Recommendation and review are different entities altogether. And it was specifically requested to have a new flair, not to merge two unrelated things together

*** I agree with this. Not every recommendation comes with a review, and reviews can come without recommending people check it out.

**** "This fic is good, y'all should read it" is still a review, even if it's a very low effort one. A review doesn't have to be 1000 words long

***** "I just saw this challenge in a Facebook wrap up and thought some people here might be interested. It involves more uncommon pairings which is a request that pops up here every so often, here's a link to the collection on AO3."

A recommendation without a review. Yeah, you're right, a low effort review is still a review, but /not/ every recommendation automatically has a review attached.

**** Not really. It's a square/rectangle situation. A positive review could, obviously, be considered a recommendation. However, not every recommendation is a review.

"This story is good, and I think you should read it," is not what I would consider 'Review' material.

***** I'd argue that a lot of 'recommendation' threads on this sub have been low effort content, because they consist of only "This story is good, and I think you should read it" without a description of the fic and what parts make it good. That sort of post is not persuasive and usually gets ignored or downvoted (unless it's for a popular fic, in which case the thread gets upvoted by people who have already read it, making the 'recommendation' largely redundant.)

I think that switching the post flair to "review" might encourage people to put more effort into their recommendation posts.

****** I think that that's an interesting experimental idea, but I hardly believe that was the original intent of our moderator overlords. They'd likely be much more amenable to changing it now before people have gotten used to it and have it used it frequently than, say, in a few weeks if the experiment has failed and there is mass confusion.

*** Seriously, instead of just, yknow, adding a flair, let's just mix everything all around for the fun of it. What?
