When Ron left the tent, he'd immediately run into a gang of Snatchers. And he had a device on him that could track and spy on Harry and Hermione. He also doesn't have any skill in protecting the information in his head. What if he couldn't get away?


** /"Weasley is Our King."/

He didn't mean to.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They were lying in wait.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He hadn't been paying attention when he apparated.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They'd been there with them. In the woods.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They followed him to the Burrow.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

The Snatchers, the name he learned was theirs.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He didn't want to tell them what the Deluminator was, he didn't even know that it could even DO that.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They took their time in the tent.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They called for the Death Eaters when they were done...

/"Weasley is Our King."/

Malfoy Manor. They arrived in chains.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He was released, but forced to kneel.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

Bellatrix and the Malfoy's took Hermione to another room after they suspended what was left of Harry in the air.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

The last he saw of her, kicking and screaming. Her big brown eyes just as defiant as ever.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

Despite her torn clothes, the blood, the bruises. Despite her terror.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

You Know Who... he thanked him with a sneer.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He said his family would be spared.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

Heroes to his cause, truly a righteous pureblood clan he said.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He made him watch Harry's execution.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

It took hours.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He didn't know someone could bleed so much and still... live...

/"Weasley is Our King."/

Hermione. She was screaming in the other room.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He knew she was with Bellatrix and the Malfoy's.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

"Please!", "Get off me.", "Harry!" On a cycle, until she went quiet. Until Bellatrix came in, looking overly satisfied.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They ignored him, and kept to taunting Harry.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

They sent him home when it was done.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

His mother wouldn't look at him. His father wouldn't open the door.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

His face was all over the Prophet the next day. They were calling him a hero.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He set himself up in a room at the Leaky Cauldron. Harry's money heavy in his hands.

/"Weasley is Our King."/

He didn't last the night...

*"Weasley is Our King!"*

*** That hurt to read but yes, it was what I asked for. People should remember that actions have consequences and having a snit in the middle of the war can get good people killed. Thank you.
