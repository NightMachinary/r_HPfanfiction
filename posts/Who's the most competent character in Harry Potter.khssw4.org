A bunch of kids needed to be the heroes, so in order for their actions to have impact the background characters were all dumbed down. There are some characters that seem competent, but basically fully rely on luck. And then there is Dumbledore who is as competent as the plot demands him to be. And people like Snape, who the book tells us is competent, but didnt really ever do anything to make a difference.


** wormtail. he succeeded in more or less everything he set out to do (except...survival), & more (finessing sirius into azkaban, retrieving volde's wand)

his death was because he's a neurotic overdependent coward who bet everything on voldemort's grace

though, he's p. much a moving plot device

** *Barty Crouch Jr.*

Escapes, finds Voldemort despite being imprisoned for like 13 years, executes the Master's ridiculously convoluted plan successfully, and even manages successfully impersonate Moody for an entire school year despite Dumbledore being Moody's buddy.

*** Voldermort and Petigrew found Crouch Jr. Voldemort broke the Memory Charm placed on Bertha Jorkins by Crouch Sr. and discovered the existence of Crounch jr. He then proceeded to ambush Crouch Sr. at his home and free Crouch Jr. After that, Voldemort, Pettigrew and Crouch Jr. ambushed Moody at his home.

*** Exactly! Not to mention that he managed to defeat Moody, an Auror old enough to retire, after spending 13 year without doing anything at all. He was imprisoned before he was twenty and didn't have the opportunity to learn or practice after that. I doubt even Tom Riddle could have defeated a Constantly Vigilant senior Auror at the age of 19. Yes, Crouch Jr had help from Pettigrew, but Pettigrew was useless.

I would say that Barty Crouch Junior had the potential to be a wizard of equal power level with Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort. Additionally, he was someone who got things done. The only incompetent part about him was that he didn't abduct Harry at some earlier point during the school year, but that can be explained away with some unseen safety precautions Dumbledore had in place, something that could only be circumvented at the third Triwizard task. And of course the stereotypical bad guy fashion of revealing his plan for no reason, but that only happened because Rowling needed it to.

*** From what I've seen, Snape and Flitwick are the only two professors listed as masters of their subjects. I would say they would be competent in that context as well. Professor McGonagal is /brilliant/ at transfiguration, but if her skill isn't considered a mastery level, then how amazing are the two masters in their chosen fields?

Edited to say: of course someone with a doctorate degree with no hands on experience isn't necessarily more competent than someone who has spent years in the field without the shiny plaque on the wall, but I hope my point comes across properly. I'm considering the term mastery as in ability, not education.

** Think Dumbledore and Snape's powers far exceed what is shown in the books, so what they do in the books is 'punching down.' Among the older adults, maybe them and McGonagall.

Among the kids I'd like to say Harry but Hermione was called the best at magic.

Hermione's quick to point out that Harry's actually better than her at Defense Against the Dark Arts.

She knows the most spells, but Harry is definitely capable of doing things she cannot. She struggles mightily with the Patronus Charm.

**** I would say that Hermione was much better than Harry in knowledge about magic/spells. Harry excelled in the practical application of magic especially in DADA and was magically more powerful eg a fully corporal patronus at 13, an accio spell to retrieve his broom from the castle (why Hermione didn't have it with her in the stands I'll never understand).

** I'd think first of McGonagall but she is an absent mentor. I'd turn to Flitwick but he doesn't have a zero-tolerance bullying policy (neither has McGonagall now I think about it.

Pomfrey has no screen time whatsoever commenting on whatever traces there must be of either Tobias Snape's or the Dursleys abuse. Not to mention whatever magical results she must encounter from bullying.

Any aurors have even less screen time. I think I could argue there are no heroes in the Harry Potter world.

Sure Lockhart perhaps, but he turned out to be a fraud.

** Hagrid - he is just a school drop out groundskeeper without much magic who punched above his weight .. he cared for a baby dragon on Hogwarts grounds, providing clues for 1st years to safely go past a Cereberus, part of events which led to 2nd defeat of a dark lord, was instrumental in providing information which led to slaying a dangerous Basilisk, teaching kids about dangers of Acromantula in the forest, introduced unicorns & centaurs as part of a detention and then when he was a teacher for a short duration, his students went on to fly on a Hyppogriff, Thestrals, blind Dragon and fight Dementers, interact with a Giant. He personally delivered harry to his relatives after the unfortunate deaths of his parents, transported a precious treasure from bank just before it could be stolen, transported harry during a flying battle, to the final battlefield .. I could go on for a while.

P.S: I hope people get the tone of my comment .. by that I mean you can twist the story and make anyone look competent.

** Competent in what? Magic? Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Snape. In overall success? Dumbledore, Umbridge, and Harry.

So I would say Dumbledore in spite of the many plot over character development moments. He did run a successful war campaign from the grave and planned an ending 3-5 years in advance.

** Narcissa Malfoy. She only really gets screentime in the last two books, but boy does she shine.

HBP: Subverts Voldemort's plan to punish Lucius for his failures by setting Draco an impossible task while still maintaining plausible deniability; convinces a highly effective double-agent to make an Unbreakable Vow before even disclosing the contents of what Draco's task entails; plays hostess to the Dark Lord while keeping him from seeing what she did with Severus to trick him

DH: Looks Voldy dead in the eyes and LIES to him about the defeat of his greatest enemy and DOESN'T GET CAUGHT even when Voldemort would want to be 100% sure that this time Harry is really dead; just straight up hangs out with her family in the Great Hall after the battle even though they were all on the wrong side until like 2 minutes before and no one even questions it

She was tough but fair, not giving anyone too much slack but not being an absolute killjoy either. She rightfully punished people who deserved it and could back up any claims or threats she made.
