...so I turn to you.

The main scene I remember is Harry in stag form, with Hermione in her animagus form (an otter, probably, but not definite) on his back, holding onto his antlers and maybe guiding him. So if not an otter, something with small hand-like paws. There's a portal and I think there's a mystical aspect to the story (the fae, etc).

I know it's not much, so kudos and internet cookies to anyone who can help!
