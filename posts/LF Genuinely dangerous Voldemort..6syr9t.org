I've been looking for 100k+ word fics that have a genuinely dangerous Voldemort. I feel like in most of the fics that i have read recently, he has been killed with annoying ease. It takes away from the victory and makes the whole dark reign seem kind off pathetic.

Thanks for any help.


** Try the Denarian Series. It has the best Voldemort, Dumbledore, Harry interactions I've read. linkffn(3473224), linkffn(3856581) and linkffn(4359957)

#+begin_quote
  "Voldemort is a powerful wizard," Dumbledore said gravely. "He has undergone procedures and rituals that would have crushed a lesser wizard and come up on top. He will shrug off and regenerate all but the most severe physical and magical wounds, although your skills in this area probably exceed his. His spells will be tens-times more powerful than the average Auror-class wizard. His reflexes and duelling style is unique to himself and quite possibly one of the most dangerous duellists in the world. His stamina, unmatchable by even myself. His greatest asset, however, is his mind. His ability to analyse a situation in a split-second and react accordingly will match even your own superior senses. I have heard some compare Lord Voldemort to a modern-day Salazar Slytherin. That is incorrect. Voldemort surpassed Slytherin long ago."

**** I have never read the Dresden Files (despite having the first five books not 3 feet from me, sitting on a shelf... staring at me) and I loved this series. There might be references that you don't understand, but I didn't notice any gaping plot points where I just had to shrug and tell myself I'll understand it one day, once I read DF.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Well, HPMOR's Voldemort is quite terrifying, but then again he's so different from the canon one you might not be interested. (In this version he's more of a Professor Moriarty-style supergenius, for whom the "easily-angered red-eyed Dark Lord" persona was just an alias to try his hand at the "taking over Britain" business, expecting his Voldemort character to be defeated quickly, except he was so competent that he /didn't manage to lose/, which is why the war still raged for so many years).
