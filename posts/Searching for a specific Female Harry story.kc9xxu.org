:END:
A Female Harry where in Third task of Triwiizard Tournament she infront of all audience revive all magical and Muggle persons killed by Voldemort through Avada Kedavra. She explains history of Killing curse like some kind of mother's curse for safeguarding the child. She was helped in this by house elves who shield her from Durselys.She took refuge in mind of House elves due to which she got a title and was made kind of representative between Ministry and magical beings. Later James and Lily try to understand her. James follows her in Muggle where she takes Krav Maga (Israel martial arts) lessons from a Muggle man whom she told about magic and also adapts martial art to go along with magic. James reprimand her for breaking Statue of Secrecy where she says that when magic is exposed there should be some muggles who will testify that magicals are not to be feared of. Also it was set in 1990s so Krav Maga was new.

I am like 80% sure this fic was on ao3 or maybe fan fiction.net as I use both. There were more than 25 chapters.
