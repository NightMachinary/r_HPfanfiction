HELP! Need to find a fanfic

I'm being plagued by a Harry Potter Fanfic I read - need to find it!

Clues:

- James and Lily survive and are in the US. On holiday to New Orleans, they're in a car accident and James dies. Lily on a coma, then is living as long term patient (stuck in teen years)
- Hermione and Snape are in a relationship which ends when Snape cheats on Hermione with a recently â€˜awakened' Lily
- Snape and Hermione have a business together
- Harry and Ginny are together

I remember it being incredibly good and making me cry.

Finally, apologies if this is in the wrong place. I find reddit confusing and I'm not quite sure what I'm doing....


** Do you remember what website it was on?

** I think either ffn or AO3. Most likely ffn.

It was almost certainly an M or above, I like the smutty ones.

I feel like the business that ss/hg ran together was based in east London?
