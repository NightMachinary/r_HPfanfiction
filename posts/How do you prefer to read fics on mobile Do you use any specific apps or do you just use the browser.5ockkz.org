** I use the official FFN app most of the time. I was using moon reader for a while, but honestly I'm mostly happy with the app. I can favorite/follow/search within it, keep it separate from my browser, and review within.

** I upload MOBI files to my Amazon account and read them on the Kindle app. This lets me keep track of position and categorize stories when I finish reading them.

** I don't like reading on my phone, so I use my Kindle's browser most of the time, downloading them in the appropriate Kindle format only when I want to read offline.

** My brother and I use FanFiction Reader for Android. We really enjoy the app a lot more than the official one, and we really read a lot. We also use another one from the Windows AppStore for both the tablets. I know that one is not free, but it's pretty ok.

** I download the stories using calibre on my computer then email them to my phone.\\
And read them with cool reader.

Ok technically I don't read them since I have cool reader read them to me. That way I can listen to them in my car and at work.

** Just the standard Android web browser in dark mode, works perfectly and I don't see a reason to install any apps.

*** I used to do this but i have a shitty phone so when I check a call or something it would end up losing my position on the page when I came back. I had to install a minimal browser that uses less memory to be able to return to where I left off without problems.

** Epub on fbreader or mobi on kindle, or sometimes I pull out my original Nook. (I really wish I had the original Nook Touch, but with the Kindle's light.) Sometimes I'm lazy and use the website.

** I just use the browser. It's easiest for me at home as I have no WiFi and my cell service cuts in and out, and usually it takes longer for me to load up an app than it does a Web page on the browser.

** Epub files when reading on ao3 but often I just stick to the browser. I use the FFN app as well, occasionally I'll use FFN downloader to upload to Dropbox or Google play but I'm happy with the FFN app.
