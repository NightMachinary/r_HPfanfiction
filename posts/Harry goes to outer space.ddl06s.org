****** It's completely unreadable because there's no option to change away from the blindingly bright background. Add to that the unintuitive format and a mess of tags that aren't consistent across authors if you try searching for something, and you're left with a site on which the only merit is the ability to display the whole story at once instead of going chapter by chapter... not that it's useful on that site because you /still can't read it due to the unchangeable white background/.

******* That was very well said. I know when I started reading fanfic I hated the idea of Harry/ Tom riddle but then I read one fic that was really changed how they were both presented and it kinda changed my views. I still dislike Harry/ Voldemort because to me, Voldemort is the psychopathic killer, whereas Tom riddle was who he had the potential to be. People have created their own personas on who he could've been, which is what I find hella interesting. But ya, I completely understand where everyone is coming from, it wouldn't be much fun if we all had the same opinions

I probably wouldn't call it "excellent" but it did have surprising depth. The author wasn't afraid to kill off characters and generally have things go badly, and honestly that's still /generous/ for sending a group of people to colonise another planet.
