I was browsing through some recommended lists on the subreddit and saw a lot of people recommending Aurelian so Googled it and was skimming through a couple of chapters to get the feel of it. I noticed that about 99% of the paragraphs that aren't dialogue begins with a name and it just really annoyed me. I don't know why, maybe because it just sounds weird when I'm reading it but it annoyed me enough for me to stop reading.

I know I'm being picky but did anyone else notice?

eg. In chapter 25

*Draco* stood at the gate.....blahblahblahblah

*Draco* checked his watch again.....blahblhablahblah

*Draco* was startled from his thoughts... blahblahblahblah

"dialoguedialoguedialogue"

*Draco* nodded. blahblhablhablah

"dialoguedialoguedialogue"

*Draco* shook his head blahblhablah

*Draco* looked down blahblahblah

** I've read Aurelian twice before, but I never noticed this, even though as a writer starting sentences with my character's name is one of my flaws that I work hard to get rid of during my editing process. Good to know that people actually do notice and all this work isn't for nothing.

**** I got it in Epub form and used something called a Braille display. Do you know what those are? If not, I'd be happy to explain.

** I also saw it recommended and tried to read it, but the toddler dialogue bothered me too much and I had to stop. I found I liked this one a lot better, kind of the same premise but better written imo

** Finding paragraph starters that aren't "<character name>" (or "I" if you're writing in first person) is not an easy task. It's like trying to find some variety in dialogue markers (said, answered, shouted, ...) without going overboard. There are only so many ways to describe your character indirectly.

*** Right! I think it's way worse when an author tries too hard to avoid this stuff. I vastly prefer simple/basic writing over artifice.

** I gave a quick look at the fic and it doesn't seem so bad, but I can totally understand how something like this can trigger you so much that you can't read any further. Once I noticed an author kept using the phrase "as (s)he did so" /all the time/ and just couldn't read anything by them anymore.

** I'm going to be honest. I love this story. I've read it probably five times all the way through - it's just one in the batch of my "comfort stories" that I read when I need something familiar I guess.

Anyways.

I reread it most recently a month or two ago and was really surprised by the writing quality. I knew it wasn't a masterpiece but... a lot of it just isn't written amazingly by any standards. I also found the relationship development a bit fast (though explained in plot alright). Honestly, I think if I found it now I might not have fallen into it as much, but I still love the premise and a lot of the story.

It's fic. At the end of the day, if we're all too picky about things being perfect there... just isn't much to read. Even in a massive ship like Dramione. So I'm willing to forgive amateur authors who do things like that and frankly if you're able to get into it otherwise it's still a lot of fun as a story.

** You're not being picky. It's just a symptom of bad prose / inexperienced writing, which lowers the story's overall quality.
