Mine are as follows:

*Lady Archimedes*, linkffn(11463030), is the sequel to the popular *The Arithmancer*, linkffn(10070079)

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), is a super Harry/Ginny story with lots of sex and violence

*A Cadmean Victory*, linkffn(11446957), pairs another power Harry with Fleur. Author updates very fast

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is my current favorite story as I hyped it several times already: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4382me/fanfiction_friday/czgkv2n]]

*Patron*, linkffn(11080542), is H/Hr and involves lots of world building.

*The Accidental Animagus*, linkffn(9863146), makes Harry, the ministry, Dumbledore, and Voldemort all more competent, it's still early in the story though despite 600+k words


** I'm following the Ambiguous Artifice linkffn(10041727), and A New Kind of Normal (updates 2x/wk) linkffn(11656250).

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. New chapter twice weekly!

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** linkffn(10807718) although I'm close to giving it up as a lost cause.

It's a do-over story, but quite different. The author's soliloquies on morality and the effects on the protagonists are well done, but the characterizations are becoming increasingly divergent from their canon counterparts in a way that is making me lose interest.

** I follow Abraxas linkffn(11580650) too. Well-written, not for kids at all of course, and for once, Harry is a super OP wizard, yet he still needs his friends and superiors. And conflicts are still exciting and tense, there's no feeling of "oh Harry will solve it and nothing will go wrong".

Another story I follow is on SIYE: [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129984][splinters]]. Harry and Ginny have dreams about their past relatives, and it somehow ties in with the war against Voldemort. It's fun to read, and there's a proper mystery! The only downside is that it gravitates towards bashing slightly. Only difference is that it's all about Harry and Ginny's POV. The characters are annoyed by each other, it's not the author itself that spews his hate on the page.

*** I was really loving Abraxas right up until [[/spoiler][the nuclear bombs start to fly]]. After that, the author just lost me. I didn't find the ending satisfying. The author [[/spoiler][built up this pretty incredible world of subplots and characters and then it all just disappears into nothingness as the magicals abandon ship]]. I felt like the author had a great premise going for a long time and to be honest, it almost felt like they got tired of writing the story and took the fastest way out they could think of.

**** My first reaction to the last chapter was that I absolutely loved it. I liked the development of Harry and Ginny in the story.

BUt now that I read it a second time, I feel like it's indeed a classic case of the story going way over Brennus' head. Very, very ambitious story but it could have been so, so much more. Still, it's well written, I feel, and it's very tense and exciting. But [[/spoiler][after the nukes]], the people stopped being characters and more pawns in a very large set of events. Too detatched.

** Well, I follow a whole bunch of stories. Many of them are mediocre or guilty pleasure territory, but these are a bunch of genuinely good ones that have regular-ish updates:

linkffn(The Malfoy Case): Amazingly written post DH legal drama. My favorite WIP atm.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus): Singularly unique fic that I've been following for almost two years now. A pleasure to read.

linkffn(Grow Young With Me): Solidly written post-DH OC romance. Well known around these parts.

linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar): Hands down best HP/LotR cross ever.

linkao3(Left Hook): Very promising start. This is already one of my favorite Ginny characterizations, and the prose is Changeling-esque in its brilliance.

linkffn(Unbecoming by Turnpike): Probably pushing into guilty pleasure territory here, but I really like the writing, and the bratty protagonist has grown on me rather unexpectedly.

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

Not really. He's much less of an irredeemable psychopath. Well, he's still a psychopath, but he has reasons -- pragmatic reasons -- to try to change from his previous path. Not my favorite characterization ever, but the story portrays it convincingly.

It also has a (one-sided) Tom/Minerva thing going on, which is another one of your guilty pleasures IIRC.

I read what's already posted, and then go on to a different story without ever looking back.

**** But the thing is, I really don't have a lot of time on my hands. The first time I discovered Fanfiction was just a few years ago, and I started reading a ton of it during the Fall semester... And it just continued from there. I read it on the bus, in the library, before class, during breaks (although I do tend to watch The Office while I'm eating), when I get home from school, until I go to sleep, and sometimes when I wake up due to insomnia. I really wish I was better at prioritizing my time, but alas, I can't keep away from Hermione-centric fics /sigh/

 

And I just included the fics I'm most looking forward to for an update. There's loads more, especially since I have no qualms about reading unfinished fics.

As the case becomes more and more tense, it's obvious that the team is missing something, something big, something that could be the final puzzle piece. Will they find it in time?
