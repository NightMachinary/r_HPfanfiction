:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
TIA. I'm looking for a fic where Hermione goes back into the past. Dumbledore I believe helps her pretend to a be pureblood girl by pretending to be someone's daughter or niece. I remember there was an older women who was apart of that family that allowed her to use their name. Also at one point I believe she begins interacting with the Black family.

Note: She did not pretend to be a Potter, I have seen a few of those. And it is not the story where she pretends to be a Dumbledore either.
