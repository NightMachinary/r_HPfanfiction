I'm going to preface this with the note that while I've been reading and sometimes writing fic for about twenty years, I've only come back to writing in the HP fandom over the last year or so. Before that, it had probably been around seven or eight years since I wrote anything for public consumption or read anything beyond a random recommended one-shot. So my question is whether or not a slash fic and having a male character who is not straight is the same thing, even if the character never has a relationship within the fic. Going even further, is a fic a slash fic if there is a non-canon male relationship in the background which is not the focus of the fic or it's plot line?

Way back about ten years ago, I experienced two differing opinions on the matter. Generally speaking, I tend to write Sirius as not straight (I don't usually elaborate beyond that, because I tend to view it as something that isn't his focus nor does he have a massive interest in doing it while all hell is breaking loose) and this was true even then. Out of an 8k fic, Sirius had a brief three or four line flirtation at a pub with a guy before returning back to his friends with drinks and it was never brought up again but I was told at the time that this made it a slash fic and I needed to put that on it.

I'd had a bit of trepedation about this - I was young and queer myself, but my experience of things that were known as 'slash fics' were generally either total gay porn or intensely over the top and often out of character interrelations. I'm sure there were good ones out there, but for my experience, slash fic was almost a derogatory term used for fics that treated sexuality like it was a kink or fetish and focused only on that. I ended up pulling the fic, which I'm currently glad of because no one should read stuff that old from me.

Later, I wrote background relationships for several characters in a fic, one of which was two girls and one of which was two guys. Both had signs of the relationship, though the actual plot had nothing to do with it (it was a dare war, if I remember correctly) but there were brief hand touches, allusions to sharing beds, a brief kiss at one point and I remember getting a review saying that this was not a slash fic and I should remove that ID tag because the relationship wasn't the focus of the story, there were girls in a relationship and there was no sex scenes.

Now I'm back into ficcing, I've been wondering about this distinction. I've seen a few people request no slash and others asking for only slash so it seems like there is a set of rules to it. Is a slash fic defined as a fic which has two male characters in a relationship (regardless of whether they're gay, bi, etc) and done and dusted? Or are there more caveats to it than that? I'm genuinely curious about how the term is used and identified with in current day HP fic communities.


** IMHO, it's only slash if the M/M relationship is front and centre. What you described:

That does not count as slash.

*** I wouldn't have considered it as much either. It was about a decade ago now, so I know fandom does change it's standards (back then, you had to put anything not straight under warnings) but it's definitely good to know I'm not way off.

** Slash fics to me are fics that specifically focus on that subject. If there are relationships that are not specifically focus on it, the fic is not a slash. For example, two guys kissing in the background and it is only mentioned, that is not a slash fic.

**** There are still people in fandom who have fits of the vapors at any mention of gay relationships, especially if they're non-canon, which is going to be the case for most. The pearl-clutching isn't as common as it used to be, but it still happens, so you may get hit with "how dare you not warn for slash!" occasionally.

** I definitely agree that it's only slash if it's a shipping story where the pairing (in this case a homosexual one) is the /point/ of the story. A well-developped AU where Harry /happens/ to marry Ron five years in, even that, I would be hesitant to call it slash.

In fact, I'd go further and reduce the definition of slash to stories that make canonically straight characters (such as Harry) gay for the purpose of shipping. E.g., I don't know if I would call a Dumbledore shipping story slash.

*** Exactly what I always thought Achille! And the thread creator's point about how SLASH always seems DEROGATORY and FETISHIZING of LGBTQ people and relationships is something I've thought about them too, so I don't like the term SLASH because it makes me think of those negative portrayals. SLASH is fetishizing real people with real sexualities and real relationships. Gay people. But a story with actual real LGBTQ people isn't in any way close to SLASH.

** I would say no. I would find it personally as an LGBT person a slightly tricky situation if all fics featuring people like me were carted off into a subgenre section that the general populace coudl easily avoid, and the category of 'normal' fics was reserved only for stories that actively did not feature any LGBT characters in any capacity.

I've always understood a 'slash fic' to be a fic where the main pairing will be same-sex. It's possible that term's evolved, though - I've been in this fandom and fandom subculture in general for a long time now.

** Honestly, the gradual realization of what people DO consider “slash” has made me super uncomfortable. Like, I initially thought it just meant those very hypersexual, kinda fetishistic M/M fanfics, so “no slash” requests made sense. But the more I read this sub, the more I see people using the term derisively to refer to ANY gay content in a fic (regardless of how explicit it is or how central to the plot it is), usually accompanied by casual homophobia. As an LGBT person, it's definitely pretty unwelcoming to realize that the simple presence of any characters like myself in a story is enough to blacklist it as some weird, niche category.

I would just tag it with an M/M or F/F if any main characters have a significant queer relationship, as well as whether it's explicit or not, and not worry about some asshole demanding a warning for some background relationship.

** I agree with the others - I'd only tag it as slash if a romantic or sexual m/m relationship plays a significant role in the narrative, not for a scene where a gay/bi/pan male character flirts briefly with another man. If you're posting on AO3, you could mark it as gen and tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Queer%20Character/works][Queer]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/LGBTQ%20Character][LGBTQ]] Character or similar, just to make it clear that Sirius isn't straight so you don't get cranky comments from homophobes and canon purists.

Slash doesn't need to have a sex scene to be considered slash, though.

** I was always under the impression that slash (or femslash) referred to stories with same-sex sex scenes. Which, with the exception of mmf/ffm, I never really got, especially if the summary was already broadcasting lemons and a same sex ship.

** To me, a slash fic is a fic that has a certain undertone of male/male attraction. It doesn't even need to have an explicit sex scene, but I will still not read anythign where a male MC is romantically involved with abother male.

Quite possibly a fic like the one above will be more disturbing to me than an otherwise straight fic with a slash explicit scene without emotions involved somewhere in the middle.

** Imo if there is in any way a M/M relationship in the fic you should tag it slash. I'm honestly not sure if I am homophobic or just feel very awkward about it since I have no homosexual friends but if I get even a whiff of an M/M thing in a fic I can't help but drop it. I sometimes will get slightly triggered that the fic didn't come with a warning about it since I may have spent a decent amount of time on the fic.

This is just me personally but the bottom line should be that if one of your important characters, not necessarily the main cast, are gay/bi/whatever then you should at least put a warning up, maybe not slash if you're uncomfortable with the word but something.

** I've seen many fics with a Sirius/Remus pairing that I wasn't warned about but after reading it I just didn't care because they weren't the main characters, nor did the story ever focus on them or show any kind of private moments between them.

So the way I see it as long as stories do it like that I don't consider them slash, now if I have to read the MC flirting with someone of his own sex then that's enough for a slash tag. This is because when reading I tend to visually myself in the character's shoes, as such I don't digest well all pairings.

Still though, it is far preferable to end up getting a pedophilic pairing out of nowhere, that should be a crime... Bloody Granger always getting it on with the geriatric party
