I've recently started reading Sarcasm and Slytherin ([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648]]), but too many details remind me of Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) which I really enjoyed. My question is: Does the S&S series stop being so eerily similar to POS? In other words: Is it worth it too read Sarcasm and Slytherin or should i rather just reread POS?


** They are similar although Lily is dead in SaS. The biggest difference is that SaS moves faster compared to PoS and has fewer side plots.

***** Sorry for being unspecific, I meant when the plotlines of POS and S&S stop being similar. Because in the first few chapters, hes making the same friends, his interactions are similar and there are so many things that almost make me think one is heavily inspired by the other.

****** It already diverges in Year 2 if i remember correctly. There are some similarities in the first year and the author has addressed that issue in the author notes at some point.

I enjoy the series and prefer it to POS, so just give it a try.

** To answer your post title, not really. A lot of the tropes used in S&S are not uncommon in Slytherin!Harry stories in general, which is why they make an appearance (and are often subverted to some degree) in PoS. S&S messes with some stuff, but a lot of the tropes are played straight. Common elements in these stories include Harry being adopted by Sirius, Wormtail actually having some character development/competence, general WBWL tropes, etc. But just because the events, outcomes, etc. are much more fleshed out and feel more creative in PoS doesn't mean S&S isn't worth reading.

I'd recommend reading S&S for something new before doing a reread of Prince of Slytherin. It's not the greatest WBWL/Slytherin!Harry story I've read, but it was decent and does some decently interesting things with the plot, character relations, etc. And it develops/is published at a fairly brisk clip.

And from the 4th book of S&S, you can tell that they're going in different directions. In S&S, unlike PoS, it seems the author is going for a "sane, justified" type Voldemort- this has been done before, of course, but is definitely different from the PoS direction. Similarly, they also use the "Dumbledore hating Harry" trope, whereas Dumbledore is fundamentally a good person and on Harry's side in PoS. PoS also feels far more creative with its reinterpretation of canon elements, but also allocates a lot more "space" for those side developments.

tl;dr: just read it

By chance, do you know any other WBWL or Potter twins/siblings stories worth reading? S&S, PoS, HP and the BWL, and to some extent Antithesis are the only decent ones I found so far and I'd love to read some more.

**** Fic was too dark for me, but Too Young to Die is supposed to be good.

Also the series that starts with the definition of normal is not a twin fic, but is a decent Slytherin Harry story which is sort of similar since most twin fics have Harry in Slytherin. It hits some of the same plot beats they usually do, just without the twin part.

** The author claimed in one note to have been told by his reader that his story is very similar to PoS and then said that he must have taken inspiration subconsciously. It seems kinda funny, how they could have such a similar story and forget to remember where the ideas all came from.

​

But in it's defense, SaS goes further than PoS, and it does have a lot of original content. Inspiration from other popular fanfics is there for anyone who can see it. There's some small elements of Dodging Prison too. But the story is still good. The way Harry is being developed is clear and consistent. Though I do have an issue with some characters just never growing up and continuing to be assholes, which PoS doesn't do.

** I actually prefer S&S over PoS. PoS starts out pretty well, but after book 2 it's seemed like it jumped the shark. Which is a pity because it had so much potential. S&S is more straightforward. It's good and consistently good. I definitely think S&S is worth it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** S&S is a lot further along, so it is fairly different in that it has nothing to base itself on after year 2. Year 2 itself did feel more different than year 1 did as well. Also PoS takes all the annoying tropes WBWL fics have, and then either subverts or attempts to justify them in a more reasonable way than they are typically done. Where as S&S just has them straight out as they are normally done, so the author apparently just likes all those tropes. So S&S feels sort of like a bizarro version of PoS rather than just a copy imo.

Also as a result of those tropes a lot of characters in S&S feel like one dimensional caricatures rather than real characters, where as PoS does a better job of having its characters feel realistic, with real motivations. That said PoS gets overly complex with an absurd number of side plots, while S&S is a lot more focused on it's main story.

Even with the annoying tropes and one dimensional characters S&S is still reasonably enjoyable to read though, so if you liked PoS might as well give it a shot.

It's interesting you say that, because I got the opposite impression when reading the two fics.

The portrayal of James comes to mind especially. In book 1 of PoS, James is portrayed as a buffoon whose hatred for Harry is entirely unjustified and unrealistic to the extent that everyone with a brain in the fic thinks he is being an idiot. It's as if his sole purpose is to be a plot element who divides the cast into separate factions of irrational-Harry-haters on one side and good-people-who-like-Harry on the other. In SaS, on the other hand, James still hates Harry, but he acts like a real person in that he has strong reasons for thinking of himself as the good guy, and he hides his faults well enough that it's understandable for people to take his side.

I've heard that PoS improves a lot in later books, but in that first year the author tends to give all the dialogue to one character in each conversation while having the others just stand like cardboard cutouts to passively accept the beatdown and/or witness the awesomeness. Comparing just the first two books of each series, SaS does a much better job having its characters interact in believable ways with well-balanced dialogue.

**** Interesting. James, along with Dumbledore, are the characters I found the most ridiculous in S&S. Especially at the end of book 3. I found them to both basically just be mustache twirling villians with no justification for any of their actions. I haven't actually read book 4, so it's possible things change, but the actions revealed at the end of book 3 are pretty much unredeamable.

Where as James in PoS while his behavior is bad, does have an explanation for why he is behaving that way which is revealed in the last chapter of book 1. He's still a dick for acting that way, but it at least sort of makes sense, versus S&S where James is a colossal dick for no reason.

***** I agree that James and Dumbledore look like obvious villains in the hospital scene at the end of book 3, but I've always gotten the impression that they have deeper motivations that Harry only sees hints of. For example, they would think their actions are justified if they know that Harry is a horcrux, they think it's vital to the war effort that no one ever finds out, and they are beginning to think that Harry has been influenced/taken over by the horcrux's personality. Their actions throughout the SaS series (the trial in book 4, etc.) are consistent with that hypothesis.

Thanks for the discussion. I've always found it interesting how some readers prefer one fic over the other. I'd like to finish reading PoS one day because I hear such good things about it, but I've had trouble powering through the first book to the reach the parts people have said are better.

** I haven't read PoS yet but personally love S&S. Even though I acknowledge that it tends to fall into the tropes of Dumbledore and James bashing I thing the author portrays them well and explores their characters well enough that these tropes are enjoyable - but then again, I tend to like fics that fall into tropes if they are written well.

I'm subscribed to ther series and am loving what the other is doing with Harry's development and particularly the political side of things.
