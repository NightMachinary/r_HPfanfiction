Looking for really captivating and longish stories that leave you saying "No! It can't end like this!"


** ...every good fiction that was last updated more than six months ago yet isn't complete.

More seriously, I find any non-fixit stories in the Marauders Era to fit that description. Especially a well-written Lily. I've been looking for a fic for a while that tells the story of Lily's life starting in Year One that I read long ago, but for some reason can't remember. It did a wonderful job with all aspects of her character, particularly the tension of being a muggleborn in the shadow of the first war and summoning up the courage to push through various points of her life.

Random long James/Lily fic/series link because I'd feel bad posting without one, and J/L is the fandom's best tragedy.

** linkao3(To Make an End by JackieJLH) More of a longish one-shot, but the ending is definitely a bit of a shock.

*** Oh god, that was heartbreaking for me. I don't know why. I've certainly read darker stories. [[/spoiler][But that ending, with Hermione and Harry wanting to bring Snape back and the Snape from the destroyed past finding a new relationship with Petunia... it just crushed me.]]

  Curses. Dark curses, rather, weren't very fun at all, and certainly not when Hermione keeps waking up in a different decade because of one. At least the company wasn't half bad. Oneshot.

** linkffn(Eden by obsessmuch), fist fanfiction I have ever read and I was crying so hard at the end.

On a different note, I just finished linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) and while the ending is absolutely a happy ending, the story ends about 100 years after the war, until the heroes die (a peaceful, natural death). It's a long epilogue and while it's sweet and happy, it made me feel so sad. I prefer when the epilogue just says what happened to them, which house their kids went to, stuff like that. This ending was a bit too unintentionally bittersweet for me.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
