*Obligatory: This is my first time writing a Harry Potter fanfic that is really meta, so please be easy on me. Thanks and enjoy the story.*

​

“Look, Katy, I understand I am not giving you enough love but can give me another chance. I just have been super busy,” I beg, “Ok, thank you. I will pick you up right after...” I notice this family that appears out of nowhere in the middle of the street. I swerve my car out of the way in order not to hit them.

“Shit, shit, shit,” I said as I was getting out my car, “Please tell me I didn't hit anybody.” I looked around and notice no one got hurt. The family that was in the way came towards me. They were what I can tell a family of either 8 or 6 with two friends of theirs. But something caught my eye.

“Holy shit, aren't you Daniel Radcliff?” I asked pointing to the black hair kid.

“Who?” ask the black hair kid.

“Daniel Radcliff. You know the guy who played Harry Potter.” I explain.

“I am sorry, but my name is Harry Potter.” said the black-haired kid.

“ Yeah, and I am Jesus. C'mon really, magic ain't real. Unless you count films and shows. Hell, the only time I have seen magic is whenever I do drugs.” I exclaim.

As I was talking, the dirty brown hair girl came close to my car and pulled out a stick.

“/Repairo/,” said the girl.

As she said this the stick glow and where my car has the dents, it disappears.

“Good, we have your attention, now listen to what I have to say. My name is Hermione Granger, this is Harry Potter, and those are the Weasleys. We are trying to escape the Death Eaters and when we were using apparition, one of them cast a spell that hit all of us. I think the spell transported us to your world. We need to get to London or this world's version of the Wizarding world. So are you willing to help us out?” said the brown hair girl.

“Well, look I understand you guys are in the wrong world, but what is in it for me. Seriously, I am going to be doing a mission to protect you guys and gals and I feel like I will be expendable. Also, how do you know if these death eaters aren't chasing you right now....”

As soon as I said that, I just saw black smoke covering us and 4 people in masks appear out of nowhere attacking the family and me.

“I shouldn't have said that,” I said to myself.

I ran into my car and start the engine. Rolling my windows I yell, “If you guys don't want to die, then jump in.”

The family jumped in and as I step on the gas I saw a man's pale face looking at me. The car engine started to turn off.

“C'mon, c'mon you fucking piece of shit work. C'mon.” As I was trying to get the car to work, the death eaters started to slowly crowd my car.

“Sir, they're coming, can you get us out of here?” asked Hermione.

“I am trying to, the car is not starting. You know what, fuck it.” I said as I went to my glove box and took out a handgun. I open up the window and shot at the closest death eater. /Bang./ That death eater went down. I shot another shot. /Bang./ Another went down. As soon as I shot another one, they started to disappear. The pale man disappear and the car engine started.

“I guess those were the death eaters, huh. Fuck my life.” I said to myself as I drove the car.


** ...I like it, although I think the text feels a bit rough-ish. However, that same roughness does works with the suddenness of the situation your character is now stuck with. Personally, I would try to flesh things out by bits between dialogue by adding a few tiny descriptions. Nevertheless, it's a good first try.

*** Ok thank you, I actually started on the second part so I am planning a lot for the main character. There is an idea that is running in my head about how the lack of magic can actually hurt the Harry Potter gang and the death eaters. But I don't know if I should add it.

**** "lack of magic"? What do you mean? As in, while in our Earth, their magic is finite and run the risk of running out or something like that?

***** Yeah, pretty much. I was thinking it can help put some suspense to it. Or creativity. Like the longer they stay in the world, the more they become muggles.

****** It's your story, so I'd say to go for it. I would go for the secrecy aspect, and what it means for them to be here. Think about it, suddenly these fictional character are living and breathing in our world? If they are real, is every story we made real too? What could happen if the world found out Harry Potter and his band existed? Or the chaos the Death Eaters could unleash in a world were THEY are the only magicals? Sorry, I'm just rambling at this point.
