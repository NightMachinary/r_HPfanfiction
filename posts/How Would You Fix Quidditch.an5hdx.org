Lots of criticisms have been made of Quidditch in HP canon in terms of whether or not its rules make sense, the potential for disparity in team brooms, and so on. How would you fix these problems and others in your stories?


** I'd change the Snitch value to something like 55 or 75, A so the Seeker's job is less all in on catching the snitch, but a team with a good seeker can rely on him to end the game when they need to but can also use them in a offensive formation. Also I really don't like Ties, so by relying on the snitch to end the game ensures that there is no tie.

Bludgers don't target people like red shells in Mario Kart, but instead fly in straight lines, Reversing off of the limits of the playing area. Also if hit hard enough by any player they will change direction so if you want to risk the damage to your arm/hand/foot/broom you can send the bludger off.

I'd like to see penalty boxes like Hockey and Lacrosse where a penalty doesn't automatically mean a penalty shot but causes a man up/down situation.

**** yeah, I'm saying i would change that, so they won't even veer towards the nearest player, it has to be accurately hit at the player or even in the right direction to intercept. there can be mind games with using the bludger to force a player to change direction, players not juking, trying to outrun a bludger to pass it rather than be hit by it on the same trajectory. stuff that wouldn't happen when you know that the blunger will start chasing them if you just send it in close to them.

** Use the seeker as fourth chaser.

Focus more on the commentary when describing scenes. Use English Football commentary as an example and stick with simple terminology (pass, cross, block, tackle).

The game itself is fine, but seekers do jack shit for most of the match. Hence describing what the seeker is doing leads to boring scenes.

**** Here is an example of a match I wrote with that in mind. Quidditch World Cup, Group Stage Lithuania vs Holstein in Holyhead, where the local stadion is made of platforms floating on the sea. The names are italic on FFN, but using Reddit's formatting to replicate that would be a pain. Also, Lithuanian names are gendered and the female ones have different endings depending on marital status. Researching that took hours.

#+begin_quote
  "And here they come! Captain Lina Paulauskaité once more leading Nojus Jonatis and Rasa Minkuté into the fray. Marko Oginskis and Rytas Ramius are watching their backs while Kalnietis and Gabija Rimsaité will play their parts. Their performance has been nothing short of astonishing so far and the critics have been shut up by the youngest team in this competition. All of them have received numerous offers from European top teams and as of Yesterday, Lina is our newest Harpy. Ladies and Gentlemen lets give her a thundering welcome!"

  The crowd went wild for several minutes, pushing the concealing magic to its limits. While there were spectators from all over the world present, the majority were still Holyhead fans and more than happy about the latest addition to their team.

  "And our German guests, with keeper Franz Möller leading them out over the waves. Möller played a superb season with QV Königsberg, making it into the European Semifinals and conceding only seven goals on average throughout sixty-one games. Mark Petersen and Fritz Jensen form his last line of defence while Claudia Schmidt, Marlene Thomsen and Simon Andersen are Holstein's backbone. And finally recovered from her shattered leg, Petra Hansen. Her quick catch against Japan and wonderful interferences during the Venice match made it pretty clear that she is back to her old self."

  "Today's referee, Carlos de la Cruz, just completed his final examination of the balls and the game is about to begin. There's the Golden Snitch, followed by the Bludgers. The Quaffle goes up and they are away."

  "There's a furball and possession changes back and forth. Jonatis gets away and he is alone against Möller and Möller shows why he's one of Europe's best with his aggressive defending. Jonatis lost the Quaffle but gets a Bludger instead. Meanwhile, Thomsen and Schmidt are already in the Lithuanian half. Oginskis chooses to slam one of the iron balls at Hansen for some reason, misses and Holstein gets an easy two on one goal. Zero ten and Paulauskaité tries to get some control back."

  "Now Lithuania is making the game wide with Minkuté flying above the guest stands while her teammates spread out but the German team is not impressed and they form a tight defence around their goals, letting them make the long crosses. Passed to Paulauskaité, then to Jonatis who crosses to Minkuté. Thomsen tries comes out to intercept - And that's a foul. Looks like Thomsen hit Minkuté's shoulder with her foot and Lithuania gets a penalty. Already taken and Jonatis fails to get around Möller, Schmidt catches the rebound but Paulauskaité takes the Quaffle from him and scores. Ten both."

  "Now Andersen makes a dash for it, gets nailed by Oginskis and Jonatis shoots only to be denied once more by Möller. If this will go on the boy will end up with nightmares about Holstein's captain. Thomsen with the counter, gets around Minkuté, only Kalnietis remaining, who takes an aggressive stance and gets outplayed by a pass to Schmidt, who scores. Ten to Twenty and now Lithuania back in possession."

  "Paulauskaité takes matters into her own hands now and charges down the field. Dodges a Bludger and goes around Schmidt and it's just her and the Keeper. Come on Lina, she shoots, no wait, that was a faint, Möller dived right and Paulauskaité leisurely throws it through the middle hoop. Twenty both!"

  The match fell into a pattern at this point. The Baltic team breached Holstein's defences with relative ease but their keeper kept them in the game with countless saves which would have made Oliver Wood green with envy. Holstein's offence, on the other hand, was based on quick counters which were not as frequent as Lithuania's attempts but more successful.

  Two hours and fifty-eight goals later exhaustion became the biggest issue as mistakes became more common. The breakneck speed from the opening hour had faded away and was replaced by a more controlled pace but the game was far from boring. Harry was amazed at how well the Seekers were helping their Chasers by being decoys and drawing Bludgers away from their team or playing chicken with their opponents. The Gryffindor saw over a dozen plays which he wanted to try in the upcoming season.

  "And now Holstein with Thomsen coming in from the right, crosses to - IS THAT THE SNITCH? Hansen in a corkscrew dive, Rimsaité is on the other side of the pitch and does not look like she knows what Hansen saw. Holstein's seeker now with an outstretched arm and she - OWWW, that had to hurt. Hansen goes for a swim as Ramius slammed a Bludger at her and hit her square in the back. The referee is flying over to fish her out of the water and it looks like the Snitch disappeared again. Holsteins coach is signalling for a timeout to get his seeker a new broom - AND IT IS OVER. RIMSAITÉ ENDED THE GAME WHEN NO ONE WAS WATCHING HER. LITHUANIA WINS 420 TO 310. What a finish to a spectacular game. I think you all here spent your Galleons wisely when you bought yourself a ticket because that was a game we will be talking about for a long time. Truly a performance worthy of the knockout stage, which will return to Holyhead on the fourteenth - "

** - Catching the Snitch ends the game, but scores no points or just minor points (1-2 quaffle goals)

- time limit is 3 hours

That's it.

Edit: * maybe consider addition of high point scoring for fancy throws like in basketball.

Edit 2: Just to elaborate on the snitch. I hate that there's very little to no tactical component to the snitch. Catching the snitch is almost always a good thing. If on the other hand the snitch scores no, or almost no, points it will be a regular occurrence that the team that's behind has to have a seeker that is a good at running interference, preventing the other seeker from catching the snitch, instead of just good at catching.

I agree, but in tennis this happens because the players are constantly neck and neck. In Quidditch it is possible (and even likely the longer the match goes on) that one team has no more hopes of winning. Maybe the time limit should only be invoked if one team leads by a margin of >100 points.

** I've presented this before, in case some find it familiar

#+begin_quote
  And in sports today...

  Chairman Hassan Mostafa wrapped up the third day of pre-season hearings by the International Association of Quidditch for consideration of rule changes in the Wizarding World's most popular sport.

  Much of the controversy in this year's hearings came from the office of the British Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, or rather from the spokeswitch of that Department, Hermione Weasley. Mrs. Weasley's exhaustive rule set and arithmantic proof of 'enhanced entertainment value' for her proposed Millenium Quidditch was reported to count at 1043 feet of scroll.

  Thankfully, in anticipation of the proposal's review, Mrs. Weasley has provided us a highlight of the most significant rule changes:

  - The three goal hoops are to vary in size and point value. The center hoop is to be made half as large, to be worth 20 points. The left hoop would be enlarged to twice size but worth only 5 points and the right hoop is left at standard size and point value.

  - The snitch is to be worth 42 points, making a tie game impossible. It isn't released onto the pitch until ten minutes after quaffle play has commenced. A Protean charm on the snitch closes the hoops of both teams the moment the snitch considers itself caught.

  - Brooms are to be shared- that is, everyone brings a broom for the pile, but the team captains pick from those brooms available to equip their players; by doing so, there would be little chance of disparity in the performance of the equipment. Choosing starts with a coin toss, and the captains will be challenged to stay familiar with the capabilities of all official brooms.

  Chairman Mostafa today declared that the proposal will require serious consideration, but that Mrs. Weasley's lack of brevity has consigned any decision on its merits to be delayed until next year's pre-season hearing.

  Mr. Ragmar Dorkins' proposal to change the value of the snitch to 250 points has once again been heard and denied. Mr. Dorkins, as many readers know, is the Manager for the Chudley Cannons. His analysis that such a change would result in the Cannons being more competitive was met with some sympathy. He was given a plate of cannoli.

** The main thing I would do would be to institute a time limit, because I think it is absurd that a Quidditch game does not end after a reasonable interval of time. Like say, the game is played in two halves of, I dunno, a maximum of 3 hours each. And if the Snitch has not been caught at the end of the second half, the game ends regardless, and the winner is whichever team has the highest score. If the score is tied, it goes into overtime(max 2 hours), which ends /automatically/ as soon as the score is no longer tied.

*** Test Cricket goes for 5 or so days doesn't it? I'm sure the time limit can be one form of the game - maybe even write is as a fad among younger kids.

That said, overtime golden goal as a rule is flawed. Especially considering that each time routinely averages >10 goals/hr (based on a rough estimate of the Quidditch world cup). A shorter time period or a penalty shootout is probably preferable.

Last, overtime is strictly for knockout tournaments. Outside of the world cup, league play will allow ties and will use point differential/snitch catches/etc to break ties. Note that the Hogwards Quidditch League used points differential (that's why Gryffindor needed to win by 200 points).

**** In my opinion, bludgers also inject an element of danger that is integral to the canon's worldbuilding. I think that Muggle society advanced culturally largely as a result of the development of new technologies created to solve problems that are nonexistent in a world governed by magic. Because the wizarding world didn't need to innovate and progress in the same way, I think wizard culture is largely still stuck in the middle ages when the idea of safety regulations was unheard of. Plus, magic allows you to deal with injury much better than Muggle medicine so a few broken bones is much less of a big deal.

- Make the snitch more likely to spawn for the team currently in the lead. It gives the rest of the team more importance as they have an actual motivation to score points, and it makes catching the snitch, if your team is losing, even more impressive.

** Nothing.

People often forget that Quidditch games, outside of Hogwarts, lasted loooooong. They have rules for when a game lasts longer than a day so you can reasonably assume that kind of thing happens in regular intervals. That means the scores probably reach high enough that the snitch, while still important, isn't actually enough to win a game by itself. Krum, the world's greatest seeker, lost the world cup due to such circumstances.

And about changing the bludgers, there are no rules against healing a player who is injured in the field. I'd wager if there was an injury --- let's say a broken arm --- a nurse or a healer would cast the bone knitting charm, and if Poppy Pomfrey's words to Harry in CoS can be taken at face value (duh!), means healing a broken bone wouldn't take more than half an hour, if that long. Honestly, that actually would make the game all the more fun, one team having to give hundred and ten percent while the other bombard the opposition to reap the rewards. To further compound this, we have the Irish seeker who returns to the field after plowing to the ground at high speeds, twice.

With brooms, I'd say take a look at the sports teams around the world. Even lower league teams can usually buy the best stuff.

Now that I've channeled my inner-Ron, it is time to get serious.

I can't believe you would waste your time with such ridiculous things when you could be out there, gathering signatures for this new House-Elf Protection Act!

CoS shows that just having better brooms is enough to give you a much better chance to win, and the school cannot really seem to afford to match that for all the teams.

First one would be, Krum's catch didn't actually made sense as they still lost so the gamblers might have assumed if the score got to that point, the Irish would also catch the snitch because Krum would hesitate. Or they might have assumed Krum is far too good to allow the Irish to get such a lead, that he would have ended the game by that point.

But yeah, I concede this point to you.

** Reduce the pint value of the snitch to 100 points instead of 150. Change nothing else, this still allows for the seeker position to be what JK wanted, but it also makes it more possible for the game to be won by the chasers instead of having thier contributions be all but irrelevant except for when the game is a total steamroll anyway.

I believe it would make the teamwork aspect if Quidditch more integral to the game, as the snitch is less of a trump card than it used to be. An argument could be made that needing a greater than 10 goal lead in order to beat the snitch is still too much, in which case I'd say reduce the snitch value to 50, and change the seeker slightly so that they can either essentially act as a fourth chaser when not hunting the snitch, or make it so that they can enter the keeper area to help defend the goals. Although the second ootion is (in my opinion) much less sensible compared to the first, as it would be very easy to have the seeker and keeper each float in the gaps between the hoops to be able to completely stonewall the opposing offense with a rapid response regardless of which goal hoop they send the quaffel at.

But now that I think about it... The fact that Chasers are scoring a lot more probably means that offense is overpowered in Quidditch. Like in football, actual scores tend to be pretty low. But if the Quidditch World Cup is on the upper end of scoring, that suggests even average teams are scoring quite a bit. Maybe the number of hoops should be 2 instead of 3.

- In single-legged cup matches (when tiebreakers are necessary), the team which caught the Snitch wins in the case of a tie.
- Make the Snitch significantly easier to catch. It should be a competition between two seekers, not between the seeker and a ball. It could even get easier over time in order to avoid very short games but discourage excessively long ones.

I don't think brooms can make for more disparity than having players of vastly differing skill can, like in football. Imagine the likes of Real Madrid/Juventus/PSG/Manchester City playing some Chinese League teams in a tournament.

I don't think there is anything problematic with canon-Quidditch at all, including things like the snitch being the equivalent of 15 goals - in high scoring matches that go to hundreds of points (say a margin of 430-620), the snitch wouldn't matter at all. It can also balance out teams that have a strong chaser line-up with those who have a strong seeker.

Most ff authors have no idea what they're doing when it comes to Quidditch. I've seen this scenario too many times to count, where the author writes a match between A and B, and has B's chasers /dominating/. After B wins, the author puts a final scoreline like 210-270 (after the snitch has been caught).

I mean...that's not a dominating performance by B's chasers at all.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

And it's quite clearly shown that that disparity was quite easily overcome by Gryffindor's more talented players. In spite of having vastly inferior brooms (Harry's N2000 was the best by far on Team G, which is why they were so excited about it in Book 1), Slytherin were unable to take a lead of over 14/15 goals. In the book, Harry has to dodge the bludger for quite a long period of time, and had Fred try and shield him from the bludger for a considerable period of time.

Even with inferior brooms, and having a beater being pre-occupied (which is 50% more pressure from Slytherin), Slytherin still didn't score enough goals.

In fact, there's no line in the entire chapter that says Gryffindor scores even a /single/ goal, and Harry says its because of Slytherin's better brooms. They only win because of the Snitch, showing that at school brooms matter incredibly much and the Snitch is too valuable. Harry ended the match quickly, which was the only reason Slytherin didn't win.

  Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.

  And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer --

  Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead --

  "Go! Go! Go!" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy -- Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him -- he was at Malfoy's ankles -- he was level --

  Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and --

** Legit just have more games. Standings depend on a combination of number of wins and overall point totals, but I think that seasons should be played more like hockey. At the Hogwarts level, I'd say a minimum of 3 games per month from October to April, each of the four teams getting one bye week of every four. For the pro league, why not have them play like 80 games a year? The snitch would still matter a lot during a game but a good chaser squad could significantly affect the standings across long periods of time.

I'd also probably cap the length of the game to avoid absurdity. Maybe to 7 hrs? Then the team with the most points scored wins, or they got to a sudden death shootout.

I'd also allow substitutions. A team should have a full backup team. However I think the seeker should only be allowed to switch once - once you're out, you're out, and if your replacement gets KO'd or something, then you forfeit.

Clearly, the quaffle should either have no shape, or have multiple shapes simultaneously. This looks like an overlooked fact, James Potter was good at transfiguration and he no longer has a form, ergo he was good at quaffling. Sirius has multiple forms, therefore he, too, is good at manipulating things with multiple forms.

** I think quidditch is shit without even addressing the snitch problem. A half decent chaser should be able to just fly to the other side and score at will. Its impossible to defend three hoops with just one person (the hoops are pretty far apart according to the movies), bludgers are easily dodgable (Harry had one cursed on him and caught the snitch anyway, and hitting a moving target is way harder than dodging) and iirc chasers cant really manhandle the other team when they are on defense.

Now for some sports analogies to further reinforce how impossible defense would be.

Its like handball, except the keeper has to cover a way bigger area, is less mobile over a short timeframe, you have to defend an extra dimension, and defenders cant aggressively grab the other team. In handball, goals are already scored on like 40% of possessions, and defense is allowed to be extremely rough.

Basketball is closer in terms of how aggressive defenders can be, with the simple change that you are shooting at a comparably very small hoop and travelling exists, so you cant just hug the ball and stroll to the basket. Again, I would say about 40% of possessions result in scoring, nba average is a little over 1 point per possession.

I think the magical sport of choice should obviously be dueling or team battles. The latter gives you everything that you could possibly want from quidditch as a plot point: one man army is very much a real concept, you can make first years useful by limiting what spells can be cast (perhaps have different roles, like in quidditch, with different limitations), team spirit, and it can have huge variety.

While I am here I would also like to complain about how shit chess is in ff, or fiction in general. Anyone that is half decent at it wont get "lured in a trap" without realizing they are in a bad spot and then checkmated two moves later. Half decent here is a very low bar, I would consider everyone I have ever played with at least half decent.

*** Good points. I mentioned in another comment how overpowered offense is in Quidditch. I know it's not a perfect example considering it was the finals, but the Quidditch World Cup had Ireland score like 18 goals while Bulgaria had 1 and apparently it ended very quickly for a finals. If even pro Keepers can't stop the Chasers from scoring virtually at will then no one else has a chance. it's like the opposite of football, where scoring is rather rare by comparison. That there is three friggin hoops would make keeping suck enormous ass.

Magical capture-the-flag could be fun to read or watch. The Switching Spell would be incredibly OP in it though, heh. Actually, that spell should be incredibly useful in general...

Honestly, I'm not great at chess myself but fiction does make it really dumb most of the time. The "traps" are obvious in those cases as long as you know how the pieces move. 😑

** Abolish the snitch and you've got a decent, if not exceptional game.

The seeker can easily be turned into game makers like in basketball and it still would be a good role for fast flyers but a lot more tactical and less isolated from the main game.

** Snitch worth 33 or 55 points

and maybe give the different loops a different worth, like the middle loop is worth more, because it would normally the best-guarded one, but it would the casers a bit tactic in their play, go for the more easy shot on the sides or full on past the keeper.

Give it more of a handball feeling, with times out but keep the penalty shots, include more back-up players, like you could switch a beater for another chaser for a few minutes if you want to.

And like handball just play faster with more goals on a professional level around one goal per minute is reasonable

** I read a fanfic that changed the snitch to an additional 10% to the seeker's team's score and allowing seekers to be a 4th chaser when not actively chasing down the winged walnut. Personally I think that the 4th chaser bit was mostly a narrative change in order to make Harry's camraderie with his quidditch team more believable, but the snitch score was a change I liked

** Honestly its hard to quantify. It depends truly how difficult it is to get the snitch. And the average time it would take to grab it. Throwing it through the hoop is fine for Chasers. A lawz fanfiction would be an muggle trying to apply advanced analytics to quiditch and seeing the result.

** I'd make it a legal move to smack each other with the beater's bats. Everyone gets bats and lots of padding. Okay but being serious I think that scoring with the quaffle should be more points, and catching the snitch less - like quaffle 20/30 points and the snitch 50 points. That way both skills are recognised without making one super overpowered.

** Anytime you have a thing that can only happen once a game you should use it to prevent any ties.

*Make the snitch worth 15 points. One goal and it wins ties.\\
*Disparity in equipment is a problem, but not like the schools fund that stuff most of the time. No reasonable solution, but it is surprising there isn't legacy student's funding for this.\\
*For school play, not necessarily pro level, put a fucking safety net or magical equivalent. The only reason no one died is JK didn't want one to, there has to be a ton of deaths.\\
*Make the snitch easier and easier to spot over time. No time limit, but have it so the beaters have to play protection for the snitch against the enemy seeker if you're behind. I kinda like the quirky insane possibility for time. Also, so far as I can tell, time really isn't that big of a concern for wizards.\\
*Finally let the seeker be able to work as chaser. If this is the case, probably revise the snitch points back up to 35 or 45 so it is a harder decision. Actually maybe even 155, 33% more chaser is a hell of an advantage.

*** Good stuff. Should note part of the reason no one seems to die (not often anyway) is because wizards are a lot more durable than Muggles. We see that Irish seeker in the world cup fly into the ground on a Firebolt without slowing down. Twice in fact. He only had like a concussion or something. Hell, Bludgers are balls of iron that are supposed to slam into players at high speed.

Granted, there should be some kind of spell to slow things down nearer the ground, though I guess that means the Snitch can't go too low otherwise no one can get it.

** I've figured that either 1) the snitches need to be retuned to better scale with current equipment. Faster brooms and more training have trivialized the snitch. or 2) the hogwarts snitch is just slower than professional ones.

** Catching the snitch earns one point.

That way, if the scores are tied, catching it still wins the game. But if the seeker's team is behind, their role changes from catching the snitch to defending it from the opposition's seeker, in order to give their chasers time to score and overtake.

In dramatic terms, this would have still worked. Harry could still be the match-winning hero when needed, Krum could have still ended the World Cup match "on his terms" and so on,

** Make a game be a best of three rounds. Each round lasts 40 minutes or until the snitch is caught. The snitch is worth 25 points instead of 150, and the team with the highest score wins the round. The seeker can (if they want) act sort of like a queen in chess, helping or disrupting chaser plays and so on. This still gives the seeker a lot of influence, but doesn't make it so they often can single-handedly determine the outcome of a match, and makes their role much more strategic.

** For a mock-up I wrote a while back, I made the game last for a standard of 2 1/2 hours, where the snitch appears once per 30 minutes, but it is at a random time within those 30 minutes. Snitch is valued at 50 points. This makes the Seeker still have to look for the Snitch near-constantly, but also can be used during regular team play. Also, since the last Snitch 'spawns' every 30 minutes, it will spawn during the end of the 2 1/2 hours as well. In this case, the game is played on until the final Snitch is caught, allowing for comebacks, if the Seekers can stall one another until their team has caught up.
