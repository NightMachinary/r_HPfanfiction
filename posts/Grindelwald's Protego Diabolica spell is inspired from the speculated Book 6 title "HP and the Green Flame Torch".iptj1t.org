** I mean, I highly doubt that JKR is taking inspiration from fan rumors back in the early 2000s but it is a fairly nice coincidence. Also, the rumor had a flame that healed good and destroyed evil, not loved ones and enemies.

Edit: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20010804142856/http://www.geocities.com/jeffvg/rumors.htm][Link tor the site]] where the green flame rumor is mentioned for those interested. Most of the rumors seem like obvious guesses and the ones that are more far-fetched, like this one, did not happen like Fleur becoming a Hogwarts teacher.

*** Do you know if JK had confirmed prior to book 7 that Snape was in fact a good guy because he was in love with a woman? I think that and the fact that Harry's eyes will play a big role in the last book were two of the most speculated predictions.

Also I forgot exactly what the green flame torch was supposed to do but other than Voldemort who has delved so deeply in the dark arts, good and evil are quite subjective concepts. For instance, if we were to trust the theory that Hermione took Umbridge to the centaurs to have her raped, she would be no safer from the torch than, say, Umbridge.

**** Sorry about deleting the comment starting a new parent chain. It was meant to be a reply here.

Snape was an obvious guess, there were hints before the last book. Snape's sacrifice arc was hinted at ever since the first book. I'd put the guesses on the same level as guessing that Hermione would become prefect, and one of Harry's classmates becoming a Hogwarts teacher. This "ifI' is a bit confusing. Do you mean that she confirmed that he was "a good guy" before the last book?

  Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world

  This was all I found for a quote on Snape's character. Her other comments suggest that she doesn't think Snape falls into "evil" or "good" as well.

Good and evil are not quite as subjective in the magical world as they are in real life, which stems from a lot of things, JKR's inspiration among them. Love is a tangible concept that can be studied, horcruxes are directly evil and are evil objects, and you can taint your soul. In any event, the difference between good and evil and enemies and loved ones are very different. And differs even more from Protego Diabolica's actual function.

And of course, and most importantly, I very much doubt JKR is trolling now-defunct fan sites from 2001 looking for inspiration.

** If I am not wrong, the protego diabolica spell in the movie, produced bluish-white flames, not green. And if we are being complete cannon, the spell is supposed to create a black ring of flames that competely wiped out enemeis while letting his followers walk through it, however it was changed to blue flames in the movies because the background was dark and the flames would not be properly visible. I am not really sure if the speculated title of HBP has any kind of relation to the Protego Diabolica, as it would be very out of character for JKR to do such a thing
