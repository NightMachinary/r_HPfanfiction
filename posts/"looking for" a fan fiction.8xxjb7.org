"fic search" I'm not sure if this is the right place or not but I am trying to find a fan fiction that I read awhile ago. I cant' remember exactly what happened in it but the only thing I remember is that near the beginning Harry and Dobby bonded and then Dobby bought harry a trunk that he could live in and Harry had multiple wives/girlfriends. I also remember that Neville had multiple trunks as well as multiple wives/girlfriends, and the whole family lived in the trunks. I also remember that there were hundreds of house elves and I think (although i might be wrong) that it was a time travel fic.


** Probably "Not Normal"

*** This sounds like the worst possible tropy-fest fanfic ever created. Is it?

**** I don't remember details, but it certainly has its share of tropes taken to the max. It has trunks that do contain entire estates - estates large enough to use as a farm with dozens if not hundreds of workers. And, IIRC, some special estate law that allows you to hold a trial for an accused or something,

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.
