Something akin to *C'est La Vie* by /cywscross/ or *Stages of Hope* by /kayly silverstorm/.

There's one I have in the back of my mind where Lily confesses that she prefers OG Harry to her own son, but I don't know if I'm just making that up or not.


** linkffn(9704180) "I'm Still Here" by kathryn518 It has a female alternate and other bits of AU, but it's good for what it is.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** linkffn(Too Far from home; Imprisioned Realm; A Black Comedy) TFFH is really angsty, with minor mentions of child abuse. I honestly loved the slow pace, but would really like for more updates.

IR is extremely, really reallly really fucking dark, with several mentions and situations of rape and torture, with a rather graphical descriptions of the wounds inflicted by it, but if you can stomach it, its really fucking good, with a brilliant world development and characterization. Its really really well done, but as I said, dark as fuck.

BC is really a crack/fun but with some interesting magic and it is another realm as well, although it isn't exactly what you wanted.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
