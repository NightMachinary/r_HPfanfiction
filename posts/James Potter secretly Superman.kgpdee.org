Any fics where instead of crash landing in Smallville and getting adopted by the Kents, Kal Els ship lands in the UK and he gets adopted by the Potters and named James? Maybe his powers could get magically sealed, and Harry ends up getting born as a human/kryptonian hybrid? I saw this fan made image that someone made of a Marauders era movie, and James Potter looked like Clark Kent in robes, and figured it would make for an interesting AU.

Or a fun power wank. Either one.

** Invincible by Kathryn518 is pretty much this - James father is a superman-expy, events still happen roughly as canon and then shit starts at the graveyard scene. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11779002/1/Invincible]]

** It's not quite what you're asking for, but linkffn(The Last Mage of Krypton) has the real Harry being stillborn due to a curse while Kal-El is borne to them as the seventh month dies. J&L adopt the new baby to replace the one they lost. Great fic, well worth a read.
