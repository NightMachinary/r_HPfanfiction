I'm looking for Godlike Harry, but he knows it, but thinks everyone else is completely capable of the same thing. Somewhat like how Lily from Lily and the art of being a Sisyphus, is able to use her glitches to actively rip apart reality and cause havoc.


** I'd like to see a Godlike Harry where people mostly ignore what he's saying now and instead constantly repeat out of context quotes of things he said years ago. Everyone has a different idea of what Harry's opinion is and nobody actually asks him. And a bunch of people think he doesn't exist at all.

** Reading through your rec thinking, "Oh,they're going to love the Art of Sisyphus!" And you did lol.

As for my rec, it takes a WHILE to get into Harry's crazy abilities but he does casually break a lot of laws and is constantly baffled by why other people can't as well.

1st. My favorite fic of all time is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225][The secret language of plants]] . I had originally done the linkao3 thing, but it linked to the second fic in the series, so I've edited this comment to have this link to the first fic in the series.

2nd. Same author; this is in my top 3 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897]])

  The stupid hat was stupid and refused to help Harry. The whole school and its division in houses was stupid too, and the teachers.Harry was in Hogwarts, but he didn't want to be. He wanted to go back home.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
