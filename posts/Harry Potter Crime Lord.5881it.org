What are some of the best fics where Harry runs crime in the wizarding world. Please no slash, thank you!

Preferably long enough to last a while.

Not really sure how to use linka03. It's a one-shot where Harry emulates Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes.

** There was a nice discussion about Stoner/Druggie Harry a few weeks ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/52p240/stonerdruggie_harry/]]

And then there is a plot bunny by Starfox5:

#+begin_quote
  I'd prefer a story where Harry is the heir of a criminal syndicate, in Wizarding Britain. James and Lily fought Voldemort, but were not part of the Order, but allies of Dumbledore out of neccessity. After their deaths, Remus kept it running, but couldn't approach Harry because that would have exposed him to the authorites. Sirius is in Azkaban because the DMLE finally could pin something on him. Dumbledore knew the charges were false, but since Sirius dodged murder charges before, he thought it was karma catching up with the man. Snape hates James for dragging Lily into a world of crime and vice, and thinks Harry will do the same. He also hates Sirius and Remus for almost killing him and making it look like a tragic accident with a werewolf, James only saved him beause Lily told him to. Petunia and Vernon hated Lily and James not because of magic, but because they ran drugs, protection rackets and an escort service - they are not lying when they tell him Lily and James were criminals.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

** Been a long time lurker, finally signed up for an account.

I am actually working on a crossover fic (not published anywhere yet) that has Harry raised by Michael Corleone in a Godfather universe crossover. My difficulty is staying true to Puzo's rather ... specific ... prose style, rather than that of Rowling. I will try to get a chapter or two of it up this weekend.

  Much to his displeasure, Harry is thrown back through time into his six year old body. As a result, Harry decides to contort the timeline, purely for his own amusement.
