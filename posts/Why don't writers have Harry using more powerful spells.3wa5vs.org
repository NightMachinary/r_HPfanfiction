Whenever I read a story about a strong,badass Harry they always ruin it for me by making his most powerful spell a stupefy. I'm not saying he has use the unforgivable's but he can still use exploding curses or cutters or something that actually causes damage.


** If anything, the opposite is true. Plenty of "indy" Harry has him throwing around random overpowered spells without any thought or creativity put into them.

** When it comes to the direct-hit spells, Stupefy seems to be the strongest spell before it gets potentially lethal.

What I wonder is why people don't get creative with combat-transfiguration, charms and whatnot.

** If you want tough Harrys, here are some examples:

In *Aspirations*, linkffn(4545504), Harry and his private army are using dark spells en galore.

In *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), Harry is a Fiendfyre expert.

In *Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925), Harry uses a combo of lethal spells and Gryffindor sword.

In *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), Harry uses a combo of dark spells and muggle weapons.

I personally like darker Harry (not evil) stories, in which he forms a "killer couple" team with a girl of his choice (preferably Ginny or Hermione).

Stupefy is a decent spell, but is easily blocked by a protego. I'm not sure whether protego works against crucio or not. If not, then Harry's crucio is effectively a shield piercing stupefy.

**** You apparently did not pay attention to details in the book.

Harry could never get cruciatus right. When he threw crucio at Bellatrix in the ministry, he stunned her instead. Later he casted crucio at Amycus Carrow and stunned him again.

So in Harry's case, his cruciatus is effectively a shield piercing (if) stunner.

** To be honest, unless you want to kill people as opposed to just incapacitating them, I'm not sure if using the spells you'd proposed is a good idea.

Also, canon Harry is quite “gentle” in fights, generally mostly sticking to the disarmer (Expelliarmus), so it would be hard to have him suddenly turn into a sadist without it going out of character.

**** Yes and no. It is to explore the possibilities, which sometimes results in things being much different and the characters being not the same. And I am fine with that.

Some authors do, however, make Harry “basically the same as canon Harry but more powerful” and that for whatever reason (that actually isn't shown, or at least no /believable/ reason that is shown) causes him to stop using the usual repertoire of spells he'd used and resort to using things that are much more vicious. And that is, due to lack of anything that would lead Harry to actually being different in those cases, incredibly out-of-character.

Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with characters being changed. Just, you know, have a reason for the change. And for Harry it can be (depending on what you are trying to write) hard to find a believable reason for why he's suddenly fine with using lethal spells on everything and everyone.

Or for a crazy step up from /stupefy/ you could read linkffn(6763981). Final chapter has giant flaming conjured balistas, fields of fiendfyre, something or other that is worse than fiendfyre also, big ridiculous stuff like that.

** I think what many authors and readers alike forget in their wonder of magic is that war is not a performance. It doesn't matter how fantastic your spells are or how great your showmanship if the spells don't connect. I often read Harry casting "chains" of spells as if there is a difference. You either hit your target or you don't and if you do it better be a spell that takes that person out of the fight. Also, spells seem to travel at speeds that are at least slow enough to allow your opponent to block them after they are cast which is highly inefficient in any true battle. A banished unseen pebble would be more effective then almost any flashy spell that can be cast.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) has the NonBWL!Harry attend Durmstrang, where Dark Arts combat spells are taught and used --- and many occupy the spectrum between Stupefy and Secumstempa: they are very painful, perhaps crippling or potentially deadly if untreated, but they are not untreatable or irreversibly damaging.

** I have never read a super!Harry fanfic where he doesn't use other spells more often. Honestly though, the reason stunners and AKs get thrown around is they are probably the most powerful spell to most magic users. One hit and the enemy is out of the fight. Sure they can be brought back to consciousness if they are hit with a stunner, but it only takes a second to throw another spell at the unconscious body to make sure that they are out of the fight for good. Most Super!Harry fanfic I read has him throwing around spells that do great amounts of damage..... but fail to actually remove the other person from the fight. Honestly that is probably because it is boring just to win when you hit.
