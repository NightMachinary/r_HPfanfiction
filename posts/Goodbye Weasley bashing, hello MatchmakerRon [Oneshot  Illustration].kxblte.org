This is a tad... /ridiculous/, and meant to be a lighthearted fic (so don't take it too seriously), but I had fun writing it lol.

  That right there is the bet. Now let's talk about the bet. Can we talk about the bet, please, guys? I've been dying to talk about the bet with you all day, OK? "Harry and Hermione," this bet keeps coming up over and over again. Every day the bet's going around the school. Harry and Hermione! Harry and Hermione! I look in the ballot, and this whole box is Harry and Hermione! So I say to myself, "I gotta find out what this bet is all about! I gotta go up to Dumbledore's office and put this ballot in his goddamn hands! Otherwise, I'm never gonna know what this is all about and I'm going to keep seeing all these ballots about Harry and Hermione." So I go up to Dumbledore's office and what do I find out, guys? What do I find out?! There is no Harry and Hermione yet. The two haven't got together yet, okay? So I decide, "Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper." There's no Harry and Hermione? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Harry and Hermione! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to the Common Room and I knock on Fred and George's door and I say, "Fred! George! I gotta talk to you about Harry and Hermione." And when I open the door what do I find? They're in on it, guys. Half the students - half the teachers - in this school have made bets on you guys getting together. This school is a goddamn casino.

"Ok. Ron I'm going to stop you right there, not only is Hermione married to Dean Thomas but I am literally getting married to your sister in ten minutes and you're here looking like a drunk hobo"

********* "Ron! What happened?" Harry asked, concern on his face as he stared at his best friend who had just woken up screaming at the top of his lungs.

"A bloody nightmare, that's what!" Ron's face was pale and he sat upright in his dormitory bed, shaking uncontrollably.

"You!" Ron pointed a finger at Harry. "Stay away from my sister!"

"And you!" He screamed at Dean Thomas who was still bleary eyed and seemed to have no clue what was going on. "Stay away from Hermione!"

The dormitory room was silent.

"Understand!?"

"Yes, Ron." Neville said in a pleasant tone. "We understand. Now go back to bed."

"Bed...that sounds nice...." Ron murmured and lied back down, falling asleep in seconds.

Everyone let out a sigh of relief.

Only Seamus shook his head and groaned to himself. "This bet is going to turn us all mental and it's barely been a year!"

**** Yeah, same. I tend to stay away from fics that have heavy bashing, I know some people might actually utilize it in a good way. But If it is actually well-reasoned bashing I don't see the need to write 'bashing of x character' in the tags at all! I would consider it as the normal exposition of a character's flaw.

***** Agreed 100%. I'm fine with real character criticism and exploration of characters. For example, pointing out Dumbledore's failings of never checking up on Harry's well being at the Dursleys should be considered criticism and not bashing. There's also the chance that characters can learn, change, and grow when flaws are acknowledged and there is valid criticism, while in bashing only fics they remain stagnant and flaws are only brought up to be exaggerated.

Hermione and Ron are one upping each other, as friends often do. It's meant for comedy, it's not necessarily bashing the pairing.

I personally love Ron and Hermione, I can see them working together if given the appropriate chance. But, I don't believe the author was bashing Ron/Hermione, merely pointing out the irony of Ron/Hermione haters.

  Hermione snorted. "Can you imagine us going out? We wouldn't make it through the first date."

  Ron shuddered. "Please don't make me think about it. You test my nerves often enough as it is, always nagging at every little thing I do. Always the tone of disdain. I would never be good enough for you, would I?"

  "And you? Never missing a chance to belittle me or mock my interests. Always butting heads with me and arguing over the pettiest things."

*** No... I "seriously just wrote this" intending to write crack...granted, it's my first time trying that kind of humor so who knows how it came across.

While writing it, I thought it would be fun to reverse tropes that I see all the time. Like the fics that go on and on about how Hermione deserves "better" than Ron and how she would be miserable with him; here I tried to show both sides, how /Hermione/ can be pretty awful to Ron too and he deserves better.

That's /my/ personal opinion. You don't have to agree with it. But maybe /don't go into a Harmony crack fic and complain about it not being pro Romione./

This was a fic I wrote hoping it could get a chuckle or smile out of someone, not to start arguments. If it's not your cup of tea, by all means, move on instead of starting a ship war in the comment section. Thanks.

It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

Same thing should apply to Romione shippers, yet they're reading this fic and hating on it.

Also, I find it hilarious that Romione shippers are bringing Romione bashing into this discussion when the fic is literally about a supportive Ron. I interpreted that exchange as two friends just joking with each other as they thought about what it would be like to date.

Haven't you ever been in that scenario where you're like, "Yikes, I wouldn't want to date you." and your friend replies with something worse because at that point you both are just exaggerating and trying to one-up the other.

As OP said... it's a light-hearted fic meant to be fun. Stop trying to bring bashing into it when there's literally none.

Lmao, it's fine. I just realized after this that it's damned if you do damned if you don't when it comes to Ron. Some ppl criticized me for /not/ bashing him; some ppl criticized me /for/ bashing him. All in the same fic.

****** Agreed that when it comes to a crack fics and tags warning of bashing, it's your own fault for getting burned. And generally, even if it comes out of nowhere, the best course is to simply close the fic and move on.

Not sure I agree so much about those people having to expect anti-shipping lectures when a fic that has no indication it's going to bash something you like does so. A Romione fic doesn't require you to break down why Harmony doesn't work, and vice versa. Same with any ship. I don't need to dedicate a chapter of a Link/Zelda fic to breaking down why Link/Malon is a bad ship. It's not something someone should expect just because they're reading a fic about a pairing.

A tag indicating there is a particular relationship tells you two things: 1) That relationship is happening and 2) other relationships involving those characters are not happening. It does not, however, say anything about the story also coming with a lecture criticizing other pairings that those two characters might be involved in.

The only time it comes off as natural is when that failed relationship gave it a go and there's emotion catharsis between those two characters who realized they don't belong together. Here, this is a crackfick, but a lot of stories do have this scene where it just comes out of nowhere. It doesn't feel like readers consuming a story at that point. It feels like an author lecturing fans of that specific ship.

Anyway, I don't want to get into a whole discourse over the thing. It didn't particularly upset me, anyway, it just sorta broke the immersion of the fic, which is why I made my comment.
