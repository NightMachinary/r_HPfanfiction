*** Yeah, fics like these are prime for Ginny-bashing, and quite frankly it gets ridiculous. Kinda feel like a lot of people who write those types of fics are the stereotypical Nice Guys/Girls™ who can't /possibly/ believe that the nerdy character isn't the one Harry would go for.

****** I've never understood this fascination for harems. Not only is it a bad idea all by itself, harems being extremely tough to live in, or so I've been told, and get everybody unhappy, but it also weakens your story by having too many characters with the same function.

Besides, Harry, with his strong family values, would never go for the harem option, imho.

I tend to avoid fics that have more than 2 people listed in the main pairing. Especially if this pairing happens to be the dreadful Harry/Hermione/Luna.

******* The only way you could write a good harem story is from the perspective of a harem member. At that point there are options to focus on intra-harem competition, intrigue, politics, relationships and drama (especially if there's serious internal conflict). Of course, nobody's ever going to write a story like that because anyone capable of writing an interesting take on that approach won't touch the 'harem fanfic' section of HPfanfic with a ten-foot pole, but there's a theoretical capacity for a good harem story.

A story having a harem is a red flag for not just the harem itself, which is universally awful, but also that the writer has prioritised wish fulfilment and the rest of the fic is also likely to be shit.

******** I agree.\\
You could indeed make a good drama out of a harem story but it would have to be a story /about/ a harem rather than a story /featuring/ a harem. It would have to be the core of your story.\\
Of course, why bother with a harem when simply having a group of friends would allow you to achieve pretty much the same result?

********* I have this plot idea about a Harem story set inside a harem, and without the Harem owner or any other male character ever appearing "on screen", so to speak (Sort of like the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Women_(1939_film]["The Women (1939)"]]), focused on a member planning to escape while all the gossip, plotting and worse goes on. But I've got a numbe of plot ideas that I consider more interesting.

I suspect he might try to hit on Sam Carter, for she has yet to make an appearance in this story.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

** It's a fairly significant part of the backstory in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064). The backstory, and the reasoning why, are fairly tragic in their own way with plenty of blame to pass around for the cheating.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4079609/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Contracts][*Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts*]] by Clell65619 linkffn(4079609) is a bit more vindictive. It's...not the world's best story, but the author did clean it up a bit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][*a rewrite that's not as vindictive towards Ginny.*]] linkffn(5835213). The rewrite got rid of the cheating aspect though. Instead it's a standard "Harry is betrayed by everyone he knew" story.
