One of my old comments came to mind just now, one where I mused that pureblood supremacists are ridiculous because even after subjugating all the other intelligent races (assuming that the prohibition of wand use by non-humans and lack of representation on the Wizengamot is evidence of subjugation), they still feel the need to label each other things like 'pureblood' and 'muggleborn' and whatnot.\\
And that if the 'pureblood supremacists' had their way and suppressed all the muggleborns, they'd end up turning on each other, over things like being half-blood, having grandparents or great-grandparents (or great-great-great-great ancestors) with mixed blood, having money, having land...

Does anyone know any stories where precisely that happens? A time and place with muggleborns reduced to the status of house-elves has purebloods being divided over stricter purity/wealth differences, or Slytherin house and its usual fanon politicking is torn apart by doublepure-pureblood supremacism, or...?

*** Strangely enough, I reread that one before making my request. And every time I read it, I wonder 'what about the Statute of Secrecy in Britain?'.

Because, if they have to leave the muggle world alone on pain of losing their magic, what happens if they need to Obliviate people, as a result of muggleborn accidental magic or a magical creature appearance, or worst of all a dragon attack? Wait, worse than that, the dementors rebel and invade Britain?\\
Presumably the ICW can set up some bases in Britain to help with maintaining the Statute of Secrecy, but how much of necessary tasks like warding areas and establishing dragon reserves and such can they do before it counts as 'interfering with the government'? What about the insane Voldemort's response to ICW intrusions?

**** I imagine his followers didn't tell him about it. And I assume after the first major problem the dragons were pulled from Britain. This is before the days of the internet, so some ICW enforcers handled it nicely.

In my headcanon, Switerland is the only country in Europe that doesn't follow the SoS, and that's because it's run by a Magical ruler. The ICW main congressional office is located there, and that country takes neutrality in everything in the magical world too. They have a wonderful utopia under their mountains. Perhaps the remains of some ancient Magical Empire exists there, and all civilians (both magical and not) are sworn to secrecy as part of the mandatory military service. (Interestingly, the Swiss Gaurd is the main military for the Holy Sea, and the Pope; and all of them are magical too.)

** This sounds like a stupid premise, or rather, a premise based in ignorance. Not because it couldn't happen, but because a "purity spiral" is by no means inevitable.

Take for example the idea of racial Nationalism, like black Nationalism.

Everyone knows what a black person looks like, you can picture one in your head when you see these words. There's a clear distinction between black, white, Asian, what have you. It's like the rainbow: just because there's an area of uncertainty in between the colors, doesn't mean that the colors don't exist, or that they are a completely arbitrary construct.

This is why I think it's stupid to take the angle of "race doesn't exist", or "how do you tell of Someone is of X race" as a criticism of X nationalism, because it's a stupid angle of attack.

At the end of the day, I think every people have the right to their Nation, regardless of race or whatnot: and to say that well, blacks, Asian, even whites can't want to live in black, Asian, or white societies because there's some blurriness at the fringes is disrespectful to their identity. Have you ever seen someone say "you're not black enough" to someone that is 90% black, for example? First, it's not anyone's place to tell another group who they must include, and moreso, it's a tactical of deconstruction that if applied universally would undermine literally everything.

Anyway, how does this related to purebloods? Well, first let's acknowledge that it's all hypothetical and magical: but I would argue that if there was indeed an idea of "pureblood", that there must be some way to identity who is pureblood.

More importantly though, I think it's a mistake to think that they would keep endlessly spiraling into finding out who is most pure, because it's a proxy for the type of insular and (I assume) homogeneous society they had for a while. So what they're really after isn't total supremacy of some autistic interpretation of "pure", just a society that reasonably reflects their ideal.

Now, this is all under the assumption that the people who take control aren't like they are depicted in Canon: as terroristic, needlessly sadistic assholes, violent supremacists led by a psychopathic megalomaniac.

I do think that there could be written a "pureblood Nationalism" that's much more reasonable and tempered, that doesn't outright want to kill all the mudbloods or whatnot, so long as the people supporting it aren't also written like Canon Malfoy, Lestrange, etc etc.

This could actually be a decent idea for a Slytherin Harry story, one where he's "dark", but also politically savvy, and gets rid of the insane extremists to make his own third position.

I think Rise of Wizards (I think it was called that) pulled something similar off, although it was a unification of all wizards, not just purebloods, which is definitely the ideal I think - but still, exploring the other end of the coin in a rational manner would be pretty interesting.
