Does it put anyone else off when writers start adding /too many/ details to their fics? I don't care what Petunia made for dinner, or Sirius' outfit, or about Draco's cousin's hobby, just get to the point!


** Yes this is commonly found in novice writers. They can't bear the thought of the reader not being able to see exactly what's in their head as if it's a film, so they stuff in loads of mundane detail.

All description should have a purpose, for character, atmosphere, symbolism, world building, etc. Slipping in a few "said Harry, munching on his toast" is fine, showing him selecting bread and putting it in a toaster is unnecessary unless the toaster is important to the plot.

*** Brevity in description is important. The poster child for lack of brevity is The Legacy, which involves convoluted marriage contract history and rules which take about 3000 words to describe. Even putting aside the fact that the author could easily describe the same thing in 500 words by simply being more efficient, where the fic really goes wrong is that it /repeats the description multiple times/.

First some goblin tells Harry. Then Harry tells Neville. Then Harry and Neville tell Daphne. Then Harry, Neville and Daphne tell someone else. And so on. Not once does the author use the phrase "They proceeded to explain their scheme." Instead, the author fully details the entire conversation, all 3000+ words of it. Every. Single. Time.

The mechanics weren't even that clever/interesting to start with, never mind the tenth time you get hit over the head with the same essay on the topic.

***** It is worth slogging through. I have yet to read a fic where there remains not only good conflict (Daphne doesn't have it easy) and a relationship that moves from "I don't know you -- acquaintance I don't like --> grudging friend". It also remains the only Harry/Daphne fic where they don't get together within the first 100k words. Could this fic be written in half the words? Yes. Still worth reading however.

​

The Legacy is an above average fic that immediately comes to mind when I think of marriage contracts. Well worth a read.

** I feel the same about Whispers in the Night, which I'm giving a second go.

First, everyone is given alternative pronouns (e.g. McGonnogall = the hardened battle axe of Hogwarts, Amelia Bones [a very key character] has to be called the head of the DMLE like once a chapter, etc.). Everyone's clothing has to be described ad nauseam, especially if it's the short, form-fitting skirt that one of the love interests happens to be wearing to a normal Tuesday morning breakfast in the Great Hall. Then, every time someone says something (usually movie-script-esque poeticism and depth), 9 other characters' reactions have to be added before we get to the next piece of dialogue. And so on and so forth.

** The problem is that in fanfiction, more words equals more views, favourites and reviews. So it's rewarding for writers to write a bunch of useless crap like a 10k words long shopping trip, drama that's completely unnecessary for the plot (but very useful to push dat wordcount up to the 300k) and just useless side detailing in general. Bonus points for splitting the story up into hundreds of ridiculously short chapters.

Add [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] 's point to that and that's how you get to 300k words long stories that could just as well have been written in 100k words.

Small streets of Rome vs say the large imposing buildings and crowds of NYC. Don't go into the minutia of things that are not relevant to the story, but rather focus on the vibe. Is it an open area unlike Diagon Alley, are there more shops etc. Things that contrast what Harry is used to, but without going into the exact blueprints of the bookstore he's passing by, with the quaint little tables outside that seat four.

But I find underdone to be much more egregious. Too much can be fixed with editing. Not enough requires learning to write better, while a horde of people shout about less being more. No one puts in the whole recipe/process to make dinner. The hyperbole is not helpful. Advice like spread character descriptions out, only describe a specific thing once in a chapter or don't mention the character's hair in every chapter are more useful.

​

World building details are another matter entirely, as they often have nothing to do with the plot, but could also be foreshadowing. Sirius and his flying motorbike are the former in the first book, but become the latter in the third.

And that's a problem why? Your readers won't know what it means, they will just wonder why you put attention to a certain detail until you reveal it. That's not bad... that's good. For me as a reader that's one of the most exciting parts of reading and you're intent on taking it away?

It sounds ridiculous to try to describe everything in extreme detail just so that the reader stays completely in the dark all the time. That's some kind of reverse Checkov's Gun and it makes no sense to me ("I'm just going to drown individual things that could be noticed in a blanket of details, so that they don't stand out").

/screeching tire sound/ Wait what? People expect less details in first POV? Ha, the fic I'm currently working on isn't in this fandom and a self-insert, but as I have ADHD and notice absurd little details in real life, it's stuffed with descriptions.

  his voluptuous, nubile daughter had trailing hair of gold and eyes that sparkled liked gemstones. the bookcase that hid the secret passage was oak, but my love interest's jeans hugged curves that would not quite as we descended the stairs. Their voice was like warm honey over velvet, or some shit.

Oh dear, I'm getting Dementia Raven flashbacks hahaha. So since I'm writing in present tense I do describe people's clothes as they are, but had I been writing in past tense I might've even switched the colors around, since experiments have shown that we don't remember crap about that pink fluffy shawl's color if we don't consciously take it in.

And because I have autism my fic is tagged with "Unreliable narrator" because my mind is blegh and will manage to turn a spoken sentence into something else entirely. So hello miscommunication. It's a balancing act.

And boy was it confronting to read through two year old diaries to hunt for my own personality flaws! But it also told me a lot about myself, and I'm so hyped about writing myself as I am instead of unintentionally writing Ideal Me.

Ah, this went a bit off-topic since I also tend to sneeze whatever I'm thinking about on the internet haha.

*** I think there's an appropriate level of detail that you could ideally maintain. Not everything needs to be plot relevant, and if you only describe plot relevant stuff in detail, it's immediately apparent how important it is/how related it is to a later solution/revelation. Meanwhile, not having some slice-of-life elements, or something describing, makes the world feel more "dead." Harry Potter fanfics can kind of get away with less, since as readers we're drawing on info in the books, movies, and other media to supplement texture within the world, but some description of "unimportant" things is still good practice. You can still balance that within the context of broader events that move the plot forwards.

In Sorcerer's Stone, we have a pretty clear series of events at Hogwarts- Harry is good at flying, which leads to the altercation with Malfoy and getting on the Quidditch team. Getting on the Quidditch team leads to both the fake duel with Malfoy and the cursing of his broom during Quidditch. The fake duel with Malfoy leads to Harry and his friends learning about Fluffy, while the cursing of his broom leads to him getting a lead about what's hidden on the third floor.

However, the "unimportant" events related to Quidditch- learning about Harry's dad, reading by the lake, learning about Quidditch history, describing the match- easily fill in the world and make it feel more alive.

**** I tend to expect the same level of things unrelated to the plot as in the source material. That's what makes Harry Potter fun, the rich, living world. It's plot, both overarching and book to book is fairly by the numbers for the genre, but the details make it memorable.

** The area that I see things being over described the most is with houses. Oh my god, houses. There are so many fics where Harry interests one or more (usually more) houses and the author almost always can't resist the temptation to describe every single room. I don't necessarily mind if a character inherits a house or multiple, but I don't want a house tour.

The most recent chapter of a new fic that I have been enjoying did this and even though they were less descriptive than the average author who does this house tour thing I still sat through it thinking "I don't care" the whole time.

** I cringed just reading your post. Yes. YES. I can't stand overly descriptive stories, be they original or fanfiction. If I can get away with it, I drop them right away; it's just not worth it when I can find much better works to read. As a beta reader I take on varied types of stories, but I'm really sick of YA and slice of life precisely because of this phenomenon. The worst is that they tend to be the products of new writers who feel all these details are vital to the story and won't accept concrit aimed at trimming their descriptions and purple prose. I'm getting upset just thinking about it...

** Radaslab and Sinyk both who have written (or are writing in the case of Sinyk) are gilting of way too much description.

The worst thing an author can do, IMHO, is recap canon. I hate stories that start out by rewriting the books in summary form. I can see it if something from canon changed, but if it's /just/ canon, then that's not okay.

Yep, it's the worst when authors try to write a fanfic as if I don't know the original books. I'm unsure whether it's some kind of hubris (they think it has to stand on its own, even though it's fanfic and not an original novel) or just imitating successful authors (who's works stand on their own because they are original) without thinking about it.

*** In one of Sinyk's most recent stories he waxes poetic about Harry's awesome cooking skills and goes on for pages about what he made and how he made it. If I want foodporn I'll turn on the Food Network.

** Most of fanfics fall into this character. Pacing is one of the most common issues in amateur writing (if you get past the obvious stuff).

Amateur Level 1: Basic sentence structure, grammar & spelling, Correct direct and indirect speech

Amateur Level 2: Pacing, basic plot, characterization, consistent POV

Amateur Level 3: character arcs, complex plot structure & mapping , themes, distinct narrative voice

** Once read a story that was had an alright amount of description for the first 15 chapters... not too much as to drown a person, not too little to give them nothing to lay out the scene... chapter 16 was eight times the length of every other chapter, went into so much detail that over half of it was a description of a lunch on a plane that didn't even pertain to the story, and was the lunch of someone that wasn't even in the story before that chapter.

I don't even remember the rest of the story before it because of how inane this part was.

** I like to be grounded in the setting at the beginning so I get a feel for the atmosphere etc . But anything more than that (unless necessary for character building or an event) annoys me.
