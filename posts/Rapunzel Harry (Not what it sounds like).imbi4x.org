Harry who has been trapped in a castle from age 1 to age 11- long hair is of course optional, I'm more looking for a “locked away and is experiencing everything for the first time now that he's gotten his letter” vibe.

Bonus: Give Harry a spicy ability that that he was being “farmed” for like the witch using Rapunzel for her hair's vitality


** Harry's hair cannonically grow immediately when cut!

COINCIDENCE?! Yeah, probably.

** How about Child of Azkaban? He's locked in a tower until he turns eleven and everyone realizes that he's not at the Dursleys, at which point Diagon causes him legit distress because of all the sensory input.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but check out linkffn(After Happily Ever by Von). I found it a bit confusing, and the promised epilogue has not, to my knowledge, shown up.

  Long, long after the events of Tangled, history repeats itself. Sort of. Oneshot Epilogue.
