I wanted to read a fanfiction that saw Harry as minister of magic, but it seems that there aren't many, or maybe it's just me who can't find them. Do you know any?


** The possibility is brought up in linkffn(Oh God, Not Again!) when Neville's boggart turns out to be Harry as Minister of Magic, who cancels Monday, and suggests people only require a license to own a dragon.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
