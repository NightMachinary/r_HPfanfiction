I will sometimes find a fiction that is so good I can't put it down for literally 10's of thousands of words at a time. I'll spend hours and hours reading, and when I finally stop to do something else, my mind will still be thinking in the rhythm of the author's narration.

It will usually happen with writings that have a more unique style of narration, and can sometimes take days for my thought process to return to my normal thinking pattern.

Any of you ever experience something like this?

*** Sorry it took me a while to respond, I was on my phone and don't really know how to link fictions properly yet haha.

So the first 2 that come to mind are "The Changeling" linkao3(189189) and "Harry Potter and the 'superhero' origin story" linkao3(24413623)

I read The Changeling in one sitting, and I couldn't stop thinking like that for like a whole week. It was amazing. I see this fic recommended all over, so I figure it doesn't need much of an introduction.

Harry Potter and the 'superhero' origin story also had my head spinning lol. I saw it recommended in one of the threads here and clicked to read a bit without looking at any of the tags or anything and was instantly sucked in. Read all that was written at the time (about 35 chapters) on a Friday afternoon, and was thinking like that for the whole weekend. It does have some M/M, which isn't really my thing, so I haven't really been keeping up with the updates, but the author updates it quite regularly.

**** Those are both incredible! I am so appreciative of the overwhelming Britishness of Harry Potter and the superhero origin story. The author really summed up teen British culture; JKR missed a certain element of getting smashed in fields at the age of 15 and how there's always boys smoking weed in skateparks.

  Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

*** I'm not even joking, this has happens to me... it's weird but kind of funny. Literally what happened today: I am getting a cup if juice, internal monologue: as I picked up my glass of juice I scanned the room before noticing a strange box, walking over I realised that it was from the attic. As I pondered whether or not to open it, my frizzy-haired sister came in and told me mum was looking for me.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

** Newcomb's What You Leave Behind is perhaps the most well-written piece of fanfiction I've ever read, especially the edited version on DLP WbA. The technical writing, humour, world-building, and characterisation are at par with JKR's work. The only issue would be the somewhat darker setting, but I enjoyed it since it was a reasonable plot deviation.
