Does it have a pairing? If so, does Harry's pairmate(or whatever) die? I heard from somewhere but I am not sure... I have a weak heart. Thanks


** There is a pairing and it's... marginally important to the plot, but she's an OC. The story mostly focuses on the macro side of politics and war, but I lost interest during the... Germany arc, I believe it was.

** It's been a long time, but what I remember is that the pairing was irrelevant. The story takes a very detached narrative approach, as if being told as history. There was no dwelling on relationships that stood out to me. That said, it's been years so my memory could be faulty.
