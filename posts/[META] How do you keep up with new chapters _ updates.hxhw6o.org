ffn seems to have a RSS service which does not work while AO3 entirely lacks one. I don't know how else I would check for updates and I'm really unwilling to browse the URL and then check for updates.

Is there another way to do this?


** If i understand this question correctly on Ao3 you only have to subscribe to a fic and you'll get an email when ever it updates, the same thing applies to ffn but you have to follow a story. To do this on either site you have to have an account.

*** Yeah I guess this is what I will end up doing. Checking email is easy.

**** Even if you can't check your email, if you've followed a fic on FFN you can go to your Story Alerts (followed stories), and it will list them in order by update.

** I have my follows open in a tab on Chrome on my phone. Whenever I want to see if something updated I'll go to it and refresh the page.

** On ao3, you can bookmark stories. You then get a page dedicated to those stories. I check it once a day, to see if any of them got an update.

** FFN can email you when a new story comes out, also if you have the app it will send you a push notification. This is very meh as Gmail's app doesn't have batch deletion so you end up like me with thousands of just abandoned Emails it takes hours upon hours to delete

AO3 has the same thing although there's is usually caught in the Social Folder of GMail

*** Both my FFN and AO3 ones go to Social folder on Gmail. If they're not going there automatically, then move one from your general inbox to the Social folder, and it should ask you if you want to do that for all of them. (We often ignore such popups but sometimes they're useful.)
