Okay so I`m pretty sure in one fic which I cannot remember then name it was said that AK was a spell that was used to give downed game or livestock a painless death. So do you think there is an obscure wizarding society that uses this spell for that and when someone from Britain sees them use it they faint from shock? Cause I am genuinely curious, like if I was a wizard farmer and I raised animals, I would rather give them as much a quick and painless death as possible.


** I thought that each of the Unforgivable curses required genuine emotion to cast them. Crucio requires a hatred and want to causes someone pain, Imperio requires the will to dominate and Arvada Kadavra needs hate and intent to murder. Not kill, murder. This part is fanon: I think that's why those 3 specifically are Unforgivable, because there's no way you could not mean to cast them. You can't cast AK in self-defense and you can't cause it to put an elderly relative out of their misery. That's why it's a life sentence.

*** Canon just states that "you have to mean them" so probably it's what you said but to what extent it's unspecified. Also Snape uses the killing curse specifically to put an elderly man out of his misery.

*** Really cause to me it seems like it needs complete apathy of life if we're going by that theory. Sure Crucio and Imperio make sense one causes unbearable pain and the other robs you of your free will, but compared to the two AK just sounds....flat is the best way to describe it.\\
/When cast successfully on a living person or creature, the curse caused instantaneous and painless death./ Is what the HP wiki says, no meaning of needing utter hate and malice. But I am not any kind of an expert i just thought if it could be used as a way to dispatch live stock.

** It seems like every grey!Harry fic has a scene where he explains how two of the three unforgivables are actually not so bad, and you can kill someone with any spell if you try hard enough anyway, so it's okay for him to use those unforgivables as much as he wants.

But somehow, they all disagree on which unforgivable is the "bad" one. And they all completely miss the point anyway.

** I think it would be interesting if it really was the case that the killing curse was invented to kill livestock... and the real reason why the killing curse was considered Unforgivable was that you had to consider your targets to be no better than cattle in order to use it effectively.

*** That is another point I hadn't considered, but it fits Moldieshorts to a T.

** I think... this might have been strange attractors? I vaguely remember this idea being in a Hermione/Tom fic

** First I've heard of this take. I remember a fanfic or two (don't remember their names at the moment) where the Unforgivables were originally either medical spells or corrupted versions of medical spells. There was also one that said that Avada Kedavra was technically only half of a spell, though whether the intended counter was never written down before testing or if it was simply incomplete is something I don't remember off the top of my head.
