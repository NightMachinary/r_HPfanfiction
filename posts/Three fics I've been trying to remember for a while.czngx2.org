:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, there are three stories I wanted to reread, but I can't find them. Please help me.

1. AO3 fic about interdimensional dream Harry Potter club

   - 100% on AO3, unfinished
   - The lead HP (raised by Voldemort) gives each member a different, backstory related nickname - I remember "Flame", "Raven" and "Gryff"
   - is heavily pro-slytherin, to the point of Voldemort - apologism (The only other Gryffindor HP is named "Flame" and is an ~idiot)

2. Harry is a metamorphagus story

   - The only thing I remember is that this story pushed the morphing aspect quite far: at one point, Harry is hit with a curse (exploding/bombardment?) to the chest and he basically creates multiple tiny hearts to keep the blood in his body and flowing, or something like that.

3. Harry is a trained by a society where every member has a horcrux

   - egyptian "God" of Sun (?) started it and is a leader, though every 50 (?) years, a new temporary leader is selected, while the originator hibernates (or sleeps or doesn't care)
   - the one who finds Harry is a greek called Jason (?)
   - one of the order ("Scorpion", I think?) hates Harry.
   - I don't remember what happens after initial training - it possibly just stops before the training comes to fruition.

Thank you!
