With so many of them, there has to be a few that are actually good.


** 1.Dimensional travel

1. WBWL or Non-BWL as long as Harry not becomes pureblood Lord and supports tgeir ideals

** Time travel, finding good new ones is hard, but it's just really fun to see how a character handles it, what they change and how much better things can turn out.

** While I like a lot of fics that others would probably judge me for, the only kind of fic I like that I would deem a legitimately guilty pleasure is fem!Harry Marauder-era power-wank where she's shipped with Snape. The fics don't tend to be very good, but I always loved the idea of a power-wanking fem!Harry deciding to romance young Snape and him not minding at all.

** Bashing tbh, especially if the fic is well-written.

MoD! Harry

Time travel

Redeemed! Draco

And many others. Basically, as long as there's good grammar and I can understand what you're talking about, I'll read /all the tropes./

** Big next gen series with Albus, Rose, etc., if that counts. Love them despite that they're not more popular in general.

Also WBWL to an extent, but typically more twists on the trope than played straight.

** I love time travel. and to that, I like it more when they travel into their younger bodies. I know people don't like that cause they are adult and some fics have romance... but I still like it. (unless it's Snily)

Dumbledore bashing. but no Ron please. ugh, I hate Ron bashing. I also like McGonnagal bashing, though not a lot of fics have that.

OP Harry, except the goblins, inheritance test addon. I could live without it. I'm ok if he has three animagi forms. but can't stand the gringotts stuff.

dubious content, going towards the non-con.

arranged marriages

soul mates, even including omega verse ones.

I don't ... hate omega verse. it's just, 95% of them are really shitty. but I like the concept I guess.

mentor Snape

good Snape and Draco. that is actually canon, come on. the time where they kill Snape only because he is a git... damn. Snape was one of the most important light side soldiers, and Draco was forced to join. if you go with him being a bully, James and Sirius were much bigger bullies than Draco ever was. it always irks me when after war fics have Draco being a spy in the past just to redeem him. Harry forgave him, why can't the fans.
