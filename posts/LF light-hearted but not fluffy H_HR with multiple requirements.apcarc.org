I know this may seem excessively specific, but I think H/Hr fics with these parameters have a lot of potential.

- Light-hearted in tone and plot, but not necessarily fluffy. Just because the fic has a plot doesn't mean that that plot has to be a dark war story about how Voldemort is coming for Harry and how this will affect his new relationship

- Set during Hogwarts years/at Hogwarts, but not in an AU (or as small of an AU as possible). I'm quite fond of canon world-building and would like to avoid AU's if possible. That said, AUs aren't completely off the table if the changes are small (and the light-hearted tone remains)

- No bashing is preferred, but that doesn't mean there can't be some minor conflicts at some point; i.e It's OK for Ron to be initially upset about the Harry/Hermione relationship, but he shouldn't milk it the whole fic

- We don't spend the whole fic building up to the relationship only for the fic to end 1 chapter after Harry/Hermione get together. Let's actually spend some time /during/ the relationship

- At least 50K+ words. It doesn't need to be as long as the /Sacrifices/ arc, but I'm also not looking for one-shots

- No first-person POV. I'm sure there are some fics that are quite good from a technical standpoint in first-person, but I really don't like that writing style in general

- No soul-bonds, unless they're done in a more original way than the typical soul-bond story. IMO, Philosophize's Power of Love series is an excellent example of how to do Soul-Bonds right. Linkffn(11197701)

For reference, I've already read Stanrick's fics (not a fan of his prose), and my favourite H/Hr fic is "Unlike a Sister" (linkffn(6574535)) (despite the fact that it meets almost none of these requirements, funnily enough). What actually got me thinking about this in the first-place is the stretch of Vox Corporis when Harry and Hermione are back at Hogwarts after the Summer break. The tone is fairly light IMO, the character interactions are handled reasonably well, there is a plot to the story that isn't just the relationship, and the world-building is nearly canon.

"Baby it's cold outside" is another good example of a fic that meets most of these requirements, I think, but it spends too little time with the characters after the relationship actually starts (everything leading up to it was pretty good though). Linkffn(12296750)

I'm aware of Lorien829's works, but I'm a little hesitant to start some of them because I wasn't a fan of 2 of the fics that I did read (Isle of Mists and Catalyst). /Senses/ is pretty awesome, though. Linkffn(2240565; 8693743; 9753533).

So, yeah. Are there any recommended fics that meet (most) of these criteria? Alternatively, are there any fics that I may be dismissing too quickly with these criteria?

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive.
