** I've toyed with the idea of writing one of these ever since reading TE7's LdS. I am growing more and more tempted by the day. I love TE7 and all of his/her stories, but I often find they leave me wanting more. It's no fault of TE7, if anything it's a testimony to the writing ability on display, but this one in particular. I felt like there was a lot there that wasn't explored, even if I love the story, and think everything was set up perfectly.

I don't know, is anyone interested in a couple hundred K story on this pairing? Not sure how I'd do it yet, I have two ideas, don't know which one I'd go for, but if there's interest I might write it.

Also, TE7, if you read this, the commentary was no slight on you, I actually loved the story, and thank you for the adventure and potential inspiration.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

  “Are you afraid of me, Harry?” His mouth opened, but no words came. His mind blanked, his cheeks draining completely of whatever color had stained them in response to the curious note of Riddle's voice. It sounded innocuous enough. Harmless with how casual she'd asked the question, but Harry knew better.
