I have many frustrations with fanfiction but I guess what tops my lost is the misrepresentation of Sirius as this sugar-high, childish man who whines to Remus when he is a 35 year old man. I mean, no, please stop. Oh, or getting right out of Azkaban and flirting with the nurse and acting as though nothing has happened in these past 12 years, it's like he never even went in there sometimes and resumes to act like some three-year old kid.

So I guess what I'm asking for is a sensible characterization of Sirius, like that in linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin). Where he's like his canon self, angsty and not entirely stable and reckless but still optimistic and good despite his flaws. I don't want him jumping of the astronomy tower because 'James dared me to, Remus'.

No Wolfstar and any period of his life is fine by me.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

** I don't mean to self-promote but my ongoing fic 'Dysfunctional' explores the possibility of Sirius not falling through the veil in OotP. It was an accident after all and I was pretty disappointed to not find any which could be considered canon with the exception of Sirius being alive and how it changes things for Harry. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866177/1/Dysfunctional]])

** I don't think there are that many, so I will link mine because nobody else will and it sounds more or less like what you are looking for. It is relatively short and is a Sirius/OC romance of sorts. It is canon compliant in that it doesn't contradict canon events (I hope) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11171435/1/The-Secret-Life-of-a-Black-Dog]] I'm not really self-promoting here because it is being rewritten and this version will be deleted soon. But I did try to get into his head, though of course you might see him differently. I don't think you'd call my version optimistic, generally speaking. He's a pretty shadowy character in canon and I don't think Rowling did him justice.

ETA I am also looking for a beta if anyone wants a job.

** Hm. I guess I see what you mean, but in my view those two views are not actually contradictory: post-Azkaban Sirius doubles on on the "wacky" side of his personality more than is genuine, to try and bury his darker feelings. (He can also be really funny in this form, if I'm being honest.)

Still, I recommend linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal And Other Morals) for something closer to what you mean, though he's a secondary character there.

******* I always skip the scenes of Harry, Ron and Hermione and the whole Misfits thing. Some of them though are brilliant but most times it's just irrelevant. However, the Heir of Gryffindor had me rolling my eyes through the entire thing but it's well-done and comes as burden to Harry in book 2 and not just some Lord-Potter-Black-Merlin crap.

I also never liked Julia all that much, but I loved her job. It was interesting.

I hope you enjoy it though! =)

********* Haha, true. I used to write them too, but never publish them. However, I think we should give writers the space to write whatever they want without mocking them. Even the best writers started out from the depths of shitty writing. As they grow older and have more experience, their writing also matures and they grow out of it. Just let them develop into their writing styles and if they remain that way then be it, everyone has an opinion and way. Let them write their Mary Sues, it's only a stage in writing.

** Rose Petal Red: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900/chapters/26470377]] is a story about a Self Insert becoming Ginny's twin sister and currently is in Harry's third year so that means lots of Sirius. I thought that he was really well written there. Unfortunately, Sirius is only a side plot and the story isn't focused on him. It is still an excellent story though.

He has a lot of gaps where happy memories used to be, which causes him to panic when he tries to remember.
