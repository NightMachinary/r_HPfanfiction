When Voldermort comes to Godrick's Hollow and attacks the Potters, James doesn't have his wand on him, but Lily does, so she's the one who tries to hold him off. As a result, she survives - she is stunned or otherwise disabled but survives the night, because of You-Know-Who's promise to Snape. James dies. Everything else is up to the writer.

James barely had a moment to think, and then he was off. He ran, like he had never ran before. He almost bounced off the walls trying to get up the stairs as fast as possible. In the nursery was his son, and he would be damned if he allowed Harry to be harmed, especially after Lily's sacrifice.

He grabbed a spare blanket and quickly tied the corners together, creating a crude carrier for the toddler. In went Harry. In went his covers. In went that plushie that always made him sleep. Hearing footsteps on the stairs, James grabbed the now empty wooden cradle and threw it at the window. It broke with a spray of glass shards and noise, but James didn't care.\\
A path was now open - he wouldn't waste the chance.

Without his wand and with the motivated Dark Lord about to break down he door he could only do one thing, use one advantage Lily did not have. James changed into his Animagus form, took a running start and jumped out of the window with the precious bundle hanging from his muzzle.

Lord Voldemort bit back a scream as he arrived to an empty room. He ran to the broken window just in time to see a stag gore Petter Pettigrew on his horns and clear the edge of anti-apparition wards. Its form blurred, and with a crack of Apparition the boy and his father were gone, beyond his reach.

Lord Voldemort screamed. He was still screaming when the house's magical protections, activated by the unconscious woman on her way to their duel, finally overloaded and turned everything in the perimeter into fire and dust. Voldemort's vessel, constrained by his own anti-Apparition enchantments, didn't survive the explosion.

**** Nope, vaped. She was unconscious and at the centre of the explosion.

Both her and Voldemort, and she didn't have a Horcrux. Of course, this means no scar Horcrux for Voldemort- Harry was away, and everything there was destroyed. This means that Voldemort either was saved by his Horcruxes, or his soul destabilized in a storm of chaotic magic without that anchor. Either would make a good narrative, with James on the warpath and firmly in the "Family First" mindstate. No Boy Who Lived anyway, which is as good a source of butterflies as any. Additionally, we have clear evidence that a muggleborn nuked the Dark Lord, which has interesting implications as well.

***** A character's actions and words are canon. The readers interpretation of personality, motivation, intent, and so on are not.

To me, Snape does not come across as someone obsessed (or in love). He comes across as someone who cares for Lily very deeply, but not very wisely or well.

****** If I had a childhood friend who I cared very deeply for and loved (whether romantically or platonically) and was black, I would not, nor do I know anyone who would in this same situation, call them a nigger (unless, you know, it was a joke between us and there was no malice involved, but that's not the case here). That's what Snape did to Lily. Whatever his feelings may have been, he clearly didn't actually care for her as much as you think he did.

******* First, let me say that what he did in that scene was completely f*cked up; I understand why she never forgave him, and don't blame her a bit.

That said, I can't agree that it necessarily follows that he didn't really care for her, because people are *stupid* that way. Even assuming that he had drunk /all/ the death eater anti-muggle kool-aide, it's a surprisingly common thing for people to do: "All of [group X] are scum-sucking troglodytes! (Except my friend Alex, who is cool */* the exception */* a credit to their [race, religion, people, whatever]." It is something you will see all the time if you look around (although usually, it's not quite that overt).

People /often/ don't reconcile the immediate to the larger picture. If they did, the world might be a better place as people would have to start pulling their heads out of their nether regions.

tl;dr: He may well have cared, but at the same time had his head up his *ss.

****** What do you make of the *action* of conspiring to murder someone's toddler son and their husband? That's canon.

That's what you call "caring deeply, but not very wisely or well"?

Yikes. Look - totally fine to just like villains. Magneto was my favorite X-Men character when I was a kid. But I still recognized that he was a bad guy. That's different from what you're doing, which is excusing unambiguously *evil* behavior as good.

It's like the authors that pair up Hermione with Death Eaters, because they like to fantasize about 'redeeming' edgy bad boys. In reality, it's the equivalent of writing a romance story about a Nazi who spent years happily working at Auschwitz, then falls in love with a Jewish woman after the war. Gross.

******* Conspiring to murder someone's toddler son and their husband? When did the subject change to Voldermort, or were you talking about Pettigrew?

Snape is the one who passed on the warning that the Potters and Longbottoms were in danger. Yes, they were in danger because of him in the first place, but he'd hardly be the first person who regretted their actions once faced with the actual human consequence.

And I am not "excusing unambiguously *evil* behavior as good." I'm pointing out that *some* of his actions can be interpreted in different ways.

If you can't accept that people can interpret a scene in different ways, I don't think there is anything left for us to talk about.

******** Only because he was concerned that the object he was obsessed with (Lily) was in danger. He only appealed to Voldemort to not kill her, he didn't give two shits about the one-year old child or the man his obsession had chosen to spend her life with.

******** I'm not a Snape fan either, but thought you might benefit from actually seeing what canon (hp-lexicon) says: "Dumbledore found it repulsive that Snape had asked Voldemort to spare Lily but not Harry or James Potter".

When even Dumbledore is disgusted by how horrible of a person Snape is, it's pretty fair to say that you are projecting your fandom onto Snape.

But I saw a fic the other day where Hermione was banging Lucius Malfoy, so it's pretty clear that a lot of fanfic readers/authors use what's between their legs more than what's between their ears lol..

********* I'm aware of the canon, thank you, but I don't decide my take on a subject based on what a particular character thinks, regardless of which character it is.

Let me ask you a question. Given, first, that Voldemort considers Harry a threat to himself, and second that Snape is known to hate James, what argument could Snape have made to Voldemort that could save one or both of them? This isn't a rhetorical question - if there's something apparent to others that I'm missing, I want to know.

That I don't see a way he *could* save either James or Harry, and thus better not to try in favor of trying to protect the one person he had a chance to save, doesn't mean I'm projecting anything. If it implies anything, it might indicate that I'm more cynical than the average reader.

Finally, you seem to imply that my opinion is in part or entirely influenced by "what's between [my] legs." Given that I'm asexual, maybe you should reserve that kind of pot-shot for someone who gives a d*am about that sort of thing? I don't even like the character.

***** The interpretation of the motive and intent of a character can't be cannon unless it is spelled out in the text. I know most people read that passage and had, essentially, the reaction of "oh, you bastard!" And that is certainly a valid interpretation of what he said! But it isn't the only one. My reaction was to nod my head and say "smart!" - he gave Voldemort a reason that "Voldemort* would accept, which is what Snape needed to have any hope of saving Lily.
