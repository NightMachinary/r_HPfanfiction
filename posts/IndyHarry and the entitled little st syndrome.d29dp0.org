Recently I have been reading one of the indy!Harry stories, which reminded me of the genre in general. The authors usually justify any action that Harry takes. Fight against aurors? Not even a problem. Crucio someone? He/She definitely deserved it. Talk back during a trial? It's only normal for Lord Potter Gryffindor Slytherin Peverell Black. Ignore, and often assault, the school staff, despite being a student? It's perfectly reasonable and legitimate. So on and so forth...

Why do you think those tropes are so prevalent? Which are the most annoying? And perhaps which of them you actually like to read?

For me, I think they are mostly wish fulfillment and canon fix-its done with the way of least resistance. It's, after all, much easier to just hand wave such issues away than to deal with them. I don't particularly like any of them, but they don't make me drop a fic. They are bearable.

I also understand that due to the passivity of canon!Harry, despite him being a smart-ass, indy!Harry is very popular, but I don't want to debate the validity or quality of indy!Harry stories, many of which I really like. Just to talk about the little shit Harry syndrome that is present in so many fics.

What is your opinion?

I understand what you mean, but the level to which fanfic authors go to is something I have never seen in good novels I've ever read. It's also very rare in some of the shitty novels I've read, mostly done for comedic purposes.

But I agree, it's rampant in fanfics, which is why I made this thread, and especially in indy!Harry. Also, I hate when in those fics Harry is suddenly an Adonis at 14... despite being a specky, overly thin, not that attractive teen.

**** There is a multitude of people just accusing any female character with any semblance of competency of being a mary sue, while completely accepting and praising the same thing in a male character.

I mean, look at Rey and Luke from Star Wars for instance, or Michael and Spock from Star Trek.

Luke is a random farmboy living on a desert planet buying */powerconverters/* and maintaining passive water extractors. His life is peaceful and easy, but he can still /somehow/ swing a lightsaber like a jedi, use the force like a master and be an absolute ace pilot with little to no training. All this he does like a Jedi would, despite only spending a few weeks with an insane green goblin. Luke is lauded as a great character despite all this.

Rey is a random scrap-slaver living on a desert planet exploring the wrecks of starships belonging to the most dangerous empire in recent history. She carries a big stick and can use it well. When she gets a lightsaber, she's very unsure with it, angling it away from her body at first, and literally only blocking when attacked by an insane patricidal maniac. Seriously, she doesn't strike him once, check the forest scene. She eventually finds the aforementioned Luke to learn from him, but he brushes her off and she becomes a bit surer with the lightsaber on her own. Her style is still very basic however. She's clearly strong with the force, something not all too uncommon in star wars protagonists, and so lifts a couple of rocks out of the way, something every jedi padawan could do. Oh and also she fights a bunch of guards who literally go one by one, and one of them throws his weapon away to tackle her battle partner. truly competent. Despite all of this, people scream and shout that she's a mary sue, unrealistic, and overpowered. Personally, I think people complain because they wanted /another/ man character.

Star Trek has a similar situation.

Spock the older is a powerhouse. He can do telepathy over many lightyears, mind-meld with literally anything, including alien machines and space-whales, knows literally everything that's needed for the plot on the top of his head, is a scientist, an engineer, a fighter, can single-handedly fly and command a starship, can swiftly communicate with any kind of alien, is literally never panicked, has LITERALLY erased all negative emotions from his mind, and is basically a vulcan tricorder.

Michael Burnham from Discovery however is named the mary sue. Nevermind the fact that the most complex mind-thing she can do is accept a link from her adoptive father, completely fail at the vulcan emotion supressing thing, Mostly stands around being burdened by her past she can't let go and is generally a pretty average part of the crew. I mean she literally mutinied because her dad told her klingons greet eachother by shooting their weapons at the other ship, for fucks sake.

The whole "mary sue" thing comes down to sexism, plain and simple. A headstrong, competent and no-shit woman is at best seen as amusing and the butt of jokes/random sexist comments, while a headstrong, competent and no-shit man is seen as cool and someone to aspire to.

****** Here's all you need to know: Luke trained for years, and even at the end of the OT wasn't as powerful with the force as Rey is at the start of the sequel trilogy. She didn't even know the force existed up until that point. She's shown to be not only stronger than Luke in the OT, but Yoda as well. And when she goes to Luke for training, she's so powerful and skilled that she not only beats him, but scares the shit out of him. They're in no way comparable, and even if Luke was a Gary Stu (which he isn't), it would still be to a significantly lesser degree than Rey bring a Mary Sue.

Mate, is this a joke?

The first time Luke goes out alone on the speeder, he gets whipped and knocked unconscious by sand people. The only reason why he survives is Ben K jumping out from behind the rocks and scaring them off. Idk how you can call Tatooine a peaceful desert planet when it's the same damn planet where Luke's grandma was kidnapped and killed by sand people, and his (step)grandpa had his leg taken off at the knee.

******* As a self proclaimed Star Wars buff I would disagree.

Luke was very much a novice. It took him years to even summon his lightsaber (ESB), and when he got some personal training from the greatest Jedi Master ever, he was way below Vader level, who just toyed with him. He struggled all the time, from the time on his farm, the murder of his Aunt and Uncle, the rescue of the Princess, his fight with the Rebellion, his fight with Vader, etc.

Rey is what I call lazy writing. We all see how underprivileged she is and how she has to scrape to survive, and yet we don't see her mature. Remember how Luke said: "What's that?" when they fleeing were Tatooine to Han? Rey never does that, she already knows how to pilot a spaceship perfectly.

My issue with Rey is that she's literally a Mary Sue, she always does everything perfect, she never makes mistakes, she is way more powerful with no training than Luke was, which is just bullshit.

I just think it's a lost opportunity. If she was developed as a real character, with a proper story arc, I would be much happier, but from what I've seen so far, I've given Star Wars a cold shoulder and I'm no longer interested in the films. And this is coming from someone who played shoot down imaginary Tie Fighters when he was 5 years old. It's been a loooooooooooong time.

***** Star Wars VII and VIII have a lot of issues, and I don't think it's fair to lump all criticisms of Rey as sexism. The dialogue surrounding the movies gets so toxic on the main starwars subs that I try not to get involved. Honestly I think TLJ gets a lot of flack for fucking up the franchise, but TFA unfairly gets a pass for setting up most of the shit that gets called out in TLJ.

1. The teasing about Vader's lightsaber is resolved in TLJ. Rey isn't a Skywalker.
2. The Palpatine knock-off's backstory isn't really filled in. He's killed abruptly before the climax of the movie.
3. Kylo/Ben's origin story is covered. He's an emo who rebels against his mother for /reasons/ and joins the Dark Side because he has a mancrush on his grandpa. Not sure if they ever told him his grandpa joined the good guys in the end.
4. The Knights of Ren are never referred to again.
5. Carrie Fisher suddenly dies, and a good end to Leia's storyline is cast in doubt. *Not their fault but I just wanted to add on to the list of things that would upset/perturb a fan.
6. A rom-com level miscommunication makes two hero characters become assholes and get into conflict with a new hero character completely needlessly.
7. New hero character dies heroically in a way that puts every fleet battle in every previous movie and tv episode into question.
8. Rey levitates the rocks in a way not previously shown in the movies. Yoda looked like he was passing a gallstone when he levitated that chimney thing in AOTC. Rey looks like the rocks are her friends and they're just hanging around to see how she's doing.

The thing is every point on the list was bound to upset fans. I can see that the writers and directors on TLJ were trying to do something fresh while contending with the tired old plot threads left by TFA. I just think they went too far with trying new things and kind of left these things there unsatisfyingly. I would assign most of the blame for why TLJ was a bad Star Wars movie to TFA not being original enough and TLJ trying to be original but then kind of screwing up the continuity known so far.

So much of the expanded universe was kind of cringey, but like they do with comic book movies they could have mined the stories for the best ideas instead of just rehashing the ANH in TFA.

***** I love Michael as a character, but I feel like one valid criticism of the show (I have to say upfront, I'm not sure if it comes as part of the criticism of the character that you've seen, mind) is that it is a protagonist-centered story that masquerades as being an ensemble. As a result, a /lot/ of the final weight and actions have to be taken by Michael, which for someone coming in expecting an ensemble teamwork show, might be a bit of an adjustment.

But tbh I would put that as a mistake in the marketing rather than anything to do with the scripting or character.

****** Honestly, this is true. I believe the idea has merit, a protagonist-focused story would work great with the Star Trek canon, but the character herself was poorly set up.

Honestly, I'm not even talking about her personality, but her position overall. She's what, a random crew member? a convicted criminal who won't ever hold a commission again? boring.

How about instead, we make her the captain of the discovery (while perhaps altering her character a little so she's less meek during dialogue and more badass during action scenes), tasked with investigating the plot of the first season. She does so, including the Vulcan Hello, which earns her some sharp reprimands and loses her the ship.

But instead of "oh noes now im a prisoner" she insists that shes right and goes rogue with the express intention to prevent an all-out war the federation are attempting to start by apologizing to the klingons. Maybe include a scene of diplomatic talks like this:

Fed Ambassador: "We're so sorry for the attack on your vessel, I hope we can maintain peaceful relations, perhaps a mere truce with you"

Klingon Ambassador: "What attack? As far as we know, you've proven yourself to be decisive and headstrong."

Fed ambassador: "Captain Burnham's unprovoked assault is being followed through by our military, don't worry"

Klingon Ambassador: "Assault? The good captain is the one who convinced our warriors that your people aren't cowardly windbags, you should ve thanking her!"

Fed Windbag: "Oh noes this goes against our weirdly agressive pacifism!"

And in the end, we get a rogue, chaotic good captain trekking these waters in a stolen ship for the good of all.

I mean he named one of his kids after Snape for goodness sake. He forgave Ron real quick after the first task, plus when Ron left during the horcrux hunt, and Hermione after the broom incident in third year. Often in those Indy Harry fics, if you betray Harry or make a mistake he will never forgive you and you are dead to him. I hate that because it's not a good way to live for one thing.

*** I'm not trying to be contrary on purpose, but does he?

I mean from the books his life sounds like that of a normal teenager (the Dursley's were not physically abusive of him, just psychologically, that doesn't make it right, of course, but i'm not trying to talk about Harry's abuse, just about Indy!Harry), apart from the magic and murder and stuff. He has friends, not many mind you, he has a rival, very common, and he's pretty much oblivious and stupid, very common among teenagers.

I get what you're saying. Canon!Harry is not the dream protagonist. He's very passive, not that good at magic, doesn't have anything going for him apart from his morals, which are kind of impressive.

But I wouldn't say he takes "so much shit in canon". I would rather propose, that fanfic authors would prefer a more action oriented protagonist and that the entitled shit Harry is their way of dealing with the realities of the world they put their character in.

Example: Umbridge detentions. In canon she gave those detentions to many other people. But in fanfiction it's usually only Harry that gets them and then deals with her in some absurd way. Of course, what she did was child abuse, but it doesn't make Harry special and how she is dealt with in fanfic is sometimes over the top.

​

EDIT: Fun fact. I was walking today and I tried to catalog all the PLOT relevant actions that Harry did by HIMSELF in the books. There weren't that many, let me tell you. In PS it was 2, in CoS it was 1 or 2 depending how you count, in PoA it was 1, in GoF it was 3-5. in OotP it was 5, in HBP it was 4, in DH it was a lot more (it was a very Harry heavy book). I also only counted those that were relevant to the plot of that book and couldn't be done by another character at that moment.

**** The "magic and murder and stuff" is rather important, it's not something you can just brush off.

The room he had growing up was literally a spider infested closet, and the Dursleys had the space to give him his own room and he knew that. The Dursleys actively went about smearing his reputation with the neighbors. I'm pretty certain that after the Dobby incident he was locked in his room and deprived of full meals for weeks. You can treat it as a joke if you like, but the book does mention a time where Petunia took a swing at him with a frying pan, and if that has happened once, it's almost guaranteed that other physical things have happened. I wouldn't consider any of those things to be normal teenage life.

I definitely wouldn't call him the most unfortunate protagonist by any means, but he definitely experiences some shit.

What I did in one of my fics was framing them for drug possession, counterfeiting money and possession of weapons of war since that would be easy to set up with magic (duplication charms).

Vernon&Petunia not being able to explain the ton of cocaine, bags full of identical pound notes and AKM rifles in their spare room would be seen as them being uncooperative (aka harder sentencing). Nor would it be possible to blame the boy who hasn't been there for 10 months (and good luck trying to blame a 13-year-old boy for industrial amounts of drugs).

While a detailed analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this findings, an NCIS officer said that at least four of the confiscated bags contained cocaine. Vernon Dursley, the director of Grunnings Drills, and his wife Petunia were arrested, with charges pending."

  The image changed to Mrs Johnson from Number 7, who seemed very eager to tell her story to the British Broadcasting Corporation. "At first it was only a single police car but nonetheless I was curious. Why would the police come here? We are a good neighbourhood after all. There was some shouting and then one constable came back out, looking worried and talked on the radio until two more police cars arrived. Then another three, followed by a van and several civilian cars. A crowd gathered around Number four so I went back inside and watched through the attic window. They were carrying white packages out of the house for two hours while at least a dozen constables searched the area. They found something that looked like guns in the garden shed and carried duffle bags out of there as well. I never expected that Mr Dursley would be part of such a thing but it seems obvious now - "

Say the teachers notice this and call the cops about child abuse. What happens when they search the house and find a bed inside the cupboard when the house had two unoccupied rooms? When they ask Harry where he sleeps? When they look at both kids in the house and see one well dressed pudgy boy and the other one dressed in ill fitting hand-me-downs?

Oh sure, legal consequences /might/ be difficult in the muggle world but nothing is stopping them being persecuted in the wizarding world, in a fanfic at least.

** If you've ever read chinese manga/webnovels, a LOT of it reads like really shitty fanfiction, so these types of terrible tropes don't just exist here.

There are certain authors and readers who truly don't want to read realistic fiction - and thats perfectly fine. I agree that a lot of indy!harry is wish fulfillment and et cetera. The issue is in a lot of these wish fulfillment universes, thinking too hard unravels any sort of wish fulfillment. Which is why in each and every scenario, there is a clear black/white. Actions are moral or immoral. Characters are only good or evil. Many scenarios just feel like the same, all powerful harry imposes his will without any real conflict. In so many morally grey!Harry stories, harry is not morally grey.

For me, these stories are unbearable because even if scenarios are original and exiting, resolutions are always the same. Even if they are OC characters, they read just like a tvtropes character trait list.

I love magic and unrealistic stories, but I want ambiguity, suspense, twists and turns, characters who are morally conflicted, characters who fall into evil/redeem themselves for good. I want the MC to struggle, romance to be slow burn, and the kind of excitement and passion that comes from a long buildup of events.

While the instant gratification of indy!harry moving through a long list of fixits is fun, for a while, i'd rather watch porn or something... enjoyment from fanfiction for me is being able to immerse myself for hours on end.

*** Too true. One of the points you raised, about black/white, is actually very interesting. Since what is Evil or Good, in such works, is determined by the MC (whether they are objectively good or evil, if such a thing even exists). Many of the best novels out there do not have a good or evil dichotomy, rather they try to present life and people. As we know both of those things, for the most part, defy such simple classification.

Beauty, or perhaps truth, is in the eye of the beholder after all, even if there are some fundamental truths that most people agree on.

** Tbh my first thought based on this idea was 'how long until we get Harry Trump fanfiction?!'

I think some of it is probably cultural and some of it is taking the character [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven][up to 11]].

By that I mean... I think a lot of the sassy/snarky elements of Harry's character in canon didn't necessarily translate as directly as they could have to a US audience as there isn't really that archetype in (modern) US kids' fiction/YA like there is in British, or at least, there wasn't as much in the 90s. (and by extension, this leads to other characters like Fred and George being interpreted in a somewhat darker light to US audiences, etc.)

I don't live in the US, but from the Americans I know and the (masses of) US media I consume, I feel like there isn't really a direct equivalent for the 'cheeky' teenage character who is snarky to adults around him but good at heart and forgiven/respected by adults without being expected to change. (I can think of younger kid equivalents ofc, e.g. Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone...) So anyway as a result we have a lot of US authors interepreting Harry as kind of a bad kid who is constantly vindicated by the narrative, and are using that as a starting point to create their world where everything is similar to that setup, but /more/.

Of course, it could also be [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality][character-centered morality]], it could have started as an absurd parody of the fairly passive canon Harry and passed by osmosis into being a serious representation archetype, it could be authorial convenience to avoid having to explain moral ambiguities and/or Harry's guiding sanity, or it could be something else entirely that caused this rise. We can only speculate!

You can handwave it as "they were emotional, they were teenagers, they were stressed", but I think it's due to the extra-textual inconsistency that JKR has a habit of falling into.

  "Well," said Slughorn uncomfortably, "you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature."

  "But how do you do it?"

  "By an act of evil---the supreme act of evil... Killing rips the soul apart."

Later...

  Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the witches' feet became hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.

  Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart.

What never sat well with me was how Voldemort's lack of reaction of to killing people, the ease with which he did it, was meant to establish him as an evil person. And it showed that killing people took a moral toll on him, a consequence for his actions.

Then Molly kills someone, no hesitation, and although we know she is capable of feeling the remorse to put her soul back to rights after killing Bellatrix, there's no mention of any consequences at all. I find that happens a lot when it comes to the Weasleys - they do a lot of questionable things, but the narration pays barely any attention to it because Harry likes them and they're the designated good guys.

  "I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That's everyone in the family!"

  "What are Fred and I, next-door neighbours?" said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son.
#+end_quote

You'd think Harry's internal dialogue would comment on that, because he values family as his heart's desire, and to see family members throw another family member aside just like that might remind him of how he was treated at the Dursley house... but he doesn't.

******* I know! Like shit, Molly, if you can throw a deadly curse that connects, you can throw a Stunner! I think you're morally OBLIGATED to throw the stunner in that scenario, in fact! So yeah, she did commit straight up murder when she could've captured and subdued with the SAME AMOUNT OF EFFORT! Like fuck. Soul should have been damaged there. She chose to kill when she had no need to.

Parallels Voldemort choosing to kill Lily when he could've thrown a Stunner with the same amount of effort, as well, and that would've secured Snape's loyalty to boot.

******** Then every murder and atrocity Bella would go on to do after she escaped again would be on Molly's head for choosing to not put her down like the rapid dog she was.

Batman is also just as guilty for the rampant slaughter the Joker perpetrates over dozen issues, since he has had the opportunity several times to put him down but refuses to and allows him to spend a vacation in that revolving door known as Arkham Assylum.

Molly *did not* commit murder killing Bellatrix, she committed an act of highest heroism and justice.

********* You're assuming she'd escape again. With Voldemort dead, Bellatrix would be wandless and unconscious in the middle of hundreds of armed fighters. Grindelwald couldn't even escape from Numergard, Bellatrix wouldn't be able to escape without Voldemort again to break into Azkaban, anyway. In any realistic scenario, she's not just going to slip away in the middle of the great hall. If you can hit her with a deadly curse, you can hit her with a stunner. Therefore, she's removed as a threat. Yes, she killed without needing to.

It's not like the difference between a gun and a taser, where a taser's prongs can fail to both stick, or where even if they do people can power through it.

A stunner hitting a target is ALWAYS going to stun the target, unless you're Hagrid apparently. Therefore, you have the obligation to use the stunner to remove a threat instead of jumping to killing. You CHOSE to kill, when you could have as easily removed your threat by nonlethal means.

It takes the same amount of effort either way. You just chose to go for the kill. And I can't ever abide that.

At least in harry potter, with actual magic going for you.

  but his reaction to cursing Draco in the bathroom, or his unwillingness to fatally curse Death Eaters during the course of the Deathly Hallows, stands in contrast to him torturing a person for spitting in someone's face
#+end_quote

Not wanting to kill someone doesn't mean you don't want to see them in pain. Harry doesn't want to do the former, but he's for the latter. He had no idea what Sectumsempra would do, but he did know it was for enemies. Torturing Carrow in anger isn't different from him trying to torture Bella in anger or kill Snape in anger.

The only time Harry didn't like seeing a bully/enemy in pain/humiliated was Snape's memory. Any other time he's laughing or cursing someone. Dudley's enlarged tongue, hitting Malfoy and co with the Prince's spells, laughing at ferret Draco, etc. He just graduated from Curses and Counter Curses to Secrets of the Darkest Art.

Edit: this is the 2nd time I've said something like this and was downvoted. Idc about the votes, but it's confusing as to why you guys think he was super straight laced kid afraid of all manners of violence, especially when he was angry.

***** Let's not forget that when they were ambushed by death eaters in the cafe, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine all seriously considered killing them in cold blood to cover their trail- the only reason they didn't was because obliviating them worked better. I see the Carrow scene as an example of just how far our protagonists have been pushed, and that they've truly entered an "us or them" mindset.
