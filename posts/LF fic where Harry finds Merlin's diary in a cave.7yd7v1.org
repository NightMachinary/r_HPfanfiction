** Is it a Harry/+Gabriel+ Gabrielle fic? Hope by Jeconais mentions that Harry found Merlin's diaries (and the man himself) in a cave.

** This rings a bell, I'll see if I can find it in my favourites. I seem to remember it being an OP!Harry story, but I'll let you know if I find anything more.

*** It turns out the story I was thinking of was the same one mentioned above, but I was thrown by the misspelling and didn't realise I was thinking of the same story. I hope you enjoy :)
