** I think you'll like linkffn(Wish Carefully by Ten Toes). The premise is that Harry and the Order lost the war and agreed to cede Magical Britain to the Death Eaters, in exchange of exile of pretty much everyone opposing Voldemort and his followers among other conditions. Needless to say, the long-awaited 'pureblood utopia' that the DEs had been crowing about isn't all it's cracked up to be in the end. It's pretty much a deconstruction fic of a Death Eater regime narrated by an embittered Death Eater.

Would you suggest any of the other stories from this writer or is this the best one, thanks.

** Something similar to what you described can be found in the wise one series by FarenMaddox -- linkffn(The Wise One: Book One: Becoming)

Apparently the FFN bot hates me, so here's a direct link to the first one in the series - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4062601/1/The-Wise-One-Book-One-Becoming][First book of the Wise One Series]]

The main plot is that Harry is taken by Sirius and trained abroad, and they only return to Britain after Harry has reached a certain age. Quite different from anything else I've read, decent reading, and it's a complete three-books series.

** Speaking of Britain's fate, are there any fics where Harry abandons Britain to its fate, and the rest of the characters manage to solve the Voldemort problem anyway? It doesn't have to be quick, easy, or costless, but I'd love to read a good F%#@ the Prophecy story.

*** Hmmmm, I can't remember what it is, but I remember Harry trying to escape on broom and getting his arm broken. I also remember that Voldemort is taken down by three mercenaries who have obscure magic, were born in June, and parents were in school with Tom Riddle and defied the head boy three times.

**** The British wizards are so callous and careless with life that they can't even see what they were desperately searching for: the thirteenth use of dragons blood. They knew there must be thirteen, given the numbers power, but were so oblivious that they slaughtered probably hundreds if not thousands of dragons to experiment on their blood. Never once did they realize that life was the most important use of all. They could never understand that all life was important. They were too selfish and ignorant.

At least that's my explanation for it.
