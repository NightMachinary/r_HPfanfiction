I remember from 3 years ago I started reading a fanfic where Tonks became deaged to look after Harry. Harry knew nothing about it and became friends with her.

That's all I remember about it. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I believe it also had sequels, but I'm not sure


** I read a fic once where Tonks was in Harry's year, can't remember it though. I thought it was a great idea though.

*** I think you're thinking of the R-series stories by Regulus: first one is linkffn(The Philosopher's Stone Retransmuted by Regulus), but it's been so long since I read any of them, I don't know if Tonks being in Harry's year was an in-story change rather than authorial fiat.

**** I think it was just one of the authors things, don't think it was an actual plot point

I read a few of them before it got too farfetched and angsty for me to continue
