Why is ron always made into a abusive person to hermione in Harry Potter fiction I just don't understand please explain people of reddit.


** Most authors need someone easy to bash in indie!Harry fics, and most think it's Ron just because the trio's friendship was not that "perfect" portrayal of it. They had fights, disagreements and very human traits in canon that isn't seen in movies or other children's books. Ron is a very homely, "typical" teenage boy for most of the books, and this doesn't sit well with some authors.

*** Sometimes not only that ... I am rereading linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) and the merciless bashing of both Dumbledore and Ron just makes me sick (we haven't got to Ginny yet, but I don't hope for much, this is Harmony after all). And there is absolutely no reason for it. There is quite nice enemy (Voldemort) and although I can understand bashing of Dumbledore (I don't like it, but as a poor crutch for missing plot, it could help), there is absolutely zero reasons for the merciless bashing of Ron. Just Harmony spite.

***** same lmao, I found a fic where the horcrux was destroyed and Dumbledore decreed that Harry was now useless, which made everyone "reveal their true nature". It had them be so fucking OOC it became ridiculous. Like, all of them were blood supremacists, Hermione was only Harry's friend because Dumbledore had told them to, everyone only cared because once again, Dumbledore said he was something special. All the teachers too began ignoring him. It was fucking wild.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but the story did cry out for some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter.

***** The horrible thing is that some of them mostly good (well, “Reboot” is horribly repetitive: the problem is not “Show, don't tell”, but “Show, not show, tell, tell again, make a small mediation on it, and then tell yet again”). I really like Lady Hermione Grangye, sneaky Slytherin-like phoenix, I adore good Petunia, saved Eileen is written pretty nicely as well. That Ron bashing is just completely absolutely unnecessary and pure damage to the story without any benefits.

The same goes for linkffn(A Fair Life by Rtnwriter). I don't need femslash (or any slash, for that matter), but this is rather decent genderbender!Harry, not even overly smutty (although, sometimes the romance is quite forced ... OK, that's for another rant), but again Ron is made into idiot just because the author can. There is zero reasons for it.

** Both Hermione and Ron are guilty of not supporting Harry during various different moments during the 7 years. When Hermione did it, mostly it is seen as her being logical or looking out for Harry. It happens in times that is not directly impacting Harry's wellbeing. Broom incident in PoA and Draco in HBP.

But when Ron did it, it was during some of the very important moments for Harry when he really does need the support. First being the Triwizard tournament and second during the Horcrux hunt. Both of these are shown as a direct result of Ron's jealousy. Second incident is made even worse because of the very obvious visualisation by Horcrux showcasing Ron's jealousy. This is why it is seen as a much bigger compared to whatever Hermione did. Even though there are other factors behind the incident such as the Horcrux's influence, the whole thing is seen as petty (especially considering the importance of the mission).

This makes it easy for the authors to take this and showcase as if the jealousy still exists and use it to breakup the relationship between Hermione and Ron. Also contributing is the factor that Ron/Hermione is not a favourite shipping in Fanfiction. This is an easy opening to breakup the relationship and put Hermione with someone of interest to the author.

*** I think a key distinction is that, when Hermione did it, it didn't involve her rejecting or not supporting him. Rather it's still her supporting him, but in a way that he thinks is wrong or mean.

Eg, the broom incident. Her being worried about it is logical, yes - but moreso, her bringing it up is /driven/ by worry for Harry. As a younger reader, we might empathize with Harry in his being angry with Hermione about it, but it's still recognizable that the only reason she did it is because she cares about Harry - and as older readers, it's easy to see the legitimate concern.

Ron's 'lack of support' involves literally walking away and abandoning Harry - which is much more memorable and striking in a different way.

I think a more comparable example might be Hermione being jealous over the potions book in HBP, but even there the context is much less immediately life or death - and I think the later books are less memorable in how people construe the characters, mentally. At least for me, I find that actions in the first few books inform my understanding of the characters to a larger degree - eg, Ron's temporary lack of support in book 4 is far more memorable to me than in book 7.

Like, those could have been written by anyone, or put in there as a trap. Potions routinely explode or melt or transfigure or burn or do other horrible things to someone who does them wrong, and yet he doesn't have a single iota of thought to the risk.

Not to mention, he then uses random spells from that book! He casts Sectumsempra, whose only note was "for enemies" on a schoolyard bully. A spell from a book written in the height of the first war. Harry was an idiot in HBP.

** Because Goblet of Fire. Also, Deathly Hallows, but mainly Goblet of Fire.

It was a horrendously OOC portrayal of Ron by J.K. It ruined Ron's reputation and character that he is never going to recover from it.

But these aren't the only things. There are times when canon is needlessly cruel towards Ron. Like, when in Order of the Phoenix, at the end we find out that Harry really was meant to be the Prefect, but because Dumbledore didn't want to put more responsibilities on him, he chose Ron instead. So, Hermione was right all along in assuming that Harry was Prefect and not Ron. Ouch. Why J.K., why?

That one of the two most important secondary characters in the whole series has no specialties other than that he's good at chess?

Let's even keep that reveal. But it could've still been used to show that while Ron wasn't the initial choice, he still did a really good job, or how he developed as a person when in a leadership type position. Does the book do that? No. It just shows Ron being immature and trying to take advantage of his position.

If you are saying that Ron should not have been written that way from the start and that Ron should have been a better character overall, then that is a different discussion. The way Ron behaves as a prefect is exactly expected of him and the fact that Ron was not the first choice for prefect is, of course, realistic given his character.

** Ron is not always made into an abusive person, nor bashed. That's something important to lay down.

Now, in the wider fandom, he is the least popular of the trio - and gets bashed the most, like you describe. It's for a few reasons - but mostly because he's the most 'normal' of the bunch, he acts in a very insecure/jealous way throughout the series, his two temporary abandonments of Harry are very emotionally memorable, and he ends up with Hermione in what strikes many (like myself) as a poor pairing. He's also an influence on Harry to be 'normal' - to have fun, spend less time studying, etc. Which, if we take the view of Harry should have done more to ready himself against a dark wizard trying to kill him, it becomes easy to pretend it's just Ron's fault.

That makes him a rather easy scapegoat - or, even if not bashed, makes him likelier to get set aside than other characters. Part of it is just his screen time - for instance, if Neville had gotten more attention and had been a part of the trio instead, I'm sure his flaws would be more visible and disliked. Instead, his early incompetence and the way he improves throughout the books is just admirable - as is his steadfast standing by Harry - which can be then negatively compared to Ron, just because we get to /see/ Ron's faults firsthand repeatedly.

Him ending up with Hermione is also a problem, because the Harry/Hermione pairing is naturally very popular. For some writers who want to start off as canon, they feel a need to have that still be the case - and then need a way to engineer a breakup, and the 'easy' approach is to just make Ron horrible. In general, that's what the over the top bashing really is for - it's to justify shunting a character aside or to make people dislike them, without having to go through every step in writing it out.

Bashing Ron is bad writing, and there are only a select few stories that are good /despite/ that dragging them down. But hopefully this helps you understand why some would feel that way.

(Oh, and there's a substantial subgenre of the fandom that /really/ hates Dumbledore and view a lot of what happened as his manipulation - which grows to include the Weasleys more generally and Ron in particular, which also adds to the bashing fics)

*** I don't really understand why you say that a genderbent hermione would be abusive tbh, I can't think of any examples. The only time I would consider Hermione morally, rather then socially at fault is when she fails to stop crookshanks eating scabbers- but even then, rats are usually kept in cages, in the real world. Maybe you could say that she should have spoken to ron about their mutual attraction sooner, but I don't think that failing to do so counts as abusive. Likewise with going on a date with Maclaggen and Krum-maybe insensitive, but not morally wrong.

​

Canon Hermione is arrogant, condescending and she has a habit of constructing elaborate theories/plans without the other two's knowledge, but I fail to see how any of that is abusive tbh. Can you tell me what you think I'm missing?

***** That's true actually, I had forgotten about that. Then again, everyone in the harry potter world is perfectly happy to pretty much ignore every kind of magical attack, at least from the 'good' guys; sectumsempra, the attempted Eat slugs!, Hagrid giving Dudley a pigs tail, Harry Levicorpus-ing ron by accident, Harry deliberately torturing bellatrix (when other spells would have been both more effective, legal and moral)... etc. And at least half of those are portrayed as justified in canon.

If Hermione is abusive because of the birds, basically every other major character is as well tbh, and since that isn't how the books are written, we somehow have to assume that magical attacks 'don't count' in this world unless they cause permenant damage (or plot says they have to).

** I think there's a number of reasons why some people bash Ron in stories where Hermione is featured as a love interest for the protagonist.

First, people tend to focus on Ron's "betrayals" far more than on his achievements - saving Harry's life, risking his life for his friends multiple times etc. - because few of us will have experienced a friend saving our life, but many will have experienced a friend "turning on us" or having a falling-out. (I don't know about anyone else, but if someone saved my life, I'd certainly not condemn them for a few faults like being jealous...). So, some authors already hate Ron, and reading such stories won't help with that preconception.

Second, for some authors writing a Harmony or Dramione story, Ron is seen as an obstacle. While it would be very easy to simply not have Ron and Hermione get together in the first place, somehow, that never seems to occur to the so in order for their ship to sail, Ron has to be dealt with. (That making Ron abusive, sexist, a bigot etc. will also help setting up Hermione as the damsel to be saved by Harry or Draco is apparently considered a bonus).

Third, Ron's the poor underdog character (event though that role is eclipsed by Harry being the orphan hero). Ron has to make do with a hand-me-down wand, second-hand clothes, sneers and insults from the rich heir in the story, and feeling as if he's in the shadow of his older siblings - a great setup for a protagonist. Imagine if he had say, a "pureblood princess" as romantic interest - can you see the stories written? As a romantic rival for Hermione, though, he's rather inconvenient. Harry the famous Boy-Who-lived or Draco the rich ad noble heir winning against the poor underdog who struggles all his life doesn't make for a great story. (Just imagine the rich city boy winning against the poor but honest country boy in all those romance flicks...) So, if Ron's kept as a rival for Hermione's affections, he tends to be slotted as the evil one. Winning against the evil one is noble, after all, and makes you look good.

And fourth, some authors might have some issues accepting that a girl can have boyfriends before "the one". So, to preserve the "pure maiden" myth, they have Ron be evil, use potions etc. on her so them being together isn't Hermione's fault. As a lesser version, Ron being evil serves to make Hermione thoroughly regret choosing him, which some authors need to "redeem" her for choosing Ron in the first place.
