#+begin_quote
  This is the first of a series of books I wrote for my kids set in the Harry Potter setting and occurring at the same time. These stories are meant to interweave seamlessly with the HP books and focus on characters primarily in the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff houses. The Tamblin books are a tad darker than the HP books, starting at about the level of the 3rd or 4th HP book.

** My personal favourite Ginny focused fanfic that is canon compliant is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]]

My personal favourite author that writes canon-compliant is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4095/Slide][Slide]]. There is a little bit of Harry/Ginny in Slide's works, but mostly the stories focus on next-gen and Slide's own characters and more recently the marauders. All of Slide's stories are worth reading (all very well written and well thought out), but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8255131/1/Ignite][Ignite]] and it's sequels are easily the best.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away, it's Tea Time]] It's certainly canon-compliant, but included within it's canon is the Cursed Child, which you may be opposed to. Still, it has a fantastic Ginny/Harry relationship (they aren't the focus though) and I would even go so far as to say that the work is probably the closest to JK Rowling's own writing I've seen.

*** It's a good way to get creativity through guidelines, if that makes sense. Also, a lot of AU fics are usually overly cliché (omg! time traveller Harry broke up with Ginny, went through the veil, found Sirius and they became the lords of The Most Noble and Ancient Houses of fucking Hitler or whatever you want it to be! Wowzers!) and alter the personalities and general thought processes of characters too much for my liking.

*** As someone who writes exclusively canon compliant, I do it because I like to write my own headcanons of "what really happened" especially for missing moments and untold stories. AU doesn't feel right to me and I can't get immersed. I want to read something that I feel could be HP, and AU rarely does that for me personally.

*** I've said this before but to me the ideal is the cthulhu mythos. If you aren't familiar with this H.P. Lovecraft wrote a number of stories, that while hugely varied in terms of characters, location, and period, had little interconnections. Later on other authors added to this fleshing it out into a real overarching mythology. I view good fanfics the same way- they add to the HP setting taking it from a series set in a single school and letting you see the rest of the world, but that only works if they don't egregiously violate the core books.

*** It depends. If a story just re-hashes the original plot, just with a slight difference, then yeah it isn't interesting. But because Rowling told the story from Harry's POV, she inevitably left out some truly great stories from other characters. Take Ginny. She's a very interesting character we don't hear much about. But the story of her 6th year while the trio were away is incredibly interesting. Just read Not From Others. Hell, I really enjoyed the fic about her 5th year and the romantic plotline that Rowling skimmed over in HBP. Like many others, I felt the romance part of the series was a bit lacking and Harry/Ginny in particular could have been done better. Reading a fic about the pair set during HBP but from Ginny's POV fills that hole.

Canon-compliant fics set during the events of the series allow the reader to explore interesting stories separate from the trio's adventures.

Then there are post-Battle fics. Again, I feel these canon-compliant fics fill a hole in the universe. For many of us, we felt there were a lot of unanswered questions and unresolved plotlines and these fics often do a great job of realistically portraying these events.

People like me who like canon-compliant want to feel that what we are reading could realistically have happened in the universe. When a fic deviates too much from canon, it often feels like we are reading a story from a different series than the one we fell in love with.
