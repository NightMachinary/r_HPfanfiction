If you're referring to the Innocent series and Hydrus Malfoy, it does seem a bit jarring but not "smash my head against a wall" terrible.

****** It also sounds similar to the story where Harry changes his name to Rahkesh or something. Can't recall the name of the fic, but he ended up specializing in Runes, taught by a vampire, and demons came out at some point.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

***** Basically the only thing she knew about her Mum's family were those flower names for girls. And yes plenty of them are ridiculous (Primrose, Daffodil, or Hyacinth Snape), but I don't think what she could have against some other. Just in Dudley-has-a-daughter-witch I read about Daisy, Holly, and some others, I have also read about Lilly Aster (in the real life!), Buttercup (Inconceivable!), Camellia, Iris, Jasmine, Sharon, etc. which all seem rather reasonable to me. After all, my wife has the Czech version of Marguerite. I cannot imagine any fem!Harry who wouldn't want to honor this family tradition, if she had the opportunity.
