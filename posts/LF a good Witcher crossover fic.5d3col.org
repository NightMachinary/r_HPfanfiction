I know that crossovers are often really poor, but I struck me the other day that a Witcher HP crossover could be very interesting. Does anyone know if there are any good fics that have explored this?

Failing this, are there any good HP fics where Harry has a dynamic with someone else akin to what Gerald had with Yennefer?


** I've written a crossover between HP and The Witcher, linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), but it's not so much a crossover as HP re-imagined in the world of The Witcher. It's hard to explain concisely, but if you like the first chapter, you'll probably like the fic. If it doesn't take your fancy, however, you can check the HP/Witcher crossover archive where TLK is located. There aren't that many fics, and I can't personally attest to the quality of the others, since I haven't read them beyond giving them a cursory glance to make sure I wasn't unintentionally ripping off another fic with my own. That being said, some of them are quite well reviewed and followed, so there may be something up your alley.

As for an HP fic with a Geralt/Yen dynamic. Do you mean "dynamic" in the sense that Geralt and Yen were bound together when Geralt makes his wish to the djinn? Because if so, any half decent soul bond fic would probably satisfy, and I'd check the search bar for threads on that. Or do you mean dynamic in the sense of their extremely combative, volatile romance? Because that would probably be much harder to find.

*** Thanks for the link, I'll be sure to check it out! By their dynamic I just kind of meant how they work well together fighting monsters, solving problems while also having that subtle romance undertone.

**** Ah, okay. It's probably fair to say that Harry and Hermione have a pretty similar relationship in my fic, and I ended up making sort of conscious parallels between them and the Geralt/Yen relationship. I don't know if H/Hr is a no-go for you or not, but their relationship isn't quite a romance yet, so I suppose their dynamic has a subtle romantic undertone.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

** I can't remember the name but on the ff.net witcher/hp section there's a fic about Harry finding Ciri in the forest fighting the wild hunt. It's only got 2 chapters so far and hasn't been updated in a while but the author hasn't said it's on hiatus or abandoned.
