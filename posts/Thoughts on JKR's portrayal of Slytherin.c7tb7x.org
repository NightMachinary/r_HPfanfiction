It's old news that JKR in recent months has developed a certain reputation of sharing [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/596635888446218240?lang=en][*hot takes*]] with her fanbase on Twitter.

To quote the great creator:

#+begin_quote
  "Not all Slytherins think they're racially superior. But all those who do are Slytherins."
#+end_quote

.

At first I thought this was another one of JKR's infamous wacky twitter retcons, but looking back on the books, I found that her unflattering judgement of Slytherin is actually /consistent/ with how they're portrayed in canon (main 7 books). In the books, we aren't shown any unequivocally good Slytherins.

Slughorn, Regulus, and Andromeda Tonks are most commonly held up as the good Slytherins, not just by fans, but by Pottermore in their [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/slytherins-that-broke-the-mould]["Slytherins who broke the mold article"]]. In reality, Andromeda is a barely there character who does nothing at all relevant to the plot (we are told she takes charge of raising Teddy Lupin, but that never appears onscreen), Regulus didn't turn because he decided that racism was bad. He turned because his beloved family servant was tortured by Voldy. And even before that, Regulus had a newspaper stalker-shrine in his bedroom dedicated to Voldemort as Harry's first impression of him, so we can infer that something about the Death Eaters and Voldemort must have attracted him enough to join them in the first place. Just like Snape, who also has a place in that Pottermore article, but I'm not gonna defend him here.

And finally, Slughorn, who can't remember his students' names and thinks Lily was so talented she couldn't have been Muggleborn.

#+begin_quote
  "Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn't believe it when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she was so good."
#+end_quote

Gee, I guess she's a credit to her race. He also does this to Tom Riddle, who is known as a charity student of uncertain background.

.

#+begin_quote
  "I confidently expect you to rise to Minister for Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple. I have excellent contacts at the Ministry."

  "I don't know that politics would suit me, sir," he said when the laughter had died away. "I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing."

  "Nonsense," said Slughorn briskly, "couldn't be plainer you come from *decent wizarding stock,* abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet."
#+end_quote

Thanks, Slughorn. You are the most positively portrayed Slytherin the story has ever had. I guess.

.

JKR was never going to put Harry in Slytherin, no matter what the Hat told him about all houses having good potential for him. The Hat can say one thing, but JKR knows differently.

#+begin_quote
  "I always imagine that the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on, because it's strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it."
#+end_quote

.

So, with all this in mind, what are your thoughts on Slytherin House?

Obviously, Slytherin's racism is used to portray it as the "bad, bully house" in the first couple of books, due to certain narrative conventions in children's literature---the same conventions that demand plucky, everyman heroes who roll nat 20's, and incompetent adult authority figures. But the negative portrayal of Slytherin /isn't/ confined to PS and CoS. It's carried on through character attitudes throughout the rest of the series, both from Harry's PoV, and other sympathetic characters.

#+begin_quote
  "I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also," said Professor McGonagall. "If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance, or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill."
#+end_quote

Slytherin /does/ value talent, ambition, resourcefulness, and networking, but the house itself was founded on the principles of blood purity (/Said Slytherin, “We'll teach just those / Whose ancestry is purest.”/). In Harry's era, of course it's bad manners to call other people "mudbloods", but Slytherin still fosters an undercurrent of cultural elitism, even by benign members like Slughorn. Umbridge and Fudge, neither of them Death Eaters, believe in such concepts as "wizarding pride", which if you squint at it with a thesaurus, isn't that far from JKR's twitterpost of "racial superiority".

#+begin_quote
  "Of course you can," said Mrs Weasley. She was white to the lips, but she looked resolute. "He knows what Fudge is. It's Arthur's fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride."
#+end_quote

.

Do you think that the fandom whitewashes this aspect of Slytherin, since there are so many fics that portray Slytherin as sexy, misunderstood, or unfairly maligned by the other houses for little to no reason? Are Canon Hagrid and Fanon Ron justified in shunning Slytherins? Tbh, there are also plenty of people in this sub who shun Dramione and Drarry fics because Draco Malfoy is a racist bigot, even before he joins the Death Eaters.

Or should we all ignore JKR, ignore any symbolism, allegory, or moral commentary she intended in the books, and continue enjoying fanfiction about Slytherin!Harry and his political shenanigans with his best mate and/or boyfriend, Draco Malfoy? I mean, it's just fiction, and overthinking fictional racism is stupid when there are real issues to worry about, y'know?

.

As a minor note, the wacky post-canon retconning actually applies to [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/1/2/pottercast-131-j-k-rowling-interview-transcript/][a quote fom JKR in a 2008 interview,]] where she claims that the Slytherins came back to fight in the battle of Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  JKR: A part of the final battle that made me smile was Slughorn galloping back with Slytherins. But they'd gone off to get reinforcements first, you know what I'm saying? They came back, they came back to fight.
#+end_quote

From Deathly Hallows, ch. 31 and ch. 32:

#+begin_quote
  "Thank you, Miss Parkinson," said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. "You will leave the Hall first with Mr Filch. If the rest of your house could follow."

  Slowly, the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out: even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote
  "My Lord... please... my son..."

  "If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins."
#+end_quote

.

.

*TL;DR:* JKR has consistently given Slytherin negative traits and qualities in the books, where there are few to no onscreen examples of good Slytherins. However, this doesn't carry over to the fandom, where Slytherin is extremely popular among readers and fans, or to quasi-canon material like Pottermore, interviews, or Cursed Child.

*** I've felt that it's less of a "redemption" for specific characters, and more like part of an ongoing trend where JKR has changed her mind about certain writing choices she made during the series. Could be due to various changes in lifestyle as she's made the billionaire club and thus is no longer the struggling single mother who was once very critical of well-to-do, prestige-obsessed posh people like the Dursleys. Or it could also be a product of the shifting social values since she started the series in the 1990's.

One major of example of JKR changing her mind is the infamous [[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2014/02/01/j-k-rowling-hermioneron-relationship-was-wish-fulfillment/]["Ron and Hermione were wish fulfillment"]] interview.

#+begin_quote
  “I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment' she says. “That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron.... I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. "
#+end_quote

.

Though the times may have changed, the /books/ haven't, and I find it incredibly jarring to hear and see JKR say one thing, when the Ur-canon main series says something different.

Oh, and on the topic of redeeming Snape, Cursed Child has done it with JKR's full blessing.

.

*ACT III, SCENE IX*

#+begin_quote
  *SNAPE looks at him, every inch a hero, he softly smiles.*

**** I don't think JKR changed her mind about Snape. I think she already knows his backstory from the start, maybe the way Snape is redeemed is changed, but Snape is supposed to be the 'good' guy all along. I remember reading about Alan Rickman knowing Snape's story during PoA filming, that's why Snape tried to save the trio from Lupin in the movie. PoA movie is released on 2004, so definitely before HBP and DH.

***** JKR never changed Snape's backstory and character, but her stance on his legacy has shifted.

[[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/670176159561326592][In a twitter post, she says this:]]

#+begin_quote
  "Snape is all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world."
#+end_quote

But in the Cursed Child, Snape is straight up described as "every inch a hero".

.

If JKR hadn't changed her mind and wanted to keep Snape a grey character, she could have stepped in to veto the Cursed Child crew, but she didn't. [[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/extended-transcript-j-k-rowling-and-the-creative-team-behind-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/][To quote JKR on the Cursed Child:]]

#+begin_quote
  *J.K. ROWLING:* The developing the story, I think, was very collaborative between the three of us. I, for obvious reasons, had power of veto over everything. I could say, "No, that didn't happen." But no, it was the three of us. But the play is Jack's play. Jack did the writing. Jack did the heavy lifting. And he did it beautifully. And I couldn't be happier.

**** I have this feeling, though, that if Percy had been a Slytherin in canon, it would serve to "prove" that Slytherins are unemotional and would abandon their families for ambition. I mean, Percy's return to the good side was pretty glossed over (which is ok, because he's not a main character or anything), but I feel like that's only ok because he was a Gryffindor. Being a Slytherin would add a depth to this part of his character that the book simply doesn't have the pages to cover (precisely because he's not a main character or anything).

*** I don't think JKR intended Slytherin to be the "evil house" for the whole series. Yes, it was heavyhanded in the beginning, and the lack of nuance shows pretty badly in the first book with how all the sympathetic characters seem to be biased against Slytherin ("Never been a wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin"), to how the Slytherins were introduced and described by their looks ("Harry was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguards."), and all of them are weird looking like Pansy's pug nose, or straight up ugly.

The later books /try/ to show Slytherins with some nuance instead of being 100% EEEVULZ---Slughorn likes talented muggleborns and is willing to fight for Hogwarts in the last battle. Regulus takes care of his house elf and wants to square up with Voldy once he found out Voldy left Kreacher to die in the cave. They do some good things, absolutely. But at the end of the day, my issue is that all of the Slytherins we're introduced to in the story have one thing in common that their good deeds don't affect: their racial prejudice.

That's consistent with Dumbledore's character, though. As sad as it is.

- In Crimes of Grindelwald, Dumbledore was approached by Aurors in 1927 asking him to join in against Grindelwald. He refused and did nothing for 18 years, until the big duel in 1945. During this time, Grindelwald was holding rallies, murdering police officers, killing babies, and escaping conviction.

- In HP, Dumbledore knew Tom was up to no good in 1959, in the job interview. He calls him "Lord Voldemort" to his face, telling him that he knows about Tom's little Death Eater gang. He does nothing until the first wizarding war starts in the 1970's, and that's when he forms the original Order. But still, Voldemort would have won if not for the self-induced AK in 1981.

** I think JKR (or perhaps Warner Bros.?) killed this idea of Slytherin universal nastiness when introduced self-selection in houses on Pottermore. When approximately one fourth of your readership is considered evil, something has to give. I think this more than anything is the root of all those not-all-Slytherins-are-bad stories (it's a pitty, that house affiliation is not a question in HP Fanfiction Subreddit Survey). It is not sustainable to keep all Slytherins as evil any more.

** Tbh all this is just an example of JKR's limited black and white world view, because honestly? If racial superiority was something only Slytherins cared about, there wouldn't be purebloods in other houses. Look at how disdainful Aunt Muriel was to Hermione as a muggleborn, and there's zero indication she was ever a Slytherin. Plus if wizarding pride and non-magical prejudice etc was confined to "bad people" then there would be no stigma around squibs. Molly has a second cousin who's an accountant, but "they don't talk about him". There'd be no stigma around half breeds like Hagrid either, which apparently is flat out common prejudice amongst the wizarding community. And if we include just run of the mill prejudice, the good guys have that in spades too, even if we just look at their prejudice against foreigners (which, really JKR? Really?).

At the end of the day, any nuance included in HP was probably unintentional on JKR's part but fandom should not be limited to depicting Slytherin as racist assholes or only have racist assholes go to Slytherin, because a) how boring, and b) fanfiction has never been about recreating the original work to the letter, so why not have Slytherins be deeply misunderstood and secret heroes, or in sexy leather pants and eyeliner?

** Slytherin (and especially the founder their House is named after) having some nuance and depth is obviously the better literary choice, which is why it is such a popular narrative in fanfiction. On the other hand, it is absolutely not canon and pretending that Slyterhin isn't House Evil is a total retcon (fanfic authors who seem to be unaware of this make me sad). Slytherin is House Evil and Salazar was an evil racist... That's all there is to them canonically. Everything else is grasping at straws: "Look, Snape was in Slytherin" (who is only a hero by word of god, but not in my book) or "Draco was kind of conflicted about murder and torture, therefore he's secretly good"

They are so evil, that even not very bright children like Ron know it (and everyone else), but when it comes to cleaning up their government, no one would suspect the upstanding Malfoys or other ex-Slytherins.

The whole narrative of the story is kinda broken in that regard, as it implies that there's some nuance ("Oh yes, of course, you clearly were imperiused by the Dark Lord and wouldn't follow him willingly") while on the other hand everything and everyone involved with Slytherin is so unabashedly evil.

** I feel like the portrayal isn't very logical based on the attributes JKR herself assigns her creation.

If JKR truly wanted Slytherin to be the out and out evil house she could have identified it with different characteristics - e.g. traditionalism or purity if that was what she was always going to be going for. Identifying it with ambition was an interesting choice that both exposes her own ethical biases and creates a conundrum for herself, because...

In an essentially ethnically segregated society, aren't the minority - muggleborns - going to be frequently the MOST motivated to prove themselves worthy of inclusion, and thus those with the greatest relative ambitions, and thus those who are the MOST, not least, drawn to Slytherin house?

** I /hate/ the way she dealt with Slytherin, both the house and the historical non-character, and that first quote perfectly sums up why. Every house has its own characteristics, but evidently none of them matter in the face of biggotry because she wanted all of her villains in one place. If you're courageous, unambitious, and bigoted, then you're a Slytherin, apparently.

Fuck. That.

And it doesn't help that, rather than every bigoted character we see being Slytherin, every Slytherin character we see is bigoted. So I think the thing to do is, rather than whitewashing, say, the Malfoys, feature Slytherin characters who a) aren't bigoted, b) belong in Slytherin, and c) are multifaceted, complex characters. You could make an argument that doing so is whitewashing Slytherin house as a whole, but then I'd respond that the only reason that's the case is that Rowling lazily made it the dedicated Bad Guy Club, which is just bad writing that fanfic writers have no obligation to uphold.

Or, more succinctly: I recognise that Rowling has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.

** I think she's terribly stupid for believing that a bigot can't also be very brave, loyal, academically inclined or any other defining traits that may land a person into any of the other houses. None of those qualities are intrinsically good, nor do they preclude you from developing hateful opinions: it takes bravery to tell the world your distaste for another ethnicity; loyalty to stick with fellow bigots in the face of public outrage; a taste for research to scour for any piece of science that may support your shitty view. Real life hatred is much, much more complicated than "gryffindor gud, slytherin bad"

To me, her views smell of someone who tries to escape the nuances and complexity of real human society by writing an overly simplistic portrayal of bigotry. You will find hateful people on any side of the political spectrum and that in itself is a scary thought, because it means you can rarely, truly let your guard down. Even among people who you may call your own, you're bound to hear something that'll make you go "yeah, I don't know about that". So she writes a story where most, if not all shitty people can be neatly wrapped in a green and silver package for easy identification. Like that in itself isn't hateful as fuck. Like she's not using the same ignorant line of reasoning that Slughorn used with that quote: You're magically talented, you must be pureblooded --- You're racist, you must be Slytherin.

When I first read Harry Potter, I didn't detect that message because I had read so many other fantasy series where [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreBetter][Our Elves are Better]]is very, very true in most books with various magical races. The actual message became slightly more apparent when it was made obvious that Muggleborns were not inferior to purebloods/halfbloods in any way. But as far as being superior to muggles/squibs, it was kinda like /"yeah, duh, they can't do magic, no matter how hard they try"./ That's a skill that can never be learned if it's not in your genetics. It's not like skin color. Skin color doesn't affect your ability to learn something. I suppose the closest you could get to a real life scenario would be mentally or physically handicapped people, because there would be certain things they would never be able to do. So the normal person is "superior" skill-wise compared to the handicapped person, though that doesn't justify treating the handicapped person cruelly. So while I didn't understand why Slytherins were so /mean/ about it, the idea of being "superior" because you have a skill "magic" that can't be learned by everyone on the planet made perfect sense, in line with */Our Elves are Better/* typical fantasy story scenario.

[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage][Humans are Average]] is another common trope for fantasy.

I've said this before but, while there may be an argument for encouraging muggleborns to integrate into wizarding culture, they should be in no capacity /expected to/, because while a lot of fics do like to spin the witch hunts and bigotry as a reason for why wizarding culture became so insular, I should point out that muggleborns are the minority in this situation and expecting them to snuff out their own cultural practices to fit in with people who already assume they're second-rate at best is weird and gross and I really wish people would stop writing this.

So, by this logic, an unambitious hothead will still get sorted into Slytherin, even if they don't want to, as long as they believe themselves to be superior? I mean yeah, Salazar Slythering was a douchbag, but I don't remember that to be a defining house trait that the sorting hat sang about. That's so uninteresting. I still have a headcanon that Barty Crouch Jr was a Gryffyndor (read that in one fic, I know that new pottermore lists him as Slytherin, I don't care).

This is more of a dig at fans who identify as Slytherin (that is with resourcefulness and ambition) than anything substantial imo.

"Not all Slytherins think they're racially superior." Andromeda Tonks is actually a great example of a Slytherin marrying a muggle, so is Snape's mother. Yes, they are minor characters, but they still count. Harry mainly meets Slytherins who try to antagonize him, because they themselves or their parents are Death Eathers. Considering that "thinking before acting" is a house trait, there is no reason why there can't be Slytherins who are perfectly good people, but just don't draw attention to themselves.

JKR herself went back and forth on what she thinks of Slytherins. Many of the things about Slytherin house in fanfic came from the old pottermore website. Slytherin welcoming letter on the old pottermore website said how Slytherin house was misunderstood and actually has muggleborns in it and that Merlin himself was a Slytherin. It was just another house back then. Considering that HP was much more mainstream then than now, a lot of fans were sorted into Slytherin. This take is changed in the new pottermore website. Slytherins on the new site are almost uniformally portrayed as Death Eater fanatics.

I firmly believe in the Death of the author concept ([[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author]], [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor]]) . What JKR says on twitter is just one interpretation, no more valid than any of the readers. So yes, I think we should just continue do our own thing and don't pay attention to her.

** The way I see it, Slytherin house is a self reinforcing toxic environment. Its not a dumping ground for racist bullies so much as it is a place for children to molded into racist bullies. I think if there were no houses many of the purebloods would still be racist due to the influence of their parents/pureblood society, but it'd be much less they'd interact more with students who had different backgrounds viewpoints.

Basically, Slytherin house is the equivalent of an internet echo chamber.

** First of all, I'm always a little annoyed when I see people explain Slytherin is full of Blood Purist because Slytherin the Founder was one. The guy lived 1000 years before the story, people and mentality change. As a reminder, another Founder of the same time thought it was perfectly acceptable to hit your enemy with a sword, and some exceptin aside people in Gryffindor do not do that.

​

Concerning this house, I think Rowling never truly decided what she wanted to do with this house. She spent most of the serie presenting them as bad people (Slughorn is the most "Good" developed Slytherin Character in the serie, which say a lot when you see his actions and Harry opinion of him),. Yet she decided in the end to say that they were just like all the other house. So for example she wrote this scene (19 years later) where Harry say to Albus that it would be ok in he goes to Slytherin, and that his 2nd name is from a "good Slytherin", or she said in interview that Slughorn did lead an assault against Death Eater from Hogsmeade during the Battle (but never said it in the book because . . .).

​

So since there is a difference between Rowling words and actions, I guess both opinion can be valid, and personally I prefer to present Slytherin as a "Grey" house mainly because I don't see why Slytherin are not killed the day of their Sorting (if they are still all bad after one thousand years), and also I don't really like the idea that 25% of the population is bad.

There is obviously some white whasing in fanfictions, but it's HP fanfic, I'm pretty sure you can always find at least one pic where any character is Good, Bad and Neutral. And I think saying "not all Slytherin are bad" is not Whitewashing, unlike things like "Death Eaters had a point".

​

Finally, I think that the most important fic in fiction is that the story must be interesting, nothing else matter than that for me and I can probably read anything as long as it's well written.\\
With that in mind, I really like the fics with a Slytherin Harry because it has potential to be very interesting. Unlike canon where Harry allies don't really have a choice (Ron is from the ultimate Blood Traitor family, and Hermione is the magical equivalent of a Jew in front of Nazis), Slytherin gives the possibility of hesitations. I really like the idea of character like Malfoy or Nott struggling between their friendship with Harry and their family expectations to join the Dark Lord and kill him.

Too bad. JKR wrote the whole house as being full of evil little psychopathic 11 - 17 year olds. All of them are blood purist. All of them want to kill all the 'mud bloods'. That's how she wrote it, until she got to the very end of the series, and realized she tried to convince us 11 year olds were dark lords.

It was a terrible writing choice that only survived because it's a children series.

** I agree, I've often said JKR wasn't fair to Slytherin. There is no chance that all the blood purists ended up in Slytherin, it just doesn't make sense and is statistically improbable. Like wise if Slughorn and Snape were the best representatives of Slytherin house, that does not bode well, both of them did the right thing in the end, but they wer both very flawed.

My view of what Slytherin would be like during Harry's years at Hogwarts is that blood purists would actually be a vocal minority rather than the majority that they seemed in canon. In Harry's first year it had already been over 1000 years since Hogwarts was founded, even with wizards and witches living so much longer than muggles, there is no way views on blood purity wouldn't have changed with the times. Hell in canon Muriel talks about the changes to the way squibs were treated in her day compaired to 1997. So I imagine that most of Slytherin views cunning and ambition to be their house values and blood purity might be what they were founded on, but it was a different time then.

I think Slytherin would be pretty divided between those who still believe in blood purity (most likely because Voldemort was fanning the flames) and are quite vocal about it (mostly Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy etc.) then there are those that don't believe in blood purity which is most of the house but there are three groups among those who don't believe in blood purity. Group 1: Those who don't really care about blood status at all. Group 2: passively opposed to blood purity, they don't say anything or do anything because they aren't going to stick their neck out. Group 3: actively opposed to blood purity, they go out of their way to stand up for half-bloods and muggle borns, particularly those sorted into Slytherin, this group is the smallest of the three, but not insignificant. Some of the people in group 3 might be motivated as well by not having their house painted with the same brush as the blood purists.

If I ever get around to completing a fic, this is how I'll likely structure Slytherin.

** I think for all the social justice she puts in her books, house elves for example, she makes Slytherin the scapegoat. Slytherin values cunning and ambition, this in and of itself is definitely not a bad thing, Ambition gets you further then playing Exploding Snap games and cunning is something everybody uses at some point, even if it's just a white lie to your boss.

The problem comes into play when these values are exaggerated. This happens in the books, Slytherin becomes nothing more then this place where people bully and don't have friends because they only want to get power, mostly with politics.

This over exaggeration isn't so prevented in the other houses; Gryffindors don't jump of the roof to prove how ‘brave' they are, Ravenclaw isn't the house of child geniuses with no social skills, and Hufflepuffs are great finders!

No but seriously, Hufflepuffs are also exaggerated in the books, often it's either the trash can for people who cannot go anywhere else or they just exist.

There is so much more to each house, Slytherins get far in life due to their ambition and knowledge and aren't just bigots with old money,

Ravenclaws want to absorb all the knowledge there is and love to share it, they aren't just nerds or Luna's. They want to know how the world works, they want to understand.

Gryffindors fight for their own, they're, much like Hufflepuffs, fiercely loyal and follow most of all their instinct and moral compass, they do things because they believe them to be good.

Hufflepuffs too are more then just loyal friends, they want to work, they're not afraid of a challenge, and when you ask them for help on your homework, they'll probably get our of their way to first learn about it so they can teach you. They want to help and better themselves and the world.

When these characteristics get over exaggerated you get cannon Slytherin. You get A Gryffindor hospital, a House of followers, and the most antisocial, nerdy House that nobody even knows exist until the next feast or classes.

Personally, I don't think Salazar himself was the big bigot JK made him out to be. He was one of the most powerful wizards during his time and considering his traits not a very stupid one either. I think he was weary of muggleborns, I think he might not like the danger they could turn out to be. Being as cunning as he was, he probably saw a very easy and danger exploit, what if they turned of him, on Hogwarts. Remember the during the founders time their was a lot of hate to these ‘devils'. Followers of Satan itself. I think he was scared for the possibilities.

Anyway, I just think JK made every house but Gryffindor bland, they where divided in good or bad houses. And Slytherin was the only bad one.

If only for one reason, Voldemort. Voldemort had managed to effectively turn slytherin house into a recruiting ground for his followers

This had a knock on effect, in which people if they went to Hogwarts before Voldemort openly spoken against the more hardcore death eaters stances, would stay silent instead because why risk your Future Career by pissing off the powerful and wealthy, I think historically you might have pissed of a malfoy but been fine due to other rich families willing to support you because you pissed of the malfoys. But Voldemort had changed all That

If voldemort had been a hufflepuff we might have seen the same thing but with hufflepuff

I like Regulus alot, he is really the product of his enviroment and unlike sirius who got sorted into another house and gained a friendship with James potter,and a sort of second family in James parents. All Regulus had was his parents telling him how noble and just voldemorts cause is he then goes to school and all his bunk-mates are hearing the same thing from there parents. so he Joins up to this heroic cause, only to discover its nothing like his parents said. yes Regulus understands he is superior to a muggleborn, but why most they kill and torture muggleborns surely its enough to just be superior.

I do think shunning them is wrong though, because it pushes slytherin to band together, and people who are alone are perfect targets for such extremist movements as it gives them a place and a purpose.

Daryl Davis a black musician managed to befriend and get many KKK members to leave the group because of the friendship they had with him.

Honestly the wizarding world should be more a mess, you sort people based on personality traits when they are 11 you throw them into rooms with other people based on said personality traits. This is a house for people with ambition and cunning, lets put a bunch of ambitious 11 year olds and surround them with other ambitious 11 year olds and then lets repeat it for a thousand years.

I am surprised Raven-claw is not a bunch of nutter intellectuals who look down on anyone who is not a claw and have no morals due to an insane pursuit of knowledge.

Slytherin not Joining the final battle makes some sense If your a slytherin student the chance, of a friend or family member being on Voldemort side is far higher and how many people are willing to fight family members to the death.

I think slytherin earnt its reputation, but its reputation also forces all Members of the house into a hole which is tough to escape.

I think alot of slytherins are good people, its just they got brainwashed by a crazy cult that had formed around Voldemort

** Here's how I've been thinking on it, since I had kids of my own and I've been rereading the series to them...

Harry is 11 when the story begins. The story is primarily told from Harry's perspective.

From Harry's first introduction to Slytherin, he is presented with the anti-Slytherin bias showed by Hagrid.

#+begin_quote
  "School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but -"

  "I bet I'm in Hufflepuff," said Harry gloomily.

  "Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."
#+end_quote

An impressionable youth got his first introduction to Dark Wizards through a generalization into Slytherin, made by his very first trusted guide to the Wizarding world.

And the rest of the story follows. He is subsequently sorted to Gryffindor, surrounded by companions of Gryffindor House, engaged in direct rivalry with Slytherin as a quidditch player, and all the while, even as Harry grows and learns, consider the probably that, at the back of his mind, there's Hagrid's voice from the first trip to Diagon Alley, saying all Dark Wizards are Slytherins. Everything we are shown as readers confirms the bias we saw first in Hagrid, because, well, it's hard to to overcome our biased when we get so much support in that bias from the people we trust.

Slytherin /could/ have been written with more nuance. But it doesn't actually make sense to do that from Harry's perspective. There are precious few moments that we see Harry re-think his opinion of Slytherins. There's Slughorn, whom Harry decides is more like a spider than a snake, and there's the climax of the epic including what Harry sees in Snape's memories.

To even get a critical plot point in the book -- Snape's vow to Narcissa near the beginning of HBP -- we have to /break out/ of Harry's perspective to get it.

So. To get my Slyth fix, I go to fanfic, especially Snapefic. And that's ok. It's not that we are whitewashing an evil group. It's not even that we are mad about the way JKR treated "us Slytherins" (for those who choose to identify as Slytherins of course). It's just a different /perspective/ on a rich magical world. I rather applaud stories (whether it's the HP series itself or a great Snapefic) that /maintain tight perspective/ in the narration. It's just good storytelling :)

** I think that, especially considering the Epilogue, that JKR in the end /wanted/ to portray Slytherins as just another house, but with a (very) troubled past due to the founder and Voldemort. However, the books completely fail to portray this, not showing us a single case of a "good" Slytherins -- Slughorn might not be outright evil but is clearly very self-serving, Andromeda as you said has no presence at all, and while Snape ultimately turned against Voldemort, he did so more out of a desire to avenge Lily rather than because he felt Voldemort was wrong.

I've always preferred Slytherins being just another house, but that people like Voldemort, Snape and (on a far lesser scale) Draco Malfoy make the entire house look bad. However, I can agree with Slytherins being especially prone to creating bad guys, due to the traits the house prefer -- ambition and cunning. Keep in mind, people go there as 11-year olds. People aren't born evil (except for psychopaths), they become evil due to their upbringing. If everyone is telling you that you're going to become a bad person, you are almost inevitably going to turn out bad. Take Snape for example -- he had a troubled childhood with an abusive parent, but as a child became really close with a muggleborn. Then he joined Slytherin, and the supposedly "good guys" picked on him and everyone kept telling him that he'd turn bad -- hell, the Headmaster forced him into silence for a traumatic experience rather than trying to find him help, and the Slytherins pressured him into joining Voldemort. Is it really surprising that he did in the end? I have a very hard time seeing him join them had he been, say, a Ravenclaw instead. And his case (pre-spying) is almost certainly not unique.

Also, if blood purity is an important trait of the house, why does half-bloods end up there? Riddle is understandable given that he was the heir, but Snape? We also have the Hat consider Slytherin for Harry, another half-blood. And surely they weren't the only ones...

** They're 11 when they get sorted. They can be misguided, ignorant, mean, spoiled and any number of other things but it's kinda gross that a quarter of all children get branded as and treated as evil every year. Where's the impetus for them to change? Why would they sympathise with a group of people that sees them as irredeemably evil from the time they enter society?

** (Warning, long post)

Excuse me for saying this, but I think she botched it up pretty badly. Like, in The Goblet of Fire Dumbledore gave that whole spiel about unity and working together only for that idea to be completely thrown out the window, along with the scene with Draco and him being afraid and having doubts. Those scenes went nowhere and amounted to nada in the end. Deathly Hallows rolls around and Slytherin House ends up grounded in the dungeon, Draco doesn't get a redemption arc and remains a coward, and the other schools are off somewhere twiddling their fingers while England gets heckin destroyed.

Imagine how COOL it would've been if those story threads had actually been utilized! Start hinting at stuff in OotP, like Slytherins sneaking out for DA meetings because Umbridge treats them like sh*t or some other motivation, Slytherins feeding DA information and Umbridge disinformation, Slytherins being resourceful pulling favours from higher ups, Slytherins being cunning by coming up with steel tight alibis in case they get caught out at night, and using the fact that no one suspects Slytherins to disobey Umbridge AGAINST Umbridge. Heck, you can even throw in some info on the Slytherin situation and some added character depth for characters like Malfoy as well as some pay the dog moments to hint at their good, redemption worthy sides. Then in HBP show things progressing. Maybe Malfoy DOES get caught with the Mark by Pomfrey after the Sectrumsempra incident and the staff actually look into what's going on in Slytherin and help the kids become better people. Maybe another unrelated Slytherin, emboldened by his different house friends snitches or takes charge. Show Slytherin House making some effort to get better. Then show it paying off in DH, with all Four houses, and maybe the other schools, joining together to fight! That would've been really cool!

TL;DR JK Rowling wasted a perfectly good opportunity to have rebel Slytherins screw with Umbridge, a satisfying character arc for Draco Malfoy, and an even more epic and satisfying battle scene. And I am ALL the bitter and salty about it.

** All Death Eaters and wannabes end up in Slytherin because their belief in violent racial purity excludes them from any other house. Attacking civilians goes against fairness (Hufflepuff) and chivalry (Gryffindor) and believing that BS excludes them from Ravenclaw. They are left with the ambition to purge a race, so off to Slytherin it is. And since the sorting takes places upon arrival, the indoctrination from their parents has no chance to wear off.

I mean, all Death Eaters we know the house of other than Pettigrew came from there, and it appears that he joined out of fear and not conviction. The only decent Slytherin in canon is Andromeda Tonks, the misfit background character. Snape voluntarily joined the magical Nazis and Slughorn didn't bring up the Horcruxes, not even in private. That certainly cost a few lives.

*** Quirrel was a ravenclaw, though if he was a death eater before we don't know. Barty Crouch jr received 12 OWLs, which points towards ravenclaw. There are a lot of death eaters which just aren't talked about so the data isn't, imo, fair.

** I read some fanfic where they managed to portray Salaraz Slytherin in a non racist way. In it, by pureblood, they meant people who were born from magical creature (E.g giant or unicorn or vampire children)

Gordic was a nice person, but as the years went on he started to grow hate for vampires and similar creatures as he hears more and more stories of them killing many people. He refuses to teach the children of the purebloods because of his hatred.\\
Salaraz then says in his rage (Which is justified, as Gordic has forgotten that Salaraz and his entire family is purebloo. Gordic forgot because salaraz was so nice and did not match up to his idea of pureblood), 'Fine, I'll take in the ones with pure blood! Those /muggleborns/ you teach have filthy blood after all!". This statement led people to beleive in the fanfic that he was racist.

Anyways, In canon, I think Slytherin was suspicous of muggles, and that extended to muggleborns. So he did not treat them correctly. It is justified to hate the people who burn witches and wizards at the stake, but not to hate children who did nothing.

** I think they were originally meant to be the "bad guys" and that attempts to whitewash Slytherin is retconning. It makes no sense otherwise, the whole house is portrayed as irredeemable evil in many ways. I never understood why they didn't disband it in the end. Sure, you have some individual Slytherins who are good, but as a whole, the house is obviously a bad environment.

** Personally I've always looked at it the other way around from most... all that rot about ambition, cunning, etc... is already the whitewashing of Slytherin house.

This is the house for the bullys, the racists, the misogynists (no girls on their Quidditch team in case anyone forgot), and the assholes. Even if you somehow purged pure-bloodism from the Magical World, which I doubt it can be removed entirely, you'll still have those who wish to dominate and control and 'win' in life not be being the hardest working, the smartest, or the bravest but simply because 'I deserve it'.

Take the whole "deciding their fate at 11 years old with a magic hat" aspect of it out, and just look at the world... and tell me honestly that ~25% of the world doesn't fit in that bucket.

There are plenty of ambitious characters, most notable various Weasley brothers, and I'd argue the Marauders were more cunning in their own way than nearly any Slytherin we've ever met, and none of them were sorted there... because ambition and cunning are euphemisms for "bad kids".

Now, the flip side of this is you get a lot of kids who are probably borderline on this, raised on their parent's prejudices but not quite ready to rebel like Sirius was at age 11 that get sent there... some give it up (like Andromeda by marrying a muggle-born) and some go full Death Eater due to lack of good influences.

** Honestly, there is a very simple way to explain why Slytherin house was a "bad house", and I will provide an analogy with the Chaos Gods from Warhammer 40k.

Each house embodies the best and worst traits of one of those gods.

Gryffindor - Khorne - At Gryffindor's best, it reflects a "Justice-aligned" version of Khorne. At it's worst, it reflects some of the depravity of Khorne. We are shown hints of this through the Weasley twins, but J.K. Rowling wrote this house to never be in the wrong, so it has some level of plot armor keeping it good.

Hufflepuff - Nurgle - Nurgle is the Chaos God of family, and represents the will of humanity to struggle on no matter the circumstances. This seems to embody Hufflepuff's characteristics of loyalty and dedication.

Ravenclaw - Tzeentch - Ravenclaw is pretty obviously an expy of a Tzeentch balanced between good and depravity. Pottermore references how Ravenclaw has a focus on even the strangest forms of divination, reflecting Tzeentch rather strongly. If Tom Riddle did join this house, it would likely have a similar level of depravity to Slytherin, with more competence as well. I will even go as far as to argue that this would make Gryffindor and Hufflepuff more depraved than in canon.

Slytherin - Slaneesh - Slytherin doesn't quite blatently reflect this, but it is fairly close. Umbridge was a Slytherin, and we all know how much of a sadist she is. There is an argument that Draco Malfoy enjoyed his rivalry with Harry Potter, or else he wouldn't go out of his way to seek him out to harass him. The best form of this has been shown in the books as Snape's love, to the point of obsession, of Lily. As for what characteristics Slytherin has that match this, it would quite simply be the ambition to reach these pleasures.

In truth, Slytherin is simply the most depraved of the houses.

*** Slytherin isn't unrealistic because its members are too evil, it's unrealistic because the sorting system, nominally, is based on personality and values, and there's no reason to think that every bigot in Hogwarts would be more ambitious than they are brave, studious, or loyal. Rowling wanted an evil house rather than having evil students, so she lazily ignored the purported traits of the house (that she wrote) and turned it into Hufflepuff but for cunts.

*** *Sundown town*

Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns or gray towns, were all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation historically by enforcing restrictions excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation, and violence. The term came from signs posted that "colored people" had to leave town by sundown. "At least until the early 1960s, ...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia."Discriminatory policies and actions distinguish sundown towns from towns that have no black residents for demographic reasons. Towns have been confirmed as sundown towns using newspaper articles, county histories, and Works Progress Administration files, corroborated by tax or U.S. Census records showing an absence of blacks or sharp drop in the black population between two censuses.
