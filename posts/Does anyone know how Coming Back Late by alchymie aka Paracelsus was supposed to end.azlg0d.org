SPOILERS FOR /COMING BACK LATE/

So, I pretty much think that /Coming Back Late/ by alchymie aka Paracelsus might just be the best HP fanfic of all time. I also think that the fact that it's been abandoned is the greatest crime in HP fanfic history. I've been re-reading it for the umpteenth time, and it's got me wondering if anyone out there might know how a few plot lines were intended to be resolved. Namely, what's going on with Ted Lupin? Who is his father? Remus? Sirius? Is Ted a werewolf? What's going on with that? I'm really just posting this here in the hopes that the author might have told someone at some point how he planned to resolve that particular point.

I know that there was an unofficial continuation of the story some years ago, I think it was called /Coming Back Later/ or something like that, but I couldn't get into it. The style was too... off? Different from alchymie's?

So, yeah. Anyone have any info?

** I have no clue about the ending, but the [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8073/46][portkey version]] has one more chapter than the ff.net version.

*** Yeah, I know. I was following the story back when it was actively being posted on portkey. I think that makes me old.

*** Yeah, I mentioned that in the original post. Also, I don't think that was ever finished either.

#+begin_quote
  We all remember the scene from "Deathly Hallows": Harry was struck down by the Dark Lord, and his spirit seemed to go to King's Cross and confer with Albus Dumbledore. Suppose, instead of returning directly to his body, Harry's spirit came back late?
