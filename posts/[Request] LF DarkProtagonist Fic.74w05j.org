I've read Prince of the Dark Kingdom, Well Groomed Mind, Black Queen, Applied Cultural Anthropology...a lot, actually. I'm looking for similar fic, where we have a villain or dark protagonist, or where the protagonist is corrupted. I don't particularly care who it is (I've read some excellent Hermione ones).

I'm especially interested in fic that follows the descent, or fic where the character doesn't angst over being evil.

Strong preference for no slash, and please nothing with explicit sex scenes (I'd like to be able to read these at work, lol). Also no wrong-BWL.

Thanks!


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is by far my favorite dark!Harry fic.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
