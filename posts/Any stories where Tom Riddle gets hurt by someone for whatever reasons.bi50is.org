I'm looking for any fics that have him in a position where he's getting hurt by somebody, because most of the stories I found were him hurting others. I remember reading one where he and Voldemort were separeted and Voldemort tortured him or something like that. Thanks in advance


** A few in which Tom Riddle is tortured (mentally or physically):

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3459731/][The Two Body Problem]] by Tozette - (Complete, login to Ao3 to read) Ginny gives the Diary to Hermione in year two.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8742878/1/Temperance-and-the-Tower][Temperance and the Tower]] - (DEAD) Heavily AU fic in which Hermione is a transfer student to Hogwarts during Tom Riddle's 6th year. Tom underestimates how badly Hermione will react to his dangerous obsession.

In which Tom Riddle is seriously injured:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13126915/1/Diablerie][Diablerie]] - (In progress, updates frequently) - Tom Riddle is accidentally transported to Harry's present in the midst of a harrowing summer of surviving the Blitz in London.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of a Feather]] - (In progress, updates frequently) The injury is in a recent chapter, so quite a ways into the fic.

Other

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Stepbrother]] - (In progress) AU fic in which Hermione is born the same year as Tom Riddle. Her parents adopt him, and Tom proves to be a very difficult brother to live with. The plot eventually ventures into some weird blackrom territory, so I'm usually hesitant to recommend it, but it fits the request.

  Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, he doesn't want to die

  In 1935, Hermione Granger meets a boy who despises fairy stories, liars, and mediocrity. He offers her a deal of mutual convenience, and soon a tentative friendship forms---if Tom would ever lower himself to call anyone a "friend". But whatever they have, it's something special, and if there's anyone who can appreciate Specialness, it's Tom Riddle. (1930's Childhood Friends AU)
