I do not ask for the translation found in the books (Muggel) but what would you think, those whose native language is German, would be the word used by the German-speaking wizarding community to call what Brits call 'Muggles'.


** Nicht-Magische = non-magicals.

And one of the German schools would be named Brockenrode and located in the Harz mountains.

*** That seems like a lot of syllables compared to the terms that are used in cannon (muggle, nomaj). I'd expect that the general public would gradually warp the phrase over time into something short that rolls off the tongue better.

**** How about "Banausen"?

Banause = Mundane, boring person, hack, ignoramus; french origin and related to english banally and banausic

******* I agree. That would fit with the way that colloquial terms like "nomaj" probably evolved from the more formal sounding "non magical", and "muggle" probably evolved from "mundane."

*********** To be honest, I'm not very familiar with the geography of Germany. I do know that the Black Forest has many magic-related folk tales associated with it, so that's the only appropriate location that springs to my mind.

************ Definitely, but it would be more a location for Austria or Switzerland. See "Rüdiger Zweigl and the School in the Mountain" on ff.net , where the Austrian school is located near the Grossglockner.

If the Alps serve as a location for a German school, it would make most sense for the Alemannic language continuum (Southwest Germany, Baden and Württemberg) along with German-speaking parts of Switzerland.

***** Haha, you're not wrong... though from what I've read Germans tend to abbreviate the most long-winded compound words; i.e. "Lastkraftwagen" becomes "Lkw", "Personenkraftwagen" is often just "Pkw", etc.

*** As a non German speaker, I'd try shortening that to Nicht-Mag to be more catchy. Provided that doesn't change the meaning entirely...

**** No. German has a much lower tendency to shorten words than English. Instead of shortening words, you shorten sentences.

The English expression "Just a moment" can get shortened to "Just a mo'." A German would not do that. Instead of "Nur einen Moment" (just a moment) they would say "Moment", meaning "just a moment".

If words really deserve shortening, Germans are more likely to use acronyms and use them as one word.

So Nicht-Magische would become NMs (an-ams) or NiMags (neemahgs) before it becomes Nicht-Mag.

** Geistlose. The literal translation is someone without ghost/spirit(which kinda fits because Muggles dont leave ghosts)

But what fits most is the meaning of the word itself, which is refers to people who are mundane, boring, stupid, without any substance, lacking any creativity or thoughts on their own.

** German is my first language for reference

The first word that springs to mind would be "Nichtmagier", or "Not-Mage".

However, looking back a little shows that "Un" has undergone a lot of change, so "Unmagier" may also be applicable. It depends really on various cultural influences.

** I´m just going to throw in some words I just made and/or looked up:

​

#+begin_quote
  */Unnerbericher -/* Harzer Mundart (local dialect) for "Unterberger" ("those below the mountain") as a reference to the Brocken (or the Blocksberg), a very windy mountain in the Harz region with a mythological connection to magic, witches and the Walpurgisnight.

  */Schtrichs or Klumbs -/* again Harzer Mundart, this time for "/Macken/" (the defects, the quirks), a bit more degratory

  */Zauberlose -/* high German for "the magicless"

  */Fadleut/* - Swabian for "/fade/langweilige Leute/" ("boring/unspecial people"), this time as a reference to the Black Forrest, which is also often seen as a place of magic and folklore.

  */Grimms -/* a reference to the Brothers Grimm, who, in my headcanon have had extensive contact with the local magical communities. The stories that those communities told them were the seed for the fairytales they are known for today.
