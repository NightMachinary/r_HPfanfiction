Many rooms were hidden in the halls of Hogwarts.

Not too deep in the walls, but never looked for, was a small room with no formal name. But in this room was where the founders themselves argued over the ownership of the very school. And how they settled these feuds?

The Classic Fast-Dealing Property Trading Board Game.

But now the lease is up, and its up to a new set of players to swindle their way into ownership of the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

×+×+×+×+

So basically the founders flipped the table halfway through the game to figure out who gets what, and nobody won(as most games of monopoly end up.) And they called it a draw. Everybody gets a fourth.

But now the game must be finished, restarted, etc.

The players can be whoever. Heads of Houses, Students, Headmasters(GoF), House Ghosts, ETC.
