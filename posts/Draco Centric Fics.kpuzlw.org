Exactly what it says, I love that cowardly little prat he's hilarious.

I've read The Code, Exile, Eclipse. Pretty much all the old ones

Are there any new/recent Draco centric fanfic.

I'm open to all pairings involving Draco except for incest. Gross.

Dramione is my least favorite, out of all the ships but if the romance isn't that big a part I'm fine with it.

If they're other parings in the story as long as it's not Snape/Hermione(or Harry) and Lucius(Narcissa)/Hermione (or Harry) I'm fine with it.

Also open to crossover fics that are Draco centric

  After the war, Draco Malfoy was given a choice.But what no one knew was that the Veil is more complicated than Severus Snape, more enigmatic than Albus Dumbledore, and as unpredictable as those Weasley Twins.Now Draco is trapped amidst horrifyingly advanced muggles, without a wand or a prayer. All he has are his wits, a surfeit of trust issues, scars and tattoos he'd rather not explain, and a raging case of xenophobia.Then the aliens attack...

**** Your hunt actually matches mine. I've just started some Draco centric fics but they might be rubbish. I can link them if you like? They might also be gold.

  Hogwarts, Sixth Year. Hermione Granger is assigned to tutor Draco Malfoy in Arithmancy. When two enemies find common ground, will that be enough to change the course of events leading up to the Second Wizarding War? Prequel to The Ginger Malfoy.

  All it takes is one look in a mirror and an ill-advised attempt to shatter it, before an embittered Draco Malfoy fresh out of Azkaban is sent back into his body on the day he gets his Hogwarts letter.Suddenly, Draco has an unwanted second chance, with a Sorting Hat that doesn't know what to do with him, a certain Muggleborn who won't leave his study table alone, and green eyes he just can't get out of his head. And then there's his new wand, whose choice of him could just mark him as every bit as dark a wizard as his name means he should be.
