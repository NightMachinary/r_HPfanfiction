What events would play out differently if Barty "tough on the Dark Arts" Crouch Sr hadn't ruined his reputation during the prosecution of his son (say, he did everything to confirm Barty Jr's innocence or guilt before the trial, including Veritaserum and a Pensieve) and beaten Fudge in the race for Minister of Magic instead of being reduced to heading the Department of International Magical Co-operation?


** In terms of political image, convicting his own pleading son is not much worse than trying to save his son but Veritaserum proving Jr is guilty. He would look as a neglecting father who didn't notice what kind of things his son was involved in.

It's being stuck being sword and wall... and, as many politicians in similar positions before have found out, there's just no good outcome out of it. If he is lawful he appears heartless yo the common witch and wizard, if he isn't, he can be blamed of favoritism and twerking the law to his benefit. If Ministers weren't elected by popular choice he might had a chance as a heartless candidate... But it's tough.

I say the best way this works is either 1) Ministers are not elected on popular vote and Crouch is named even if perceived as heartless or 2) Jr is truly innocent and he proves it.

*** I'd actually really like to read option 2. Don't think I've seen one yet.
