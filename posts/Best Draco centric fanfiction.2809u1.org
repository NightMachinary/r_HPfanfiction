** Definitely not my cup of tea, but I'd say the Draco Dormiens series. Be wary, though, as most of it is plagiarized.

** I second the Draco Dormiens series. I really liked it, regardless of the plagiarism that went on. Might have been immoral but the series was very enjoyable.

** I have two that I can offer.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=319086][Marked]] follows Draco from the night of the Battle in the Department of Mysteries through the meeting with Voldemort where he receives his Dark Mark and his mission to kill Dumbledore.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320684][Detox]] begins about three months after Voldemort's death and tells the story of Draco's courtship of Astoria Greengrass.

Detox is truly novel-length while Marked is borderline between novella and novel.
