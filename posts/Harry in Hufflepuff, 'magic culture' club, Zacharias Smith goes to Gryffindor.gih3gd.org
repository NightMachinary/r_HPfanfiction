Looking for a fic where Harry is sorted into Hufflepuff. Zacharias is so jealous of the attention Harry gets, he goes into Gryffindor. Not a major plot point, but one I hope will help the fic stand out in memory. Somehow Harry and his friends (can't remember if it is Ron and Hermione, or others) get a club going where wizard raised students teach magic culture, etc., to Muggle raised students. It becomes a big deal. Even Draco gets involved. One of the side effects is Lucius wants to get rid of the diary and dumps it in Knockturn Alley, by a hag with a small cache of books. Unfortunately for him, he didn't exactly keep a low profile. Someone spotted him and retrieved the diary, so it wound up at Hogwarts anyway. I don't believe this is a time-travel fic, but I could be mistaken. I've read so many fics they blur together.

TIA :D

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** While we're here: Snape talks about the Guardian's benefits and the author mentions someone who did the math. Does anyone have a link? Or remember the ballpark amount?

Because those were very real things back then.

Edit: Child Benefits + Guardian Allowance.

Edit2: I remembered about the wayback machine. It's ~940 pounds a year, for 16 years.

*** 940 pounds/year doesn't seem like it would cover all the costs of a child. Is it meant to? Clothes, shoes, toiletries, meals, school supplies, play things?

**** It's supposed to help. There was still welfare and all that jazz, but the Dursleys couldn't get away with claiming that.

But for the Dursleys?

- Clothes: Hand me downs
- Meals: barely fed him
- Play things: lol
- School supplies: second hand, leftovers, not given, etc.

This was practically all profit for them.

***** the benefit isn't meant to comfortably cover a Childs needs by design, the great conservative government have overhauled the benefits system in the UK making them less generous to in theory provide an incentive to go to work, make sure they went dependent on the state,

​

and as [[/u/Nyanmaru_San][u/Nyanmaru_San]] said, the Dursley's (from canon anyway) wouldn't have spent any more on harry then that had too.

​

*current child benefit is £84.40 a month in UK*

***** I know the Dursley's didn't spend it as they were supposed to. I meant, theoretically, what did the government expect the money to cover.
