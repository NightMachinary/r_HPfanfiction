Just recently started reading HP fics and the two I've really liked are Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived, and On the Way to greatness. I just recently finished all their chapters posted on fanfiction.net, but then I read that there might be other chapters floating around on websites other than it. So basically i'd love some information about how many chapters are out for each of those stories, and also where I can find the chapters. Sorry If I formatted this Question wrong/I have no idea how to add line breaks on text posts. cheers


** There's 5 more chapters on DLP for HP & BWL, but they're pretty far below the standards of the chapters uploaded to ffn. You need an account and 5 posts to access the WBA forum there, which is where they're located (as well as many other amazing stories in progress).

As for OTWTG, I don't know anything about there being more chapters, but if there is, they're likely only accessible for the author's betas, so unavailable for normal people.

*** This is exactly what i was after, thanks. Do you happen to know if either of them are still planning on updating their stories, or are they abandoned?

** I don't know about those 2 in particular, but whenever someone says there is more out there the two places to check first is DLP and spacebattles.
