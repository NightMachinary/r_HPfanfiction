And everybody else -- including magical creatures, like werewolves and centaurs -- are treated (near-)equally to witches and wizards, particularly those who are muggle-born.

How would you write a fic where the pure-bloods are the good guys, without flanderising either side?


** Slight meme warning but here's how I would do it.

The muggle population of the UK has a population boom, the likes of which are almost completely unprecedented in British history.

Ignoring the real world ramifications, the main side effect of this boom is that for about the next decade, the majority of witches and wizards that go through Hogwarts are muggleborns.

Combine this with the war(which ever war you want to use, Grindlewald, VW I or VW II) and now there are almost no pureblood students.

During this time of pure muggleborn growth in the wizarding community progressive movements are made. Werewolves are given pack land, Vampires are given the run of the wizarding blood donations in the way Goblins are allowed to run the banks (Under oaths that keep them from being able to use the blood for any magic rituals). Etc.

But against purebloods these laws are heavily biased. Pack lands are aquired by the government taking ancestrial homes away from families. Family Grimoires are confiscated because magic should be shared as a community. Of course purebloods fight back against these things but for once the wizarding world is changing too fast and the old familes can't react well enough. The families that try and fight for traditionalist values are seen as backwards and want to stop progress.

** Post-war seems likely the best time. There would be a huge shift in temperament with pro-muggle heroes guiding Ministry policy. Within a generation I could see much of the magical world being very regulated and the keeping of secrets from other wizards being almost a heresy.

Imagine a world where everyone has the Trace on them their whole lives. Every spell is logged, evaluated, judged. It might kill the wondrous nature of magic in the effort to keep muggles 'unvictimized'. Many magical species might be hunted to near extinction for the safety of muggles, the rare survivors kept in highly-restrictive zoos.

** After the war, there is a clean-up and a lot of the old elite (rightfully) end up in prison. As a reaction to that, there is an attack by some Death Eater remenants which kills Harry and Hermione. Whoever is in charge uses this to crack down hard on the purebloods, gets himself emergency powers and so on.

Basically a Palpatine-like Minister who abuses Harry's and Hermione's deaths to gain more power, claiming that his actions are what they would have wanted, to continue their work and so on. It starts with economic restrictions, then escalates further towards the inmates in Azkaban, who are executed (even if their sentences were supposed to be only for a few years). There is the occasional act of resistance by some pureblood, which only leads to a harsher treatment for them.

By the time you get to next-gen time, the purebloods are forced to wear badges, can't own more than X property, can't marry anyone but other purebloods, are forced to register with the Ministry and so on.

This wouldn't trivialise the atrocities under Voldemort nor make the entire "light side" bad, as they were played masterfully by the new Minister. Maybe the Minister even orchestrates some of these attacks as false flag operations to make the situation seem worse and present himself as the only path out of the crisis.

**** Because Hermione isn't charismatic enough, nor does she has the necessary political experience and connections. Certainly not to orchestrate the escalations.

Also, Hermione does not seem to be the long con type. If you give her the role of avenging leader, you get a purge and are done with it.

** I would basically tweak Out of the Night (by RainingInk). Which already has the presence of Dark Wizards (almost inherently pure-blood), their connection to and use of magic being distinct (the magic is from without rather than within, and has a sacrificial nature). Compared to wizards who use dark magic/curses, these Dark Wizards have been purged for centuries, and any that are caught face an automatic death sentence.

If Harry centric an easy in would be after Sirius dies, he inherits Grimmauld place and as the owner finds himself suddenly the victim of targeted "justice"/harassment by a specific Ministry office or the Ministry in general.

Then you could have him look into things and see the system is corrupt, and the history and facts that he thought he knew are one very biased side of a coin. The Ministry says Harry is a leader of an insurrectionist army, an inheritor and purveyor of Dark Magic, parselmouth. If they say that about him, what about the pure-bloods? What's true, what isn't? And so soon he finds the pure-bloods as a whole are more boogeyman than the root of all of wizarding societies ills.

You could even have Ron's family in on this. Arthur gets shunted aside, because of pure blood and independent thinking. Percy is passed over again and again as less qualified but more fervent and loyal muggleborns get the job, or alternatively he pushes father out of a job as he is more fanatical.

Personally I would nix the magical creature angle and focus on wizards.\\
1) Pure-bloods (as Dark Wizards) hide their natures, but some few extremists fight to upend system. 2) The Ministry propagandizes and most wizards believe, but most won't fight and die for their cause. 3)Dumbledore/Order is only there to stop Voldemort led extremists. And 4) Harry is trying to break the back of the Ministry's power, but simultaneously defeat Voldemort. Finding allies wherever he can and working with other factions in turns by necessity.

** after world war ii and grindelwald's war, a few things happen. firstly, the muggle population increases rapidly as the economy booms, increasing the number of muggle-born and half-blood magicals. secondly, dumbledore uses his power as chief warlock and supreme mugwump to implement highly progressive policies which make magical creatures and muggle-borns basically equal to pureblood wizards in the eyes of the law. with this comes the inevitable backlash against wizarding tradition, something which the purebloods definitely don't want. perhaps dumbledore bans old magical rites/rituals or something similar, maybe the power in magical britain is shifted away from the old families, but whatever it is it angers the purebloods, who don't actually hate muggle-borns (in this world), but just want to be able to keep practicing their traditions.

bang. purebloods have an actual ideology that makes sense and isn't founded upon racism and violence.

** Easy, just have the winners go too far post-war in making things "fair" and "equal".

Let's say the Ministry's top positions are usually taken by pure-bloods. So they implement a 50% Muggleborn quota. Except there aren't enough talented Muggleborn around to fill them, so they lower the requirements. Now a pure-blood might need an "O" in DADA to become an Auror, but a Muggleborn would scrape by with an "A".

They make it a hate crime to insult someone's heritage. "Adventures of Mad Muggle" are banned. Pure-bloods become the only group that's safe to mock in media & entertainment.

Representation on Wizgengamot is offered to centaurs, goblins, etc. who gleefully take it, but have no intention to actually follow human laws.

Old rituals & traditions are forbidden under the guise of them being discriminatory, without truly understanding their purpose.
