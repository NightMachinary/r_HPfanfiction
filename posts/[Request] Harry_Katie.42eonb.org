  Harry's attraction to Parvati leads him to take his Yule Ball preparation much more seriously and his night is changed as a result. Includes an awesome Ron, an interesting Parvati and a drunk Katie Bell. Oh, and what's a Yule Ball fic without a little Fleur Delacour?

*** Oh ye gods. That is absolutely awful. The current top review sums it up perfectly: "this is written like some ten year old drop out wrote it."

****** I just up-voted you! Can I get a mention in your next fic?

No... there's just no way to take the micky out of something this bad. I think you just threw up in /my/ mouth a little, this is so revolting.

**** I actually tried reading this and a couple other docs by the same author when I first started with fanfic because it sounded like a decent plot. Couldn't get past the first two or three chapters. It was technically correct, not a ton of spelling or grammar errors. It just wasn't executed well. Poor word choice, sentence structure and the plot would advance randomly, like in five minutes ten things would happen, then a ten minute conversation that is only dialogue no scene changes or descriptions. I might be wrong, it's been awhile, it just seems kind of lazy.

** I asked for this like two months ago and got this super great(but discontinued) sixth year fic. I wanted to comment so I could see if anyone answers you because that's all I got. Though I did look for it on ffn and I found this half decent one about them being on the same professional quidditch team but it wasn't great, and pretty clich√©d so I could try to find that if you want; fair warning I only got through like the first four or five chapters so it might get better might get worse.

**** I don't thinks so. I'm not familiar with that one. The one I'm thinking of has the horcrux in Harry's head be like a grown up tom riddle that saw Harry's life and was influenced by him to be good. It starts after the ministry battle knocks it loose which stops it from being a horcrux and allows it to talk to Harry.
