So basically, Atreus from God of War(I think) turns up in Harry Potter and moves in with the flamels. I don't know if this is just a really in depth dream. And then at one point he sort of mock duels dumbledore. And I think he is good at ice magic. Let me know if this is some random dream or if anyone recognises it.


** No you're not I remember this story as well but not the name
