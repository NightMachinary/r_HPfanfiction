I'm looking for fics with magic heavily influenced by occultism. I'm talking demon deals, floating candles, pentagrams, seances, psychic mediums, portals to hell, rituals, and/or any other stuff you can think of. Students being taught DADA by Cthulhu or Dumbledore secretly being a giant red-skinned, bat-winged, arrow-tailed, pitchfork-carrying demon from hell. Anything crazy like that.


** I don't know about most of that but With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat is a story almost completely focused on ritual blood magic, focused mainly on ritually carving runes into Harry's flesh in dedication to different celestial bodies in return for permanent effects. I really enjoyed it when I read it and am planning on rereading it soon. Not sure if this was exactly what you were looking for but I hope it helps. linkffn(9036071)

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

** Has the concept of Steelwings and made something of it(Complete).\\
A little warning before, the author likes his humor and it's not for everyone .... oh yes and there are the lemons and lemons....did i spoke of the lemons. ;) It also has a sequel, a crossover with ASoIaF previous warnings are still valid here too.\\
One of my favorite fics. :)

*** I had no idea that this had a sequel! Also yes with the amount of lemons in this fic it has to worry about them lemon stealing whores. The fic has a lot of cool ideas though - I like the world building, tolerate the gratuitous lemons, and facepalm at the authors religious views, but in the end enjoyed this stoy
