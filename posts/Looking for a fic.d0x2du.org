:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This one I've read a few years ago and all i remember, is a scene where Harry exits Grimmauld's library and Mrs Weasley and Hermione shout at him that ''he's not allowed to be there and the books are dangerous '' but he replies that as Lord Black and head of house, the books are only dangerous for them.. I think it has Molly/R/Hr/G/AD bashing and think he locks the library too..
