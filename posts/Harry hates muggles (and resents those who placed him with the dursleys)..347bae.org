Honestly, this feels like a more logical response than canon (up there with not bitching about your homework when you get to go to magic school).


** Harry dislikes Muggles in /On the Way to Greatness/, and he isn't exactly chummy with Dumbledore, albeit for different reasons.

#+begin_quote
  "Well, you actually like the Muggle world, don't you?" he said aloud, landing upon that very reason, and immediately wished he hadn't.

  There was an awful look in Hermione's eyes.

  "You have been friends with Purebloods for too long," she said. "Or else Slytherin has that effect on people. You've no right---you of all people---you have no right to condemn the Muggle world! You know what it's like!"

  "And that's why I can condemn it!" Harry said, stung. "I've actually lived there, and maybe it was good for you, but it wasn't any good for me!"

  Hermione looked like he'd just slapped her, and he felt a little shocked at the anger he found rolling within himself. He'd thought his miserable years in the Muggle world all forgotten; he cringed to remember himself in those days, and tried not to. None of it mattered anymore. Long gone was the wide-eyed child who'd expected a benevolent adult to turn up one day and deliver him from suffering; Harry had sorted himself out, and he was doing just fine.

  Here, in the wizarding world.

  Harry closed his eyes and told himself that he didn't actually hate all Muggles. He knew better than that; he knew that, while he hadn't seen any kindness in the Muggle world, perhaps there was some to be found. The entire world could not be as bad as what he had seen. The entire world could not be condemned out of hand like Harry condemned it from his personal experience. The thing was, he couldn't help the way he felt about it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464303/1/Dark-Lord-Potter-Part-1][Dark Lord Potter]] has Harry hating muggles but with a younger tonks along for the ride...

There's another HP/NT (ish?) fic the name of which eludes me at the moment where he's in his fourth year when he flat out murders the Dursleys the instant he realizes the Dumbledore intends to keep him there every summer. IIRC: Harry only gets out of azkaban because... I think his name comes out of the GoF?

And then in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]] Harry reacts violently to the discovery that Dumbledore was responsible for his placement with the Dursleys.

** In /Growing Up Black/ he ends up living with the remainder of the Black family, and hates Dumbledore for placing him with the Dursleys. He also has a bit of disdain for muggles after growing up with the blacks, and his "cousin" Draco, though hes not a standard slytherin muggle hater.

** This is the second thread I'm recommending this fic in today, haha. In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7659033/1/They-Shook-Hands-PostCanon-Revision-Year-One][They Shook Hands]] series, Harry resents muggles and in one of the later books, even works toward helping the ministry snatch muggleborn babies and place them in magical foster homes so they don't have to grow up mistreated like he did. This opinion is most likely due to Harry being in Slytherin and hanging out with his muggle-hating housemates. You know, I like the story as a whole... but Harry is a little hard to like at times.

*** I thought that the story went downhill after the whole being made emperor. Enjoyed the earlier chapters though.

I remember Harry hates muggles in this, but it's been a long time since I read it, and I never did finish it. Non-evil Harry.

** There are very few fics - On the Way to Greatness as mentioned - and a few others that pull it off well without a stupid bashing fic or a harem fic.
