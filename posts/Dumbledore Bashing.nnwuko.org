Looking for anything remotely Dumbledore Bashing


** On Ao3 just use the Dumbledore Bashing tag (or the manipulative Dumbledore tag). It should be fairly easy to find a good enough fic if you sort by Bookmarks, Kudos or even Hits.

** I hate any bashing, but the one story with reasonably well written Dumbledore written as the antagonist of the story is “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving” by Kgfinkel linkao3(27453535), and you get also an awesome Petunia story.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
