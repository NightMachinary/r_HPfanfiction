  Being the Master of Death was a curse, plain and simple. That had been death's intention when he 'gifted' his trinkets to the brothers three.

** Linkao3(future's part by darkseraphina) not really a dark!harry except in the beginning, turns into a romance fairly quickly.

Linkao3(Harriet potter is by setepenre_set) Harriet sorted into slytherin- morally ambiguous but not really dark.

Linkao3(charlotte the great and powerful) dark slytherin charlotte potter, leaves a trail of men behind her.

  There are stories with snakes that bite and say {you knew what I was when you picked me up} but this isn't one of them. This is the kind of story where the abandoned child walks in the jungle beneath the branches full of hissing things and tells them {we be of one blood ye and I}. Harriet Potter is eleven and she chooses. (genderswap/Slytherin Harry au)

  Her whole life has been about gaining power through struggle and sacrifice and manipulation of the only thing she has going for her (Charlotte's a terrible person beneath the pretty face and she knows it). Charlotte wants to be more than the girl from the cupboard and she's not above using others to gain power.

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  When Lucius thought all was lost: his Lord came back; malicious grin on his lips and a look of such ecstatic pleasure in his scarlet eyes Lucius did not know if he should fear for his and his family's lives or rejoice to see his Lord looking so terribly satisfied. The only evidence something monumental had happened was the thin, red scar that resembled vaguely a lightning bolt on Voldemort's vicious grinning mouth.
