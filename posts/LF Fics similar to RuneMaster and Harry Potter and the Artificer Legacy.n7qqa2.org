Like I said in the title I'm looking for fics where Harry takes up and eventually masters subjects like Runes, Enchanting, Warding, Cursebreaking, or Alchemy (and anything similar), I can't really describe it well so I am using the two fics in the title [linkffn(5077573) and linkffn(13435630)] I have already read Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path and Runic Animagi, but the point is that Harry should be good at utilizing magic to do things like making powerful artifacts, and etc.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  Everyone knows the story, the Potters attacked and little Harry left with his relatives. But what happens when the last Potter stumbles upon something left behind? What does someone with no preconceived notions about Magic do when they find out that it's real? Do they follow along just like everyone else? Or do they find their own path? Harry Potter did always like to make things!
