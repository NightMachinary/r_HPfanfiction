Similar to the typical "HP fan gets dropped into the HP universe" fic, but the character is perfectly aware of being in a fic, constantly breaks the fourth wall, estimates on how plot relevant things are going to be based on how detailed they're described, sees a gun on the wall and correctly predicts that it's going to be used later, asks for favs and reviews to keep the creator of his universe in a good mood.


** Then there is me just looking for hp fan THAT IS AWARE OF FANFICTION gets thrown into the hp universe.. there is usually some convuluted crap about how they cant speak about what they know, or they refuse to interact with Harry and co. For some bizzare reason..

Or better yet, a Harry that travels universes/dimensions, ends in one where the hp books and fanfiction is a thing, then reads about it..

Or a Harry that reads fanfiction about his alternates, and gets ideas from them..

Guess i just want a (somewhat canon) Harry to interact with our version of fanfiction i guess..

*** Take a look at [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheInfiniteLoops][The Infinite Loops]]. Not exactly what you asked, and +not at all Harry+ I don't think there's HP Time Loops, but same general idea of someone (loopers) knowing how things go, and different loop variations to spice things up a little bit. I think [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops][MLP loops]] is the biggest of them, +with+ at 2.3 million words and growing, it's pretty good actually.
