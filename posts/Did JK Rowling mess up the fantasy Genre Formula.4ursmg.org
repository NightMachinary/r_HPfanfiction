I recently created a comment stating that it is my belief that JK Rowling messed up the formula for a contemporary fantasy series.

I would like to hear everyones opinions on this. EDIT: I forgot to link the comment I referred to. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4upofx/discussion_why_didnt_the_order_use_the_taboo/d5s9323]]


** Please restate your argument.

And no, I don't think so. Because I don't actually think she was writing a fantasy series, that was just a framing she was using.

*** please read the link applied to the edit. I forgot to link it when originally posting; my apologies for that. I would counter that all authors when published are asked "what genre is your work?" or some question that is essentially the same. When asked that question, Rowling had to have answered fantasy because that is what the book is catagorized under. Therefore she wrote a fantasy series.

Basically I stated that Rowling failed to make characters other than the trio matter, and that falls under making the world matter in the formula. For example. During the sixth book when Dumbledore dies, the readers are sad. Yet what about the countless dead in at the end of the series from the final battle? We dont FEEL like Harry saved the world from Voldemort. Instead we feel as if Harry went back to school. I stated that I would have prefered a mixed perspective in the last book. I wanted to see the story of Neville. I wanted to see Snape's hardships as he watched the children that a part of him hated yet strove to protect. I wanted to SEE Minerva's plight as she worried about her students.. I wanted to feel Ginny's helplessness as her world crumbled around her.

Instead I got 600 pages of Harry running around trying to save a world that I didnt care about. I stuck with the series after the sixth book hoping that the formula would be fixed. It wasnt.

I also stated in that comment that we love JK for her skill in writing the other portions of the formula so beautifully that it defined a generation. I believe that JK failed in using the stereotypical formula for a contemporary fantasy series, and that is the root of most of the complaints we have about the series as a whole, but if she had followed the formula, we wouldnt have harry potter.

**** Tolkien is credited as being on of the pioneers of fantasy (side note: when he wrote [[http://www.rivendellcommunity.org/Formation/Tolkien_On_Fairy_Stories.pdf][this essay]] he doesn't even call the genre fantasy because the term hadn't been established yet, but calls them fairy-stories!), but that doesn't mean we have to follow his example to a T, he did what he felt like doing, and so should all authors. Then we can decide if they were successful, but to do that, I think every reader who wants their opinion respected should understand that not all art has or should have the same objective. A simple blue canvas can seem pointless until you put it in the right setting and then it looks much better than the photo-realistic Napoleon battle painting that it replaced, but the battle painting looks wonderful in an ornate building down town where the blue one would have looked like a construction banner. Tolkien was very interested in world-building and language, Rowling is very interested in symbolism, and George Lucas is interested in a fun adventure. None of them are wrong, they are just different and have different strengths.

If you have issues with JKR's writing, that's totally fine, but I would suggest not saying she fucked up a formula. As far as I've noticed, artist are urged /not/ to follow a formula, so your wording makes it seem like you want to sound like you know what you're talking about. If there is a strict formula, then it's the sort of thing an author ought to understand so they can break it in useful and informed ways if they want to. If you feel Rowling was not successful in her story-telling, I would focus more on explaining why McGonagall's plight with her students is important and what it would have added to the story - how witnessing Ginny's hardships in real time would help you connect to the world in ways that's not possible without her, and in what specific ways you feel Neville's story is lacking.

I have no idea what you're saying here,

#+begin_quote
  Game of Thrones makes the landscape less about the world and more of the characters, then makes it apparent how the world functions around said characters. The inheritance saga, spent close to a whole book exploring the concept of natural balance in relation to characters. A key aspect of the book is Aleigasia. Twilight saga has the vampires battling against their natures to ensure that there is balance (yes the book is bad but whatever). Shoot even Star Wars follows the expanse of the world it builds and makes it matter. Just watch the Star Wars the Clone Wars series on netflix and you will grow to care about characters other than the MC.
#+end_quote

There are more than enough words that I should understand what these examples have that Harry Potter doesn't, but I have no idea what point you're trying to make. The Inheritance Saga explores natural balance through magic, but I would say Harry Potter's main theme is extremely similar - the natural order of life is death, and in this world, magic favors those who accept death over those who fear it. Twilight has vampires battling against their nature, but I would say Dumbledore and Snape's entire characterization is about their inner conflict and guilt and over-coming it to do what is right over what is easy. Star Wars' having hundreds of creators who work on the films, novels, and tv shows separately notwithstanding, is a world built on feeling in much the same way Harry Potter is - two suns! Why not? Giant sand monsters - okay!! (even though Luke could have totally used his jedi powers sooner, but whatever, how else are we going to get this bad-ass scene?)

You can make your arguments, but at least keep in mind that many of us feel attached to minor characters in the same ways you feel attached to Star Wars or Twilight characters. I've always said the minor characters in Harry Potter feel extremely fleshed out without requiring pages upon pages to get the point across. JKR has always struck me as an author that takes less is more to heart. She also writes in a way that allows us to /feel/ the story.

For example - when Rita Skeeter writes about Harry, Hermione, and Krum's love triangle, we are not told or described Harry's opinion on it. Perhaps you would call that a fuck-up, but after reading it the first time I would have sworn up and down that Harry was mortified only for me to go back and find it's just Ron and Hermione talking about how they feel about it, and Harry is silent until later when Snape read it out loud and he goes red. JKR shows us through subtle characterization what sort of person he is and we /know/ how he's reacting, because she successfully uses what we're thinking as readers. I think it's quite cleverly done.

The world building is also something that is written as a feeling - it's how the whimsy is achieved. We do not get the level of detail as Middle Earth, nor do we understand magic in the same scientific way as Eragon or Lyra in His Dark Materials, but there is a poetic logic to JKR's world that gives us both the silly interdepartmental memos fluttering up lifts and de-gnoming as well as understanding why the darkness of Dementors is different than the darkness of Thestrals.

And why flying memos anyway? Why did they only just recently switch from owls? Surely the Ministry is old enough that whatever is being used in Arthur's time has been used for centuries and tested with time! But maybe they tried things before owls, and maybe they tried things before the things they'd tried before owls. The key to JKR's world building is - does it make you chuckle? LOTR was built by a god who was interested in the concept of time and how it changes language and landscapes, Game of Thrones was built by a cruel god, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's God vanished in a puff of logic (so who knows what that guy was thinking), and Harry Potter's world was built by Elizabeth Bennet's father who delights in the ridiculous even at the expense of propriety. If you want to know what the Harry Potter world is like, just remember that JKR named her school Hog Warts.

And the magic that pulls the plot along makes the exact amount of sense as it needs to and no more. Her magic is not scientific, but it's also not faith. Maybe it is closest to the Dust from His Dark Materials, but instead of being powered by self-awareness, it's powered by intention (so maybe similar to Eragon's magic after all?).

Harry Potter seems to not be your thing, but that doesn't mean the author fucked up, it means she wrote something that's not your jam.

***** Harry Potter is my first love... looked upon fondly, but there are issues that at the time, I did not realize existed. For me, I have recently been forced by a terrible professor to write about how an author adhered to the stereotypical fantasy "formula". I realize that such a thing seems... absurd. Yet all painters utilize the standard strokes of a brush to create multiple works of wonder. All people who carve wooden figures utilise a simple kit of chisels files and cutting instruments to form their masterpieces. I was taught that such is true for any genre of fiction. Fantasy follows a set of rules that were outlined in my linked comment.

What I was attempting to state in the part that you have quoted (how do you do that btw?) is that each of those works made things OTHER than the main cast matter in some fashion. Where as every time i reread Harry Potter I cannot help but ask," Why name this character if you will never mention her again?" We even have a work of fanfiction over a character that JK named and then... NEVER mentioned again. (Sally Anne).

However all this being said, I LOVE Harry Potter. It is as much a portion of my childhood as my family and pets. It is the first book I bought on my own, it is the book I would take a flash light to bed so I could read it under the covers when I should be sleeping, it is the story that opened my eyes that not all people are simple, that magic is more than just abrakadabra and that tyrants should be overthrown. If my post ever put the doubt of that in any minds, I deeply and sincerely apologize to both you, and to my past self for not clarifying. This post was not an attempt at degradation of JK Rowlings work. It was intended as a sounding board for my own personal feelings about a story I love and cherish very deeply.

Here's a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ewgt/reddit_markdown_primer_or_how_do_you_do_all_that/c03nik6][great guide]] I was sent recently that blew my mind about formatting - have fun!

I'm sorry that I thought you didn't like Harry Potter - clearly you're on this subreddit. I also didn't mean to make my assumption that you didn't seem like the focal point - in the end, I don't really care if you like it or not, but I also didn't understand what you were saying in the end. I'm still not entirely certain what GoF, Twilight, and Inheritance are doing that Harry Potter isn't.

I think because to me, some of what you're saying Harry Potter isn't doing is something I've considered and /liked/ about Harry Potter, and other things you're saying about it are things I think /are/ there, so it just seems confusing - in the end, I'm not really sure what exactly is lacking. And also, the things you're saying about HP I feel like are in other stories, like His Dark Materials, LOTR, and Star Wars. Especially now that you've mentioned Sally-Ann, I feel I have to mention Boba Fett - who was introduced in the infamous Christmas Special and then made into a character in the films who does nothing and people loved him despite him basically doing nothing, and his background grew from that instead of the other way around. And even then I feel like we could come up with a hundred Star Wars charactrs that are as relevant as Sally-Ann - how does a story feel realistic and fleshed out /without/ minor characters who only serve one small purpose? Again - why I'm confused, I think every good world-building story does this, because there's just no way hundreds of people can be fully fleshed out. I hate linking old links to "prove a point" (it always seems so lazy to me), but in this case, I think it's relevant, but I was a mod for [[/r/hprankdown]] and we spent months analyzing minor and major characters for their literary merit (with varying definitions of what literary merit meant, haha!), and some extremely minor characters served very useful purposes that didn't /need/ to be expanded on, while other more major characters' background's felt unnecessary.

But on another hand, even though I think you're examples need some work, I think your main points, if properly fleshed out, are very interesting and probably true, but I still don't think all your points are a bad thing about the books. Firstly, condemning someone for breaking a formula is never going to be an argument I trust because my first instinct is to think "good!", but I do definitely want to understand what you think is lacking and why it's important to you, because that is a discussion I would trust and I think then we could have a really interesting conversation about the books - especially now I know you love the books as much as I do!

I would love to keep going, but I gotta head out - feel free to respond so we can keep chatting if you want! I seriously would love to, and if you're paper isn't done yet, maybe our conversation will help fuel discussion points for it!

** While I don't know anything about the "Genre Formula" I read your comment and I do agree that Rowling didn't really make me care about many characters, or make me think the Wizarding World is worth fighting for. Voldemort was worth fighting against, but I didn't really care about the world, or anyone besides Harry, Ron and Hermione, and maybe some others like Neville and Luna.

I think the switching POVs wouldn't really work if it was done for the first time in the 7th book, I think it would have been jarring after 6 books of just Harry. She'd have had to start with it in the second book for it to work, so I don't agree with that, as cool as the idea sounds.

** No, she did not. It was not perfect, but the story was meant to show something and that it did. There is no magical “fantasy genre formula”, you write what you want to write and either it works or it doesn't.

  However Rowling created a world as diverse and as amazing as Middle Earth
#+end_quote

Simply not true. Rowlings world is paperthin and whenever she adds something to Pottermore, I can never shake the feeling she just pulled that out of her arse because of her contracts. To compare that to Middle Earth, or the inheritance saga... feels wrong.

Harry Potter didn't mess up the formula because it never used the formula to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  It is the formula for the contemporary fantasy novel. There are few rules in the formula : Antagonist that threatens the entirety of the world Protagonist lives in. Protagonist must have allies. Allies must be fleshed out characters to matter.
#+end_quote

That is the rule for every story ever, not just contemporary fantasy.

#+begin_quote
  "Make the world matter by exploring its nuances."
#+end_quote

That also counts for Thrillers, Romances, Sci-Fi, any story really. If you cannot bring your readers to care, you won't get them to keep reading. How you get them to care is your thing. Rowling decided that she wants to do it from Harry's perspective only.

Frankly, I don't even know where to start and end to point out how freakin wrong your statement in that thread was. I'm not sure if this is your own theory, or if you picked this up from somewhere, but fact of the matter is, its bullshit. There are very little rules to writing. There are a lot of guidelines, but actual rules are very few and in between.

</rant>

Anyway... I could write you a thesis about this, but I'm not gonna start. I can only recommend you to research this more and find out why Rowling didn'T mess up "the formula".
