Yeah, so, getting really sick of being recc'd to Prince of the Dark Kingdom and Columbrina/ShayaLonnie all the time. I'd love some fics really exploring Covens and Holiday traditions (especially Scottish? Hogwarts is literally in Scotland and I never see anything Druid related?)

Maybe some wandless magic where it's not treated as this ultimate expression of magical competency (I believe Pottermore has multiple school listed where wandless magic is the norm). Blood magic maybe (preferably not made to be a dark thing in fic).

Essentially I guess I'm looking for fics that all have what we would consider dark elements without it being totally obvious to the reader that the author grew up Christian and thinks these elements necessitate a dark and bloody story.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), has a very interesting take on the occult.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), wizards soured on Christianity and returned to their pagan roots.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

**** Thanks for the shout out! RisingSunsets if you enjoyed HG Demonologist you might also enjoy my long series "Perfectly Normal" linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]) which has a strong theme of pagan festivals, but only builds up momentum with this slowly (so it's only vaguely alluded to in the first fic, a little in the second, and is strongly present in the third and fourth fics as Harry gets slowly drawn into pagan traditions. The fifth part will start being posted in late July - I'm currently editing it.\\
I would also recommend:\\
"House Proud" (short but great) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703]])\\
"Harry Potter and the Kindling of the Fire" (series) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/97016]])\\
"Again and Again" (Tomarry, politics & religion) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/439865]])\\
"Dark Phoenix" (more religious elements late in fic) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1881821/1/Dark-Phoenix]])\\
I also recommend "Out of the Night" by Raining Ink, but you'll have to Google for a copy as it's not hosted on major archives any longer.

** I'm writing such a story. linkffn(The Coven of Albion). In fact, Harry in my story concludes that Christianity is silly because prayers never work for him. I haven't yet explored UK pagan traditions (other than a made up coven ritual they performed on the Winter Solstice in my newest chapter), but it'll come along; I'm trying to introduce it organically I guess. Wandless magic is explored a bit so far, mostly by Harry trying to figure it out so he can run away. In canon JKR says wandless magic is an expression of high skill at magic. Yes Uagadou prefers students to learn it but that's a traditional thing. But I don't treat it as this thing only Harry gets so he can be OP, that's just stupid.

Ignore the bot, I updated the story several days ago. The bot is slow to catch updates, it's annoying. >:|

** Covens are bullshit theory though. Actual occult (of course we have to remember that bot "occultism" and "esotericism" are retroactive terms assigned to variety of preexisting currents) was tightly connected to Christianity in its development.

Celtic paganism has barely anything to do with esotericism. Wicca is actually a throughoutly moddern magic system rooted in Golden Dawn only dressed in neopagan clothing.

Actually the most occult fic I've read is linkffn(Victoria Potter) as it uses ancient Greek cosmology as the base of its magical theory.

Western esotericism is rooted in Neoplatonism that arose among Greeks in the third century when Christianity was still relatively young, in Hermeticism that shaped itself in Alexandria at similar time, in grimoire tradition that started in earlier antiquity, in Christianised Kabbalah adapted from Jewish thought, in astral magic imported from Arabs.

And I think the Black Princess-Stories by Silently Watches feature lots of Voodoo practices. linkffn(Princess of the Blacks).

In the Bitter Hug of Mortality linkffn(10502653), Harry is unable to use the regular magicks, instead he is some sort of necromancer that uses rituals and communes with the spirits on a regular basis.

Those are the only stories I can think of right away.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
