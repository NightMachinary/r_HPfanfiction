Dean has the biggest magical core, followed by Ron, Neville, Seamus and Harry. Now Harry feels really inadequate about confronting Voldemort with such a tiny magical core. When explaining to Dumbledore that he doesn't feel up to the task of challenging Voldemort to a duel, Dumbledore comforts Harry and tells him "It doesn't matter how big your magical core is. It matters what you do with it."

** "It doesn't matter how big your magical core is, Harry. It matters what you do with it," Dumbledore said, "You might think that, for instance, Grindelwald's magical core was big. It would be a lie. I have first knowledge on the matter and, rest assured, Gellert's magical core was rather average, leaning on the smaller side."

"Is that true, professor?"

"It is, though, what he could do with the size of his magical core, is another topic altogether," Dumbledore said, his blue eyes twinkling with excitement. "Gellert had firm control of his magical core as he went to perform his most monumental of magics. He was relentless. Ever-enduring. Steady. He knew when to twist, flick and turn. And when to press his magic onto you harder. Ever thoughtful of what his opponent was craving, Gellert was."

*** Harry frowned. For some reason, he had the strangest feeling that the term "magical core" was some kind of metaphor and this conversation with his headmaster was not about his abilities as a wizard but something else entirely.

"Gellert was also a very /hard/ opponent, my boy. Always raring to go, he was. And as I have told you, the size of his magical core was average, at best, but his mastery over it was most impressive. I do not exaggerate when I say that he could do things with it that other wizards could only dream of..." Dumbledore said in a wistful tone, raising his head and seemingly getting lost in memories.

"I... see..." Harry answered in a dubious voice as the strange feeling he had increased tremendously.

**** "He flicked his wand at me as no other. At one moment he was playing the low game, battling with quick and rhythmic moves. Then, he would do the unexpected, turn on me, and try to spill all of his magic core on my face. He was tricky as well. Deceitful. Dirty. Played a little with getting you off guard" Dumbledore said, grinning, "Intense. Unavoidable when he came at you from behind."

****** "As with all things, Harry, knowledge comes with experience. If you will excuse my boasting, I must say that while there was a lot that Gellert could give, it was nothing that I couldn't take, though I will confess that it was not easy to take it all," He admitted.

"Really?"

"Yes, It was very-" Here, Dumbledore paused, seeming to think about a suitable turn of phrase. "Very hard. You see, what made Gellert such a terrible foe, despite the size of his magical core, was his stamina. There lied the secret of his strength. He was steady and knew perfectly well the way to use what he had. After all, it is common knowledge that having a big magical core will not help you if you overexert yourself and blow it all in one go," Dumbledore advised him, his blue eyes twinkling.

"Nowadays, hot-headed youngsters think that duels are all about big, flashy spells and that you can end it with a few strong thrusts of your wand, but this strategy falls flat when you have exhausted yourself and your opponent is still standing. What matters is finesse, my boy. Finesse and endurance. You must make it last."

I can just imagine James and Sirius boasting about their core sizes and getting told off by Minerva. Pffft imagine Draco fumming because Hermirone has twice the size core of his- 'impossible!'
