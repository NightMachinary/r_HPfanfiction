#+begin_quote
  At this very moment, Hermione Granger is a tiny muggleborn child who's tried half a dozen spells. No one is scared of her. No one knows to expect her."We're really doing this," Pansy eventually says, breaking the silence. "We must be insane.""We're saving the country." Hermione tears her gaze from the sunrise across the treetops of the Forbidden Forest to find that Pansy is already looking her way, something resolute in her gaze. It's too solemn of an expression for a child, but Hermione's probably isn't better.

  Hermione has a pregnant adopted sister, parents who don't believe she's bisexual, and a crush the size of the Great Lake on Pansy Parkinson. Taking Pansy up on her offer to be Hermione's fake date to her parents' Christmas dinner could solve at least one of those problems...but it could also make everything worse.

** I'm a big fan of linkao3(luna lovegood and the forgotten circle) - it's not primarily romance focused, but it's an AU where Luna's mother founds an all girls magical school and has some Luna/Ginny and updates regularly

#+begin_quote
  Luna Lovegood grows up a Seer, the child of prophecy, and best friends with Ginny Weasley. After Ginny is possessed by the Dark Lord during her first year at Hogwarts, Luna founds a magical school for girls to explore the ancient art of women's blood magic, defensive magic, and rhetorical diplomacy. She fights the rising tide of darkness with this new brand of old magic, putting her at odds with the Ministry, Hogwarts, and Harry Potter. Luna must choose between traditions when a darker power rises to threaten her brave new world.

  If blindness wasn't enough for Ariadne Granger to deal with upon attending Hogwarts, being the transgender Girl Who Lived didn't help matters.Blind trans girl Harry Potter fic to spite JK Rowling's TERF ass. Starts before Ariadne has even figured out she's a girl and before she is rescued from the Dursleys.Since this fic is gonna be quite long, I'm adding a key here. Note, some things might lack context if you skip.Chapters 1-6: Pre-Philosopher's Stone.Chapters 7-33: Philosopher's Stone. Minimal plot divergence.Chapters 34-75: Chamber of Secrets. Moderate plot divergence.Chapters 76-109: Prisoner of Azkaban. Major plot divergence.Chapters 110-Current: Goblet of Fire. Major plot divergence.
