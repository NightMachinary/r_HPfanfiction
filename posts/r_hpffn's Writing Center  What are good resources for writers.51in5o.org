** [[/u/ILoveToph4Eva]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/51kiqw/all_purpose_writing_resource/][just linked]] to a [[https://curiosityquills.com/limyaael/][massive series of rants]] about fanfiction that seems worthy of inclusion. I'm only a few pages in, but it looks like an excellent resource for writers on what to do (and more importantly what /not/ to do).

** Parts of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][The Abridged guide to Intelligent Characters]] are worth including, or maybe even the whole thing. While I know that as an author, Less Wrong is an *ahem* /divisive/ figure, this advice is really good and a lot of it applies to every type of story.
