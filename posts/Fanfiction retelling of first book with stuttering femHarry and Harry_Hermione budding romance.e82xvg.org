:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
A few years ago, I read a fic that wasnt particulary great, but I want to know how it ended and can't seem to find it!

I remember that Fem!Harry was abused (probably badly remembering my old obsession with severe hurt/comfort) and had a stutter. She befriends Hermione and develops a huge crush; regarding Hermione as her 'knight in shining armor' about twice a chapter.

I wish I could remember more, but I can't. I hope someone can find what I'm looking for, as it's been years and I cannot find it.


** Okey, hear me out, I THINK I have read the fic you mentioned (if it is in ffn), but I can't find it, BUT I think I know the place where to find it. There is an author that has written many fem!Harry fics, Philosophize, and it has a series starting with Yull Ball Panic. In nearly every chapter of that series, the author makes a recommendation of various fem!Harry and is there where I have read nearly all the fics with fem!Harry that I have been able to find in ffn. I will start to check out, but in case I miss it, you know now where to try and find
