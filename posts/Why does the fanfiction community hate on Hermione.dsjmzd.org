** The fanfiction community does NOT hate Hermione.

Even on this sub where there are more people who dislike her, our surveys over the years show that her fans outnumber haters by something like 10 to 1.

Out there in the general fanfiction world, she's more popular although they tend to ship her with Draco and Snape.

Within the general HP fandom, which is far greater than the fanfiction community, her popularity gets another upgrade.

Of course, there are some very vocal people on this sub who do not like her, and perhaps they give you an impression that this character has lots of haters.

*** It's classic response and non-response bias.

Whenever I reread the books, I always get the feeling the female characters have less development. Hermione gets less character development than Ron or Harry. McGonagall is a noncharacter, Bellatrix is alright (in terms of character development), Mrs. Weasley might have had the most development in the books.

** First, I want to address the general question. The fanfiction community does NOT hate Hermione, as a rule. In fact, she is arguably more beloved by fanfiction authors/readers than any other female character in HP since she is the female SI character for most writers. Hell, she was the SI for Rowling herself in canon, along with Harry and Dumbledore at different points depending on your perspective. A cursory search through [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] will inevitably show that the fandom, like Harry for instance, tends to overglorify her relative everyone else.

Second, getting more directly to your comment I think, is why does this /subreddit/ hate-on Hermione. In general it also does not, but it is /less/ biased in favor of her compared to the average readership and authorial community reading HP fanfiction. I can come up with a variety of reasons why this occurs and/or appears more prominent here:

- Hermione is like Harry often made ridiculously overtalented such that its not enjoyable to read and wreaks a lot of people's enjoyment.
- Hermione's character is often poorly translated into fanfics (like Harry or even worse Ron as well), and the characteristics authors focus on are often Hermione's most annoying or alarming behaviors in canon.
- The Harry/Hermione pairing may overall have more fics than any other pairing, though I admit I haven't thoroughly checked that. Oversaturation often makes people exhausted with something or even dislike it (basically what happened to Western or Space fiction in the last seventy years).
- Hermione in canon often comes across as rather self-righteous or smug, but never really seems to grow out of those traits. She never goes through the sort of emotional or mental arc that many other characters, for example Harry, Ron, Draco, or Neville, discovering the error in her ways or colossally screwing something up. She doesn't mature as a character in an appreciable way, even compared to more background characters. The best change Hermione experiences in canon, and one that is too often the /opposite interpretation/ of what occurs in fanfics, is realizing rules and authority aren't infallible.

To be honest though, I think most of it comes down to the oversaturation with Hermione/X pairings I mentioned. But again, none of this comes down people disliking Hermione per se (I certainly don't), but perhaps the trends endemic in Hermione focused stories.

** This question made me realize something: I actually like Hermione a lot more than I thought.

The versions of Hermione I don't like are outside of the books - in the movies, in certain fanfiction, etc. I never really had a problem with her before I was exposed to these.

What makes Hermione's movie portrayal (I'll talk about the movies here, since I don't have a specific fanfic to cite off hand) especially annoying is that she can really be a mess of a person in the books (even with JKR's favoritism) and in the movies, there's barely a hint of that.

In the books, she can be bumbling, scared, irrational but also quick on her feet and resourceful. I can read Hermione and be annoyed and impressed by her. I can dislike her on certain parts and sympathize in others. She's just a girl with major issues as well as good qualities and I can connect with her at one time or another.

Then you see her turned into this photoshopped glorified version of herself and it's like “man, I really don't like this character.”

This might seem like a strange example to illustrate my point but here it is:

There's one bit in PoA I really hated regarding Hermione. She, Harry and Ron are hiding behind the pumpkins outside Hagrid's hut. And the future version of Hermione and Harry are hiding in the forest behind them. Hermione goes “Does my hair really look like that from the back?” and steps on a twig or something. Hermione would never do that! She would never jeopardize something so important over how her hair looked.

What I'm getting at with this is, these portrayals take away the socially awkward, kind of a weirdo with priorities different than her peers part of her.

Those are the parts that made her sympathetic to me- that she doesn't care about things like hair, clothes and popularity (I couldn't personally relate to this as a teen who was all too consumed with magazines and hair straighteners but I did understand having different interests than the majority of your peers). The way she was not good with people, way too into her grades, and sometimes a real bitch. I can't say I liked her always, but I did understand her- especially in the context of her being a teenage girl.

When you take away that and all other flaws, she becomes so two dimensional she could be the lead in a Hallmark Christmas movie.

Tl;dr- Was Hermione my favorite character in the books? No. But did I dislike her? Not at all. The glossy, can-do-no wrong versions of Hermione that pop up in fanfiction? Not a fan.

** There's a vocal section of the fanbase that dislikes her, and you'll often see it popup on here.

To an extent it's a reaction to how she's interpreted in a lot of fanfics. As the most prominent female protagonist in the series, there's strong appeal to use her as the main character of a fic. And similar to Harry, that means there's a lot of fantasy fics, or ones where she'll be incredibly powerful. Those types of power fantasies tend to evoke worse reactions, in my experience, when it's a female character (eg - there are far more 'Mary Sue' accusations than superpowered Harrys being called 'Gary Sues' or whatever the male equivalent is).

That gets exacerbated in other 'standard' fanfic approaches - namely, exaggerating canon details. This is how you get Dumbledore getting more and more manipulative, Weasleys getting bashed to further and further extents, Ron becoming more and more of a dumb, lazy glutton, the twins using incredibly lazy 'jokes' - because it's taking elements from the books and exaggerating them, running them into the ground. For Hermione in canon, she's the smartest character of Harry's age (and, it seems, of the years around them). That means that if we're exaggerating her character, it'll tend to make her /more/ competent than she already is.

That rubs some people the wrong way, particularly combined with Ron bashing (if someone prefers Ron to Hermione, and there's a lot of comments or views that she's "too good for him", that'll get a pushback), leading to vocal dislike of her (or comments about how she made Ron worse by taking over aspects of his character). Add to that shipping wars/dislike, and Hermione having a number of vocal (and controversial) romantic partners in fanfics, and that's a good recipe for a pushback against her.

*** I like to think this sub is getting better about Indy! Harry though. It also gets tagged a lot more, which is thoughtful. I can see an Indy Harry fic a mile away.

I think making a character more competent is rarely done well, especially when the books are the gold standard for quality.

You tend to have character flaws suppressed, because apparently smart people don't make stupid mistakes. Qualities like arrogance and excessive stubbornness, or the "I know what's best for you." attitude really bothers me.

** Which fanfiction community?

- Harmonians love her (as Harry's arm candy, or less frequently, as his tough but fair mistress).
- Dramionists and Tomionists love her (or, rather, the image of the flighty bookish ingenue whom they name "Hermione", who gets seduced by the sexy rich badboy).
- Snamionists love her (as an object of forbidden student-teacher romance, though they do tend to portray her as mature and powerful, unlike Dramionists).
- etc.

On the other hand,

- Smart!Independent!Powerful!Harry mavens resent her for being smarter, more level-headed, more ruthless, more independent, and better at almost all magic than the male lead. In other words, they want Harry to be more like Hermione, but without the flaws.

There are the misogynists, who simply can't stand a smart female character who doesn't follow a man's lead.

**** You forgot the biggest group: Shippers. I feel like half of the canon compliant crowd is like "Hermione, well ship her with Ron" and the other half is like "purge the rival! Blood for Harry. Hinny OTP!"

It's basically the same as the Ginny hate from the Harmony crowd. Hermione and Ginny were the only realistic partners from the books, so the shippers will defends their ship by making absolutely sure to depict the other as a horrible monster. A lot of the slut Ginny trope comes from there. And the traitor-for-books Hermione.

** In part it's because there's a portion of the fanbase that doesn't particularly like Hermione for various reasons and quite a few of those come into fanfic.

More importantly it's because /many/ fanfic authors have a tendency to take Hermione and turn her into a flawless all knowing superbadass who can do no wrong. She's always right, she knows all the answers, is the best at magic, and the 'brightest witch of the age', and so fucking perfect she's boring and one dimensional. I cannot count how many fics I've read that Hermione is warped into a Mary-Sue and everything she did in the series was white washed and justified.

The hate is fanfic in in large part a backlash against shitty writing and characterization. It can actually be hard at times to find a fic that does Hermione justice and doesn't make her a saint. Especially in the Harmony section of the fandom.

I say this as someone who adores Hermione, and is a fairly strong Harmony shipper herself.

I'm very much in that boat when it comes to her ruthlessness. I remember a "how to fix Hermione" thread a while back and most responses were along the lines of "have her learn humility", "make her less commanding" and "show her that (social) mistakes have consequences" and I am sitting there wishing that there would be more fanfics where she becomes the one you call for a dirty job.
