Refilling charms exist. But, what are it's limitations?

Why didn't Harry use it to refill his Felix Felicis?

For that matter, why didn't they use Refilling and Replicating charms in DH for their shortage of food?


** I would think that potions can't be refilled/replicated like that. In fact, most items with magical qualities probably can't be replicated, otherwise there would be no economy at all.

As for why they didn't just buy canned food and replicate it, that's probably plot-induced stupidity.

** Well that's interesting because what exactly does a filling charm do? If you can't conjure nor transfigure food why does this charm even work in the books? If it works could you duplicate food? Isn't duplication some sort of conjuration?

In my opinion this charm is a nonsense. The best it should be is to temporarily make a fake copy of what was there before as a conjuration before vanishing after a time.

In reality even conjuration is strange. Can you conjure without a time limit or does it depend of the wizard strength? Maybe there is some kind of dimension where a reserve of energy and matter exist and you can conjure things using matter from there and vanishing put it back there?

The way I see it, transfiguration could be hold a long time if using lot of power or maybe using runes or ritual to make it using ambient magic or I don't know what. Conjuration would be even harder if not impossible to sustain without limit. The reason why I think you can't conjure or transfigure food is because it would ultimately disappear or revert to its original form which would be a problem. As for Aguamenti I see it as either a summoning of water somewhere or better, a humidity compressor which makes water, maybe duplicate it if needing a lot of it but maybe a bunch would disappear over time.

In the end the problem with magic is the limitation and logic behind it and the system its author created. JKR didn't seem to think this really thoroughly. Following this idea I usually prefer fanon magical system or in other books, the Inheritance Cycle magical system. As for transmutation, FMA makes sense.

**** But what is duplication? Getting more of what exist already yes but if you have one apple you have the physical material for one apple. So You duplicate it to two apples. Where does this second apple comes from? You gain more matter from where, from what? This has to come from somewhere. I think duplication is a form of conjuration which takes a model as patron and makes it easier to make complex objects or reduce the thought process needed but in the end duplication still is creating matter.

So from what? Will it be everlasting? Does it revert or disappear after a time? This only spell goes against what we know about conjuration and transfiguration.

Magic.

No it doesn't. Transfiguration in and of itself is creating matter out of nothing, regardless of if it's food or not.

I look at it like creating an adult out of a baby. You can't create an adult out of nothing, but give it enough time and the baby will become an adult. In this case, replace /time/ with /magic./

In this case, inanimate objects pretty much count as nothing. You wouldn't be able to create an adult out of a rock, just as you wouldn't be able to create food out of a rock.

******** Indeed you can't. So how do you duplicate food because as you said you can't create it from nothing. A wine is food. Liquid yes but it's (most likely) processed aged grape juice.

I don't argue to be annoying and all (even if I'm probably am) but with the lack of proper rules and some that are cannon (can't transfigure/conjure food... or maybe you can but it won't be actual useful food) the duplication, refilling in this case, of food shouldn't work except if you invoke from somewhere else.

In this case if you invoke something do you need to know from where? Because if not it might not work or worse you might randomly steal someone without knowing. Does Harry knows where to take this wine from?

Ugh JKR magical system is just so headaches inducting.

I'm not quite sure what you mean. You duplicate food if you have food in the first place.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

From itself. It's like cells duplicating. A cell won't be created out of nothing, but it can be from another cell. It's the same in this case. You can turn an apple into two apples, but you can't turn a rock into an apple. But rather than energy/nutritions fueling the duplication of these cells/apples, it's magic.

*** In Prince of Slytherin fic, conjuration is equated to teleportation. If you know the location of one object, you can conjure it to you. It differs from summoning in the sense that instead of physically moving across, it is instantly replaced with air. Somewhat like an advanced switching spell, I guess.

**** Yup. The potions the gang drinks to get to the Philosopher's Stone are mentioned to be in "auto-refilling flasks." However, it's explicitly stated that these flasks just summon more potion from somewhere else.

It was a nice touch I thought to explaining how Quirrel can get to the stone, but then Harry also needs to drink the same potion later.

Where in the book? I'm fairly positive this isn't ever mentioned.

****** I don't remember it ever being mentioned, too. Though, given the number of fanfictions one reads these days, it's much easier to get confused with canon and fanon.\\
But the idea of refilling flasks is a cool one.

**** So you end up stealing someone somewhere? Or if you don't know the location of an object you want to conjure you can't?

[EDIT]: I began PoS a while ago and stopped so I don't know or remember what they said about it. I'll have to catch up anyway

** "Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration" --Hermione Granger, DH

Logically, money should be another Principal Exception, otherwise everyone would be super rich/magical economy wouldn't even matter. Remember the coins from the World Cup? I'd guess duplicating food works something like that, the copy food would just disappear after a while, not giving you the nutrients you need.

The Refilling Charm, in my understanding, works more like a Summoning Charm, so more of the liquid would already have to exist somewhere and would only be transferred into the cup or whatever. Otherewise, who would ever even need to pay for Butterbeer, if you could just buy one and share it with 1000 people?

Magic, just like characters, should not be OP, even if it sometimes feel like it is.

(I remember a discussion about whether you could eat a cake, then summon it from your stomach and eat it again, since you can't actually magically create the cake XD)

*** I agree with a lot of what you said. But when Harry uses the Refilling charm in HBP in Hagrid's hut, how does he refill the bottle? It's Slughorn's and I'm pretty sure he has no idea where he could find more.
