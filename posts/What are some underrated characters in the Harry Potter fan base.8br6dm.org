*** So annoying because Fleur is that trope turned upside down. Sure we meet her and she's drop dead gorgeous and has the veela allure. But then we get to know her and find out that she's smart, strong, and is willing to stand up to Molly when Molly is being an obnoxious bitch. (Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Molly, but good God does she have the potential to be the MIL from Hell).

**** We also can't ignore that she was named champion for her whole school. You'd have to be a very powerful/capable magic user to get chosen. I feel like the movies actually did her a disservice in characterizing Beauxbatons as a girls school, leaving a subtle implication that's the only way a girl could be chosen as a champion. Really, the movies cut out most of her amazing characterization.

** Andromeda Tonks - she defied her family and was disowned, married a muggleborn and their only child was a metamorphmagus (seems too coincidental given that she was disowned by Walburga); in the second rise of Voldemort, her daughter marries a werewolf and gets pregnant in the middle of the war (hamstringing the Auror's value to the cause). Later her husband runs off to escape persecution only to be killed, her Auror daughter dies, along with the deadbeat werewolf and the only thing going for her is that her grandson has Harry Potter as a godfather.

There's a lot to work with there, and the woman's only in her forties.

*** Yeah, I think off all the background characters, she is the one with the most potential, at least if you go with a certain interpretation of her family, namely that she was actually the proper daughter while Bella was the rebel who snuck out of Hogwarts to smoke and drink. That she still kept in touch with both her sisters, even after they married Death Eaters because Andi ran and her parents forced the other two marriages. They met in secrecy because despite all the ideological differences, they were sisters first. Bella was slowly broken/conditioned through violence and only became the monster after marrying Lestrange, something Andromeda feels responsible for.

At least that is part of my personal headcanon, which I use in my stories. linkffn(12745758)

*** I've always been curious to see a Romance with Andromeda and Harry based after the war. This woman has lost everything and now has to care for a child on top of that, Harry going and trying to help even though he's only 17/18 and no real idea how to deal with kids or a grieving woman. Of course lines start getting crossed that probably shouldn't be and shit starts getting out of hand.

There's a lot going on at that time with the fallout of the war and Harry's place in society, him trying to reconcile with Ginny while spending so much time with Andromeda and Teddy, Ron and Hermione drifting from him to pay attention to their own budding relationship, Harry trying to figure out how and what he now wants to do with his life, and everyone trying to grieve and move on. The drama, drunken mistakes, conflicted and shifting feelings are all lined up.

With all the fics out there based on the aftermath of the war and including a lot of what I've mentioned, it seems strange that I've never seen a fic where a romance between Andromea and Harry is ever touched on.

They end up having more of a friend as opposed to a lovers dynamic, but she jokes that if she was younger, she'd have considered it. It does turn into a time travel fic in the weirdest way I've seen so far (Fawkes just kidnaps them to Harry's fifth year), then it becomes a Harry/Tonks fic full of paradoxes and lots of Remus bashing (And eventual Dumbledore bashing). I suppose if you read the first chapter and ignore the rest it has an interesting premise. There's a few more weird aspects, like Harry and Andromeda become anamangi but it's a fun romp

I get really caught up on how much he loved Tom Riddle, then was responsible for pointing him in direction of Horcruxes, and Voldemort respected(?) him so much that he let the only person who knew about the Horcruxes continue to live, even on the opposing side. And of course Slughorn was at the final battle and saw Voldemort finally die - did he see Voldemort die? Or did he see the charming 16 year old who brought him crystallised pineapple?

You know, a year or two ago I would have agreed with you. But I learned the value of having connections and someone that introduces you is incredible.

It has nothing to do with anyone being malicious, either. Successful people don't have a lot of time and don't want to waste it. By having someone who both sides respect introducing them, the other person instantly becomes more worth listening to - the mutal friend is a sort of spam-filter.

And Slughorn apparently was good with that, and he did genuinly seem to care for potential and merit (see: Hermione, Lily), too.

While the whole system isn't perfect, it's how it works in the real world, and there are definite advantages.

There is that, "no child left behind", etc. - however, there is also promotion of excellence. Both approaches have their advantages.

***** ...none of this changes the fact that he was a shit teacher, and person. not to mention passively bigoted, hence his saying he was surprised lily wasn't a pureblood, and that tom was sure to have wizard blood. no wonder voldemort's cause flourished while he was head. his job was to educate. neglecting students that need help, and just not being a good teacher in general, means he's failing at his job.

i'm not saying he wasn't /useful/. he evidently was. favouring people because of who they know and creating a shitty environment for his students does make him selfish, though. the idea that he cares for the well-being of his students is laughable. he's written as someone who's clearly a hedonist. which dumbledore says

He was expected to fail in order to punish Lucius.

I know you don't like Pottermore, but just read JK's essay on Draco. She clearly says he's not a good person, but she also clearly backs up EVERYTHING I've said here about Draco's motivation.

Or Stannis Baratheon, whose desire to do the right thing led him to his own Poltava. But Draco isn't the bad guy. He isn't the hero turned monster because he tries to save his wife. He isn't the righteous king who goes too far to secure his birthright. He isn't even at Daenerys Targaryen level, who does, by modern standards, the right thing and causes a lot of suffering due to that.

He is just a spoiled brat who avoids the consequences of his actions because at first his father's influence shields him and then later he avoided his righteous punishment because his mother was a decent person. He might have been in a shitty situation in the last two books, but who wasn't?

And we all wanted those things as well. But, at least in my personal experience, I never wanted these things at the expanse of my friends. But when Harry gets shafted by Dumbledore and the Ministry, Ron's first thought is "Well, you could have told me how you entered. Some friend you are". I mean, not only is he delusional to the point where he thinks the Goblet would have chosen him as Champion, but he ignores the shitty situation his friend ended up in. It is not that he is envious of his friend, it is how utterly stupid he reacts when his friend is forced into a bloodsport previously cancelled due to its high death toll.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think that he is a shitty human being, but he is simply not a good friend towards Harry or Hermione and only gets better after he was poisoned. But by that point, there is far too much water under the bridge and I honestly don't like the subtone that you should hang out with toxic people because they can grow up eventually. Hermione should have cut him out after the Yule Ball, if not after the truth about Scrabbers was revealed (and it turns out that Ron has been leading a hate campaign against her for half the year for no good reason at all).

Also, if we're going to insist that pets be “secure” we must also hold Hermione accountable for not keeping an eye on Crookshanks as well.

Here's the thing about pets. They're messy, they're smelly, they sleep all day, a lot of the time they are useless. And yet you love it anyway. Ron complained about Scabbers and loved him anyway.

#+begin_quote
  even riling up the other Gryffindors
#+end_quote

Riling up the other Gryffindors? When did he do that besides telling Lavender that Hermione "didn't think other people's pets mattered much"? Hermione might be the brightest witch of her age, but at this point in the canon, she is dreadful at trying to make people feel better when they're upset. I don't even remember her saying "I'm sorry about your pet, Lavender."

The After-Quidditch party? When Ron shouts "If Scabbers hadn't been eaten, he could have some of these Fudge Flies"? I'll grant that was rude, but as Ron said earlier, Hermione hadn't apologized yet either.

Most of Hermione's isolation that year was self-inflicted via the Time-Turner, and the courses she was taking. It wasn't all Ron at all and to say that it was ignores Hermione's role in all of it.

#+begin_quote
  That was the shitty part, milking the affair for five minutes of attention.
#+end_quote

I must be forgetting this part. Ron ranted to his family--and Fred proves he is even worse at making people feel better than Hermione--but that was it. That's not milking the affair--Ron would milk being "captured" by the Merfolk a year later, but that's a bit different.

I'll grant that it was odd that Ron had a pet rat when nobody else did. But I hesitate to say he wasn't secured. After all, Ron kept Scabbers in his pocket or in his dormitory. Unless you meant keeping Scabbers in a cage, which is actually really unhealthy for rats.

Meanwhile, Crookshanks was allowed to wander all over Gryffindor Common Room--and Hermione brought him up to the boys' dormitory at least once. She didn't keep her pet secured at all.

  It is not that he is envious of his friend, it is how utterly stupid he reacts when his friend is forced into a bloodsport previously cancelled due to its high death toll.
#+end_quote

A "shitty situation" that both of them ignored.

It is canon that the only one who cared about the "death toll" aspect of the Tournament, prior to the Goblet selecting the names, was Hermione. Both Ron and Harry explicitly expressed interest in entering before their fight. For example, Ron thinks that it would be "cool" to enter, and Harry agrees, with images of winning and Cho "showing admiration" in his mind.

Ron isn't aware of any plot targeting Harry (and Harry doesn't even bother to tell Ron of the potential plot brewing against him), he just has Harry's previous comments about the Tournament to go on. Harry expressly states how he would have done it and when Harry's name pops out of the Goblet, unfortunately Ron thinks Harry betrayed him.

#+begin_quote

That's one fight where Ron is to blame and one where Hermione is to blame. And yes, he was entitled to an apology, because no one knew about Scabbers being Wormtail. Hermione being vindicated "in hindsight" doesn't cut it. Ron even says that all she needed to do was act as though she was sorry.

We only directly see him in 3 scenes - snapes worst memory, Voldemorts memory of the potter murders, and in the resurrection stone.

Shapes worst memory is pretty terrible. But everything else we know about him - the way he sacrificed himself for Lily and Harry, the way he defied Voldemort (he was a rich pure blood, he wasn't fighting for himself), the fact that he became an animagus for Remus, he saved snape when Sirius tried to kill him.

But a majority of the fandom just remembers snapes worst memory, but they ignore the fact that snape gave as good as he got from day one on the hogwarts express (and before when he bullied petunia).
