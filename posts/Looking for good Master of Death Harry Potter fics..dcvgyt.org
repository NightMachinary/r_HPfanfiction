I feel like there aren't many out there. Preferably no fem Harry, but if it's a really good fic, I might give it a try.


** Some I would recommend:

--------------

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] - Reborn into Black family as elder sibling to Sirius&Regulus. Decides to protect them.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]] - Harry is weary, gets dragged into stuff by Stark (if I remember correctly)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]] - Ahoka meets Harry after getting kicked out from Jedi Order, follows him. Harry looks down on Dumbledore-esc JediOrder.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] - Death!Harry is summoned by Order of Phoenix, attaches itself to that universes Potter.

--------------

there should be some more cool ones on the list: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-the-Master-of-Death/105520/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/][community/Harry-Potter-the-Master-of-Death]] but too tired to actually go through them all right now.

** So, while linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is a Fem!Harry fic, it's one of very few fics which actually does something significant enough to not be a generic fic where Master of Death is just an excuse for OP!Harry, or a throwaway line that adds nothing to the story at all. It's very unique, and very AU, but one of my absolute favourite fics. Definitely try it if you haven't.

**** I'd argue that the fic laid lots of groundwork for that moment by developing Lilly's emotional attachment to Tom and her uniquely bizarre sense of morality. Lily is just not very good at being a human being. That's part of the irony in the fic, that even Tom Riddle manages to understand humanity better than she does.

From the beginning Lilly doesn't attach any emotional baggage to the parental figures that she doesn't even remember having. Also, her understanding of death at a young age was fairly skewed, considering her own inability to stay dead. The people she cares about most are the ones who consistently demonstrate that they care about her unconditionally in return; a very small group made up of only two people: Tom and Uncle Death.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

Not true. I've read some where being 'master of death' is a curse rather than a power-up. For example:

- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/chapters/32183310][Resurrect the Living]] (59k+ words, frequently updated on Ao3), being the "Master of Death" is more of a /Sixth Sense/ style curse than a power-up.

- In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11235039/1/Turned-Around-in-Time][Turned Arround in Time]] Harry's new title grants him the misfortune of getting pulled through time to any occasion when someone tries to summon Death.

  Harry became the Master of Death but it's not perfect. There's no eternal youth and invulnerability, and the time travel is cool but pointless, because change is impossible in his universe. But there's another universe - it has superheros and mutants and perhaps enough flexibility to change time. This story meshes HP with the entire MCU. Will deviate from canon. Not OOC

** There's the one with the Death of the Endless from Sandman cameo in it that's pretty decent enough, iirc. An EWE fic that's a HP/HG one. It has Harry withdrawing from the world and constantly transient as he was afraid of the hollows falling into the wrong hands. I think the title is Coming Back Late or something.

Of course there's Fair Lady linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11494031/1/Fair-Lady]]). It's a HPxSandman crossover and a HP/Death fic, though the master of Death thing is very much subverted.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020][All Hallow's Eve]] is an avengers crossover that doesn't have much plot but I found it to be enjoyable.

I can't think of any that aren't dimension travel or crossovers off the top of my head but if you look through the Master of Death Harry tag on ao3 or just look up master of death Harry fanfiction I'm sure you'll find some.
