For next-gen multi chapter is preferred,

I've read a couple fics where next gen characters arrive in 1995, spill everything, and their parents arrive a few minutes later to whisk them away and oblivate everyone.

Other than that, it's not common. Especially for the marauders.

Any fics in which the Marauders go forward to like 2017 and interact with Harry/kids would be welcome as well.

** It would be really cool if the Marauders and Lily arrived during Harry's years at Hogwarts.... Only to find him a perfect Slytherin
