** ahh I know what you mean. I have one such a story where Harry gets together with not only Luna but a small group of girls. It is a crossover with Naruto and got an extremely overpowered Harry. But it is a really good fanfic. linkffn(11517217)

  Purebloods have always been obsessed with maintaining their bloodlines. What was this based on? What is the origin of these traditions? Or rather WHO? As always Harry finds himself in the oddest situations. But finding himself face to face with the Progenitor of Magic Itself? That's certainly not what he expected when he got out of bed in the morning.

*** To be fair, the beginning of that story /is/ pretty... bad.

The later chapters are pretty decent, though.

** linkffn(The Merging)

Not a Luna pairing, but on the bullying subject Harry doesn't do anything about it at first because Luna hides it from him and when found out, asks him not to do anything. He eventually finds out the extent of it and flips his shit. The climax of that little subplot is glorious, too.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
