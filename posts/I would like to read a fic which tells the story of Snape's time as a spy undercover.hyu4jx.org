Bring me all your spy tropes: the cool gadgets, the codenames, the femme fatale, the decisive duel, the underground base full of goodies and magitech, doomsday devices, spiffing bespoke suits, and excessively violent deaths.

Basically, I made this whole post to make this pun: Solid Snape


** I'd love good stories of Snape as a spy as well. That said, I'd like to see more serious spy stories. Turning assets, dead drops, encrypted messages, very boring waits as opposed to the James Bond spying which almost never exists.

** RemindMe! 3 days

Surprisingly hard to find stuff covering the nitty gritty of the war days, though I suspect it's because it'd be largely depressing to write for a lot of folks.

** I am currently knee-deep in linkao3(a dealer, not a death eater) which is an AU Lily/Severus in which Snape is a spy from the beginning. It goes into a lot of detail about him building friendships and alliances. There is a fair amount of world building of the death eaters, blood politics and the potion world that is quite unique and interesting.

First attempt trying the bot. Here is the link if it doesn't work [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14046060/chapters/32352954][a dealer, not a death eater]]

** iirc, linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) does an excellent job with this, although it's more canon compliant rather than having all sorts of spiffy spy things.

  Severus Snape is going straight to hell. The people he calls his friends are helping him get there.

** I don't know how to send links but A Difference in The Family: The Snape Chronicles (can be found on fanfiction.net) does something like that. It's a biography of Snape's life from his birth to his death. The themes you are looking for are all in there (except for maybe overly descriptive gruesome deaths) during the chapters covering his time in Voldemort's service/double agent during the Second War. Note that this fic was written quite soon after the end of DH so a lot of the stuff may not be canon compliant with things that JKR published/mentioned after the release of DH.
