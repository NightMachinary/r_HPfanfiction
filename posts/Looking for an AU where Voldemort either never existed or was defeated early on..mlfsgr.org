Basically one where James and Lily survive and Harry grows up with parents. It doesn't necessarily have to be a “happy” fic, because I like a little bit of drama.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]]: Harry falls through the Veil several years later and joins Sirius in a new dimension. They meet a good Tom Riddle and new villains there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4269983/1/Anything-but-Slytherin][Anything but Slytherin]]: 'Good guys' won the first war, but not necessarily to your liking.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]]: James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a trap. They faked their deaths and fled to Germany. Harry never went to Hogwarts and thus has a very different career. However, Voldemort is not defeated and is doing quite well as of 2024.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13618513/1/half-awake-and-almost-there][half awake and almost there]]: No Voldemort Muggle AU and a very nice Harry/Ginny romance. This Harry still has an interesting background, while Ginny has a tragic one. Its author is the one who wrote the popular "The Changeling" series.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]]: No Voldemort AU and a good Bellatrix/Hermione romance. There are still some very nasty bad guys here, some familiar, others new.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13786171/1/Stranded][Stranded]]: Peter is a double agent and they got Voldemort through him. Harry grows up under his loving parents and doesn't like Hermione at all, until they are both trapped in a strange location through a portkey accident.

It's sorta what you're looking for, I think.

#+begin_quote
  A fifteen-year-old Tom Riddle slips through time, pulled by a scarred boy into a seemingly idyllic future. Harry Potter falls with him into a reality untouched by Voldemort's reign. Taken into the Potter household, the two form an unlikely bond -- but between centaur magic, governmental plots, and the darkness at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, this new world is not as it seems.(In which Tom learns to be kind, Harry learns to be cruel, and ancient magic sings to them both from the woods. Meanwhile, a war of metal and secrets brews in the shadows, threatening an end to the fragile peace.)
