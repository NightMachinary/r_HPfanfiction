** No idea, I've always disliked them. I get how more is always better but even from a writing standpoint what happens is you simply get less development over many characters instead of good development over one.

And also from a real life standpoint it just adds too much complexity to a relationship that it becomes a gargantuan task.

Hard pass from me on harem fics, I typically even dislike fics that depict three people in a relationship.

*** While I agree a lot of harem fic authors don't know when to stop, undeveloped or one-dimensional characters without any personality is a common problem for the most fanfiction stories.

Even if it's rare, polyharmony does exist in real western countries and multiple wives are usual in muslim culture.

So it's more about how the story is written than what it contains.

****** It's not me who invented the busted Susan! :-)

I just mentioned it as it is -- a fanon cliche that is quite popular in Harry/Multy fics.

If you are asking about reasoning...

I can speculate that Susan as a character is popular, because she's a niece of the Head of DMLE and therefore a very useful addition to Harry's harem. Authors started to give her big bust, because it's a thought that guys likes big breasts and she should have something distinguishable in her appearance. Hermione has hairs, Daphne is a gorgeous slim model and Susan gets her big bust.

*** I am not seeing it. Of the HP harem fics I've read (which would have been a long time ago, admittedly), I can't recall /one/ that features a dynamic comparable to that of a Harem anime. A defining trait of the harem anime is that the male lead doesn't actually get a harem---long-term consentually concurrent relationships with multiple partners---but rather has a number of suitors after him, competing with each other, often in ways highly unpleasant to the male lead.

I guess a harem fic can be viewed as a fulfilment of the (generally unfulfilled) "promise" of a harem anime.

Only if you're ignoring Hermione, Ginny and Luna's perspective, no? I agree that Harry going along with this is more likely than Harry/Malfoy, but you also have to objectify (or extremely warp their characters... like Hermione as a dominatrix Harem alpha wife) all the women involved.

Admittedly that also holds true for Draco in Harry/Draco (he'd probably have more objections over this pairing than Harry), but at least you're only raping 2 characters instead of a whole harem of girls.

Who says that they are opposed to group sex? Not that it is likely, I'll admit that much, but none of the characters actually says at any point that they don't find women attractive. Is that twisting the characters to some degree? Sure. BUT, unlike Harry/Death Eater, it doesn't go against the fundamental basis of the character. Hermione would still be Hermione if she was into girls, but Harry accepting Death Eater scum as his equal for life goes against pretty much everything he stands for.

There's nothing to suggest that divorce, or gender equality (or lack thereof), is any different in the wizarding world than to the real life UK. There's nothing to suggest there are any really major social differences in fact.

There's nothing to suggest that Narcissa married Lucius as some kind of escape from an abusive upbringing - she didn't defend her sister who married a muggleborn, and chose to marry someone who became one of Voldemort's chief lieutenants.

There's nothing to suggest she was unhappy, or that she was any different from the majority of her relatives, or that there was even the slightest strain in her marriage to a murderous racist.

The only evidence you have that she was some kind of poor victim who hated Voldemort is that she valued her family more than her loyalty to him, and that she abandoned him during the final battle. Incidentally, Lucius, formerly one of Voldemort's most senior lieutenants, did the same. Are you going to argue that he was somehow unwilling? Maybe he never wanted to be a Death Eater, and only joined Voldemort because his evil wife forced him to?!

There's simply no evidence for your theory, and it relies on far too many baseless assumptions.

And Snape was a fullblown death eater who most likely killed and tortured muggles, not just a brat with a giant ego who parrots what his daddy says. Harry also seemed to forgive Dudley or at least not hold too much a grudge against him. Draco also seemingly is not really into exterminating anyone, we clearly see that he's not able to kill people even when they pose a direct threat to his own life.

Harry is ridiculously forgiving of people. And Draco seemed to learn his lesson in the end or at least to question his behaviour without any good influence to prompt it. If he had Harry as an example of the type of person his parents want to see exterminated he might reconsider his views.

I still think it faaaar more likely that they can become friends than that Hermione, Luna, Ginny and Harry will be cool with all sleeping together as a giant group or sharing Harry.

Then, it turns into, "Yeah, she does that to him, he does that other thing to her, totally predictable because of the relative orientations of their bodies and erogenous zones, the other she does that to her and him both, and... yeah, this is sort of repetitive." [Drag the slider forward.] "Still more of the same. This is about as sexy as watching furniture assembly. I think I'll go read a book or something."

I'm not saying they give it up for good, but I suspect the titillation factor diminishes rather quickly. (Or maybe I'm just weird that way and am projecting.)

When it's comedy, I don't mind the objectification. I enjoy nonjon-style "Harry bangs everyone.

** Aside from the obvious fantasy reasoning, polyamory is also a thing. I know I like some fics with more than one partner. I tend not to read erotica though, so I don't know how most of those work. I've read a couple with good 'throuple' relationships though.

** By obsessed you mean like them? Or is this some subculture that just does't exist here but does elsewhere?

I personally enjoy reading them, because it fulfills one of my sexual and romantic fantasies. Seems fairly obvious no?

That doesn't mean I fancy myself some sex god that could satisfy droves of women, but then again, neither do we fancy ourselves wizards who can change the rules of physics with a stick and a few words, do we?

** Male fantasy and objectification. I hate it. It's so disappointing when a story has an interesting premise and devolves into nothing but harem antics. Worst disappointments for me have been Linkffn(Barefoot) and linkffn(Firebird's Son)

*** People keep talking about /Barefoot/ when harem fics come up, and I... huh? All I recall is some mild, now-resolved polyamory with Human!Hedwig and Tonks. Hardly what you'd call a harem. Did my brain suppress the memories of the harem stuff, or what?

**** I stopped reading after the Hedwig/Tonks/Harry stuff had gone on for a while and I thought the fic had taken a bad turn. If it gets better later on, that's good. It was just especially disappointing because I'd never read a similar story (very rare in the HP fandom for me!) and I was really hoping there would be more plot and less wish-fulfillment

Really? That ruined the fic for you? It's the entire premise of their society. The story goes to a lot of weird places, but it's one of the few decent Harem fics, especially because the women involved in the Harem aren't particularly excited about it.

***** Eh I liked it. [I disliked a lot of other stuff in those stories though] He really put the typical harem fantasy on its head, by having everyone involved be really miserable about it. As opposed to other Harem fics you're really not supposed to envy the protag very much.

But Darth Marrs stories are always bitter-sweet with a heavy emphasis on the bitter (and Firebird's Son is particularly dank). So I can see where you're coming from, sorta.
