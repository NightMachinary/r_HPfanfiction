I'm looking for a fic where Harry just raises hell during the whole of fourth year. As in, takes full advantage of the fact the school can't expel or fail him, and turns his participation in the Triwizard Tournament into a farce, humiliating all involved. The crackier, the better.

Edit (12/26): Thanks for all of the recs, guys!


** I seem to recall some crack fic where Harry sent the hogwarts express into a portal, only to open the portal later just in time to launch the express into the dragon. Can't seem to find it tho...

  Harry has been through a lot yet there are some perks to being as gifted as he is. So he's not going to just sit back and let the world shit on him. He's going to best the absolute best. First few chapters are hard to read. Get past those and I promise it gets better. Also, I know the beginning sounds very cliche. It's explained later so try to stick with it. M for bad stuff

** Have you read "Oh God, not again!". Lowkey top 5 in the HP fandom, kind of laid-back, though. So if you're looking for a bit more drama and all that jazz, I'd siggest "The Lie I've Lived", which is in my oponion the best HP fanfic I've ever read.

*** So I have always wondered about this fic because I will be honest, fics that are rated K+ scare me away pretty much instantly. The actual books are rated higher than that (well the later ones anyway), and unfortunately, a K or K+ rating often seems to imply the author handles things with kiddy gloves to avoid offending folks. Even T concerns me at times to be honest depending on when the story takes place.

And yet, the story premise sounds amazing, and I do enjoy good quality crack fics of all types.

So, I guess my question is, is this actually K+ or more mature, and does it read like a K+ or not?... and so on and so forth...

**** Tbh, I too was a bit miffed by ratings; I thought M automatically meant something like Lemons every 2 chapter. But eventually I came around that and just decided to give a chance to any Fic catching my attention. I mean, it's not like reading 1 chapter is enough to get you really invested about a fic. Though if it does, then you obviously will like the rest. I realise I still haven't answered your question explicitly, so yeah just read the first chapter and you'll fdecide if it's to your taste or not. The Lie I've Lived, on the other hand... Let's just say you can't not like it cuz that's impossible. Btw you can eventually add to the search bar some key words like 'Gof' 'Goblet of fire' 'Fourth year' 'Triwizard'. Last time I checked, there are some good ones not even passing 1k favs. Oh yeah, there's Harry The Hufflepuff. Unreal ongoing story

***** Yea I mean there are plenty of M fics that don't have a single bit of sexual content in them, often just some violence.

For me, I just don't like when stories are handled with kiddy gloves in order to appeal to a broader audience, especially when it's not remotely true to the reality of the context of canon. And so K+ fics generally scare me away unless they are intended to only cover early on in Harry's life (pre-school or first few years at most).

I mean, let's be honest, the book series deals with a mixed-sex boarding school, where a good portion of kids are at ages where in real life, kids would be expected to be dealing with sexual situations, and a book series where violence does play a significant role as well due to the nature of magic, and due to the troubles within the Wizarding world and what amounts to a terrorist group being involved.

You can write about the realities of being a teenaged child without taking it too far both in terms of sexual content and violence, and so authors that intentionally skip over such context tend to write stories that are not as immersive. It's the reality, fair or not.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
