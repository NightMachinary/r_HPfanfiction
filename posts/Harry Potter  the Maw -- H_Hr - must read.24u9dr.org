*** I've also seen this one a bunch and skipped it for the same exact reason. I'm running out of H/Hr fics to read, though, so I'm gonna give it a shot.

****** Actually, /do/, in this case. Those were good instincts.

I reviewed it to hopefully aid and succor others who've had the misfortune of reading even the first two chapters of this story. See that for details, if you must.

In short, it isn't good. Just straight forward character torture, almost by the numbers. Right down to the cheesy tone and dreams of Voldemort being "scary" in a vague way. Old school schlock in the worst sense.

Okay writing quality in a most basic sense. Doesn't flow, isn't engaging. Just bad in general.

******* Thanks for the save as it doesn't sound like I'd be interested in this fic at all.

Do you have any good recommendations for H/Hr fics? I don't care about length, completion status, or rating. I'm almost done with my current story and the only thing I could think to do was reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][this]] for the fifth time.

******** Well, I've got some really cheesy ones on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Etimeloopedpowergamer][my fav list on FFN]], but if you want dark done right, try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] by [[/u/wordhammer]]. Arty, strange, and very very different. That M rating also isn't just for show or a few f-bombs, so be warned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] is good but unfinished. Gets a little long at times, but has some good ideas. Less of a horror show than my other suggestion, too. Most unique time travel idea I've ever seen, and well presented.

  Could you explain where the title comes from?

  Hmmm...the Maw in the title of this fanfic is more of a symbolic thing than anything else. A maw in normal terms is something unsatiable that sucks up everything around it. When I came up with this title, it occurred to me that Harry is going to be thrown into one big figurative maw in his sixth year, so that's where the title came from. The necklace and Voldemort's ambition are two such examples of a maw; where it sucks up everything and leaves nothing behind.

  The maw mentioned in the title is rather ambiguous; but it is mainly a reference to Gates' necklace, and, more symbolically, the depth of human ambition, hate, and love.

  Something had changed, but what it was, he did not know.

  Perhaps it was his new knowledge of the monsters of the world, of those demons that never truly die.

  The knowledge that, beyond the iron fist, behind the rows of teeth and fangs, and down its slick throat is the monster's maw. It is the maw which separates the monsters, divides them into categories, makes them cruel in their own different ways, driving them. It makes Voldemort kill and torture the innocent. It made Gates torment Death Eaters.

  [..] Harry could glance at it, fleetingly peek into it, but no more. Not the best Legilimens in the world could. The maw was something off limits to everyone, even to the monster itself. It was too immense, too intricate for it to be quantified or even expressed.

  The unanswerable questions of the maw still and will forever exist: What lies at its bottom? Who knows its depth?

**** Wow thanks for taking the time to post such a detailed answer. From the looks of it the author really put a lot of thought into the title.

** I am reading it now. Like the interaction between H/Hr. But really dislike how Harry reacts to the rest of the world. He is being quite a push over over everything. Why would Dumble ever allow someone like Gates watch over Harry when he is clearly evil??? Dumble may be a lot of things but one thing for sure he is not dumb. He sees through people. Having Harry turn retarded def dont help with the war.

**** I understand the background more as the story progresses. But its just weird that Harry doesnt actively try to do anything that might help him win the war. He knows he has to face Voldy yet he doesnt really train himself that hard besides physical exercises. Its an interesting concept to include a character like Gates but I just couldnt enjoy it.

May be harsh, but still---why should I care about your opinion if you don't care fixing trivial mistakes like this before sharing it?
