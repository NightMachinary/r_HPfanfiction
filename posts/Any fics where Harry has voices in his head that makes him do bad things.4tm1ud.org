  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest of places...even in your own head. For years Harry dreamt of Tom Riddle; but Tom was more than just a dream - he was very much alive, a piece of a soul trapped inside Harry's head. Befriending Tom Riddle was bound to take a toll, but Harry knew that it would all be worth it - because he'd never be alone again.
