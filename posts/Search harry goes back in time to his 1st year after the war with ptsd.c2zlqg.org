:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
EDIT: it's solved! The fanfic is "nightmares of futures past"

Stupidly, I forgot a fanfic toon that I read years ago, but was far from finished. For some reason, I can't find it on Google or the fanfiction site despite remembering that this was a fairly popular back in time fanfic.

Synopsis what I remember : Harry won the war, but at the cost of everyone he knew. Depressed, he finds a way to commit suicide, but merges his memories back in time to his 1st year self. The story then continues with Harry trying to hide this knowledge, while slowly preparing his friends for the upcoming battle throughout the years.

Additional info: the final battle at the beginning of the story was much different from the last novel in the series. I believe this was because it wasn't out yet when this story began. -Harry suffers heavily from ptsd and coming to terms with being able to see all his friends again -dumblefore functions more or less as the second main danger, as he would probably obliviate all of Harry's memories, if he would find out, as this would probably ruin the plans he set up in the original story.


** Are you talking about Nightmares of Future Past? It got removed from fanfiction.net recently on a bad reason.

****** Just an FYI:

The AuthorLord would like to inform you that FanFiction.net deleted Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. He received an email stating that it had been removed because it had copyrighted material that he did not own. There was a note specifying song lyrics. Harry Potter and NOFP doesn't have any copyrighted song lyrics. The only song lyrics are from some original verses that I (runsamok) wrote for the sorting hat to sing, which was used with permission.

Update May 21st: The AuthorLord is appealing the decision with FanFiction.net and it will likely take a few weeks for them to respond.

Update June 13th: There has been no response from FanFiction.net in any way to our appeal. This is alternately disappointing and infuriating.

******** God, I wish more authors would use AO3. It's fan-run and not for profit, so there are no ads and it's all designed to be author-friendly. So much easier to use, it provides much more author protection against harassment and flaming, able to read fics in one long page rather than scroll along chapter by chapter, able to download fics for later reading in multiple formats, ability tk search by tag or exclude certain tags, a real sense of camaraderie and friendship among authors in certain niches... just a much, much nicer website to use than FFN. As an author I haven't used FFN since about 2014, and as a reader I hate FFN and its ads. I donate $5 a month to AO3 just because I love them so much.

********* Is there a trick to using AO3's filter system? No matter what I filter in, and make sure to filter out, I still get stories popping up that are swimming in tags that I don't want to read. Just about everything there seems to have a thousand tags from the MC to a character that was mentioned in canon but not in the story.

******* FFNet can barely keep their website running, do people actually expect them to give a shit about anything? They're obviously idiots who lucked out early. The site is swimming in a sea of ads, so they're obviously doing just enough to keep money coming in.
