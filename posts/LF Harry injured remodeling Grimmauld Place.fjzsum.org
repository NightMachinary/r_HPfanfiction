I remember it was the year after the war and I think Harry was on a break from being an auror but he was remodeling Grimmauld and there was an explosion that landed him in St Mungos. Ginny was his medical proxy/emergency contact but they hadn't gotten back together yet. She had to leave Hogwarts to go to St Mungos because Harry was in acoma and in a weird wizard green gel to help him recover?? That gel thing is probably off, I read this fic years ago and would like to re-read it. I'm pretty sure the fic was pretty lengthy or even finished. It could be on any HP website, I used them all back in the day.
