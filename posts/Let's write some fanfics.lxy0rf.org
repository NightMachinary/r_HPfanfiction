It has been a while since I have seen one of these so let's have some fun here.

Rules are simple.

1. Every thread is one fanfic
2. Respect the outline and story before you. If you break from the thread people have all right to downvote you violently.
3. Not threads of the same person commenting all over again to himself/herself. You can comment more than once in the same thread, but can't answer to yourself
4. If you want to comment about a particular thing and don't want to add to the story you're free to do so. Put there "Comment" or some other marker that it shouldn't count for the story when not obvious.
5. That's it

​

So here is the structure:

1. First comment should be the title
2. Second a genre (If crossover you can add it in here)
3. Third, pairings, if it has any
4. Forth and so on, the story. Only one paragraph per comment.

​

Let's go:

***** Teddy Lupin hadn't had a perfect childhood. (After all, he'd never gotten to know his parents since they'd died in a war shortly after he'd been born.) However, it'd been a pretty good one overall, filled with fun and so many people who loved him, his Gran, Andromeda Tonks, and his godfather, the oh-so-famous Harry Potter, being the most notable. Now though, Teddy felt as though he clearly hadn't appreciated his childhood properly at all, and he was regretting it because of what he was experiencing now as a young man.

****** He thought he had all figured out. He would give his best at Hogwarts and, with hard work, he would prove himself a worthy son of two war heroes. Then, he would naturally become an exceptional auror, as his mother had been and his godfather still was. Hogwarts had been good enough, for sure, but his perfect started to crumble the day he applied to be an auror.
