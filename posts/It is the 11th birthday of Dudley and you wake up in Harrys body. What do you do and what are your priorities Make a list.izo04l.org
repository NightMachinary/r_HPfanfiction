It can be a general list or even year to year. What do you want to change and what do you leave how it is supposed to be? If you are a girl would you still go by Harry or would you become transgender and take your girl name or some other name?

I think I would like to skip the philosopher stone completely. Since only because Harry wanted to protect the stone, it came out of the mirror and gave Voldemort the opportunity to get the stone. So I could just ignore it and he can wait till he becomes black.

Might preemptively capture Tom during Fourth Year and lock him in a box somewhere, until the Horcruxes are dealt with. I'll probably kill Barty too.

** I freak out.

I'm in the body of an 11 year old who many people try to kill on a regular basis for the rest of the decade, who has an immortal psychopath gunning for my/his head. On top of that I have to go to school for seven goddamn years with kids - and those kids will become teens and some of those teen girls would probably have a crush on me/him and I'd freak out more and avoid anything that suggests an interest in romance as I am not a pedophile.

In terms of the Yule Ball though, I'd probably not bother getting a partner just to piss McGonagall off. If worst come worst and I truly need a date for it, I'd ask Daphne Greengrass under condition she not see this as a 'date' or get any romantic ideas about it - to piss Gryffindors and Slytherins off, and Snape.

I wouldn't be doing investment stuff because I doubt it's as simple as people think it is.

I wouldn't be friends with Hermione. My opinion of her in fanfiction and the fact I dont like bossy people means we would not get along.

As for Voldie - well I tell Dumbledore everything and let him handle it. For the horcrux in my/his head, well we will deal with that when necessary.

** Assuming canon is, well, canon, I feel like trusting Dumbledore is a fairly safe /a priori/ assumption to make. Knowing that Mrs. Figg is in the neighborhood on his orders, it should be fairly simple to let her know that something's up, wait for her to tell him, and go from there. At an absolute bare minimum, I can confirm the existence of Voldemort's horcruxes two years ahead of schedule, along with descriptions, locations, and warnings for all of them, and give an executive summary of the next seven years of events. Not for any "preserve the timeline" shit but as basic forewarning and a heads-up that if nothing is done this is what will happen and shit's not exactly coming up roses.

Second priority is getting Sirius exonerated. I'd probably tell him the truth of things as well, if only so I don't have to waste my time trying to deal with him trying to be a parental figure when I'm (mentally) over 30.

Assorted nice-to-haves include getting Pettigrew and Crouch Jr. caught, dealing with the basilisk one way or another, and hopefully being a decent friend to Ron and Hermione assuming we interact in any meaningful way to begin with. Save a bit of friction there, you know?

I'd absolutely attend Hogwards because /magic/, but dating anyone would be creepy AF. That said, I'd still do plenty of independent research on.../ahem/, magical enhancement, because I'd be shocked if that wasn't a thing.

** I'm saying everything to Dumbledore.

Now I hear you. "What ? But Dumbledore is a manipulative senile old fuck, why would you risk your memory eing taken away like that ? He's Obliviate you without a second thought !"

Well, first of all, Dumbledore is not this senile old manipulator you all make him out to be. And if he is, then what would I, a muggle with no knowledge about how to use magic, be able to do against him ? He'd know Legilimancy, and I doubl I'd be able to block him, or Snape.

For that matter, Snape. I get some people think he's a tragic hero. I really do. That said, if I want a good seven year at Hogwarts, I'm getting rid of him. Either legally, or underhanded. And I know where he lives.

For first year, I've said everythinf to Dumbledore. Same for second, third, fourth, and sixth. So, no death gauntlet to trap a Dark Lord, no Chamber of Secrets, no "Pettigrew and the day Black wanted to fucking kill him", no tournament because of no Crouch, and no traitorous Snape. Assuming Dumbledore is not evil, he'd know of the dangers of Horcruxes, and wouldn't drop dead.

But I think I'd ask Dumbledore to let Voldemort roam in the school a bit, so he can kill me. I've got a horcrux I'd like to take care of, you know.

What more, what more ... I'd punch Malfoy so he could never reproduce, it's a given. And also, just to spite Snape - I'd become one of the best potion master of all time. And drop it all off once I'm dubbed better than him.

** Walk out the front door and keep walking until I find the tube station. Walk under the turnstile and hop on a ride to Charring Cross. Go into the Leaky Cauldron and into Diagon behind someone else ala every other fanfiction. Go into Gringotts and up to the counter and say "I would like to hire a cursebreaker".

Horcruxes have TONS of protections and rituals and whatnot just for PROTECTION. Now, did Voldemort do any of those rituals over Harry's scar? Nope. It should be fairly trivial for a cursebreaker (or healer) to remove said soul fragment if it has none of those protections.

After that, send letters to Ted and Andromeda Tonks using the "Hey, I'm Sirius Black's secret baby and mommy just died. HALP!" Because any letter that says "hey, I'm Harry Potter" would instantly get thrown in the trash.

While waiting for them, write down EVERYTHING I can remember about horcruxes and whatnot.

I figure it would take less than a year to catch all of the Horcruxes and pwn them. This would cause Voldemort to poof.

** Hold on. My soul is in Harry's body. My MUGGLE soul. We know magic is tied to souls since Voldemort and all the Horcruxes have magic despite having no body. So I very much doubt that I can do magic.

Now, I am not staying with the Dursleys by any means. So I put sleeping pills in their food and rob them blind. Neither am I going to hang around to be targeted by Death Eaters or pushed into "adventures" by Dumbledore. I have no obligation to save the Wizarding World.

However, I would feel bad if I didn't tell anyone about the Horcruxes and left Sirius in prison. I need a magical adult who has no ties to either Voldemort or Dumbledore, who I can contact through the muggle world, and who has the motivation to carry out my plan. There's only one person who fits the bill: Ted Tonks. I find his address in the phone book and write him a letter explaining everything, claiming to have traveled in time with the cost of losing my magic. I'm afraid that Dumbledore will just Obliviate me, leaving me defenseless, and I can take care of myself.

I break the Dursleys' phone, put everything in Vernon's car, and drive to London. It's tricky doing this in a child's body, not to mention driving on the left side of the road.

It takes me a while to find the Leaky Cauldron. I look for people dressed oddly, but it's 1991, so that's not uncommon. I finally find it by trailing my hand along the side of the buildings as I walk along Charing Cross road. I wait and follow someone through to Diagon Alley, and go to Gringott's. The goblins have me use a blood quill to verify my identity, and issue me a new key. I do have Harry's blood, after all, if not his magic.

I take most of the gold and go on a shopping spree. I get a magical tent with a built-in Disillusionment charm, a case like Newt Scamander's, and all kinds of survival gear. I explore up and down the Alleys buying anything I can use, including books about the things I've always wondered about.

I manage to get Vernon's car into the case just like Newt did with the Erumpent. Then I take the Floo to Hogsmeade and go camping in the countryside nearby. Very comfortable camping in my magical tent. I send owls to Ted from the owl office in Hogsmeade and pick up his replies there. He and Andromeda get the rat, free Sirius, and start on the Horcruxes.

I live frugally and read all kinds of books. I learn to brew Potions and use them to change my appearance and the color of Vernon's car.

When the Horcruxes are all gone, I meet with Sirius and explain the truth. He helps me get a new identity, enchants my car, and we run off to travel the world.

That is of course presuming that whatever caused your soul to inhabit Harry Potter's body merely pushed his soul out, as opposed to absorbing/assimilating/consuming it (possibly along with whatever fraction of Riddle's soul inhabits the curse scar).

** First, panic. Because 1. I'm in a fucking cupboard under the stairs in bloody /Britain/ of all places even though I'm American (would I have an American accent!?), 2. I'm never going to see my family again, and 3. /there's a fucking Dark Lord after me/. Now that that's over, I wouldn't care if I was suddenly a boy. I'm cool being either gender. I would like to actually /be/ Harry instead of /taking place of/ Harry because that would be fucked up.

Second, I would try to convince the snake at the zoo to come with me. Can you imagine the protection he'll bring you until you can learn to use a wand or figure out how to use wandless magic?

Third, totally figure out if I'm actually a Metamorphmagus or not. Well, this'll depend on if magical blocks are a thing and if Dumbledore placed a block on me to stop me from wigging out in front of my Muggle relatives and non-magical neighbours.

Fourth, either go to Diagon Alley myself or wait until Hagrid comes. Well, wait until Hagrid comes so I can get my lard ass of a cousin's /second bedroom/. I'll convince Hagrid that he can stay in the lobby of the bank because he hates the cart rides and I'll see if I have an account manager. If I do, brill. I'll ask him (I'm assuming the manager is a male) if inheritance tests are a thing and if magical core or ability blocks are a thing. If so, I'll inquire on if I can get tested on both things, and if I have a block, I'll pay whatever to have it removed. I'll also see if there is some magical way to get rid of my old shitty glasses because wearing glasses that are the wrong prescription /suuuuuuuuuck/. If not, I'll use my sudden fortune to get myself some new glasses. I'll also check out if I just have the one vault. Ooh, and see if Lordships are a thing because why not? Oh, and check out if my parents had a will. Ah, and inquire if they know how to get rid of Horcruxes (and hope that I'm still a Parselmouth if they can remove the soul leech from my head).

Fifth, go shopping! Can you imagine how fucking brilliant Diagon Alley would be? I'd totally get all the regular school things first with Hagrid and then I'll ditch him. I'll just tell him I'll get back to the Dursleys by myself and then I'll get a room at the Leaky Cauldron. If, for some reason, an eleven-year-old is not able to rent a room even though a thirteen-year-old could, I'll grudgingly make my way back to the Dursleys. (Or, if I can get a handle on my Metamorph abilities that I probably don't have, I'll make myself an adult.) Then, the next day, I'll fucking scavenge every piece of knowledge I can! Can you imagine what types of books could be hidden in second-hand-shops? And little pieces of magic and stuff? Oh, and I'll totally see if witches and wizards celebrate the pagan holidays or if it's seen as "dark magic" that's "illegal." Like, whatever that is.

Sixth, soak up all the knowledge in my school books as I can. Practice my magic because the Ministry won't be able to sense my doing magic around a shit ton of other magic. All of the purebloods and most half-bloods already have a leg up on me so I'll need to catch up. I'll definitely try to understand potions, as well.

Seventh, while I'll want to free Sirius, I /will/ have to try and stick as close to the canon timeline as possible with the exception of probably going to Slytherin because that's what I keep getting on my sorting but I'll try to get in Gryffindor (despite totally wanting to be a snake) because I'll be close to Pettigrew. Or, instead of worrying about that, I'll talk to the Weasley twins about the map in third year and I'll convince them to give it to me because I'm the son of Prongs, godson of Padfoot, and honorary nephew of Moony. I'll then use that to track down Pettigrew and Padfoot. So, I may end up in Slytherin, after all.

Eighth, go to Hogwarts! I'll probably end up stealing the Philosopher's Stone sometime after Christmas and I'll see if I can get in contact with the Flammels. That or I'm hiding the fucker in my blood-warded hidden compartment in my school trunk. Oh, and I'm /totally/ going to scavenge as many cool things as I can find in the Room of Requirement.

Ninth, deal with the tournament. I'll probably deal with the baby dragon situation to see if they speak Parseltongue. If not, then that's out. I'll just fly like the other Harry did because I'm still technically Harry and will therefore have some of his skills. I'll also take the cup without Cedric. Sorry, buddy but I don't want you to die. Then I'll summon the cup to myself after being Crucio'd a few times (that's gonna */suuuuuuuuuuuuck/*). I'll then reveal Crouch to Dumbledore and I'll /hope/ that he doesn't get his soul sucked out because Fudge is a wuss. I also won't be declaring that Voldemort is back in front of everyone, just Dumbledore. I'll also deal with Umbitch. Probably get myself detention, have Colin Creevy take a picture of my hand, and I'll show it to Dumbledore. If no one does anything about it then I'll send the pics and a memory of the event to Amelia Bones because she's actually competent.

Tenth, begin hunting the Horcruxes I can get as soon as possible. Meaning, I'll have to wait until fourth year to do so. I'll go through with the whole basilisk thing (sorry Ginny) and I'll kill the diary so that's one down. The locket's in Grimmauld Place (and so is /knowledge!/) so that's two. I'll grab Ravenclaw's diadem at the end of first year where I'll either deposit it in a vault in Gringotts as soon as possible or I'll give it to them to destroy via Fiendfyre, so that's three. I'll also inform the goblins that there /may/ be another Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault though I'm unsure if Voldemort had it there for a decade or not, so that's probably four. I'll probably employ Gringotts and a shit ton of curse breakers to get the ring from the Gaunt House (though I'll insist on keeping the stone), so that's five. Next will be Nagini. I'll find a way to deal with that when I deal with Voldemort, so that's six. And then there's me. Again, I'll employ Gringotts to rip the thing from my skull, so that's the last and final seven.

Eleventh, kill Voldemort. Which will totally suck so I'll be training myself to survive since first year. Maybe the Room of Requirement would help with that? I'll also make sure as many people as possible survive. It'll suck if they end up dying but oh well.

Twelfth... live as the motherfucking gay wizard I am.

​

Other than that, there are some things that I might change. Say, visiting the Chamber in first year and befriending the basilisk. See if I won't die if I look it in the eyes. I'll also probably just skip the whole Heir of Slytherin event by stealing the diary from Ginny after Malfoy Sr. plants it on her. I'll just knock into her on accident, upsetting her cauldron of books, where I'll slip the diary between my own purchases. I'll then either give the book to Gringotts or I'll see if I can skip using gold to destroy pieces of Tom's soul by seeing if the basilisk can give me some venom or whatever. I'll use that for most of the Horcruxes before seeing if I can off Nagini myself and get Gringotts to suck the leech from my head. Oh, I'll also see if the Chamber has any goodies for me.

I need that, because I do not know if my presence can be detected by goblins. For all I know, Thief's Downfall will treat the body as a disguise and eject me, thus lethal. I also lack the key.

#5: I have no idea if I'm monitored, and how much. That means, no trips to magical districts until I can reasonably leave the country, possibly the continent. Some of my pocket money (odd jobs and summoning charm on dropped coins) will be sacrificed on language books. I have spanish and japanese, in half a year I can probably have French and German in passable form.

#6: On weekend two weeks before school term ends, I visit Diagon, as a half-blood kid. Stealing one, unused part of Petunia's wardrobe can make the difference between 'outsider' and 'preserving Statute of Secrecy'. I will decide on that after observing the crowd in front of Leaky Cauldron. I take my bug-out sack with me, so if I need to run, I can go to ground and flee to France. In Gringotts, I do not introduce myself and do not dally. I exchange some cash.

#7: Essential purchases include Daily Prophet (unless I can get it used?) and some books on magic theory. I avoid buying Hogwarts texts - skim them, but skip. I am, after all, just looking for 'supplementary reading'.

#8: By now, I have enough cash to take the Chunnel to France, and further beyond. I have knowledge of general situation in both worlds, some meager funds and practice getting more, can communicate in non-English speaking countries. The wards are also well charged, and if I was not spotted during my Diagon jaunt or killed as a target of opportunity, it means that no one was notified of me leaving. I, presumably, also do not have any tracking charms on me.

#9: As an adult, or as soon as I get or create a patsy (bribery, compulsions, or glamour myself well enough to fool electronics), I can start playing markets, get enough cash to retire and live out my days in a mansion in central Australia or Brazil. Until then, I can practice utility magic, collect lost money, do untaxed dishwasher jobs... With magic providing hygiene, I can live practically anywhere where I can get food. Alternatively, I can get myself sent to a German, Russian or even Polish orphanage, do little besides gathering useful skills and vanish after getting my ID. Central Australia is still a valid final step. That or Syberia.

​

In the end, Voldemort is not really my problem, Hogwarts is a death trap (though of honeypot variety) and I see no place for myself in the magical society. I do know however that if the Trio could avoid the Death Eaters, the Ministry and other interlopers for prolonged periods of time with little preparation, while visiting hotspots of enemy activity... I can do it too after preparing well.

** 1.  Don't snub Draco. Instead, treat him politely while not offering overt friendship and keep a ‘happy acquaintances' type relationship while firmly putting him down whenever he gets into his Mudblood phase.

2.  Completely ignore anything and everything to do wirh the Philosopher's Stone because Voldemort can't get it anyway.

3.  Ask Ginny if I can take a look at her books and swipe the diary away. Enjoy a stress free second year.

4.  Presuming Sirius to be hiding in the Shack, pay that a visit via the Whomping Willow and hash out the whole “you're actually innocent thing”. Deliver Scabbers to Remus (because Sirius would kill him) and get Sirius acquitted. Move in with Sirius and hard core suggest psychological help.

5.  ‘Trip' in the top box of the Quidditch World Cup and unveil Barry Crouch, thereby preventing my involvement in the Tournament and also Voldemort's return (which was also prevented by Wormtail's capture).

6.  Begin a long-con game of writing Dumbledore about “visions” I'm having about a cup in a vault somewhere and a crown looking thing in some kind of packed room. “Discover” the locket and the diary's nature in Grimmauld Place and bring it to Dumbledore at the start of fifth year. He's not going to tell me anything. That's fine. “Discover” the Room of Requirements and the Diadem. Use this as an excuse to get involved in the hunt by claiming you can sense where the other Horcruxes are.

7.  Direct Dumbledore to the Lestrange Vault and request I be allowed to accompany him to the Gaunt Shack because “Maybe you need a Parselmouth, Professor. I thought I read that the Gaunts were notorious for that skill.” Prevent Dumbledore from putting on the ring.

8.  Begin to court Hermione while I wait for Dumbledore to muster up the courage to tell me about the fact that I'm a Horcrux. When he does, tell Hermione. Maybe she'll find something. If she does, cool. If she doesn't, I'll go into the Forest and ask Firenze if it's safe to kill myself. If it is, awesome. If it isn't, I'll leave behind a note explaining everything and do it anyway.

9.  Presuming I am allowed to come back after my suicide, marry Hermione, have two and a half kids not named after Albus or Severus. Look into teaching at Hogwarts.

10. Live happily ever after.
