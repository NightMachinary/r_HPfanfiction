The title pretty much says it all. I'm writing a one-shot but am curious what readers and fellow writers think of them as a whole. I'm also wondering what everyone thinks an appropriate length would be for a one-shot. I understand that when writing, one shouldn't confine his or herself to a certain number of words but is it possible that too many words would turn readers off and vice versa, too little wouldn't entice others to read? The longest one-shot I read was 17,748 words and thought it was great. The shortest I read was 3,361 words, and thought it was much, much better than the former, even though a lot less content was shared.

But, would a longer one-shot encase the reader into the world the writer has crafted (of course, this also depends on the skill level of a certain author) and enhance its factor of immersion? Or would a longer read turn off those that aren't looking to get invested in a multi-chapter story that could take months or years to finish, if it even does at all? I know that a lot of this depends on the content and how well one writes but it's something that's been bugging me for a while and I had to scratch the itch. Cheers!


** I like them. Short stories are a valid form of literature and an excellent way of exploring themes that would get ignored in longer novels. Many of the best writers have experimented with short stories.

I also like writing them because I feel better about them being a stream of consciousness for me. I'll start with a vague idea and see what happens. Sometimes this is fun lile when I wrote my Aunt Marge fic or my Hugo fic, sometimes it is a form of therapy lile my George fic.

** Personally, I prefer longer stories, though I still read quite a few one shots. It's the quality and premise of the fic that matters, not the length.

You should absolutely not think about length, as some of the best, most iconic one shots are amazingly short, case in point linkffn(Cauterize). It's the story that matters. Also, I don't think longer one shots, as you say, are off putting. It depends on the story, how much it needs.

** They can work. Probably need at least 5K for me to feel like reading them though. I'm always wary of them though since I hate getting invested in something really good only for it to end too soon. :(

** I like them. I read more one-shots than multi chapter stories. Sometimes the discipline of restricting the word count results in better, tighter writing, and with it being fanfiction, the characters and world are already familiar to the reader. It's a win-win really. I find a lot of multi chapter stories -- especially very long ones -- ramble and meander and just get very dull.

Word count . . . I wouldn't want to read more than about 6k in one go.

** Like! Depends on the writing style. Ideal is probably 10-15k words. Just long enough to put some meat on the bones. Something you can enjoy in a quick sitting. I think a well written 1 shot leaves you wanting more. Not like a cliff hanger, just a desire to experience more of that world.

** As reader, I adore one-shots because most of them have endings that tie everything together. If it was meant to be the start of something larger, I still read and adore them, but also feel like pieces are missing.

As writer, I like them but also struggle with them. For some reason my mind equates a one-shot with having more artistic freedom. I'll worry less about environment description (my Achilles Heel. Sometimes, a character practically prances around in the nude because I forgot to describe their clothes).

At the same time, taking only one chapter to tell a story makes me pay more attention to the words I use. Every word counts to bring the story to life. I have to include an amount of backstory that would otherwise be spread out through ~10 chapters, without bogging down the story. Without losing backstory, because that would "implode" the story I'm telling. Every word needs to contribute to character emotions, physical sensations, etc.

** I write one-shots as little spin-offs of my main work. I do it to release stress, scatter plot-bunnies (I'm NOT taking on a second major book!) and to play with certain characters and certain sorts of scenes. My one-shots are usually either funny, smutty or both.

As for reading them, it's not exactly easy to find great ones, but when you do, they're absolutely worth reading!! Even some of the not-so-good ones are worth reading - in these cases, it's usually because they're nice little fluff pieces that make you feel good when you've had a bad day.

I also find that one-shots are good little inspiration-givers. They're better at sparking ideas than long stories and sometimes (for me, at least) they can help you see how characters might react when you're not sure, or they make you go, “I could do that better.”

Long winded, but yeah.

One-shots are good.

** When I first started writing HP fanfic, I restricted myself to one-shots as I already knew I had a bad habit of abandoning multi-chapter works from other fandoms and I didn't want the same thing to happen with HP. I think I'd done about 10 or so single-chapter stories before I put out a multi-chapter one and even then, it was written as a single but my beta at the time suggested breaking it up into chapters. I think I ended up with 6 on that one.

I really like writing self-contained stories. I like the sense of accomplishment at finishing a complete, coherent story with a beginning, middle and end. My stories all take place in the same Potterverse, so they're all connected and can be viewed as parts of a larger work which is also pretty satisfying. I like writing a story and having it informed by a previous story and in turn inspiring another one. As I've developed my story-telling skills, I've branched out into more multi-chapter works with my longest being 39 chapters. I don't know that I'll ever write anything that long again, though!

As for length, I looked at mine and the longest is 10k words and the shortest is a bit over 3k. Most of them seem to fall in the 6k range. I don't think word count can really be counted on for immersion. If it's well-crafted, a 3k story can be just as engaging as a 10k one. I've read some that were less than 2k that were satisfying, capturing small moments in a character's life.

Writing in the short story format can force an author to be much more disciplined with a need to keep the plot moving forward and it's definitely a good writing exercise. My favorites are when I get an idea and everything just comes to me and all I have to do is get it written down. Sadly, that doesn't always happen!
