*** Ron. "Hey Julian, what kind of wand you get again?"

Harry. "Who's Julian?"

Hermione. "He's in our year. One of the extras that doesn't have any lines."

Julian. "Oh this one, it's great mate! Thought I was just going to be a regular wizard mate but then Olivander he pulled this beauty out. 'A powerful wand young Julian, with a powerful history. I've only crafted one of it's like and I fear I shall never do better. You'll do great things I imagine.'"

Harry. "Hey wait..."

Kent. "Oy! Olivander told me my wand was had an ancient power like no other wand before or after it! Great things he said!"

A chorus of voices agree that they all had a similar story.

Ron. "Wait a tic. All he told me my wand was sturdy and dependable."

Harry. "Isn't that a Huf... mrgghfff."

Hermione, holding Harry by the head. "It's a good wand Ron, there's nothing wrong with that."

  Harry's fourth year was going to suck. Oh, if only he could find some way of turning on his surely-existent powers of super-wizardry. He had those, right? It must be fate that Harry happens to run into the perfect wandering saleswizard. Humor/Parody.

** People like to feel special, and because they identify with the main character, when Harry gets his amazing basilisk-venom-and-dementor-bone wand they can feel special by extension. I guess this applies not just ot readers but writers as well.

I don't even think it's necessarily bad to give him a rare wand, it's just that maybe it should be better at certain types of magic and worse at others instead of just being super powerful at everything.

** You mean like those “thestral bone with dementor's soul core” wands (I keep seeing stuff like that in Dark!Harry stories). Or just regular wands that are supposedly very old and choosy about its wielder, and having means being super special and having inherently better magic at everything?

On the first on I think it's supposed to reflect inner character and all that. Besides, mini Dark Lords can't have something so plebeian as a nice, nondescript wand, right?

For the second, I'd kind of gotten the impression that was how wands in general worked. The wand chooses the wizard, theres a lot of wands and a lot of wizards, it can take time to find a proper match and trial and error is pretty much the only way to work that out. A wand that's been sitting on the shelf for decades seems pretty reasonable.

As for the “supar-speshul” aspect, there is a canon precedent for it. Harry's wand has a twin core with Voldemort's and it is kind of a big deal. The Elder Wand is this legendary unbeatable wand. I guess those authors want to expand on that by adding other unique wands (Except so many seem to go overboard and act like the elder wand is a weak toy in contrast to their “amazing” creation). I always find it amusing that these wands are usually just forgotten about in a couple chapters and act like a makeover plot: dragged out drama that is mostly cosmetic and serves little bearing whatsoever on the plot except for some cheap “Ooh this character is awesome!” reactions from side characters.

But like other people are saying here, I could totally see Ollivander acting like every customer is getting this cool unique wand destined for great things, because people are gonna be willing to fork over the cash when they feel like what they're getting is one of a kind. And it's not technically a lie...

*** Choosy wands make sense, canonically. My problem with it is a combination of nearly everything else you mentioned. When they make their own wands out of some strange collection of ingredients, and wind up with the Elder Wand Mk IV, it's then ignored plot-wise, and then it seems to have all the properties of all the other wands/magics plus some. It bothers me, I'd rather read a story about someone ordinary in ordinary circumstances accomplishing something extraordinary through work or skill, not Deus ex Wands.
