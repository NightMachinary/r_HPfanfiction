So this is the first time using this site, but I thought I'd give it a shot because I can't find either one of these fics anywhere. Mainly because I can only remember parts of them, the first one Harry can summon the avatars of the noble families in physical form and several lords and their heirs pledge allegiance to him. The second one I just remember dumbledore tries to kill Lord Slytherin? in a wizengamot meeting and Lord Lestrange steps in front of the killing curse for him.


** Could the first one be “A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool (Rachel500)” linkao3(1085412)?

  What if Sirius decided to stay in England and deliver on his promise to raise Harry instead of hiding somewhere sunny? Changes abound with that one decision...
