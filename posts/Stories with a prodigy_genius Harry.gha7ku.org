** There are actually lots of prodigy!fanfics but showcasing intelligence is actually quite difficult to do.

#+begin_quote
  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

*** Oof. Got halfway through the first chapter and had to give up. Weeb!Harry is a 10 year old with a ripped physique who wakes up at 4am to run sprints and do Kung Fu and is so strong at wandless magic he can throw around the Dursleys.

Half a dozen spelling errors and I give up. This wish-fulfillment cringe-fest gets a hard "Do Not Recommend" from me.

Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating ancient runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way!
