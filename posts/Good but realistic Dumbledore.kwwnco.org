I don't post often, but I find myself in need of some help from the magnificent community. I have been reading HP fanfiction for quite some time and have made it through quite a few different styles of stories. I am currently working on reading Lightning Dragon's Roar [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10681251/1/Lightning-Dragon-s-Roar][lightning Dragons roar]] In here there is a scene in which Dumbledore and Harry activity take the fight to attacking Death Eaters. More a type of mentor Dumbledore. Far too many fics seem to have Dumbledore bashing (which I don't actually mind) or the "everyone deserves a second and third and forth chance" Dumbledore. I am looking for more of Dumbledore and Harry taking the fight to voldemort.

Rating and such doesn't matter much though I am looking for the longer fics. Crossovers or such are fine as well. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]] features an awesome Dumbledore, but also a smart Lucius Malfoy and a very dangerous Voldemort

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/][barefoot]] by Zaxaramus. Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not. Interesting Harry and Dumbledore dynamic. Unfinished. FFNet.

** Dumbledore is fairly proactive, but in a Slytherin way rather than Gryffindor, in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). The information Snape brought back from the future allows him to plot Voldemort's downfall more effectively than canon, but so long as they can keep Voldemort ignorant of it, they can afford to take their time and seek out the Horcruxes quietly. Even when Dumbledore takes to the field, it's a carefully calculated move.

On the other hand, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), there are no Horcruxes and Tom Riddle is a politician rather than a terrorist, so there's no (violent) war. Dumbledore is mostly trying to keep the pro-muggle faction organised enough to stop Riddle from pushing further discriminatory reforms such as anti-miscegenation laws.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.
