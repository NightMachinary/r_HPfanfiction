I'm looking for stories like Linkffn(midnight blues by zeitgeist84) is a story that features a PTSD!Potter being screwed over by the government and is trying to eek out a living, Potter-style, that is to say a more mature, sarcastic, pop-culturally and more realistic version of the book.

I do have to note though. [[/u/zeitgreist84]] points out a valid point, it is weird that muggleborns immediately lose their muggle culture (religious cursing, pop culture references, and the like) the moment they step in the Magical world, considering that they're only there for loke 8-10 months and they'll be back in the muggle world for a refresher, where are all the muggle references? The only muggle reference we get is from Dean and it is about Football.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
