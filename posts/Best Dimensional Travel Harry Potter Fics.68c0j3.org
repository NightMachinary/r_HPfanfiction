Recommend your favorite/best Dimensional Travel Harry Potter fanfics. Not time travel, or crossover world travel. But strait Dimensional Travel.

Any rating (T through M through Explicit).....

Any style (Sad, Happy, Dark, Light, Adventure focus, Pairing focus)

Any pairings (although I will note I generally don't read main character slash stories).

Thanks!


** Here is a collection of COMPLETED dimensional travel fics I have in my Favorite list:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Both Harry and Sirius before dimensional-traveled through the Veil. They started wrecking things in the new world, quite recklessly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Again, the Veil served as the conduit for Harry and Sirius to a new dimension. Harry met a good Tom Riddle there, but also new bad guys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/Children-s-Crusade][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): This fic is IMO very similar in its feel to "Stages of Hope", but not as good. The story is about Hermione from an alternate dimension, where the war was basically lost, requesting help from the canon dimension. The canon Trio and Ginny eventually answered the call and went once more into the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflection]], linkffn(3959072), is the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][The Darkness Within]]. Harry from that dimension made it to canon universe and swapped places with canon Harry. Lots of Angst in this fic.

[[https://www.reddit.com/user/InquisitorCOC/comments/?count=175&after=t1_ddouy31][Shadow Walks]], linkffn(6092362), and its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]]: They are two highly UNDERRATED fics. The first one has Harry searching for Hermione across several dimensions, and encountering of course multiple outcomes. The second one is about one of the Hermiones he encountered during his travels going on her own dimensional travels, looking for a new home.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): My favorite dimensional travel, read it for yourself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections][Strange Reflections]], linkffn(12307886): In the other dimension, James and Lily survived and raised Harry. They made it to canon dimension after canon Harry defeated Voldemort. To avoid confusion, the other Harry called himself 'Hadrian'....

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Harry and two other canon characters ended up in a world without prophecies, and that world was even in worse shape. The author wrote [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3872862/1/Rebuilding-the-World][an alternate version]] that was IMO even better, but unfortunately abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6730432/1/World-in-Pieces][World in Pieces]], linkffn(6730432): Harry got summoned to another universe by a desperate Order. The characters there took somewhat different roles than their canon counterparts. Snape, however, was good.

*** Thanks for all the suggestions. I have read several of them (A Black Comedy, World in Pieces, Shadow Walks, Deepest Reflection and started but never finished Children's Crusade and Strange Reflections).

But most of the others are new to me. Stages of Hope is actually on my too read list but I was a bit worried about its premise and length. I have heard of A Riddled Universe but it just seemed an odd premise to me and I wasn't sure I would like it. The World as We Knew It is probably the most intriguing to me of the group I had not read.

I noticed you said "completed". Are there any non completed or in progress ones that are also worth keeping an eye on?

**** "Shadow Walker" is great.

"A Riddled Universe" has a pretty cool Tom Riddle and some surprising villains.

Unfortunately, I only have crossover or time travel WIPs to recommend.

** I replied to a thread similar to this with:

Well reality swapping fics without the Order being involved in the dimension travel. There's a bunch and a whole load more crossovers but sticking to popular Harry Potter ones.

Linkffn(9704180) I'm still here. A well know fic, still being updated but slowly. Harry unintentionally slips into another world.

Linkffn(11525673) A one shot that inspired linkffn(4040192) (Harry Potter and the girl that lived.)

linkffn(3959072) the final story in a trilogy that hasn't aged too well but is being rewritten. Alternate Harry swaps places with canon Harry.

linkffn(12446118) (Intersecting realities) The newest completed reality swapping fic. Harry WAS summoned by AN Order but left and found himself in an entirely new reality. For all intents and purposes Its the Canon world he swaps into. Not fantastic writing but new enough that you probably haven't read it.

Linkffn(12188150) technically time travel but its Tonks (Yes Order member but quickly begins to disapprove of their actions) so not the usual swap. Either way, injecting a new variable into canon universe.

Here is the DLP scryer search for Dimension travel I didn't set it to summon since the summoning charm etc might interfere with what you're searching for. Hopefully one of these will be worth reading.

Hopefully something on here is relevant to your search.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

  Voldemort is back, he can be stopped but all things come at a price. Someone called for a hero but he said no, ripped from his own reality he jumps again. Will he be more helpful this time? AU femHarry.

*** Thanks. Sadly i have read most of these, with the only exceptions being Like Grains of Sand, and SilverAegis's one shot.

Grains of Sand looks intriguing, and I have heard of it, but I had never read anything from a Tonks point of view and just wasnt sure how I would like it. I generally prefer Harry, Hermione, or Sirius point of view stories.

I also am following I'm Still Here.
