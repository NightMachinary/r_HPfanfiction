Hey, all. Some of you (if any) might recognize me as the author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13206329/1/Through-the-Veil][/Through the Veil/]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13314997/1/Five-Istari-and-Four-Warlocks][/Five Istari and Four Warlocks/]]. A few months ago I began a new HP project. I feel this is my best project yet (in no small part thanks to AutumnSouls, who is beta-reading for me) and I wanted to share it with you all to get some traffic and hopefully comments and reviews as well.

*Summary:* In the summer before her fifth year, Iris Potter is given a journal that belonged to her mother from Sirius. She discovers that Lily Evans and her maternal line have been practitioners of forgotten arcane arts since time immemorial; in a desperate attempt to rid herself of her hated enemy Voldemort, Iris attracts the attentions of ancient entities with unimaginable power. Now she must gamble things she never even knew she had, to find the strength to survive.

As you can see, this is a fem!Harry fic, with a significant AU background. I've published 30k+ words so far, and while my upload schedule is inconsistent at best, I've so far managed to stay on track of my goal of average one chapter per 3-4 weeks. It might slow down once I start school again, but I will do my best to keep it up.

Do leave a review, on here or on the various sites. It does help encourage me to keep writing.
