Can you give me any ff recomendations for fics when the main character is a single parent? I am not really interested in slash.

thank you :)

It's harry/ginny endgame, but also very much ginny as a single parent.

** Here's a Dramione fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12989521/1/A-Family-United][A Family United]] Most of it has Hermione as a single parent. Dramione is end game, but it's a heart warming fic with just the right amount of salt and fluff.

  She left. One day she just wasn't there anymore. They knew she was still alive, she still wrote letters to her parents. Why had she gone? A little plot bunny that popped up and waved to me. Should be more than a one-shot. JK Rowling still owns it.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione disappears. Harry searches for her for years, but she is gone... until she finally comes back on her own terms. (Written to illustrate the flaw in this trope.)
