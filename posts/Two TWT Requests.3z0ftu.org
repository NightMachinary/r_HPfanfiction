First, I'm looking for stories that have the TWT set in one of the other schools. I'd prefer Durmstrang over Beauxbatons.

Alternatively, I'd also be grateful to read any stories that take place at either of these locations, even if they have nothing to do with the Tournament. I've already looked over linkffn(5353809; 10557311; 9939304)

Second, I'd like to know if there are any stories that include Champions from schools other than Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.

Thanks in advance for any help you're able to provide.


** For the first: linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Goblet of Fire). /Forging the Sword/ is supposed to get there, but I doubt it ever will.

For non-TWT stories, linkffn(4508571) is the only fic of its kind in the fandom, and well worth a read.

For the final one, linkffn(Denarian Renegade) has students from the Salem institute participating as well.

  It's been five years since the last Triwizard Tournament and Hogwarts has gone through a rebuilding. This time it's Beauxbatons' turn to host the tournament. HG with RH on the sidelines. PostHBP, Canon based. Lots of adventure with a few surprises.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
