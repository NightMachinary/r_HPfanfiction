** A different take on the popular "Harry starts a coffee shop after the war" trope. Because not enough people twist the tropes...

** Auror Stevens was not having a good day. He is caseload had been increased and his girlfriend had broken up with him that morning over his job. And now it seemed like his favorite coffee shop had closed down. Scanning the street, he spotted another shop by the name of Potter's Pastries. Any coffee would do, even one from a a shop stealing a war hero's name that looked incredibly run-down.

Grabbing a prophet from a rack near the door, he strode towards the counter. A man with glasses greeted him. Stevens absentmindedly ordered a coffee and a scone as he opened his newspaper and started reading. Apparently the Malfoys had been fined for yet another trade law violation.

/"Avada Kedavra!"/ A shout rent the air. The auror went for his wand and dived towards the floor, knowing it was already too late. Amazed that he was still alive, Stevens cast to conjure a flock of birds around him. Stevens looked up with the sound of chirping and panicked wing-beats as he brought his wand back to cast a stunner, only to stop when he saw that the employee had his hands in the air and had placed his wand on the counter.

"What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?" Stevens shouted, not yet recovered from his scare and about ready to kill the man.

"Sanitizing the counter?" came a contrite response from the man with widened green eyes.

Taking a deep breath, though careful not to close his eyes, Stevens responded. "Sir, I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you in to the ministry for questioning". He wasn't sure but he swore that the man muttered "It's my third time this week. I'm starting to think Hermione has a point!"

Levicorpus? Perfect for hanging up cooking implements and no clutter like with a shelf!

** I wish this could be real life. Being gluten free is so hard and if someone could just transfigure or charm it away and have the actual great tasting food that feels and tastes the same, I'd cry. I literally would cry, no joke. I've been trying for months to make somewhat normal bread. It would actually be interesting to add that into the story. The random gluten free bakery in middle of nowhere that started because of an intolerance. Muggles flock to it. Calming droughts added to their tea. Happy tears.
