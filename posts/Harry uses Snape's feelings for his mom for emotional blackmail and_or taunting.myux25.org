Something along the lines of "What would Lily think if she saw you treating me like that". Extra points for him adopting her mannerisms (e.g. "accidentally" calling him "Sev").

Snape's roasting in a hell of his own making, so why don't we add a few coals to the fire?


** Harry starts wearing a wig with long red hair to potions class and gets his eyes fixed

*** Snape has no right to hold onto his love for Lily. People always act like he's entitled to something. Snape is the reason Lily is DEAD. If he doesn't tell Voldemort about the prophecy, Voldemort doesn't go after the Potters.

Then he has the audacity to make fun of the orphan who's life HE RUINED. but he still claims to love Lily. Because that's how you show your love for people. By tormenting their child. Their child they literally died for. Their child they loved so much that magic couldn't kill them. Just because you “love someone” doesn't mean you're entitled to anything. It doesn't mean you get to act however you want without consequences.

Snape is basically just an incel who hates the chad James Potter, because Lily chose him instead. He got so tilted that he joined the magic KKK (who ironically value Jame's blood status more) and got magic hitler to kill his rival as well as the girl he “loved”. He's got big school shooter energy.

*** Eh Snape deserves at the least the example statement. Snape is part of the reason Harry is an orphan. For Snape to constantly try to torment Harry opens Snape up to reprisal. Especially since Snape likes using Harry's dead father to cause anguish for Harry.
