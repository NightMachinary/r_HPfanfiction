Basically a fanfic where harry is not hated half of the school year, preferably has more friends than Ron and Hermione. Can be Super-Powerful or whatever as long as it makes sense. Oh and bonus points if he isn't moody and antisocial.


** I only remember a fic by Jeconais had this:

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/index/]]

Don't remember much else about it though, don't think I liked it much. But I distinctly remember Harry being some kind of amazing social butterfly.

** linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI) has Harry being a popular Hufflepuff kid, on par with Cedric. He's also incognito in Hogwarts though, so no one actually knows he's Harry Potter (this probably contributes to it, honestly).

  Remus Lupin didn't graduate from Hogwarts to become an odd-jobs man. He always knew he would be fighting the good fight, he just didn't know on which side of the Law. In the end,he made his own side.

** linkffn(Weres Harry) He has friends in all houses, and dispels the Heir of Slytherin rumors with Ernie Macmillan's help, using a quote from Clue!. He also avoids getting shanghaied into the Triwizard Tournament as a contestant. (The chaos he caused in the process made Dumbledore make him the Master of Ceremonies as payback, because he couldn't prove it was Harry who did it.)

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.
