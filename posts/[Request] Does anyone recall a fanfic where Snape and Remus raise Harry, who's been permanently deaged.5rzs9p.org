** If you do find it, could you edit your post with the title and author?

Good luck! It sounds like something I'd like to read.

*** Definitely!

At this point, I might go on an even larger hunting spree for it this afternoon, since it seems other people are interested, but no one knows what it is.

***** I tried looking under Harry deaged fics or even Harry do over. Those words were not very helpful for me. I also tried looking for Severus/Remus fics, and I made all the searches go for completed and over 30k word count, because I rarely if ever read an incomplete story or fic smaller than 30k, so it's really unlikely to be that.

However, I mostly used scryer.darklordpotter.net for my searching. I'm not sure if it's Archive of Our Own, FF.net or possibly one of the minor websites. But since Scryer seems to not be a good choice, I'll probably start again by looking at fics on Ao3 and FF that are completed, over 30k, and have Severus and Remus as mains.

I don't think choosing romance or family or comfort for a genre will be helpful for said search.

I'll probably avoid those smaller fan websites, because I've read very little on them, so it's probably a waste of time.

****** Yeah, most of the fanfic I read is on ff.net, Fictionalley, HPfandom, ao3 and skyehawke. I rarely read fanfics shorter than 60k and I prefer them to be 100k+ because of how quickly I read.

******* Actually I used Google for a little while, thinking maybe I could find someone else also asking about this fic and it worked!

No guarantees on quality or anything, but it's linkfffn(5192816)

******** ...how long does it usually take for the Bot to show up and do its job? I could just type the usual .../s/ and put that number after it right?

Edit: Yeah, the quality is disappointing.
