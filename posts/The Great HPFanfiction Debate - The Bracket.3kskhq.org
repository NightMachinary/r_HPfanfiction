** Oh btw if you're wondering how the seeding was put in place...i've no idea...just put the names into that website and it was generated randomly. If this all goes well and we do it again i'll try and get something more official sorted next time.

** Few questions -

Is there not a panel of judges? or, maybe make the judges the competitors who are not in the actual debate?

Also, how are the replies going to work? I know I'm busy with work and school for a great deal of the day, maybe allow competitors to schedule a one hour time bloc where the debate happens? Is there a set amount of time we must make the reply in?

Sorry for grammar/etc I'm at work on my phone at the moment, may have other thoughts later

*** As it stands we're going to have a strawpoll open at the end of the time limit to have everyone vote. Then from the semi-final on there will be a panel of 3 judges to vote. Then next go around we'll go with whatever worked best.

#+begin_quote
  Is there a set amount of time we must make the reply in?
#+end_quote

24 hours for all replies, if you only reply once every 5 hours that's up to you.

Like everything though that can be changed if it's not working out.

** Okay, I usually only check this sub every couple of days. I missed out on the this round but would like to signup for the next topic, how can I go about that?

*** I'm really, really sorry but I can't change the bracket now that it's set up cause it'll randomise everything and mean the two people in this round won't be in this round.

****** Sign me up. I can't promise I will be good at whatever topic that round is but it should be fun. I should probably go do my yearly reading of the books. . .

******* Awesome. :)

Unfortunately i've no idea how to edit the bracket on that website, so if it says MakinPorin, it means you, sorry. :P
