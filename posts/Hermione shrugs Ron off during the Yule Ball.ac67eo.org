When Ron accuses her spying for Krum, in canon there is a shouting match and Hermione runs off crying. But are there any stories where she just raises an eyebrow and walks away to find Krum (or Fleur/her date)?

I am not looking for stories where Harry or her date tell Ron off for being a dick, or the date swoops in to "save" her, I want fics where Hermione can handle the situation on her own.

No Hermione/(future) Death Eaters and no Hermione/Ron (obviously).


** I'm writing a fic (sadly none of it is published - yet!) where both Hermione and Ron have the hots for Fleur, and when Ron's puzzled over the whole 'going to the ball with Krum' thing ("what are you doing coming to the ball with him? didn't you tell us you were gay? he's spying on Harry for sure!"), she reminds him of this fact, thus deescalating the argument pretty much instantly.

**** She panicked and said yes as a knee jerk reaction when he asked her (she's kind of a closeted baby gay in fourth year, but gets a girlfriend in fifth year). Immediately afterwards, there's an exchange with Ginny, which goes something like this:

/[...]/

/With determined steps, she strode up to Gryffindor tower, and spotting Ginny, she grabbed her without stopping, and dragged her into her room./

/Ginny, I need your help. - she said as she shut the door/

/I'm not going to the ball with you, Hermione - Ginny said with a raised eyebrow./

/Hermione shook her head to dismiss the notion and laughed nervously - It's not that. Someone asked me. And I said yes./

/Well, that's wonderful! Good for you, do I know her?/

/It's Viktor Krum./

/He's not a girl, last time I checked - Ginny deadpanned/

/Hermione shot her a nasty look./

/Okay, okay. So it's Viktor Krum. Oh, the boys will have a fit! I bet Ron would have gone with him, if he'd asked./

/But what do I do?/

/Well, you just go to the ball and not kiss him. Make it clear you just want to have a fun evening and be friends. He's only here for a couple of months anyway. And he's a celebrity. He'll probably roll with it. Did he want to go to Hogsmeade with you before that, or something?/

/Well, no./

/There you have it./

/Well, when you put it like that... okay./

****** Yeah, Hermione is 15 and Ginny 13. Ginny's first boyfriend isn't happening until OOTP, so either it's the blind leading the blind or crack.

********* Could you maybe drop a profile link so we'd be able to get mails when stuff shows up?

And as an aside.. Maybe Ginny is savvy when it comes to relationships in general, but just has a gigantic mental shortcircuit whenever a Mr. Potter is within 20 feet?

** Hermione doesn't run off crying? They do have a shouting match, but Hermione simply stomps off after saying the last resort line, and then they're all polite and friendly the next morning. The crying was a movie only thing.
