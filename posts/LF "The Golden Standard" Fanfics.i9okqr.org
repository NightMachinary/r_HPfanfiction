I don't know how to properly explain what I'm looking for but I'll try my best. In other communities I'm in there always seem to be a handful of stories the community unanimously deems as "the gold standard". The stories that are praised by practically everyone and generally viewed as masterpieces.

I want to know the stories that you guys/the community as a whole view as best of the best, stories that stand out in quality above all else and seems to be loved/recommended by everyone.


** HP fanfiction community is HUGE and there are some horrible divisions in it (search for “Shipping Wars Harry Potter”, also gigantic amount of slash stories). However, considering just the canon-following stories I would say that [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] is as close to the golden standard as you can find (start with “Tales of the Battle” and continue from there on; older stories you can read later).

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is one of the best written fics out there. Linkffn(A Black Comedy) is up there too, but is more divisive than SH due to its crude humor.

I think comedy/parody will always be more praised than serious fics, simply because they're not as easy to criticize and the plot isn't as strict, if that makes sense. Though the plots in both of those are pretty well-written.

** I doubt that there's anything close to a universal consensus on story quality, but what you could more easily find, perhaps, would be stories that defined a part of the fandom. Like Draco Dormiens kicking off Draco redemption fics.

In that vein, I'd suggest linkffn(The Snape Chronicles); I'm not aware of another fic that really tackles that job, and it made the case for Snape having a point about Harry's behaviour looking like a repeat of James.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
