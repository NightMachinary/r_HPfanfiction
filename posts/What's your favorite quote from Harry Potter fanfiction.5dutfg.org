** I'm not sure if I remember it correctly.

"I am Lord Voldemort. Master of Death, and King of This World. I am your worst fucking nightmare."

It's my favorite because of the setting and atmosphere. Not to mention the fic was a crackfic with many, many great things said.

** u/T0lias:
#+begin_quote
  The years past and the Dursleys spent quite a bit of time in prison, it got so bad that Vernon would burst into tears every time someone said the word '[[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bubba&defid=955731][Bubba]]' and after what seemed like no time at all, Harry received his Hogwarts letter.

  "Dudley get the mail," Vernon ordered.

  "Make Harry do it," Dudley whined.

  "Harry get the mail," Vernon ordered.

  "Bubba," Harry smirked sadistically.

  "I'll get it," Petunia stalked past her crying husband and towards the letter slot.

#+begin_quote

  BUBBA rules the [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=prison][prison]] by [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=assraping][assraping]] all men smaller than him. Including some of the guards. Has many [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=prison+bitches][prison bitches]] and fucks them until their [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sphincter][sphincter]] has either ripped or reaches the same diameter as a softball.

  BUBBA is extremely horny and has a perma-hard-on. STAY AWAY FROM BUBBA'S CROTCH AT ALL TIMES. DO NOT [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drop+the+prison+soap][drop the prison soap]] when BUBBA is near. NEVER piss off BUBBA. Never become BUBBA's cellmate.

  To avboid being raped by BUBBA, make him your friend. "CAUTION: BUBBA may still ass rape his friends." Or have the runs during your prison stay.

  BUBBA loves to de-virginize prison newbies.

  Wardens and Guards may put you in a cell with BUBBA if you did A) a horrible crime or B) piss them off.

** "Dumbledore and The Dark Lord had been trying to figure out for a decade what it took to control Severus Snape. It was almost laughable as he watched Miss Granger hovering protectively over a book in her lap. Everything they needed and it was this young girl to stumble upon it, simply because she asked nothing of him."
