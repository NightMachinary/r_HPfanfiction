As NEWTs are equivalent to British A-levels, we know that after finishing Hogwarts, students have a high school level of education. What next?

In the books it seems like there's a more practical approach: there are apprenticeships (in the Ministry) and trainings (for a Healer) and special courses (for an Auror), yes, but no actual studies that we may know from the muggle world. Plus Rowling once said in an interview that there will be no Wizarding Universities -- but she might have also been referencing the fact that she'll not write Harry in college as a new story settled in a Wizarding University, not that there are no Universities at all. Though there doesn't appear to be many, not gonna lie.

It's honestly so interesting to think about and such an underrated area in fanfictions. For example, in the series "Sarcasm & Slytherin" apprenticeships seem to be much more formal and acknowledged than in canon, and in "Wear Me Like a Locket Around Your Throat" we see characters preparing for TOAD exams, which are a level above NEWTs, like a university degree. Both of these are so interesting to speculate about and it's such a pity more authors don't explore those topics.

So how do yall see the higher education in the Wizarding World? Any ideas how else you could approach that topic in fanfics?


** I like the idea that some of the ancient British and Irish universities (I picked Oxford, St Andrews, Edinburgh and Dublin) have magical colleges/departments which were hidden from muggle students post-Statute, but allow magical students to mix with the muggle world if they wish. In my hc there are also some magic-only universities, but these are generally a lot more specialised and somewhere that you'd go to if you wanted to study Healing, for example.

In the spirit of the OWL and NEWT naming conventions, I've gone with BAT (Basic Advanced Tutelage; equivalent of a Bachelors), ASP (Additional Strenuous Pedagogy; Masters), and EEL (Extraneous Edification for Laudation; PhD).

** I personally don't think that the Magical World has any formal Higher Education. If the NEWT are enough for jobs like Healer or Auror, I don't see what career could necessite a Higher Level Diploma to even apply. All the careers seem to train the new employees after hiring.

I also prefer the concept of Apprenticeship, where someone may go to live under a more experiment wizard to learn under him. It's because this system has a base a canon (with Dumbledore who studied Alchemy under the Flamels for a while), and because it "feels" more magical than some "Magical University".

​

But while I'm not a big fan of the idea, it's still an idea that can be interesting if well treated, though there are very few fics that talk about it.

** In one of my fics, Lily Luna reads “Wizarding Education Around the World.” It details the 11 major Wizarding schools (UK, France, Norway, Russia, USA, Brazil, Uganda, Japan, China, India and Australia.) I also added magical schools in Jerusalem and Baghdad for people of all ages, combining wizardry with religious teachings. I also included academies of magic in Rome (defensive magic) Athens (magizoology) and Alexandria (spell creation.) These societies seemed too ancient to not have their own magical institutions.

** The thing is, apprenticeship is way more logical for all sorts of reasons; it feels more magical, it is somewhat old-fashioned like the magical world is, it's more suitable for the very small and specialised magical community, it's more practical in many ways than university education today, and it's more prevalent in technical fields IRL than you'd expect. E.g. medical housemanship, pupillage in law, and articleship in accounting.

TLDR it's a little difficult to write a HP University world that makes sense. Because the opposite is much more sensible.

** Given the tiny size of the magical community, I don't think there are universities and specialized education is done via apprenticeships. However, I understand that bored Oxbridge students want to have stories like “Love Is Like A Rose” by liquid lily linkffn(2870133) so they write them.

  Years have passed since Ginny graduated from Hogwarts and last saw Harry Potter, but when she runs into him one morning in Oxford, how will their newfound relationship bloom, and how will her family take it?

** Remember that thirty years ago most people didn't go to university. Even A-levels and O-Levels (old GCSEs) weren't for everyone - my mum had one O-Level, and my dad didn't do any. They started work instead, like most working class people.
