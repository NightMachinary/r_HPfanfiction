It can be Sirius raises Harry, just being parental figure after Azkaban, or anything in-between. The idea of Sirius Black and his leather jacket/motorcycle as an enthusiastic PTA parent with bake sales and rivalries with moms who have names like Karen has been something I find hilarious, and thinking about it has made me really want to read stuff with Sirius as a parent. Bonus points for Remus Lupin.


** I can picture all the witch moms crowding around him adoringly like "You're such a good father to baby Harry," and swooning. And Sirius is there like "I only came in to get some nappies"
