Please friends and writers, I have an idea for a fanfiction story I would like to write and I would like to know people's /opinions on/ it since other writers are better than me and also write more than I do. My idea is that since the magical communities are separate from the nonmagic ones and they have been for centuries, what if they were /separated even more?/ What if they were /isolated?/ Yes, what if they were so separate that they were like a secret society and a /different society/! What if they were so different and cut off that they had their own culture and ideas on things like sex, sexuality and gender and gender roles, political systems and currency and social manners, and even had their very own language? A language that every muggleborn would have to /learn to speak/ along with everything else if they were going to join the society? And this meant that very rare magicians would be able to speak /both/ their language and muggleborn languages and they would be the guides for the muggleborns? I think it would be so very cool and interesting to write about! What do you think about the idea? :)


** I'm sure there's nothing wrong with it, but I'll be blunt. Most of us are bursting with ideas. Ideas are easy. Ideas are cheap. The hard thing -- the challenge -- is writing it. So if you like it, write it.

** It needs a plot.

I know of two fics that use a setting that basically like this, except for the language bit:

- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5)
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph14)

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Oh there was one like that. I remember that McGonagall had a meeting with muggle-born children and their parents to explain history and traditions. There was something terribly weird with all the female children being drawn to Harry or something, or the other way around, which understandably creeped the parents out. Can't remember much else, but somehow I am sure that it fits your request. Hope anyone knows the name of it though:(

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)

** Magical society being a different society is already a Thing in fanfic. Bearing in mind that the books are set in the years 1991 to 1998, the fairly common tropes of homosexuality being completely accepted/completely abhorrent (take your pick, they're both out there) are obviously from a different society from real contemporaneous non-magical society. And anything involving polygamy, arranged marriages, or acknowledged and sanctioned under-age relationships is too. Male pregnancy plays with gender roles.

The currency is of course different in canon.

In an awful lot of fanfic the political system appears to be modeled (usually without the authors' knowledge I'm sure) on something from around about the 1200s mixed in with the 1700s and 1800s - a powerful House of Lords (the Wizengamot) that enacts and enforces legislation and whose members have special rights, with no effective check on their power, and with open bribery and legal Jesuitism - and the politics is mostly presented in fanfic as being solely along an Isolationist vs Integrationist axis instead of the two economically liberal/authoritarian and socially liberal/authoritarian axes that real-world politics is often simplistically portrayed as.

Manners are often presented in fanfic as being a weird combination of styles from various places in the real world and times in history that are clearly different from the non-magical world.

As for language, given that the statute of secrecy dates from 1689, there have been almost exactly 300 years for language to diverge. Assuming that magicals and non-magicals have diverged in different directions (a reasonable assumption given your predicate of isolation) we could expect the difference to be about the same as between modern English and that of around the year 1400. And that's not that different. Chaucer is readable today with only minimal support from Ye Olde Dictionarie. However, you also say that you want to keep the influx of Muggleborns, so they would have at least /some/ influence on the language. Therefore the difference would be less than between Chaucer and modern English.
