*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past]] is something like I wanted to find (warning: great, unfinished, abandoned after 38 chapters)

**** It's not abandoned, the author just work really slowly. Love this story, though. I have read it three times already.

Have faith, my friend. (It's up to 39 chapters now.)

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost_a_Squib]] is next one - finished parody - "silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry". Includes certain amount of canon bashing but it is also similar to HPMOR.

** What do you mean by similar? Just in terms of length and quality, or are you looking for similar plot elements and that sort of thing?

**** Attempts at that? Innumerable, very common in post fourth and fifth year fanfics, often of the indie!Harry persuasion.

Reasonable successes? I don't think I've come close to finding one yet, though Methods of Rationality, for all its flaws, comes close.

I've found reading fanfic requires suspension of, well, not disbelief per se, maybe taste, at times? Nearly every fanfic, no matter how amazing in certain aspects, requires that you put up with and tune out some personal oddity of the author, whether it's poor spelling (god damn it, you do /not/ "peak" someone's interest, even if MS Word accepts it), author tracts, shipping fetishes, complete with endless tedious romantic scenes (Sacrifices Arc, ugh...) or an obsession with anime or blowing Lucius' face in with a shotgun.

** The only fic I can think of that does interactions with muggles well is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/][Incorruptible: The Dementor's Stigma]] by Matt Silver. But it's an AU set in zombie apocalypse, and I don't think that's really what you're looking for. Although, it is one of the best fics you'll ever read, so you can look at that if you want.

** You could try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A_Stranger_in_an_Unholy_Land][Stranger in an Unholy Land]]. Basically, our Harry gets transported to a world where he is a Death Eater and much more powerful. It's nice because it's a more logical explanation for why he is suddenly very strong and talented in a very short period of time (compared to many fanfictions where he suddenly develops near Dumbledore/Voldemort-level skills in a few months of learning magic through studying).

The fanfic deals a lot with muggles and muggle technology (electricity and its affect on magic, bombs and guns, etc) in the second half, as well as has more detail about spells (occlumency, etc) and the magical world/politics. It is very connected with the muggle world in my opinion, it even has a muggle scientist that plays a fairly big role in a chapter, as well as some other muggle characters that affect the plot. There is not really a focus on hard science though, more on the military.

It isn't perfect and it was started after OotP so there is some Dumbledore hate (although MoR has that too). But I think it's pretty enjoyable and one of the better fanfics. Downside is that it's a trilogy and the author abandoned the story during the second story, but you could easily read the first part on its own and enjoy it.

To warn you, the first chapter starts out slow (very descriptive chapter of Harry with the Dursleys before he is transported), but I really recommend giving it a chance. :)

*** Argh.

I just finished chapter 7 of the second story. And no sign of the author for the last three years.

I abandoned a story I wrote one book of, which I abandoned during the second book. It had garnered quite a few fans, and this is pure karma coming to bite me for what my story petering out half way did to them.

**** I know, it's so depressing; I still hope that the author will return one day ;__; I mostly wanted to read the 3rd part where Harry would confront the evil Harry, it would have been brilliant.

Perhaps one day you can return and surprise your fans!

***** Nah. The storyline ran into a plot black hole and crossed the event horizon. :/

Maybe sometime.
