** In this fic Draco and harry are adults with families. They discovered that magical fertility I'd linked to how well the family has treated magical creatures through the generations.

E.g. not having/treating house elves well.

The Weasley great grandad or something had founded a hippogriff sanctuary or something.

It's quite long and very well written. Not crack and I think it's a drarry.
