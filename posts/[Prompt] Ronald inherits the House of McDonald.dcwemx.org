** "HARRY! HARRY! It has food /and/ a ball-pit! Do you know what a ball-pit is, Harry? Do you? And there are thousands of them all around the world! It will take a lot of orange paint, but I really think I'll be happy there, and as some of them are near libraries, I'm sure Hermione will be happy, too."
