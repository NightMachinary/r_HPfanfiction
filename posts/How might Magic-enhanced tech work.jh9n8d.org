I am writing an alternate history fic where the Nazi's win WW2. As a result, don't ask me why, but as a result, the Wizarding World becomes exposed to the Muggle world.

Some years later, the United States(The sole Allied power that did not fall under Axis rule/dissolve), is a utopia, because of the synthesis of Muggle tech and Wizarding magic.

How might this work?


** Nazis win WW2, they were with Grindelwald, who wanted to overthrow the Statute of Secrecy That's how.

** The first things that come to mind are:

1. Using silencing charms to reduce noise. Besides making things more pleasant, this is a health and communications issue in factories.
2. Using cooling charms to prevent generation/leakage of waste heat. This allows machinery to run longer with less deterioration, allows them to to be used in more locations, and so on.
3. Using strengthening methods to allow things to be built stronger and lighter with less material. This permits more aesthetics to be used in design, makes more efficient use of materials, and allows some things to be portable that would otherwise not be possible.
4. Potions or lubrication charms to reduce friction between moving parts. Significant for product lifetime by reducing wear and heat generation.
5. Shrinking charms to allow mechanical devices to be made smaller. Or perhaps use an engorgement charm on the raw materials, so that a finite will return the finished pieces to the smaller size. Portability and power requirements are improved with this.

You would presumably use rune work or shielding to prevent 'finites' (either errant or deliberate sabotage) from affecting vulnerable things.

** I mean, if Mr Weasley's car is any indication, it'd work very temperamentally, and you'd probably end up with a sort of Animistic Factory-Cities kind of feel. Magic and Tech combine weirdly, so you'd end up with tech with a lot of weird effects and qualities that probably would make working with it somewhat... harder than usual.

Could be fun though. Imagine a Factory where all the machines are sentient and you have to talk them into work in the morning. Or a car that acts like a puppy so you have to pet it before you can go to work. Though Warheads would probably have the most confusing identity crises ever. Or a lightbulb that only works in the dark (it thinks the sun is up, so it's light, so it doesn't need to be on). All the whimsical nonsense of Rowling Magic, but attached to tech instead.

Could definitely be fun. :)
