I could only find one, and now I've lost the link to it - I know I found it on FFN through the search feature, but now it doesn't show up under the search terms I'm pretty sure I was using. (No great loss anyway - iirc it was basically just a standard manipulative!Dumbledore fic with an extra gimmick.)


** That would be so nice, I mean what if Lucius donating to St. Mungos and stuff was actually innocent and well-intentioned, because their family is struggling to cast off the war reputation from being Imperius'd? :) And also maybe if Bellatrix was ALSO Imperius'd and tortured during the war, and forced to participate in torturing the Longbottoms and so much other horrible stuff she had no control over, you could have her in St. Mungo's afterward getting treatment and stuff to try improve her own mental health and get her out in the world again? :)

*** Imagine a slightly more-AU take on that where the Longbottoms are actually recovering, but slowly, and decide to help Bellatrix with her own recovery while they're all still in St. Mungos being treated. It would take a far more talented author than me to do this justice (someone like Kittius, the author of the Worm fanfic Mixed Feelings on Spacebattles), but done right it could be really touching.

That's a tad more plausible than most of the others. OK, Doylist answer is that JKR just sucked at writing mentally ill characters realistically, but I always rather like the Watsonian interpretation - turns up every few fanfics I read - that the reason she acts the way she does owes at least something to mind control. Either so she didn't do an Andromeda or because Voldemort figured having a smart, powerful witch infatuated with him would be useful so commanded Mr. Lestrange to lay down his wife for his Dark Lord.

** A story I'm getting back to this upcoming week has this. It starts a few years before Harry and Draco start Hogwarts and involves the Malfoys getting the Black family back into shape to take power in their society. linkffn(The Coven of Albion), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834801/1/The-Coven-of-Albion]]

Lucius still harbors some supremacist beliefs (about Muggles anyway) but was Imperiused by Voldemort into putting those beliefs into action. Narcissa is genuinely cut up about what blood supremacism has done to her family and makes a real effort at reforming. Should have a new chapter out in a few days, lemme know if you like it!

*** I just read all of this in one sitting, it was that good! I love how it's derivative of RoBM but it really focuses of the magical aspect of the characters and the coven.

**** Glad you liked it! So far I've been slightly disappointed that RoBM seems to have established that the Black coven isn't really religious. It feels like it was just a tool they used to instill fear without a whole lot of reason behind it besides superstition. So I decided to have a deeper focus on the religious and mystical aspects a real coven might have if they were really making a relationship with a deity.

New chapter this weekend, I hope you enjoy it (Maybe drop a review)! :)
