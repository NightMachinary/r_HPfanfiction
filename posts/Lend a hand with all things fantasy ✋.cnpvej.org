Hello! I'm currently in the process of writing a fanfic (although haven't posted any of the chapters yet), and this is my first attempt of writing something fantasy based. My usual stories are very real life, so this is a totally different style for me! I'm having no trouble with anything, other than writing the actual battle scenes. LIKE MAJOR trouble. I've wrote a million and one scenes of people having a bit of a brawl in other fanfics I've wrote, but this is just sooo different for me. If anyone could give me any advice, and or just generally help me write the battle scene, I would GREATLY appreciate it ðŸ˜Š The basic concept of the part I'm struggling on, isn't just a one on one fight, but a fight involving a mass amount of aurors and a mass amount of 'enemies'...

Cheers.


** Are you talking about large scale battles (think Minas Tirith or Helm's Deep) or rather skirmishes (more ambushes, motti tactics and the like)?

What I noticed works best for larger battles is to switch between POVs. Have a scene with one element (be it archers, fighter jets or spaceships), then switch to another (cavalry, tanks, space interceptors) and so on. You can have various situations, limited information (one part of your forces think that they have won only to be taken from behind, another is ready to surrender, one declares that they'll fight to the bitter end and are overwhelmed, one sets up an ambush, a ruse or field fortifications and so on).

*** Yeah, basically a battle on a massive scale. I'm trying the tactic of switching POVs, etc- but it's the actual action I'm struggling with. I don't want it to become, "he fired that spell. The other blocked the spell and fired another back. He then sent a more powerful spell which made the other fall on his arse" (or in a much more literary sense that is haha)... I just don't want it to be repetitive or samey in any way.

**** Focus less on the "damage/defence" bit and more on movement and using terrain as well as what the PoV feels (pain, despair, hope, hate over the death of a friend, anger). Also, you don't have to accurately describe each bout. Switch to describing the actual action (spells x and y) and more "camera-esque" style (blue light, purple beam, green shield, red dome).

** Maybe describe the rough setting of the battle. Huge battles like in LotR aren't really possible in the HP world with the Statute of Secrecy, it's mostly raids and guerilla style surprise attacks. Death Eaters attacking the home of some good Order member, aurors raiding a suspected Death Eater safehouse, this year's defense teacher turning out to be evil and dueling Harry in the hallway. For larger battles I'd recommend switching perspective between a few established characters on both sides. Perhaps tell the side story of how a specific Death Eater got recruited and in each battle there can be a few paragraphs from his perspective, alternating with the perspective of whoever the Death Eaters are attacking. That way you can show a battle from many perspectives but it's not told from the perspective of complete strangers, and the readers get to know each character a little.

Except that everyone is already wielding a weapon and a showdown of a few thousand is certainly imaginable (Battle of Hogwarts en large).
