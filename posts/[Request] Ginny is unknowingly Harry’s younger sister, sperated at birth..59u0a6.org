Just thought it would be interesting to see if anyone knew of a story with the above premis.

I admit it's prone to being cracky but I think it would make an interesting nail fic.

**** I don't remember the name now, but there is a minor one-shot about that that is somewhat decent. It's pretty much crack and (as already said) not very long, though; I'll return if I ever remember the name or otherwise find it on the list of things I've read.

  Harry finds out that things are not what he thought. it turns out that he is not the only surviving Potter. Warning this is not a story that you read to your children. Contains nudity. detailed sex scenes. sex scenes between members of the same sex. I own none of the characters i just like to fool around with them.
