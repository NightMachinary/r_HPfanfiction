I'm planning a fic where Harry, for certain reasons, will have to attend Hogwarts as someone else, but I'm having trouble picking a first name for him. I have a dislike of fics where Harry uses his real first name, or Hadrian or James etc when he's pretending to be something else. I feel like it would be too suspicious usually, and especially in this fic.

However that leaves me with the issue of coming up with a completely new name for him, which has been surprisingly difficult. I think it would be a bit off-putting to name him something generic like Steven, but something super pretentious might be equally annoying.

The name should be something you'd expect for a pureblood, so probably either something old-fashioned o very unique (I have found, on lists of Unique names, plenty of canon HP characters, which I found funny).

I'm just very unsure which option to go for. Does anyone have any experience with this, or any advice? What are people's favourite names for Harry?

** Depends....Looking at this list of canon purebloods...it would just depend on the lore of the pureblood family you're creating.

The Carrows have kind of a Greek/Roman thing going on from the list.

The Gaunts have Evil Gaunt, Omen Gaunt, Evil Omen Gaunt, Raven Gaunt.

I have no idea what is going on here with the Lestranges except it looks like they should have taken a break from marrying into and out of the Black family.

I think the Longbottoms just went with severely British sounding as a theme here with the exception of Callidora here who doesn't count because she was a Black.

The Malfoys kind of had a luxury and wealth theme until Narcissa married in. Apparently, the Black family was eating the other families.

Basically, just pick a theme and the feeling behind the lore of the pureblood last name or surrender to the Black family tree and flip through everything to do with stars ever. Even obsolete ones. I named my Pok√©mon PC, Praesepe, after a star cluster in the Cancer constellation.

Pick your poison, my friend

*Edit: Changed fancy to luxury and wealth. They have albino peacocks. I had to subtract some of the class that the word fancy gives to that. Obnoxious

*** That's great advice, thank you! I hadn't really considered families having much of a theme beyond the Blacks and stars, but that makes a lot of sense. Thanks!

** If your main two concerns are giving him another ordinary name and it being too weird, and giving him a unique name and it being too pretentious, you could try Henry. Harry is a nickname for Henry, so it's not like a completely different name you're calling him by, but since his name is apparently just Harry it's also different enough to warrant using as a disguise.

** Here's a few; Edward, Edmund, Edwin all have a Britishey pureblood sound to me. Sterling, Tancred, Caius, Peregrine, Corvus, Leifr, Torcall, feel like they could fit Harry. For one reason or another.

** I'm late, but Harry tended to stick to names of people he knew when he was taking other names. In POA, he uses Neville Longbottom as his fake name, and I'm pretty sure he did something similar later on.

** What about a star or constellation name, in honour of Sirius? And pick one with a hidden meaning that fits for your story.

Though I suppose that only works if Harry has met Sirius and has some kind of positive relationship with him prior to his going undercover.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** Leo would work, because 1. it's a star constellation, like Sirius, and 2. represents Gryffindor. and it's also a normal muggle name, and I could see purebloods with it as well. you could go more posh with it, like Leonis or Leonidus tbh. not if you weren't going for Gryffindor though...

otherwise, I would probably choose depending on what I was going for. if he was Master of death, then other names of Death, or death gods from other religions, would fit. maybe even Charon (the guy who takes the souls through the river)

Hades being god of underworld, and "had" means snake in my language, so if I were to go for MoD and slytherin, I would probably choose Haden. it also starts with "H".

you could also go with canon wizards, like from chocolate frog cards.
