Not looking for anything super fluffy but I really like that in linkffn(The Best Revenge) the overall story-arch is remarkably wholesome(?) even though Quirells possession is much more pronounced/active/evil than a lot that I've seen.

Things I love from TBR Shape realizing he's been an ass/trying to change his ways Harry's relationship with Minnie Magic being useful/practical (salvaging Dudley's cast offs) Focus on characters in different houses/Inter house mingling

Doesn't have to start with the summer before 1st year but I'm looking for a focus on Harry/his generation huge bonus points if they are more than 50k - thanks!


** It's been a very long time since I've read TBR so I'm foggy on the details, but if you're interested in general ones which focus on the relationship between them and how it could improve, I can suggest a few ! some popular ones I know of are:

  How different would things have been if Severus Snape picked up Harry instead of Hagrid?Snapshots what might have been through all seven books done by season.

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  Harry runs into Snape while trying to find the definition of home, and finds himself drawn into Snape's summer Order task by the headmaster, looking for a location outside of London. Along the way, he and Snape learn a few new definitions themselves.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!
