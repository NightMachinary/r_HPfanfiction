[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779463/1/Force-Interrupt]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303265/1/Wait-What]]

So, someone (HHrPie) introduced me to Force Interrupt today (which then lead me to Wait What) and it got me thinking. What in-universe explanations (watsonian) can we come up with for these issues? Quote canon, speculate to the extreme, bend and misinterpret, whatever works. I'm just curious what y'all creative-types can come up with that actually fits with rules set in-universe. And I know Rowling breaks those rules often (Flitwick says "You have to know all about a spell to cast it" and spells take work to cast, but apparently Harry can just cast Sectumsempra from a single word in a book without knowing motion or purpose.) but I hope we can do a 'lil better than that.

If you've got any other issues, plotholes, or ill logic that you want to find an explanation for, please post it here! Mayhaps we'll find a solution. :)

No 'Rowling is an incompetent worldbuilder who wouldn't know continuity or logic if it came up and punched her in the face in broad daylist' Doylism, please. We all already know that's true and it doesn't really add anything to this kind of discussion. In-Universe only.


** I tried to explain away some canon 'stupidities' in my one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/Interview-with-Director-Potter][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628). A few examples (JKR is not JK Rowling, but the initial of the interviewer):

On not using Veritaserum in criminal investigations:

#+begin_quote
  HJP: Well, let's begin with Veritaserum, it's a wonderful tool, it's not perfect, but if you combine it with the right questions and evidences, you will be able to crack basically any case. And of course, it greatly cuts down on the chance of punishing someone innocent. Our record of the last twenty years speaks for itself.

  HJP: In the old, the Wizengamot based its rejection of Veritaserum on mainly three reasons. The first one was that the defendant might be able to close his throat with wandless magic. We are still laughing hard whenever that excuse was mentioned in our department. Did they think people were that stupid? One Finite Incantatum will end it, and someone in our custody wouldn't have the luxury to perform that wandless feat anyway.

  HJP: A very accomplished Occlumens could of course resist Veritaserum to a certain degree. But we have means, and I mean not torture or anything illegal, to reduce that person's Occlumency defense significantly. On the other hand, such Occlumens are exceedingly rare, while the vast majority of criminals have little to no Occlumency skill at all.

  HJP: The last reason was memory charms. It's a valid one I must say. But again, confessions and human witnesses face the same problem. Memory charms are now the first thing we look for when we interrogate or interview any suspects and human witnesses. Both our department and the Department of Mysteries (DoM) have tools, excellent tools, to identify and reverse most memory charms, including results of Obliviations. Basically, the most important reason for the old Wizengamot to reject Veritaserum was to cover up the dirt of their â€˜esteemed members of the society'.
#+end_quote

--------------

On Dumbledore with respect to mishandling Sirius case:

#+begin_quote
  HJP: Speaking of my godfather's case, it exposed the utter incompetence and malice of the old Ministry. Well, let's suppose Sirius Black was a highly ranked Death Eater and a traitor. Shouldn't they investigate him thoroughly about his contacts, his hideouts, his resources, and whatever Voldemort's plans he knew? Shouldn't they ask him how he deceived everyone, most importantly his best friend James Potter? The Ministry did none of that, but just threw him into Azkaban and forgot about him. They never held a trial either.

  JKR: And Professor Dumbledore was never involved in his case?

  HJP: We did look into this matter after I became Head Auror. But records were far few and in between. Former Director Crouch merely sent Sirius' confession and some statements from Aurors to him. Remember, Professor Dumbledore only became the Chief Warlock in 1990 when Fudge was elected Minister. So he wasn't able to force a trial back then. When I asked his portrait at Hogwarts, it replied that it was too painful for him to confront Sirius personally. When pressed further, his portrait replied that Sirius did indeed exhibit suspicious behaviors during the months leading up to my parent's deaths. Not having the courage to force Sirius' trial was one of the biggest regrets of his life. But that's beyond the scope of this interview.
#+end_quote

--------------

On why Death Eaters let Weasleys off the hook after the Wedding attack, despite having no qualms about Legilimency, Veritaserum, and torture:

#+begin_quote
  HJP: It was a colossally stupid decision. My breakup with her would absolutely not have protected her, if Professor Snape had not covered for her. When the Ministry fell on that night and they raided the wedding (of Bill and Fleur Weasley's), I for once thanked the Ministry's incompetence and bureaucratic rules in that they didn't bring any Veritaserum along. Instead, they relied on intimidations and Snape's Legilimency. We didn't know what Snape reported to Voldemort later, but Voldemort definitely dropped using Ginny as a leverage against me.

  JKR: That was a very close call. Has it ever been explained why Voldemort didn't move fully against the Weasleys and others who had opposed him before?

  HJP: This is in fact an open secret. Our interrogations of the surviving Death Eaters, especially Yaxley and Avery, confirmed that Voldemort wanted to take over Magical Britain as intact as possible. There was of course Death Eaters, notably the Lestranges, who wanted to torture all their enemies to death, but there was also a pragmatic faction headed by Yaxley and Snape who vouched for diplomacy and observation first. Weasleys, with their seven magical children, could be huge assets to Voldemort's cause if he turned them. He thought by showing some mercy and even appeasement, he could sway those dissident Pureblood families to his cause.

  HJP: As long as they did not collaborate with me and openly opposed him, Voldemort was fine with keeping them under observation and Ginny as a hostage at Hogwarts. We believe Professor Snape did influence Voldemort in pursuing this more pragmatic policy at first.

*** It honestly reads like a thinly veiled attempt at retconning stuff because there is always a convenient explanation which leaves everyone important in a good light. I feel like if you want to address the issue Watsonian, you have to admit a few mistakes along the way.

Otherwise, you end up sounding as if you are trying /too/ hard. Or like the "X-did-nothing-wrong" joke. Which is only used for people who did a lot wrong.

**** First rule of people - never attribute to malice what can be attributed to mistake. It seems to be something the fandom has odd perceptions of. Everyone fucks up, but a third of the fandom seem to think that having a good reason makes everything okay (Snape/Draco apologist types) and another third think that fucking up even slightly once makes you a monster (Sirius haters and Manipulative Dumbledore peeps). It's interesting, considering the message of the OG Series.

***** Three things here.

1. If you are in an important position, the fallout from your fuck-ups is much higher. That's why they are generally held to a higher standard. If you work at a cash register and you enter the wrong barcode, well, the damage is not going to be catastrophic. A few bucks at most. If you are the Minister for Defence of a superpower, on the other hand, the tolerance for mistakes is a lot smaller (or at least it should be).

2. Negligence is not an excuse. Like, I honestly don't care what Dumbledore was thinking with the Dursleys, be it evil plot or badly executed plan. Fact is, he never checked up on Harry. Not even when Harry didn't want to go back there. Or ensured adequate mental health. Dumbledore was the one who placed him there, it is his responsibility to ensure that Harry had at least an acceptable life there. Rather than having to dodge frying pans which could easily cause lasting brain damage if they connected with his head. Or live on rations which are comparable to the later stages of a siege.

3. Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action. At some point, Dumbledore's failures become too many to be explained Watsonian other than with either incompetence or malice. Just to name a few:

- The Dursleys

- The Basilisk

- Hagrid's random arrest in 93 and the continued loss of his wand rights

- Not intervening on Hagrid's/Buckbeak's behalf

- Not doing anything for Sirius at the end of PoA

- Harry in the TWT

- fakeMoody

- Umbridge torturing HIS students

- Malfoy running free attacking the same students

- Letting Snape escape with knowledge of the prophecy.

One or two of those things would be acceptable. Together, they paint a bleak picture.

****** Oh, I agree that Dumbledore is probably evil or incompetent - incompetent being my personal bet - but that's exactly the reason I made this thread. I wanted to know if someone could explain all those things in a Watsonian manner. Because, well, it's not just Dumbledore. It's pretty much everything in the entire series that has a veneer of malice or creepiness to it, from Snape overhearing Pettigrew's confession in the Shack and trying to get his soul sucked out anyway to love potions being responsible for her primary example of a 'loving relationship'. And like the two stories I linked said, the number of holes in the Fidelius is ridiculous and the only solution that exists is 'Harry doesn't know shit about anything'.

Like, regarding Dumbledore's actions, perhaps exposure to two Hallows for ten years (Cloak and Wand) and one Hallow (Wand) for however long it'd been since he beat Grindelwald had an effect on him? The Stone seemed to drive people to kill themselves (the fatalistic words of Harry's parents in his walk to the forest seemed to imply the Stone brought Death, as much as or instead of the Dead), so it's possible they all had some form of mental influence, right?

I wonder if there's correlation between the different Dumbledore-version camps and the way they connect those things -ie. do 'naive and doing his best Dumbledore' people only see them as individual elements to explain, whereas 'manipulative Greater Good Dumbledore' people see every action as part of a greater whole, etc.

The naive do-good want him to be good because they want him to be the friendly, wise grandfather type, even if his actions speak otherwise. While the manipulative crowd wants him to be evil so that they can justify their other interpretations (eg IndyHarry).

Honestly, I would prefer to see him as good, but I simply can't because he fucked up too many times.Which is why I prefer either well-meaning manipulator or well-meaning incompetence over the extremes.

** I'm trying to come up with sensible in-universe explanations in my story. Here are some of them:

1. *Why doesn't Voldemort demand that all Death Eaters swear an Unbreakable Vow to him?* Binding the Vow requires a permanent sacrifice of magical power. It would do his servants weak. Besides, it would be harder to recruit followers if people even suspected they would have to sacrifice their magical power.

2. *Why isn't every private property under the Fidelius Charm, and why isn't everyone their own Secret Keeper?* Each person can be the Secret Keeper of only one secret. A law of magic says that nothing can be totally hidden, and so the Fidelius Charm only works if the Secret Keeper is outside the hidden place. If he visits the place, the Charm is temporarily lifted.

3. *Why aren't Time-Turners used before and after the Prisoner of Azkaban?* Hermione's Time-Turner was actually a prototype created by the Department of Mysteries. It was the only one ever used outside the Department, given to a trustworthy student for testing. After Hermione gave it back, the Unspeakables decided it was a too dangerous piece of magic, and swore to never allow them to be used again.

4. *Why didn't Crouch Jr abduct Harry earlier in the school year?* After Pettigrew escaped and alarming things began to happen, Dumbledore used many spells to prevent Harry from being abducted. They were lifted before the Third Task, because the Triwizard Cup being a Portkey was the plan from the beginning, but to bring the winner out of the maze. Crouch knew about this and exploited the temporary breach in security.

5. *Since a map of Hogwarts that tracks people is possible to create using student level skills, why doesn't anyone else have one?* The Marauders did not actually craft the immensely complex and powerful charm that tracks people, it is a part of the ancient Hogwarts security charms. There was once an official map of Hogwarts, but it was lost. The Marauders found a way of hacking that charm and they made it project its information onto the parchment. No one else has ever thought about such a thing.

6. *Why didn't Voldemort hide a Horcrux in the Chamber of Secrets?* He considered it risky because of the Basilisk.

7. *Why ins't Felix Felicis used to change the course of the war?* Felix Felicis actually stores luck for later use. If you want enough luck to get everything you want, the maker of the potion must suffer a loss of equal size. Also, the potion only changes your luck and affects events that cause no harm to outsiders. That way Harry couldn't have used it to defeat Voldemort, because his victory would have been very bad for Voldemort.

And I always assumed that the Marauder's Map was just plain luck moreso than actual skill. They're smart enough to find the right ingredients for what they want, but they basically just tossed a bunch of shit into a pot and heated it to a random temperature, then happened to come out with something edible.

I totally agree with six, though. Putting two chicks in one basket is very un-Voldemort. One plan with multiple parts, sure, but one place to defend multiple things, no.

- *Why the pathetic traps in PS/SS?* Dumbledore's plan was always to use the Mirror of Erised as a final, impenetrable trap. We see in the book and movie that he's /very/ proud of that idea. Ever have an idea that you're super-proud of, but then as you try to implement it you run into more and more problems and it turns out to not be as great as you thought? That, but his ego/hubris didn't let him reach the realization.
- *How was Hermione the first person to figure things out in CoS?* Petrifications. Everybody's attempt to figure out what the monster was started from "things that can petrify" and the entry on basilisks says nothing about petrifying with an indirect gaze. With a Parselmouth reporting odd voices, Hermione took the approach of starting with "magical snakes". We also don't know if anyone previously noticed fleeing spiders or dead roosters.
- *Why does nobody stop Snape's bad behavior?* It wasn't nearly as bad when he first started. Students still complained to the other three Heads, who went to Dumbledore, who told him to tone it down. He did... for a while, before starting to ramp back up. Dumbledore took the renewed complaints as being based on rumors of how Snape had been before, combined with being a strict unpersonable Head of an ill-liked House, and assured the other Heads that it was just rumor and kids exaggerating. When he realized he could get away with his behavior now, Snape gradually escalated past where he'd been before.

** That the Prime Minister was the ONLY person that knew about magic. Just had an argument with someone about this.

When you have a bunch of muggleborn children between the ages of 11-17/18 randomly "disappearing" out of the system for ten months a year and not getting any education? Nor paying taxes? No death notice? That's a pattern like no other. Someone has to know, at the very least to mark down "they are accounted for, see person X in department Y for any followups".

The upper echelons of the government have to know. At least to cover the paperwork, any coverups, any investigations, etc. Weird occurances happen? They forward it to the DMLE.

They quoted Fudge asking if he was telling anyone else and the Prime Minister saying no.

My whole take on this is that Fudge doesn't know that other people already know. Fudge wasn't a good minister.

This is worldbuilding, and why it didn't come into effect in canon? Fudge's head in the sand routine ruined any chances of the Muggle Government helping. And then his replacement (the second one) either imperio'd him, replaced him, threatened him, didn't tell him anything, obliviated him, etc.

***** Well, why would they be reported missing? The parents of the Muggleborn know where they are. And a secondary school teacher is hardly going to miss a child they've never met. A primary school teacher would probably never notice, just assume they left the area and went for schooling elsewhere (which is technically true). Tax people wouldn't care - nobody pays tax here until they leave education and so long as the parents just ticked the 'still in education' box on Poll Tax forms each year, nobody would care unless they kept doing it after age twenty or so. After that point, they just fall through the cracks as NEETs (Not in Education or Employment or Training) and there's seven or eight hundred thousand of those in the UK.

But even if they were reported missing and someone with resources/authority noticed, finding missing people is HARD. Especially if you've nothing to go on, or the parents have the fear of the devil put into them by magicals insisting they keep the Statute. It's like trying to do a jigsaw after flipping it upside down first, so you can't see the picture. You can still find pieces to stick together, and if you work long enough and get lucky every so often you'll uncover it bit by bit, but it's still hella difficult.

Honestly, the thing about death notices would probably be noticed mainly for the older Muggleborns though. "Bob Smith vanished when he was a child, only being seen at family gatherings, until he died at the age of... one hundred and forty three? Hang on a tic..."

I agree with you about Obliviators though - they definitely aren't all powerful and they probably miss a lot in the long run. And to get back to your initial point, I also agree that more than just the Prime Minister probably know too. I just don't see the connection as being one of necessity due to missing children, just the usual cronyism and backroom-chatting where the people in power pass the information about to those they believe need to know - ie. the kind of people that would be called to a COBRA meeting if the magical-types ever became an issue. "There's a magical society hiding from us because they're lazy buggers, and these kids are magical and would probably cause FEAR-esque trouble if they don't get trained. We'll probably get them back later on though, so fund more adult education so they can get educated properly."

******* I'm not sure how it works in the US, but we only have two equivalent levels of schooling here (Primary/Secondary Education) so there's only one transition point to cover. There's also significant cultural differences in the level to which strangers are willing to get involved in one another's business. Americans seem to do it at the drop of a hat - not so much here.

I don't know if you're really interested in specific policies here, but basically, upon leaving a primary school, you're supposed to tell them what secondary school your child will attend and they'll check up to ensure that child is on the rolls for that school and has attended or had accepted excuse for non-attendance for the first week. The initial responsibility for that check is entirely on the individual school or schools. If either school has a suspicion that a child has disappeared or that confirmation of the new schooling (and attendance) is not found over a three week period after the admission date, they report it to the Pupil Tracking Officer for that local authority (each County Government has one person, with occasional variation for the bigger counties). That officer then looks into it and either reports the child missing to children's services or works with the parents and local government officers to get the child back into education.

That's the policy nationwide. So, three weeks is plenty of time for an obliviator team to hit a school and remove some records, but really an obliviator would just need to contact the PTO and obliviate them in the period before they enter the kid into the computer system, or they'd contact the primary schools with a "Yes, little billy has of course been accepted at Hogwarts Boarding School and here's his attendance records." and that would be it. There's a computer system now, but that wasn't around until 2006 or so and before that it was entirely just paper records.
