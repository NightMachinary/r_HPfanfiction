:END:
It's an interesting alternate-timeline short fic I found once and then lost. I can't remember if he uses the timeturner, gets accidentally sent back in time, or just has awareness of common tropes, but whatever it is, it means he prepares far in advance for all kinds of events. Most years, he just sorts the problem out right at the start and spends the rest of the year having a great time. I seem to remember his most difficult problem became letting Sirius out and exonerating him.

It was decidedly a comedy. It was quite short and not that serious.
