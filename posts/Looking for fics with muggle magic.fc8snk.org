I've been watching too much Penn and Teller and now I'm thinking about muggleborns who can do sleight of hand, etc. Just anything that has that as an element in the story ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š


** I just imagine some first year muggleborn being really good at card tricks and baffling the upper years.

"WTF, how did he do a wandless, non verbal switching spell?!"

"Holy shit! This kid just read my mind! How did he get through my occlumency?!"

"Hey, kid, how do you" -- "Feel about Pranks?" -- "You seem to have" -- "a real talent" -- "for causing chaos." -- "We have" -- "a buissness proposition" -- "for you."

And then he ends up doing a whole Penn and Teller act with Dumbledore at the end of the school year where no one is impressed at first, because /of course/ Dumbledore can pull a rabbit out of the (highly annoyed) Sorting Hat, he's freaking Dumbledore. And then they go and causually break every single one of Grant's Laws of Elemental Transfiguration.

McGonagall never forgives the Headmaster, even though they end up explaining everything.
