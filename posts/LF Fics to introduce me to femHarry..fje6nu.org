One never actually read a fem!Harry fic. I need something to introduce the idea to me well. I do, however have some requirements.

Must not be slash Harry must always have been a girl in this fic. Thanks!


** There are two types of fem!Harry stories:

1. Where Harry (with different name, of course) is naturally a girl, always was and always will be. Usually, I guess, the motivation is that the author is a woman and she feels uncomfortable writing from the male point of view (I know something about that, somehow, without me wanting it, most of my stories have a female protagonist, and it is really hard). For some of them the difference in result is minimal (I like linkffn(The Videus Charm by OfPensandSwords) as an example), for some of them it leads to completely different stories. I like linkffn(Victoria Potter by Taure) and I /really/ liked the very good setup of linkffn(The odds were never in my favour by Antony444), but it turns kind of weird in the second year and later with the hidden cabala running the world and similar crap. Also, for very different story linkao3(Tea Cures All Ills by delizabethl22).

2. Gender-bender stories, where Harry was originally our Harry from the books, but then something weird happened and he turned to a girl (or he was born as a girl and then his sex was magically hidden and now he/she turns back into his natural state). There are many wrong reasons why somebody could write such story. First of all, and I am afraid it applies to most of them, the author wanted to write a lemon and femslash was more juicy for (I guess, usually) him. One unashamedly so is IMHO linkffn(11396276) and I will leave it at that. Another one is linkffn(Pranking The Tournament by Gardevoir687), which is not even much smutty, just a rather plot-free fun of having Harry with bra and in skirts (and great friend with Luna, which is really sweet part of the story); Harry, err, Harriet(?) with Neville at the Yule Ball is just a gorgeous scene. The second is that they are Snape/Draco fans and they didn't want to write a slash story, so they turned Harry into a girl to suite them better to their planned pairing. One classical example would be linkffn(Snape's Daughter by Tribi) with unbelievably horrible choice of name for the main protagonist (I won't even write it here). I am not a big fan of either Snape or Draco, so when the story turned to be Drarry, I quit, and I don't overall feeling about it now. A reasonably good variant on this theme is linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), where the pairing is with the Snape's AU son, and it suffers from the deluge of smut (including some of the most obnoxious tropes like magical-hormone-makes-you-horny), but if you skip that, there is a rather good story hidden beneath it. Alternative to that ‚Äúsomething weird happened‚Äù is linkffn(A Fair Life by Rtnwriter), where it is Harry (the canonical male one)'s death in the Forbidden Forest in the end of DH and returning back as a girl on the eve of the announcement of champions for the Triwizard tournament and it is so far rather decently written Hermione/Harry femslash (not even too smutty). Similar idea with different execution is linkao3(A Different Perspective by StellaStarMagic), where the canonical Harry jumps after Sirius into the Veil in the Death Chamber of the Department of Mysteries, but he is kicked back by rather Pratchettish Death into being a twin-sister of more or less canonical Harry Potter just before the letters from Hogwarts are delivered to them. She is sorted as a Hufflepuff, and it develops into so-far interesting timeline repair story. One example of rather anxious treatment of the situation is linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) which turns into rather interesting pairing of Harry/Susan Bones, but again further the development, more weird it becomes.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress.

The devastating news will affect all that is to come.

"... The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky... Some say---" "It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead." ---POTC quote. The Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs. Warnings inside. AU-ish.

The first thing everyone noticed about Hope Potter was that she may have had her mother's face, but she had her father's penchant for causing trouble or somehow finding it, and it only made sense that danger was attracted to her very scent. She was going to prove she was more than just the Girl-Who-Lived. (Fem!Harry) Mostly canon-compliant, diverging in book eight

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.

** I haven't seen any of these recommended yet, but these are basically my tip-top of the fem-harry folder in my bookmarks. I second Ceplma's delineation of the the two types, these are are a mix of both. Pranking the Tournament, Son of Potter, Season of Change are Genderbending during the Fic, Goblet's Surprise, Yule Ball Panic, and Future's Past are Harry-was-always-a-girl fics. Future's Past has some smut, but it's easily skippable without removing too much from the story.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
