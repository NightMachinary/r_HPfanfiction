My vote goes for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/4/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]], a Dark!Harry fic where he accepts the Peverell inheritance and the power and knowledge that comes with it.


** A few come to mind and I'd be hard pressed to choose among them:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi. Law school ate the author.

For sheer epicness, perhaps Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] series, abandoned two chapters into the last book. She used to update every week or so, then nothing.

Nearly all the collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/936968/nuhuh][Nuhuh]], though his Retsu's Folly in particular.

Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]]'s works, particularly book three of her Backward With Purpose series and Yellow Submarine.

Not dead yet. At least these author don't go full cocktease (There is Of Love And Bunnies over at the Power Rangers fandom. Great fic, but the 3 authors stopped updating. 2 years later, the main author output out another 2 chapters, then die again. Sub-author 1 disappeared from the net, Sub-author 2 wrote 1 chapter in her companion fic a year later, then disappear again. From the same author, The Prank War (HP fandom) isn't finished either. It stopped updating around when she dropped FF.net the first time.). DWP updated the first book with her FB detail though (Ella Sparky I think), anyone want to message her? If she isn't going to finish it, she could at least leave the plan of what she was going to do.

*** Boy Who Lived is still unfinished, but it's got 10+ more chapters on the Dark Lord Potter forums. However, the fic takes a really dark direction and the characterization takes a dive, so I don't honestly recommend it.

If you are, like I was, willing to risk it, the extra chapters are [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=17021&page=2][here]].

** Dulce et Decorum Est by Minisinoo. Broke my heart when she announced she wasn't finishing it: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7311272/1/DULCE-ET-DECORUM-EST]]

Her Aorist Subjunctive series as well.

** I remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] by RustyRed a while ago and really enjoying it.

But my favorite abandoned fic has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3787073/1/More-Equal-Than-You-Know][More Equal Than You Know]] by The Obsidian Warlock. Cool interpretation of the magic system, awesome battles, and probably the best Dumbledore characterization I've ever seen.

*** I accidentally started reading Ectomancer a few days ago, not realizing it was abandoned. I was not happy when i realized it was abandoned. It had a good begining.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3484954/1/The-Marriage-Stone][The Marriage Stone]] by Josephine Darcy. 381,147 words of Snarry marriage-fic... that hasn't been updated since 2008. Lots of fan-written endings, none of which I've read.

*** I love The Marriage Stone; it's probably my favorite Snarry. It's also /somewhat/ realistic in its development of their relationship. (Not that it can ever really be realistic; that pairing is pure fantasy.) (It's still my favorite slash pairing though.)

** This was the fic that helped convince me R/Hr could actually work out.

Sadly incomplete, but first 2 major plot arcs are done and well written. Canon pairings for H/G R/Hr. Romance is a plot element but not the only one, mostly deals with Harry struggling with how to go on post-war. Title is a reference to a Kipling poem about soldiers returning to civilian life after WWI. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127805][Shut and be a bud again]]

** Ah man, there was one called "My Darling Caroline" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5753663/1/My-Darling-Caroline]], it was a sequel to one of my fav fanfics, and it hasn't been updated in almost three years. It wasn't even that amazing but I'm still bummed out about it, to the point I wont read non-complete fics now!

** Agreed with Trunacation about HP&TBWL, it's definitely on top in terms of fics I wish had been completed.

After that for me comes:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]], which was an amazing Harry Potter/Culture series crossover that Rustbyte abandoned (as he often did).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3741153/1/A-Fractured-Year][A Fractured Fate]], which was the third book in the "Antares saga", a full rewrite of the HP world, with the idea being that Bellatrix was cast out by the dark lord after it was found she couldn't have magical children. She survived a situation that was meant to kill her, and eventually named names for the ministry, got a pardon, and adopted a magical boy from an orphanage who turned out to be Harry. It sounds weird, but it was really well written, definitely one of the best rewrites out there. Too bad the author quit writing them.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379857/1/Criminal-Limit][Criminal Limit]], sequel to "Renegade Cause", the best Harry/Tonks fic out there (and one of the best HP fanfics around period).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time][Harry Potter And The Heartlands Of Time]], another sequel to one of the most epic fics in HP fanfiction. Joe is probably one of the best known FF writers out there, when he moved into publishing his own original fiction, I guess he gave up fanfiction. Such a shame.

God knows there's more, that's just off the top of my head. I'm sure if I was to look through my old bookmarks from 2007~ish, I'd find pages upon pages of them.
