Where individual muggles discover some exotic source of power and use it to nasty ends. Maybe a revolutionary technology which happens to be immune to the effects of magic; maybe a whole other kind of magic /(not necessarily more or less potent)/ that doesn't depend on genetics to wield, and operates differently; maybe a simple convergence of entirely non-magical circumstances and ressources that ends up constituing a worldwide, non-negligible threat, which you couldn't possibly justify hiding from the way wizards may have done in the past.

Anybody written something like this?

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...

** You'll probably find quite a few crossovers with villains from other fiction with no HP magic but other special powers.
