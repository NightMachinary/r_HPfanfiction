Harry might have romantic feelings for her, but she considers their Relationship as just platonic. However, due to some events and situations Harry might be threatened by something or someone and to distract him or buy more time she seduces him. Possible sex, but no requirement.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

******* If you look through updated within the last week and sort by favourites you will see that Voldemort and other male Death Eaters are now prime shipping prospects for both Harry and Hermione.

******** And don't forget how OOC the Death Eaters are. The only way these fics (usually involving Hot!Voldemort, or Sane!Bellatrix, or Movie!Lucius) can work is to make them different characters with the same name, up the darkness of the supporting cast and make Dumbledore into Satan reincarnated. Usually it involves visiting them before they become Marked, as if doing so turns them evil, and they're all around the same age.

********* You know, the other day I found a really promising time travel story where Harry accidentally runs into a young Bellatrix because he actually dimension traveled and Andromeda took care of the Lestranges. It works in that premise because the Death Eaters are still evil and I like the headcanon that Bellatrix was made a monster (makes for a better narrative than Andi, the good sister, running away and Bella, the evil sister, joining the Death Eaters because she is so evily evil). I mean, Bellatrix is clearly insane and ought to be different without the insanity. Probably still a pureblood supremacist, but more along the lines of "for the lower class, these muggles really have their uses" and not" Kill them all!!!"

But Voldemort as a good guy? Lucius, the cunning politician who unleashed the magical equivalent of a nuke on Hogwarts because he wanted to discredit another man, written as paragon of chivalry? Snape, who joined the magical Waffen SS after he "accidentally" called a friend mudblood? Draco, who has been calling for racial purges since the tender age of 12? We know enough about these characters to make a believable positive depiction impossible. Sure,, there's the butterfly effect, but at some point authors are using names only.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter had won the war, it had been bloody, brutal, and in the end almost entirely futile. Despite his influence nothing changed in their secluded society and eventually he just stopped caring. With Hermione's blessing he eventually decides to perform a ritual that jumps universes, and somehow ends up the caretaker of a female version of himself. Chaos, of course, ensues.
