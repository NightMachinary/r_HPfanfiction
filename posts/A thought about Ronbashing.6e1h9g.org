Not sure why so many writers forget this in favour of that one time Ron wasn't loyal with the TriWizards Tournament.

He tried to do what he thought necessary to save his country.

** What you are forgetting is that most writers /want/ conflict there.

If you remember your youth, have you never made a decision that someone disagreed with, yet seems completely right to you, and the other /idiot/ just is being unreasonable?

That is the feeling the authors project onto Harry. They want him to feel that way. Why is X being so stupid? Why don't they support me? Are they on my side?

Now, go over the list of canon characters even remotely close to Harry and tell me who is the most likely to completely disagree with Harry over a "stupid thing" like this? The only character that you really can write that way is Ron, or with a lot of effort Hermione.

So, as an author you'd either need to remove that feeling from Harry and thus make him less relatable (at least for yourself) /and/ take out conflict (which makes the story fun) or you bend Ron a little bit.

That is why Ron gets used like this: It's not that he necessarily is that way, but if some canon character was to "betray" Harry like it, it would most likely be Ron.

**** First, sorry for the long answer, I got carried away when writing this.

--------------

I've never claimed such authors or stories to be good, I just tried to lay out their reasoning for writing Ron in such a way, which I still think I captured.

And while you and I may view this as petty and inconsequential conflict, others may not. When I was younger my world revolved around me, my thoughts and emotions. And emotions like this certainly dominated my thinking for times.

Such a story can be great for a teenager who just tries to find someone to identify himself with, and give strength to pull through an emotionally yet 'simple' situation. When I started reading fanfiction back in November, I was going through a pretty bad time, the start-up I had worked on for two years and invested so much time in pretty much had failed. I had known for a while, but it was then when I had to accept it. Harry Crow was (for the first 100k words) a fun story to read back then, a kick-ass Harry that goes through canon, demolishing anyone. Now I see how ridiculous and simple this story is, but back then it was /fun/.

One other 'use' of stories like this is for the author to reflect on his growth later, trying to understand and see what he thought when he was younger. One more example:\\
I recently re-discovered some notes (and with that thoughts) that I had about a book. It's "Siddartha" by Herman Hesse, and a very short summary of my thoughts was that there - as suggested by the protagonist - is a distinct difference between "child humans" (which is basically everyone) and other, more intelligent and superior humans that ignore the materialistic world and live a better life.

In the book the protagonist is at one point getting close to become such a child human, and basically I took away that I'd have to be careful to not become this. I was superior, after all! Of course I totally disagree with that sentiment now, but it was a shocking discovery. I even remember how I had to justify my girlfriend and love that I felt to comply with this mindset, which seems so stupid today.\\
I learned a lot about how I changed since then, just from some stupid notes I found again - a whole story written by me would be interesting now, but I never did that.

Your stories are different: In my understanding you usually use them for example to explore morality and consequences of concepts hinted at in canon, other fanfiction and the world itself. This is a great use and, and certainly makes for a worthwhile story and contribution. However, exploring the mind of teenagers is fine, too.

One doesn't have to like it, but there is demand for it: Twilight was a success, and certainly not because of the moral introspection or great plot, but mostly the character-driven conflict, that is often very stupid.

***** I'll admit that for that kind of stories, teenage drama might be appropriate.

But usually, such stories - unlike canon - don't feature Ron overcoming his biases, personal growth, or even the usual conflict solutions common to teenage drama. There's no Ron and Harry reconciling, overcoming the petty drama and focusing on defeating the Death Eaters together. Instead it's usually used to break up their friendship, or nip it in the bud, and replace Ron with "a better friend", either Neville, or an OC (with a canon name).

Like that, the whole conflict usually is reduced to Ron being an asshole (the scale varies from wanna-be bully to Death Eater) and getting his "just desserts", or Ron serving as "proof" that the Gryffindors are actually bigots, and the Slytherins just misunderstood noble souls.

That's not conflict, that's simply Ron bashing.

I mentioned why I liked to read Harry Crow, which has little conflict - and if there is any Harry wins immediately and convincing.

The author has no plans for Ron to be redeemed, because he is /wrong/, and forgiving is something that is less satisfying than simply destroying the other person, and that is what these stories are in the end: Wish-Fulfillment.

Again, I'm not saying that stories that include mindless bashing without any redemption are /good/, I'm just saying they are not outright worthless.

Trying to understand why someone would write something or why it is okay for me to enjoy it, even if it's not good by literary standards has been liberating. I don't need to judge the author or myself for enjoying something. That's all I'm trying to explain here, and I don't even think you really disagree with me.

****** But canon Ron was at least a wannabe bully. I stopped liking Ron in PoA when he started a lot of drama about a rat he thought useless. To me that destroyed any sympathy I had for this character. When I read GoF and Ron was an arse about the whole tournament mess I was really happy to see him gone only for Harry to take him back. Then Ron was a giant arse towards Hermione again and Harry did sit back and watch. That's the second thing I hate about Harry in GoF.

If the person who stood by me when no one else did, who spent dozens of hours helping me stay alive, and the guy who recently was a git and thought that I was a liar for getting entered into a bloodsport were fighting and the recent git was giving my loyal friend shit in my name I'd never speak to the person again (funnily enough something similar happened to me IRL). And certainly I wouldn't sit there with a bag of popcorn while my friend is reduced to tears.

I never liked the wifebeater Ron or Death Eater Ron stories. That is just an overused plot device. But bully Ron? Insensitive git Ron? Fairweather friend Ron? That's how I see Ron based upon canon alone. If a story shows Ron that way I don't see that as bashing, I see that as canon accurate depiction of Ron. I could even see Ron pulling a Snape and call Hermione mudblood in a heated argument (like when he leaves in Deathly Hallows). Because Ron is at least latently bigoted. He didn't see the issue with using magic to get a driving licence. He altered the mind of a muggle without sparing this a second thought. That shows that Ron is not a good person and probably a criminal offence as well.

It's these small things that make me hate Ron. And if I ever publish a story I've written Ron will be shown exactly based on these things. I won't make him a wannabe Death Eater or a wifebeater. But he certainly won't be Harry's friend for long.

******* I think that you are falling into the trap of putting yourself in Harry's place. Yes, there are many people, who put in Harry's place, may feel like Ron is an ass and doesn't deserve to be a friend to Harry. But on the other hand, we also don't understand exactly what Harry's thought processes were. Yes, Ron started a lot of drama about his rat. On the other hand, Hermione wasn't exactly all that apologetic. She was more along the lines of cats will be cats, you should have kept him locked up, etc. She had good points, but at the same time there was not a huge amount of sympathy for Ron's pet being killed. Try putting yourself in Ron's place. His pet was killed by a hostile and unfriendly cat, and then the owner is making excuses.

Similarly for the tournament, I could see Ron feeling betrayed. Here he is, wanting to enter the tournament, and his friend tells him that he isn't going to enter. Then he finds out that not only does his friend enter and is picked, but the judges don't kick him out of the tournament, in clear violation of the rules. To an insecure guy, who really really wanted to be in that tournament, I could certainly see his reaction as plausible. And did anyone even tell him that it was a magically binding contract in the first place?

The trick to reading fiction, and even functioning in life, is to not get overly tied to a certain point of view. Putting yourself in someone else's shoes can lend you insight, and even give you sympathy for their actions.

******** Magically-binding is a fanon idea, I think. Pretty sure that in canon it's just that Barty Crouch Sr. says Harry has to compete, there's no mention of contracts or bindings.

That said, I agree with you, and also think that people overthink and overreact to a lot of Ron's mistakes.

Hogwarts is effectively secondary/high school, right? Well, people argue and have falling outs and stuff like that - one time, where me and my friends were playing tag or something when I was about 13, we'd recently introduced a new guy to our group, and we were getting on like a house on fire. One of my other best friends deliberately went out of his way to hurt this kid in some weird fit of jealousy, but we made it clear what he did was absolutely not okay, and refused to speak to him afterwards until he apologised to the new guy, which took about a day or two and then we were right as rain. They're both my best friends today, nearly a decade later.

Ron /can/ be an arsehole, absolutely. But his actions in GoF are hardly unforgivable - notice that he thinks Harry lied, but doesn't wear the 'Potter Stinks' badges or join in any of the other shit the students do in the lead up to the first task. His resentment is quieter and more centred around his personal hurt at what he believes to be Harry's betrayal.

Authors making Harry super judgemental and melodramatic about the whole Ron thing really bother me. So he's not perfect, big whoop. No reason to cut all contact with him, blah blah. Communication and forgiveness in the face of adversity like that help build a stronger friendship - believe me, I've been there - and the fact is is that everyone you know is a human being with flaws and issues and the potential to make serious mistakes. Holding Ron up as a friend first and human second does him a disservice, I think, and authors get so caught up in his apparent prejudices or flightiness that they bury anything good about him at the same time, a lot of which is just as if not /more/ visible to the reader than his negative traits.

He was Harry's best friend by that point. Of course he'd back him up. Ron's a bro. Even if he does mess up sometimes, friendship always wins out.

But the Ron of /Philosopher's Stone/ didn't have that solid friendship with him on their first day at Hogwarts. He might have very well disliked Harry for being sorted in Slytherin. Even if he didn't go that far, the tensions between their two houses probably wouldn't have let them be close friends. And seeing Harry go into Voldemort's house would have given him pause. /Had to be a reason for it, right?/ he might think.

Also: Ron bashes and slams Slytherin whenever he can in canon (ok: Most of the time it involves Malfoy or Snape of course!), we have not seen him accept that Slytherin doesn't mean evil/deatheater (makes him quite the hypocrite, he harbored a Gryffindor deatheater after all - not that he knew it at that time!), it's one of the first things he does when meeting Harry (after wanting to see his scar and being a jealous asshole because Harry can buy stuff from the sales-lady on the train (which Harry graciously shares with him, too!) and bashing his mum for forgetting that he doesn't like packed lunch!)

It's quite natural that Mr. Motor-Mouth-without-any-Filter-what-so-ever, would start blurting out bullshit as soon as he learns that Harry is dating a Slytherin (or friends with anybody from that house!)

I am not saying that he wouldn't come around in time, as that is quite possible (he did return in Goblet of Fire, too it just took him seeing his friend almost dying to say that he's sorry (note: IMHO Harry should have told him to piss off at that point...you don't need fair-weather friends after all, you are better of having very few good friends than many bad ones after all!)), but I am saying that Ron is a git - I mean Hermione might not have been the most socially astute person ever (and she never will be, because she simply doesn't care enough - she cares more about books and knowledge!), but Ron was especially harsh on her (not only in year one - the "she's a nightmare" comment! - but whenever they had fights...without Harry as the stabilizing element/buffer between them they'd have torn each other to pieces!)

You know he didn't /have/ to stay, right? Or even come back. He was a pureblood and could have lived life on easy mode at Hogwarts if he was so inclined. Harry and Hermione on the other hand were the two most wanted. And you can't bring up this argument without mentioning that Harry was the one who told him to leave.

Ron has a lot of skills, and if you were capable of reading into a character, you'd know that. That's like saying Hermione's only talent is reading.

Ron was resigned to eating his shit sandwich, but Harry offered him some of his sweets in exchange for a homemade sandwich. Ron wasn't acting like a jealous asshole, so you may want to take those rose-tinted shades off for a moment.

Harry was never friends with, nor dated, a Slytherin.

Harry didn't really give him a reason to believe him, then turned to physically assaulting Ron with a button when Ron ignored him. Ron's never asked Harry to die for him, yet Harry has several times. Harry's the overemotional, little bitch that's constantly getting his feelings hurt like the emo shithead that he is. And Ron has to deal with it for seven years.

Hermione was just as bad as, if not worse than, him. And she constantly brought it on herself. Besides, Harry only stepped in on their small arguments. When they really blew up, Harry stayed out of it.

**** Could he? He was an enemy of Draco Malfoy, Snape didn't like him and neither did most of Slytherin house, so I guess he wouldn't have had "easy mode" (sure, he might not have been tortured etc. but it still wouldn't have been great IMHO)

What? Ron wasn't great at school, he seldom worked on his own and often copied Hermione's essays!

Yes, Hermione was bad (I am not defending her, hell I don't like canon-Hermione either! I think somebody who probably grew up in higher society (Britain is after all still pretty much a classist society and doctors and other university grads aren't exactly of low status!) should have had more social graces (and some incline to doll herself up, maybe not in the extrem if it's not something you care for, but at least a little!), fact is however that Hermione didn't and she didn't care what most others thought of her (unless she overheard them and then she goes to cry in the bathroom, despite the fact that it's her fault - note: Yes, she is a teenager, still she should have noticed that all those verbal attacks etc. are her fault because it's her behaviour that caused them!)

Yeah, Ron was acting like an ass on the train (especially when Malfoy showed up, but the sweets thing, too - he kind of lets Harry know that he doesn't like "charity" (despite it being only a few sweets!), that's IMHO why Harry trades for one of Ron's sandwiches (so that he can claim it's not charity!))

In canon he wasn't dating them or being friends with them, but I bet he was not an asshole to them just because of their house (there were Slytherins who were not Malfoy toadies after all!)

You don't have to fucking give a FRIEND (your supposed BEST FRIEND even!) a reason to believe you...hell, if anything you should have to give them reasons to doubt you to start them doing so, which Harry clearly didn't do (hell, after all of their adventures before and Harry saving his dumb little sister who should have known better than to write in that damned diary Ron should have never doubted Harry at all IMHO or at least he should have stopped doing so after Harry tells him in no uncertain terms that he didn't enter his name!)

Yeah, he buffered them best he could, but when they were really going at it there wasn't much he could do ;) (and taking sides if your friends fight is bad form, so he was right to stay out of the large spats!)

ps: Nice going downvoting squad, you know what they say: The downvoting button is not an "I disagree" button ;)

***** Draco wasn't at Hogwarts. But Ron wouldn't have had to worry about starving or dying, and he could make sure his family was safe. Instead he leaves, gets caught, then can't find Harry and Hermione before they leave, and spends the next month or two looking for them, rather than check up on his family.

Ron got Exceeds Expectations in Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, Care of Magical Creatures, Herbology, DADA (same grade as Hermione), and got an additional OWL in Astronomy, even with the distraction of Umbridge attacking Hagrid. He and Harry both failed Divination and History of Magic. And the kicker is Ron doesn't study, yet is essentially a B+ student. He's not stupid by any measure. Lazy, but not stupid.

Ron snickered when Malfoy said his name (which we don't even know if the two things were related), then Malfoy dove straight in, insulting his family and throwing their poverty in his face. And you're right, that's why Harry didn't offer to buy Ron a new wand or dress robes. Ron doesn't like being looked down on.

Ron tries to avoid Slytherins, and the only ones he really interacts with are Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He was even passive to the Slytherin underclassmen, like in HBP when that "little girl" (Crabbe under polyjuice) drops her scales.

It doesn't matter if they believe you or not, because Ron was still ready to support him. Harry was the one just the day prior talking about putting his name in the goblet, then lo and behold, Harry's name pops out of the goblet. And what's Harry's rebuttal? "Believe me or go fuck yourself!" Besides, Harry's very attention-seeking, so it's not hard to believe he would do something like that, but Ron didn't understand how dangerous the tournament was, elsewise he probably would have believed Harry. That and if Harry had tried to explain it to him.

Arguing is Ron and Hermione's way. If they've got a problem with one another, they let it be known, so as not to be a problem anymore. It's actually extremely healthy, but most fans don't see that as most people aren't raised as liberally and are taught to grin and bear it.
