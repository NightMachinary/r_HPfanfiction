** Lots of great classics on FF.net, I like being able to control my searches on AO3 but dont like the overloaded tags some people do. Wattpad can die in the furnace of a nuclear reactor for all the use I find in it.

** [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] app grew on me fast and is my mainly source atm. I can't get comfortable with all the (sometimes chaotic) tags of ao3. I don't think wattpad needs to be even referenced in this question. Also dlp scryer is a really good tool to find something that you missed on ffnet.

**** It's not just that the userbase is inherently better - AO3 deliberately put policies in place that limit opportunities for harassment. Authors can choose to moderate comments (meaning that any comment has to be approved by them before it's publicly visible), they can delete comments, and they can lock their fics to AO3 members-only. There's no direct messaging option. Harassment is explicitly against AO3's ToS, and they have an Abuse Team to back it up.

** I prefer ao3 for its search functions, especially the clickable tags. Though I do hate the folks that overuse them.\\
FFN has a lot of classics and the stories are usually somewhat restrained compared to ao3, therefore usually a safer idea when I do not know who can read my screen.

I tried wattpad once and was not happy with their search functions at all - totally useless for me for that reason.

​

Plus, ao3 has a dark mode. Much easier on my eyes.

***** A third edit would be somewhat ridiculous. Okay, so [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] has a feature to swap text and background colours in the chapters themselves. That is no true darkmode the way ao3 and a ton of other sites (reddit as well, looking at the colours onscreen atm) do it, since other pages are still mainly white. When you are suffering from headaches as often as I do, that's not a good thing. Besides, even with the colour swap the chapter page is still somewhat glaring, while any ao3 page is rather soothing to my eyes.

** From the technical point of view I like AO3 most (it is free source, community-driven, the best search, so I can filter out slash and too much gore), but [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] is just so big and has so many members, that a lot of stories are just there. However, I can never find them there, so I am almost completely in mercy of recommendations. And Wattpad ... well, my daughter reads it (hey, she is 14! and a lot of Czech stories are there), but I read like three stories there (actually, I like [[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter]] and [[https://www.wattpad.com/192985075-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter-1][Dursley's Dilemma]] , they are not much dramatic, but nice teen-age high-school style; yes, I like Stalky & Co. and so what?), the fourth I will never mention to anybody. In the end what really matters is the text, and I mostly read ePUBs downloaded via [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]], so it really doesn't that much where I got the file from.

** FF is better on mobile, their app works great with alerts and offline. AO3 works better on desktop, the FF desktop site isn't good and some options are only available there, some only on the mobile site and some in the app.

Personally I use FFN unless I am looking for something specific -- Ao3's filtering system is superior /by far/ to FFN filtering.

If I were to create a fic, I'd post it on both FFN and Ao3. Not sure if I'd bother with wattpad, since I didn't even know it existed.

** AO3 feels less organized than FF. You also tend to have higher quality writing on FF, which is good if you have an edited, polished product. At the same time, because the standard for writing isn't as high on AO3, you can post new work that you're unsure about without as many doubts, nor do you receive as much backlash for posting something someone doesn't like. Both have their pros and cons.

​

Wattpad feels totally unstructured and many people on the site seem to enjoy very basic premises with bland storytelling. Of course, this doesn't mean that this is all wattpad has to offer, nor does it mean that the other two sites do not have those kinds of stories, but it seems that wattpad is where fanfics of lower quality exist more frequently

** ff.net tends to be a much simpler site to use, but the limitations on what can be tagged makes it difficult to sift through things easily. Ao3 has pretty much the exact opposite problem in that anything can be tagged and people sometimes take that as a challenge. There is also much, MUCH more slash stories on there and it is irritatingly difficult to try and filter them out. I have nothing against slash in theory but so many of the stories on Ao3 have the pairing being the singular plot points which does absolutely nothing for me.

Recently I have been moving back and forward between the 2 reading MCU and Into the Spiderverse stories, I honestly couldn't say which site is best overall as it very much depends on what you are looking for.

Oh and comparing Wattpad to the other two sites is a little like entering 3 horses for a race with 2 champions with different strengths and the another with every birth defect and communicable disease possible that somehow lumbers along even though it would have been better for everyone if someone just shot it in the head.

**** It gets rid of a lot, but many people just tag their work as multi and it still shows up. For example if you sort by bookmarks in the MCU while excluding M/M literally the second story is Peter Parker/Wade Wilson and Steve Rogers/Bucky Barnes. These days I mainly just exclude by relationship because it tends to be more precise.
