Both have little said about them, but Davis was a half-blood in canon. Greengrass was said to be a part of Parkinson's clique.


** linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) Best Tracey in fanon in my opinion. I don't even remember if Daphne exists here. Complete AU though.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

**** Quite a few things from fics have made their way to becoming canon to some people.

Whether it's Ron being abusive, Hermione looking like Emma Watson and being a Super-Genius, Daphne Greengrass being +Elsa+ an ice queen, or Dumbledore cackling in the background spouting "For the greater Good".

** This is the case in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks]]). When the main character meets and befriends Tracey in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/6/Princess-of-the-Blacks][chapter 6]], Tracey says that Daphne only tolerates her because their families are allied, and that they don't actually like each other.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

*** I appreciate it. I'm not fond of fem! Harry (it's not an absolute rule though, just bad experiences with fics), but this looks good.

I've been recommended this fic before for different reasons.

**** I read that four-book /Black Queen/ series only a few weeks ago. Here's a mini-review with minimal spoilers:

I found the first two books quite good. The main character does politicking, becomes more powerful, and makes mistakes sometimes. The world is fleshed out well. I was looking forward to what happened next.

The third book was fine for most of it, but I was a bit disappointed in the climax, which came out of nowhere. Information that the author didn't foreshadow was too important in that climax. At the end of the third book, I felt like though lots of things had happened, too little of it had mattered. But I was still interested to see what would happen in the next book.

The fourth book, like the third book, had interesting build-up and world-building, though less world-building than the previous books. However, its ending feels very incomplete and unsatisfying to me. Some of the major plot threads are resolved, but a lot of others, major and minor, are left hanging. I tried to stop and analyze the ending to see if there was more to it, but that just made me remember even more things that I assumed were leading somewhere, but that were never mentioned again. At least the ending is better than if the story were abandoned, as so many other fics are.
