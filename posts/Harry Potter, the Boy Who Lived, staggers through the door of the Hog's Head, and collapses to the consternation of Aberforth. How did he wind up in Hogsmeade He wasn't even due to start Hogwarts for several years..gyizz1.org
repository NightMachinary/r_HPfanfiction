** Harry accidentally turns his oversized shirt into a Portkey, and stumbles into the pub after landing. "Oi! You're too young to be in here, lad. Where are your parents?" Aberforth demanded. "They died." Harry informed him solemnly, right before passing out from magical exhaustion. Abe Dumbledore swore violently, already moving around the bar to assist him. As he checked the kid's pulse, he looked right at a very familiar scar. The swearing increased several magnitudes.

*** "Magic obeys the wishes of wizards and witches, especially in their direst circumstances," Albus explained to his brother. "Harry was afraid, and his magic reached out to someone, anyone who would actually protect him."

***** I just loved the idea of Aberforth calling for his brother after he finishes cursing, and while he waits, manages to rouse Harry, and get a few details as to /why/ he's in his current state.

Albus trying to take Harry back to the Dursleys without listening to Harry's story and Aberforth objects physically. With a fist. To the face.
