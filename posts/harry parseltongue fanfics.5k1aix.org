im looking for stories where harry uses his parseltongue ability more often, stories where he has a pet snake/basalisk, and/or stories where he can talk to dragons. i have typed these into google before and have had a lot of trouble finding any. (preferably over 60k words and complete)


** He talks to all sorts of animals including snakes in linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them), and hangs out with a runespoor for a while. He also picks up a snake companion.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** There is a lot of parseltongue in [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]] (site requires signup to view fics). Not just Harry, he has a whole conclave of parselmouths. And at least 6 pets/familiars. It's complete, and 386k words.

I've heard at least one report that signups aren't going through, pm me if you'd like an ebook.

** linkffn(magical relations) has Harry speaking and teaching Parseltongue with the help of his pet snake. Conversations with and about snakes in that story are probably the funniest parts.

Linkffn(muggle-raised champion) has Harry's ability to talk to snakes extended to include dragons.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*
