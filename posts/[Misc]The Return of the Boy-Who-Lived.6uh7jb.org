Here's a snippet from my take on the "Harry doesn't go to Hogwarts at 11" plot which might be turned into a full story at a later date:

*The Return of the Boy-Who-Lived*

*Ottery St Catchpole, Devon, Britain, July August 25th, 1996*

“Ron's late,” Hermione Granger said, not for the first time in the last ten minutes.

“He was fine when I left thirty-five minutes ago,” Ginny said, making a show of looking at the clock on the wall - a normal, muggle clock, not some wizarding contraption that showed everything but the time. Hermione had been surprised that the Lovegoods had something so normal in their very eccentric home when she had first spotted it - but visits to Neville's and Lavender's homes had shown her that this was eccentric for a wizarding home.

“Then why isn't he here yet?” she retorted, biting her lower lip. She didn't want to worry, and if anything had happened, they would certainly have heard, so close to The Burrow, but... With Death Eaters on the loose, and Ron being a rather prominent blood traitor after the Battle of the Ministry...

“Lavender's not here yet either,” Luna added, without looking up from where she was reading The Times Hermione had brought her friend.

“She said she'd be late,” Hermione pointed out. “Ron didn't.”

“Exactly!” Luna nodded, as if Hermione had not just refuted her argument. But that was normal for her friend. Even if ‘normal' wasn't usually a word associated with the Lovegoods. Which made their home a very good spot to meet, of course.

“If he had gotten into trouble, we'd hear the explosions,” Neville said. The Gryffindor was twirling his wand between his fingers - limbering exercises, he called it. Hermione was certain it was related to the movie they had watched with the entire group earlier this summer.

Just as she was about to say again that Ron was late, there was a knock at the door. Luna looked up, blinked, and nodded. “They've arrived.” Which meant the wards hadn't triggered, Hermione knew. Louder, Luna said: “Come in!”

The door opened, and Ron stepped in, wearing muggle clothes and a sheepish grin. “Sorry that I'm late - I had to dodge Mum.”

Hermione Granger simply raised her eyebrows at Ron's excuse. And when she spotted Lavender behind him, also clad in muggle clothes - very fashionable ones, she couldn't help noticing - she simply shook her head.

“He fetched me from the bus stop,” Lavender said, beaming. As usual, her hair was combed to hide the scar on the left side of neck and cheek.

And he took thirty minutes for a ten minute walk, Hermione added to herself with a wry smile. It wasn't that she was jealous - Ron was her best friend, nothing more, and she was happy for him, but sometimes she wished... She cleared her throat. “Now that everyone is here...”

“All of the Gryffindor Grenadiers are present and accounted for, Ma'am!” Ginny interrupted her with a wide grin. Hermione rolled her eyes, but otherwise ignored the redhead. And the giggling blonde next to her. To think that she had thought showing the group military movies would be educational!

“...let's talk about the coming term. Since their defeat in the Battle of the Ministry, the Death Eaters haven't launched another attack.”

“That we know of,” Neville pointed out.

Hermione nodded at him. Her friend didn't say much, but when he did, it was good to listen. “Yes. But with the Dark Lord's return now confirmed to the satisfaction of the Minister, we can expect more trouble soon. Even at Hogwarts. Especially at Hogwarts, if the latest rumour we heard is true.” She looked at Ron.

“It is true. I verified it with Percy.” Ron grew serious. “The Boy-Who-Lived will be attending Hogwarts this year.”

“Why didn't you tell me?” “You git! You knew and didn't tell me!”

While Ron was trying to explain the need for operational security to his angry sister and his pouting girlfriend, Neville nodded slowly. As did Luna.

“The world will finally see the power of the Boy-Who-Lived, raised by Dumbledore himself to be the perfect foil for the Dark Lord's plans! As The Quibbler revealed twenty years ago!”

Hermione didn't want to point out that Harry Potter hadn't even been born twenty years ago. The last time she done something similar, Luna had produced an issue supporting her own claim, and Hermione had more important things to do than to wonder whether Luna's mother had been a Seer, or simply gifted with charms that allowed the retroactively correction of mistakes. Or whether Luna was pulling a prank on her.

She cleared her throat again, interrupting Ron's spat. “That's enough. He and I agreed that we wouldn't spread the rumour until it was confirmed.”

Ginny sat down, scowling. “No wonder they're a couple - Ron's a worse gossip than Lav! Only he doesn't spread the gossip!”

Luna beamed at the redhead, as if that had made sense, and Hermione wondered, not for the first time, how the group managed to be so silly in meetings, yet so skilled in danger. But as long as it worked...

“Anyway, with Potter coming to Hogwarts, the Death Eaters will be coming too. Maybe the Dark Lord himself.”

Ron scoffed. “And we'll send them packing, like we did before.” Grim nods followed his statement. They had done so indeed. And some of the Death Eaters wouldn't be a threat to anyone ever again. “They won't get the Boy-Who-Lived on our watch.”

“He might not need our protection,” Luna said. “He was raised by Dumbledore, after all, to face the Dark Lord. Probably in a hidden mansion full of curses and traps.”

Hermione had her doubts about that, but she simply shrugged. “Even if he was trained, I doubt that he has any actual combat experience.” Not even Ron had heard anything about Potter actually having done anything noteworthy since surviving the Dark Lord as a toddler. She just hoped he wouldn't be a difficult boy to protect.

But it wouldn't matter - their group had done far more difficult and dangerous things already. “So, let's go over the known threats. Does anyone know if Malfoy is coming back to Hogwarts after his father got killed in the Ministry?”

--------------

*London, No 12 Grimmauld Place, September 1st, 1996*

“Do you have everything? Emergency Portkey, second wand, potion bag, bezoar?”

Harry Potter nodded. “Yes. I triple-checked.” His godfather was a worrywart. But he wouldn't want him any other way. It had kept them both alive after all.

“Condoms?”

“What?” Harry almost dropped the trunk he was levitating. “Condoms?”

“Well... we may be sending you to Hogwarts because it's the safest place in Britain, now that the Dark Lord knows you're alive, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun with the witches there.” Sirius's grin reminded Harry of Padfoot's - it was just missing a lolling tongue.

“There's spells for that!” Harry said, too late for a good comeback.

“I know, I taught them to you myself. I just wanted to see how you flustered you'd be.”

Harry rolled his eyes. He wasn't exactly inexperienced with girls, even if - as Sirius was wont to bemoan theatrically and regularly - he wasn't as experienced as his godfather had been at his age. But those had been short romances and flirts under a fake name, doomed from the start. It would be different at Hogwarts. And, he thought with a frown, there was the danger just being near the Boy-Who-Lived brought.

“You're brooding again. You have the same expression Remus has when he's in one of his moods.” Sirius was frowning at him. “Harry, we've trained you to protect yourself and others. And you can't do that if you're isolating yourself. Don't be a Moody Moony - the witches won't like that!” He blinked. “On the other hand, Remus was quite popular among some witches who thought his gloom and doom was romantic. I guess you can do that too!”

Harry scoffed and floated his trunk to the entrance hall.

“Just remember: You'll be surrounded by students, not trained Aurors and Hit-Wizards. Apart from the Order members among the teachers, even the staff is not trained for combat. If anything happens and we're not around, it'll be up to you to deal with it and save them.”

“Dumbledore said there was a group of Gryffindors who has been fighting Death Eaters,” Harry pointed out, setting his trunk down next to the fireplace.

Sirius scoffed. “Fighting Slytherins at Hogwarts is not fighting Death Eaters.”

“They were in the Battle of the Ministry as well.” Or so Harry had heard.

“They got lucky - or unlucky, if you want. Getting saved by Dumbledore doesn't make them trained fighters.” Sirius looked at his watch. “We need to go now - we have to take a detour, so we won't risk an ambush on the way to the express.”

Harry nodded. Only a fool took the direct route. And being predictable meant you were dead. Sirius had taught that to him early on.

** I've read plenty of the classic 'Harry has been trained before coming to Hogwarts late' but none really after the war hit it's full stride. I'd read it if you made it into a full fic.

*** In the backstory? Only where it makes sense or fits too well to skip. For example, defeating a troll together is a great bonding experience and also is such an impressive feat that it sets up Ron and Hermione with the fame and reputation needed for their next efforts - and it paints both of them as Malfoy's "Ersatz-rivals".

In a similar way, a battle in the Ministry is a plausible consequence of both Voldemort's and Dumbledore's goals. Voldemort wants the prophecy so he can avoid its consequences next time, and that's the only place where he can get it. Dumbledore knows this, and wants to prove that the Dark Lord is back to the Ministry - facing him inside the Ministry would achieve that nicely. Neither side wanted the kids present, but shit happens when you're a bit too clever in setting up weaknesses to tempt the other side. And of course the battle went far different from canon - Lucius wasn't the only one who died.

But generally, things went off the rails from the start - Sirius raised Harry, with Dumbledore involved. No blood wards. No diary either. No disguised Barty Crouch. No manipulated GoF.

There is potential for friendly rivalries here.

** Hmm, I'm guessing this will be HHr? There's another fairly known sorry that has Harry being raised/trained by Sirius and Dumbledore, joining Hogwarts in his sixth year I think, and HHr. Although no one like Hermione in that one so, there's a difference there.

*** Probably Harry/Hermione, yes. And yes, I read that story, and I really hate how Hermione was the damsel in distress, a complete victim, placed there so Harry could save her. This would put a well-trained Harry together with a group of Gryffindors who are well on their way to become child soldiers, and who aren't overly find of the Boy-Who-Lived suddenly taking over the top spot in the eyes of the school - if he wants to or not.

**** I suspect that the "Gryffindor Grenadiers" might actually be more ruthless and have more practical experience in the Dark Arts than Harry in this case: I am assuming that Dumbledore and Sirius would have done what they could to keep his soul clean, so to speak.

***** That depends on your definition of the "Dark Arts". I often use two versions - the Ministry definition, which is a rather random collection of potentially lethal or cruel curses, and the magical, which only includes those curses which actually damage the soul. Dumbledore wouldn't let the Grenadiers dabble in the later.

The Grenadiers have experience with killing enemies, which Harry lacks. But Harry got a more focused and in-depth training in fighting.
