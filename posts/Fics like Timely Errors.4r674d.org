I've not come across anything with a similar feel or execution to linkffn(Timely Errors). Does anyone have any recs for fics like this?

I particularly like the idea of Harry going back to the Marauders era, but never revealing his name.


** I haven't really found anything else like it. Most time travel fics it seems have the traveller staying there, and the whole story takes place in that time. However, linkffn(2814526) has Harry travelling back to the founder's time, for a relatively short amount of time, then going back. linffn(2690076) features Hermione and Fred travelling back for a year, then going back.

  Harry awakens transported back in time over 500 years. Hogwarts is still being built and, amid the bustle, Harry finds the warm, nurturing parental figure missing in his life, in none other than Rowena Ravenclaw. Will Harry ever go home? Will he want to?

*** The author of /All through the night/ has no idea how familiar pronouns work. The first sentence after the jump already has a mistake in it. As has every other sentence following.

**** I'm not sure what mistakes you're referring to. Are you talking about the 'old' english bit? For that matter, I'm not sure what you mean by familiar pronouns. A quick google search returns stuff like the difference between tu/vous - which is something that's not in english.

***** The "old English bit" is an attempt at using familiar (or informal) pronouns, yes, as English used to have before the formal became the sole mode and the informal was dropped. That's called the t-v-distinction in linguistics.

But it's also about wrong 2nd person conjugation. "Hath" is a 3rd person verb form, not second.

My native language still has them, and so I can't help but notice if they are used this persistently wrongly. It's supposed to signal times long past and authenticity, but it does the opposite.

****** While it is wrong, is it really fair to criticize them for something that most people probably don't know? Most people don't really learn about the old english grammar rules, and don't know the difference. I can understand how annoying it would be if you do though.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
