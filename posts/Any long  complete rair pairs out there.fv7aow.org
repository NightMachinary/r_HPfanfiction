I rhymed, heh.

I've just finished a novel length Draco/George: linkao3(no more bailing boats for me (toss me a heavy rope)) and would love to read another rare pair fic!

Ones that I've come across and enjoyed are 1) Luna/Voldemort: linkffn(Twelve Dark Moons by Sophiax) - complete 2) Marcus Flint/Katie Bell: linkffn(Detained) - WIP, abandoned? 3) Oliver Wood/Minerva McGonagall: linkao3(Venus & Adonis) - one-shot

I don't think I really have a preference for any character, although I do get iffy with non-con & don't like any alpha&omega themed stories. I'd also prefer 3rd person narratives, even if from a particular POV. Please do send any over to me!


** Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle.

  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."

** I have a new fic that's very much a WIP; I figured I'd pop it in here just in case! It's a Hermione/Tonks fic, and very AU. Voldemort succeeds in killing the Potters in 1981, and subsequently takes over Wizarding Britain. The Order is largely dead or in hiding, and Voldemort rules with a totalitarian fist. Muggleborns are taken from their homes at a very early age and raised to be second class citizens with very few opportunities to raise themselves up. One of these opportunities is Requiem, a contest hosted by Voldemort each year. Linkffn(13530186)

#+begin_quote
  In 1981, Lord Voldemort was victorious in Godric's Hollow. Fourteen years later, he rules Britain with an ironclad fist. Each year, young witches and wizards compete in Requiem for a place in his inner circle. When Hermione is chosen to represent London, she's forced to use every one of her skills to succeed - or die trying.

Last updated in April 2014, so while I would love more of this melancholy but comforting post-war story, I doubt I'll get it. Potentially Harry/Charlie but mostly gen till the end, so if you don't like the ship, you can still enjoy it. Unresolved past Harry/Ginny mentioned, but again, that's not the focus--Harry's healing is.\\

Choosing Grey series by Betagyre (Tom Riddle - Voldemort/Hermione) WIP

A Time-Turner AU with dubious antihero Tom Riddle, morally grey (but conflicted) Hermione, conspiracies, mid-20th century wizarding world politics, plenty of dark magic.

This is a long, involved AU in which Hermione gets involved with Tom Riddle despite her intentions, and eventually makes a life with him. She's not Dark, but has a nuanced view of politics and works to carry out her own plans and keeps her morals, mostly.

The BDSM aspect is my least favorite aspect of the story, but in this series it works for these two characters. Explicit.

  When Stiles was a little kid he always wondered about his father's tattoo. The way his father was, tattoos had never made sense for him. On the right side of his father's arm were the letters SPQR with a Caduceus symbol above it, and six bar lines under it. When Stiles gets hurt and the pack wasn't there to help, the Sheriff decides it's time Stiles learned about his tattoo...and about his own legacy as the grandson of Mercury.
