** I don't knw of any fics similar to Red Sparrow but just out of curiosity, did you like the book? I finished reading it sometime last year and thought the premise was excellent but the execution fell flat. There were some good moments here and there but overall, once I closed the book, I had no intention of completing the trilogy.

** The closest thing I can think of is linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) which features Hermione as a timetraveling badass.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)
