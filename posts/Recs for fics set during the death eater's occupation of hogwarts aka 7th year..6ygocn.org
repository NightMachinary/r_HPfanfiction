I just realized I haven't heard of many fics set during the carrow's reign at hogwarts (probably because the trio and draco weren't present). Any recs? Any pairings (including slash) are fine, 20k+ preferred.


** You've probably read it already, but Not From Others is a Ginny-centric one that fits your description.

#+end_quote

I'm quite certain Draco never went anywhere. Anyway, this is one of my favorite premises. I just wish there were AUs of this period, but there are enough interesting PoVs to follow to keep it interesting regardless.

Ginny Weasley and the War for Hogwarts - Contains some innovative elements that I generally don't see in such fics. linkffn(6514733)

Astoria's Guide to Slytherin Guys - Ignore the nonsense of the epilogue, and it is a fairly decent Slytherin perspective of that year. linkffn(6242630)

Headmaster Snape - Snape's perspective is always engaging. linkffn(11931368)

The Seventh Year - Neville and McG centric. I remember literally nothing about this, but I liked well enough to fav. linkffn(4575862)

Traitorous Hearts - Features Astoria as a spy. Characterizations and dialogue are a bit wooden at first, but they smooth out later on. linkao3(6671233)

Caught on Fire - Neville/Ginny romance that takes place in Carrows-ruled Hogwarts. linkffn(12215200)

Evolution - Draco/Ginny, set during Deathly Hallows. Mostly a character study of Draco. linkao3(7309849)

The Second Splinter - The only Hogwarts AU I've read that promises substantial canon divergence. Ginny-centric. linkffn(12488984)

Keeping the Castle - Seamus-centric. Haven't read it, but it is on my to-read list. linkffn(11780250)

Tell Brave Deeds of War - Again, haven't read it, but looks interesting. Follows the Ravenclaws. linkffn(12330043)

The Changeling - It is not solely what you're looking for, but it has 50k plus words following a Slytherin Ginny in Death Eater ruled Hogawrts. One of the best written fics in the fandom. linkffn(6919395)

Also seconding Not From Others, A Call to Arms and Penultimate Acts.

  As the daughter of the Dark Lord's chief spy, Astoria Greengrass is well-acquainted with subterfuge. When her family's loyalties are called into question, their lives will depend on her biggest deception yet. But she'll need all her wits, because the Death Eater she must deceive is Draco Malfoy, and the truth is, Astoria has a secret that could doom them all. (Set in the background of Deathly Hallows)
