Looking for something along the lines of "Harry & Ron are best friends who share everything... Including Hermoine"


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387][No Boundaries]] is the best one I've found so far.

  Dean has been blind for most of his life, and has learned to cope with it. He starts to wonder how much longer he can cope with his disabled eyes when he meets a strange man at a bar, and learns he has a lot more to him than he lets on.

** AO3 should have a number of them depending on if you're looking for plot or just smut.

If you filter by the rating explicit you should get smut.

** Man, I read one recently that was REALLY dark, the trio was imprisoned in Malfoy manor and Harry was tortured and... other things, the first few chapters were really hard to get through, but the trio-love connection was written as a way to help Harry overcome the trauma and heal. It was surprisingly well done, but I don't remember the title. It started with ron/hermione, then harry/hermione and then Harry/hermione/ron and then Ron/harry/hermione.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath.
