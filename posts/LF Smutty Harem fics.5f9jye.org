basically looking for fics that feature harry paired with 2 or, preferably more, female characters that has smut or sex scenes in them. As i feel like far too many harem fics take themselves far too seriously in terms of plot and content. really i'm just looking for a fun read that focuses on the perk of having a harem without all that political and tropey nonsense. With that said, I'd like the plot to be simplistic or for smut's sake, near non existent. Not really looking for masterfully executed writing but the writing should get the job done, even better if the sex is well written. Incest is tolerated but /please/ keep it minimal. Bonus points if the rec(s) has romance/romantic development, one way or another(not a necessity but a man can hope).

Examples fics:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5446275/1/It-Could-Only-Happen-to-Harry][It Could Only Happen to Harry]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8994911/1/The-Potter-Family-Chronicles][The Potter Family Chronicles]]

** If you're looking for light plot but loads of smut read anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/megamatt09/pseuds/megamatt09][MegaMatt09]]. He does massive harems with crossovers from all kinds of other fandoms. especially comic books.

** Try out '[[http://Ficwad.com/Story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]]' by Vanir - Harry rubs elbows (and other parts) with magical creatures from Nordic myth. It's only fair- he's actually an alchemically-designed spawn of several powerful creatures, so god-like powers of sexual awesomeness shouldn't be surprising.

Yeah I guess the author thought it was necessary as a plot device to get Harry to keep dating various girls, but it really felt out of place... not that other Harem fics have better reasons for the existence of the Harem.
