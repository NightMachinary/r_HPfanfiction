Whenever I read a fanfiction that provides the Hogwarts timetable, I just skip over it as it doesn't have any relevance to the plot. What about you people?


** Honestly, no. Mostly because the books themselves tend to play pretty fast and loose with the class timetable.

It doesn't. The first Potions class is first thing Friday of the first week of classes.

**** In real life, easily, in Hogwarts not so much. Its quite normal to have a week or two of orientation. Maybe when Potions is normally held they're having their details taken for Madam Pomfrey or some other admin task the school would do like making them all sign an agreement that they've read and understood the uniform restrictions. We just never see this sort of thing in the books, that being said, it would be really boring to include it.

Also, for what its worth my high-school also used a two week timetable.

** I never read them. Along with the school song, the hat songs, bank statements, inheritance results that are longer than 2 lines, Hogwarts supply letters, bad twin-speak...

In most cases, the aforementioned and some other examples are entirely superfluous and whatever a reader might get from them can be gathered from the context. I prefer a short statement in the narrative or in dialogue like ‚Äùthe hat was a bit ominous this year‚Äù or ‚Äù it appeared that the Potter family was obscenely wealthy‚Äù it gives a sense of what we need to know but doesn't involve a wall of mostly pointless text.

I read somewhere that every element of a narrative should contribute to the plot, and while not a writer myself I think that is something to consider ü§î

** I read them, provided they're formatted well. They can help with making the story flow better too if writers use them, as the characters actions make more sense, when it's spread out over a year or more. Don't necessarily remember them though when I'm reading m. üòÖ

** I read them because you never know when it's important and it's a good heads up for what's going to happen in the future. Because they could be having an average/normal day of classes and then all of a sudden they are going to "Magical Theory" or "Battle Magic" class with a made up professor's name, and I would be blindsided and confused if I hadn't read the time-table before.

** I've never seen it. IMO in most cases it's good to have one made up by the author for internal consistency but pointless to include in the story unless as a curiosity in AN or as additional material. Maybe give some mention if it's past 3rd year and time travel shenanigans come into play but otherwise just ditch giving a timetable in timetable format in the story, include stuff more naturally in conversations/internal monologues or narrative

As you should do with everything else with a story

** I've always read them, even irrelevant information like the house songs and such. It always feel disorienting to just jump from one thing to another and accidentally skip over some stuff.
