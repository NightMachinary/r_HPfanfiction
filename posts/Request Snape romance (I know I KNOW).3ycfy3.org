** YAY, fellow SS/HG fan. Your request is my absolute favorite type of fic, so I should be able to help. (Also if you want to recommend anything you've come across, I'd appreciate it too)

I imagine you've read linkffn(Post Tenebras Lux by Loten) but it's my absolute favorite SS/HG so I have to mention it. If you haven't read it, it's a story of healing and a quiet romance that takes place ten years after the war

linkffn(Sin & Vice by mak5258) is a fantastic and original take on what a ruthless and desperate Dumbledore could do with Hermione's talents and a time turner that can send a person back years at a time.

In linkffn(Thirty-One Days by keelhaulrose) Hermione has a month in the middle of the final battle to convince a 16 (17?) year old Severus to want to live

linkffn(Snape's Oceans by Theolyn): 25ish years after the end of the war, completely canon compliant through the epilogue, Ron's dead and Severus has forgiven himself for Lily. They meet on an island in Greece and heal each other.

linkffn(Phoenix Song or, Hermione Granger and the HB P by grangerous) is the first in the Phoenix trilogy. It's the Half Blood Prince told from Hermione's and Severus' perspectives, and she gets up to so much that she couldn't tell Harry. Canon compliant except for the epilogue. The next two in the trilogy are DH from their POVs and the year they go back to do their NEWTs from their POVs. Not the best written (well enough written not to drive me off, though), but the plot is fantastic and quite a lot of it has become my headcanon.

I can probably think of more if you want them. I hope this helps you forget your real life troubles for a few hours and I hope it gets better soon.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

  In the midst of the Battle of Hogwarts Hermione is given the opportunity to help save Snape's life. Little did she know it would require visiting Hogwarts twenty years prior. She has thirty-one days to befriend the sullen Slytherin, and perhaps save his life. But, as always, things don't always go as planned. HG/SS, time-travel, EWE

**** Loten's take on so many characters is perfect. I love her Snape, Hermione, Dumbledore, McGonagall. I actually read her Immortals from Numair's perspective before I even got into SS/HG and looking through her other fics was the first time I realized the ship existed. I didn't read them then, but after I'd read Pet Project, I came back to them, and Loten's probably my favorite fanfic author now.

** Looking for Magic linkffn(2737071) is a HG/SS I always enjoy. While it's not officially complete, from a plot/story standpoint the key points are all resolved. Though there is definitely a lot more to this storyline than a pure romance, so it's not a really a Mills & Boon.

  Severus Snape and Hermione Granger deal with traumas past and present and find they have more in common than they realize as they prepare for the ultimate confrontation with Voldemort. SSHG pairing. Not HBP compliant. This is a novel length story.

** I really loved linkffn(Time's Fool by Lunabeegood). It's a time travel story but different where they explore multiple lives they could have led in different areas of the world and different time periods due to a broken time turner as they try to find their way home. It's really good! The romance develops through the story, and while there are the sad moments, their love is written beautifully.

Also, linkffn(A Chance in Time by GreenEyedBabe) is the best time-travel story I have ever read. There are some definite emotional rollercoasters, but it does have a happy ending :)

linkffn(Affairs of the Heart by Dazzlious) is a great story! It is not as long, but it is completely wonderful! This one also does end happily even though it may not seem like it. It's about the love affair of Hermione and Snape.

** I saw this recommended on here a while ago:

[[https://hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/getting-the-hang-of-thursdays-0122/]]

The author has loads of HG/SS fics available as well, if you look at her master fic list. Seriously, this author is amazing. This one I just linked is a groundhog day style fic where Hermione keeps dying. Seriously awesome. It's got two different endings, a happy one and a sad one, so be prepared.

Also, not sure if you've read linkao3(1862259), Forged in Flames, but it's a weirdly satisfying read. Kind of dark, though.

      This is the first fanfiction I ever wrote\. I'm finally bringing it over from FF, stripped of most of the original author's notes\. \(You don't need to know that I was a bit late updating on a particular Thursday\!\) This fiction goes into some relatively dark places, and there are scenes of torture/violence, so please be warned\. The setting is AU; in this version of events, Dumbledore is still alive in their seventh year, everyone is still at Hogwarts, and Voldemort is not yet at full power\.If you enjoy it, please comment/review, because authors live for that sort of thing\.

** I only read Snape fics when he's paired with Harry so I won't be a lot of help but one of my absolute FAVES is A Nick in Time and its sequel Growing Pains by Tiranog. Actually, anything by Tiranog is amazing but start with those. [[http://tiranog.southroad.com/Tiranog_Site_Map_Web.htm][Here is her site.]]

** I'm on mobile so I can't link but try For The Only Hope by ausland on ff. It's WIP and quite lengthy but the romance and build up is worth it. I also love a lot of character development and grit in Hermione. It makes the story much less strange with their age difference and gives it a bit of depth.
