The longbottoms had authorized The medical action as a last ditch resort In a hope that maybe an alternative method might be found to at least allow Frank to understand his surroundings and perhaps Alice might be able to speak somewhat normally.

Their minds were broken in many ways but for some odd reason they responded to some of the stronger muggle pharmaceuticals, and something Group talk therapy, That Natalie personally smuggled them both to 3 times a week at king's hosputal in central London.. The group was made up of survivors of the falklands war, a few Vietnam veterans and a police officer that had spent a few months in c Captivity being tortured by a gang in Northern Ireland during the troubles.

Over all it wasn't pretty but remarkably Natalie noticed her patients making progress.

The longbottoms continued With the treatments for nearly 3 years until the war made it impossible to get them to group and Natalie actually smuggled them along with several other patients to the Bahamas for treatment and protection while the factions fought for the islands..

A son his father was finally able to recognize, and his mother hugged for the first times without giving him a bubble gum rapper... this time is was a letter. A paragraph in length in a crudely written hand... But it was Alice's own hand that wrote it

So it was progress
