See, sometimes I'm reading a story that starts out good, but the protagonists do something or condone something disgusting and it just completely spoils the fic for me. Things that make me stop reading and start plotting how to ruin the lives of the 'heroes' instead.

Typically these are things like horribly abusing the legal system, or intimidating someone into a magically-binding contract or Unbreakable Vow, or framing someone for a crime, or et-cetera. Basically doing bad things to people in a way that they can't get redress for it.

A few fanfics come to mind at the moment. You might like them, I certainly don't anymore.

- *Susan Bones & The Prisoner of Azkaban*'s Harry is understandably vengeful, but he really rubs me the wrong way late in the fic by, for example, agreeing to give clemency to caught-in-the-act-Death-Eater Snape in exchange for a portrait of his mother, then immediately violating said deal (by letting Susan murder Snape) once he knows where the portrait is, and casually murdering one of his (former, now expelled) classmates before playing the victim card ('see, you turned me into a killer!')...both in front of the Wizengamot.

- *The Little Veela That Could* starts off so well...and then in chapter 11, Tonks is subjected to solitary confinement, tortured, and forced to take Unbreakable Vows making her Sirius Black's slave, so that criminal charges (that she's innocent of, by the way) against her are dropped.

- And just now, *Harry Potter & The Prince of Slytherin* also started off well, if a bit bashy, but then chapter 27 has Harry threatening to either have Draco murdered or Imperiused (these are 11 year olds, by the way) if Draco doesn't take an Unbreakable Vow, while said Draco is (unwillingly) under the effects of a magical contract keeping him from revealing said threats later.

So yeah, complaining-about-fics-I-don't-like aside, can anyone look at this and give me any forewarning about any fics that'll just get me upset if I read them?


** Hated Cadmian Victory and haven't come across a compelling Dark!Harry fic as of yet. Most of them devolve into Arsehole!Harry almost immediately.

I also find most Harry/Hermione fics are actually Harry/Emma Watson fics. Thus anything writen by Robst is a no go for me.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** With all due respect to OP, who likely bailed at the right time, there is a /lot/ more wrong with linkffn(The Little Veela That Could) than that.

1. 350,784 words, about half of them not really needed.
2. She's really an [[/spoiler][angel or maybe fallen angel?!]]
3. They fight along side [[/spoiler][Joan of Arc?!]]
4. Wait wait wait, this has a soul bond thingie...with an eight year old girl?!
5. ...
6. This is an "M" rated fic.
7. ...
8. <sigh>

Well, it isn't another /Harry Potter and the Rightous Curb Stomp/, by robst. I can at least stand to read this one a second time...if just to remember how bonkers it is.

It /is/ well written, and makes few eye-catching writing mistakes. So at least it has that.

** The Green Girl. (SPOILERS)

I see it recommended all the time when people ask for canon rehashes and I just cannot grasp why it's so highly recommended. So much of this fic actually triggers me and I can't even make it beyond chapter 2 to see if it changes.

As I dislike coming off as ignorant and bias, I slugged though eight chapters of this fic before literally questioning my existence. As I said, I enjoy canon rehashes as I like to see what people do with them. I don't care about information being repeated, the same events happening -- as long as they happen differently.

The first thing out of one of their mouths is 'You're one of us now.' Are you serious? Like, who wrote that fic? Okay, okay... moving on. On the second line, it clearly states that Slytherin hates Muggle-borns. I can handle this. But to have that contradicted in the first three paragraphs has befuddled me.

"Hi, I"m Hermione Granger, I'm a Muggle-born!"

"Yeah, well, you're our Muggle-born now."

Are you having a giggle? Not even half way through the first chapter and everything we know about Draco Malfoy crumbles and he actually wishes to befriend this Muggle-born, something that Lucius Malfoy would go crazy about. Awesome. This will be a long drawn out process where we watch them squabble and Hermione slowly prove herself...

"Theo, we've got a Muggle-born in our year."

Are you fucking me right now? ARE YOU -- okay, relax. So, in the first chapter we realise that Slytherin actually doesn't hate Muggle-borns, or maybe because this Hermione is a self-insert in the highest calibre, and they're accepting. I eagerly await for Draco to be called the 'Ice Prince' and Daphne to strut along and be called the 'Ice Princess.'

Chapter 2. I need a drink... where's the vodka...

Some boy with sense called her a Mudblood. Excellent. We're back to real Slytherin and -- he was punched by a first year... amazing. Then another says the word, but only for Gryffindor? My GOD! And would you look at that, Draco still harasses Harry, despite the fact that there's nothing in the story to indicate animosity between them.

Oh, another canon thing that has been copy and pasted in and had three things changed. $10 Draco doesn't actually go to the duel and does it solely to get Harry in trouble, just like in canon. Yay, I got $10. Just kidding! Harry never went this time to make Draco look good.

And broom scene perfectly copy and pasted from the book with minor changes to make the mary-sue Hermione look good. I also love that they praise the same cunning and then get salty when it backfires and works for someone else. Finally, some eleven-year-old children are present.

Next part. Life is so unfair for the Slytherin house. We hate Mudbloods but love Hermione Granger. WAHHHHHH!

Oh look, the feather scene. I wonder if Hermione will correct Ron when she shouldn't be anywhere near him. Was Charms even a joint class in canon, at least in the books? I need to check.

Just speed-scrolling to skip half this nonsense...

Oooh, a Quidditch scene! I wonder how this plays out. Omg Harry's broomstick was jinxed... what a surprise. And once again, nothing comes out of that information. <furiously taps keyboard> Christmas! And it's copy and pasted from the book with names CTFL+F'd and then managed. Absolutely barbaric.

GASP! Severus Snape complimented Hermione. That's about as unlikely as Draco befriending her -- nevermind.

Pure-blood marriage contracts? Hell yeahh! We need that shit.

Same scene with Neville.... k. Stolen compliment/insult from the Quidditch section and just moved around... nice.

I'm done. I may as well go read canon as it's less cringy.

I do remember that both times I've tried reading it, I did manage to get through about half of the story, and even close to the last few chapters.

It's an interesting (if somewhat overused) premise, Harry's sent to Azkaban after being framed for killing Cedric Diggory, then Love Interest, I mean, Susan Bones, starts to doubt his guilt and starts investigating pensive memories of the event...

It starts off with the targets of Harry's anger doing something to deserve it (Amos Diggory, Dad Granger), and his response is...relatively proportionate (he doesn't kill them), but later on the plot just seems to degrade into 'kill everyone we don't like'.

Arthur Weasley bothers me somewhat in the fic with wanting to kill Peter via a duel for the 'crime' of living in his house for 12 years (Peter runs away and ends up getting Kissed by a dementor), and the fact that Harry/Susan murder both Snape and Justin whilst they're in custody is also a minus...I quit reading after that second one, by the way.
