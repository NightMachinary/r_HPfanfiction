Why do some people like things like Harry X Voldemort after his horcruxes? I don't understand it, so I would like someone to explain it to me.


** Someone asked the same « question » a few days ago, I think (if you want better answers than mine).

I don't see what you means by « after his horcruxes ».

But, I guess one of the prominent interest in HP/LV/Riddle is the trope of the hero and his nemesis with which they share so much (the whole « we're two sides of the same coin » thing). It's not new, it's not limited to this fandom either.

Also, a lot of the fics are either very critical of the relationship and the interest is in the fact that's it's an unhealthy relationship to begin with. Or, they play with time travel because it's very interesting to see what would have become because Harry and Tom are literally the same at the beginning (orphans, difficult relation with muggles, etc, etc) and how they'd influence each other.

To be fair, I don't see how it'd make less sense than Hermione/Draco or Hermione/Snape. HP/Bellatrix is probably just as « bad ». From this reddit, it seems that Pansy/Harry is very en vogue, and I don't see how it's any « better » if you just focus on canon and don't give a chance to the writer's own universe.

I've read fics with Harry/Tom that are written in such way that it's so much better than a lot of Ron/Hermione I've read where the characters became so caricatural that the relationship became literally so abusive without the narrative or the characters realising it.

So, yeah. I don't really understand. It's just like any other non-canon ship, from my POV.

Sorry, but did you just put Harry/Voldemort on the same level as Harry/Hermione or Harry/Luna? Because there is a stark difference between getting together with a good friend and getting together with the murderer of your parents who is old enough to be your grandfather.

**** Haha ! Sorry ! while writing it I knew that it wasn't exactly the way to say it correctly.

I wasn't talking about the « safe » characters with which Harry or the main characters are already friends in canon. More like Draco, Pansy, Daphne, Blaise, Nott, etc, etc.

And like I said, most of these ships call for an AU where either the murder/various crimes are not committed or it happens before anything happens, or in the case of Draco, there would be an actual redemption, etc.

So, it's rarely about Harry, mid war, deciding that « eh, it's fine, let's get into a relationship with Voldemort while he kills all my friends ». (Or if it's the case, the fic will clearly be about unhealthy relation, Stockholm syndrome and/or others manipulations).

If you want to read about a cute relationship that you'd want to have in real life, that obviously wouldn't be the good ship for that.

Anyway, I feel like my English is meeting a limit while trying to explain it correctly/clearly. But it's the same than any other AU ships like HP/Daphne, Snape/anyone, where the relationship is not something for a romantic comedy (does it makes sense? Haha). But the next poster actually explained it so much better than me!

In the end, the difference is more that of Ron/Hermione (for example) being more of a Jane Austen type of stories, more of something realistic, that you'd want in real life. While ships with LV and co, it's more like Hannibal/Will (at least, from what I saw on tumblr), or characters like Patrick Bateman. It's clearly not healthy or as romantic than the other, and you'd want in real life. It's « good » in a literary sense, the interest is literary, it's not a normalisation or anything of LV's moral. Everyone is aware that LV deserves death if it was real life/realistic. Just like, for me, Draco and Snape are terrible, awful people. But still, I understand the interest in fan fiction with ships involving them. We don't always read fiction for relationships or characters that we'd like or even tolerate in real life.

** Some other threads have asked this same question (or similar). I recommend checking out this one for some excellent answers of why some people find it plausible and appealing to read:

- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8uyp4g/how_do_authors_realistically_and_successfully/]["How do authors realistically and successfully pair Harry(male or female) with Tom/Voldemort?"]]

A few examples:

 

*** Unhealthy relationships can be fascinating
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: unhealthy-relationships-can-be-fascinating
    :END:
Many people enjoy reading about explicitly unhealthy relationships because of the intense drama/emotional tension/heartbreak that such stories contain. Of course, this is not something that the reader would ever want to happen in real life, but it can be interesting to read about tragedies that delve into the darker side of human nature.

In those sorts of fics Tom Riddle (or Voldemort) may manipulate Harry through mind magic, the horcrux connection, Stockholm syndrome, etc. In many cases Riddle/Voldemort is written as unhealthily possessive of Harry, since possessiveness is the closest that he (a psychopath) can come to approximating the emotion of love.

 

*** Redemption arcs can be romantic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: redemption-arcs-can-be-romantic
    :END:
Many people enjoy reading redemption stories in which a 'good' guy successfully turns a 'bad' guy away from the path of evil through the 'power of love'. It's a happy ending trope that is common even outside of fanfiction.

This is especially common in fics where Harry time travels back to before Voldemort opened the Chamber of Secrets for the first time. Many people set Tom Riddle's last chance of redemption (i.e. 'point of no return') at before he committed his first murder and/or made his first horcrux.

 

*** Good guys/girls like bad guys/girls
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: good-guysgirls-like-bad-guysgirls
    :END:
In fics that don't involve time travel, Voldemort often regains his sanity/good looks before the plot delves into any hint of romance. That way he more easily fits into the 'antihero' or 'bad guy with a heart of gold' archetype. This is a very popular trope in the romance genre.

Sometimes the fic invents a backstory in which Riddle started out with good intentions before the horcruxes drove him crazy, so once his sanity is restored he 'recants his evil ways', or Harry uses love to persuade him to 'be a better person', etc. In other cases, the fic author creates an AU in which the 'good' and 'evil' sides of the war were more like shades of gray with well-intentioned extremists on either side. In that case it's plausible that Harry would side with Voldemort over people who would want to kill him for being a horcrux, which can then be setup for Harry and Voldemort getting closer to each other emotionally..
