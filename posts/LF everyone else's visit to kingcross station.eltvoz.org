A story where all characters end up in the white train station of the after life.

Like Sirius seeing James and other waiting in train car and runs after them. Kreacher cant board the train until Regulus comes by and accompanies him. Fred sitting on a bench refusing to ride until George comes and they board together. Where Andromeda sees Bella sitting on a bench since she cant board without tickets.


** I know this one. It's crossover with Discworld because it features Death. Don't remember the name but you can find it if you search crossovers on FF.net. it's the one with most reviews.

** Well, Bella would be giving the mutilated foetal dark Lord company ( who is shivering under the bench starkers) and she would just mother her former Lord.
