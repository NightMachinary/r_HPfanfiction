So we all know the "political" fic where Harry discovers a marriage contract and then Amelia Bones or Mr Greengrass become his personal attack dogs because he is Lord Potter, duh!

And that got me thinking. You often read the criticism that it is utterly unbelievable that everyone bends just over for Harry in those fics. And that's certainly a valid complaint, and it makes a boring read. But, in the same breath people often state that as a newcomer, everyone and their mother would dump on and exploit Harry when he is new because he is inexperienced. And while certainly some people would try to do just that, I find it odd to believe that Harry would have no one in his corner.

If you look at European nobility, newly minted, young kings and lords often faced challenges, rivals trying to get back at them, family feuds and the like. But almost always, there were also loyalists who stood by those challenged nobles. Sometimes it was out of a sense of duty, sometimes it was loyalty to a parent or grandparent, in some cases it was choosing the lesser of two evils or "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" or even egoistic decisions based on the greater profit/smaller risk.

I think that the mistake a lot of fics make is forgetting where power comes from. Going by historical nobility, you'd have lower level supporters (towns, baronies, the local clergy) forming a hierarchy. And it certainly was no one-way street because people expected returns for their support, be it monetary, military or political. So when you have Harry prattle off a list of "allies", he shouldn't just expect them to do everything he wants, it should be a mutually beneficial relationship where both sides get something from the other. It could be anything from a favour or a business deal to an arranged marriage (not necessarily with Harry as the groom) or simply a payment of gold. Or maybe it was a favour someone else called in based on something one of their supporters wanted since they have those obligations as well.

And the Wizengamot should have a lot more fractions rather than just a "Voldemort" and a "Dumbledore" block until Harry barges in. If there are 100 seats, I'd expect Dumbledore to have maybe 15 who are truly his people, 10 or so who throw their weight behind Voldemort's public face, 10-20 who are supporting the Minister and the rest are fractions sized 5-10, each with common interests, who vote in accordance to them and whose loyalty can change quickly. And after Voldemort's takeover, there should be a lot more backroom plots going on to limit his influence, even if they pay lip service to him. After all, most of the successful takeovers had a new power simply take over the existing system and guide it along certain paths rather than rule with an iron fist since that was a quick way to revolt.

And I know that this was a history-centric analysis, but considering that those fics try to emulate historical nobility, it seems kinda appropriate. And maybe that's the reason why so few fics can hold up to historical intrigue or fictional ones along the lines of Game of Thrones or House of Cards.


** It's not lordship tropes that are bad per se. It's that lordship tropes are usually a flag for lazy writing.

Lazy writing is bad writing.

The same is true of helpful goblins, Harry's magical trunk of awesomeness, Harry magically learns kung fu/karate/sword fighting/how to shoot, and most of the other similar tropes that are widely panned as awful.

These can be good tropes /if the author spends the time to properly develop them/. If the author doesn't take the time to actually develop the trope, it will read as cheap, and the premise will be paper thin.

Remember that conflict is more interesting than resolution, and a story with no conflict isn't a story at all. In the case of Lord!Harry, have competing factions, and take the time to establish competing interests within Harry's factions. Allow problems to exist, and allow the major setbacks to actually be major set backs. Don't go for the low hanging fruit when it comes to resolutions. Allow the antagonists to be competent as well.

In short, don't use lazy writing.

** I think that you're completely right on the need for more personal power relations - and that much of the support should be from those 'lower down' the rung, so to speak.

It should also be monstrously complicated, of course - with rights and responsibilities that vary from place to place and conflict with each other all the time. People tend to sanitize the feudal relationship a bit too much in fiction - where it's absolute, instead of fairly malleable.

** I usually prefer not having Harry or whatnot as a Heir/Lord with some exceptions. I actually like the Lordship trope since I think it goes well with the themes and the aesthetics of the original series, but, of course, it has to be well made. I just don't generally like Harry as this super powerful almost king Harry because even when Rowling stated the Potters were wealthy after the end of the series, she never said they were like the Malfoys, Lestranges or Blacks rich, just upper bourgeoisie/lower aristocracy-like. Linkffn(Accidental Animagus) does Harry being a Lord really well IMO because he only inherits the Potter title/seat and fortune, and he's even on the lower echelon of the aristocracy since the Potters in the story are only a Noble House on equal status to the Notts, Smiths and Brocklehursts and the Malfoys, Blacks, Greengrasses, and Longbottoms are Noble and Most Ancient Houses. So even sidekick!Neville and punchingbag!Draco have a higher status than him.

I like myself some backstage political intrigue and wizarding Britain really doesn't look to have big and unified factions like the American system. As I wrote in my story: “People in the Wizengamot think about themselves first, their ideologies second, and everyone else never.”

The trope is supposed to be an easy way to make politics and culture front and centre than almost if not every tropes, but it's often poorly executed because most people don't do a minimum of research because they are lazy or actively want to write power fantasies. A large percentage of the community who write also seems to be from the US or at least don't live under a monarchist system in any way, shape, or form and so have no real grasp of what it means to be an aristocrat in the end of the twentieth century in Europe, even if it is only by examining fellow citizens. Even French people and their Republican system would have a better chance of understanding since they still have a (defunct) aristocracy in their midst, while those outside Europe and some Asian countries never had an aristocracy or it effectively left their nation when their country became independent.

On another note, I also prefer when the protagonist starts at the bottom of the high society's hierarchy, or at least in the middle. My protagonist is somewhere in the upper echelons, but he's from France and the political intrigues will for the large part be either in the Wizengamot and Geongragamot of the British Isles and the International Confederation of Wizards, and in there, his contacts are more in the middle/bottom part. He has a great-grandfather representing another country than the MC's in the ICW because you'll expand the marriage prospects of your children to the international scene so as to really stay pure-blood, and MC's contact in the Wizengamot is his father's great-uncle. The uncle has a small entourage among the mostly moderates: the Greengrasses and Fawleys because of century-old friendship between the Houses and Marchbanks because they both somewhat work in academia and past common affiliation (though this is more courtesy than an official alliance). Amelia Bones and Augusta Longbottom and him respect each other mutually and have similar beliefs in certain aspects, but diverge in others. These are five seats in one group, with only three really always voting together. The rest has to be ‘collected' to shift the vote to their side.

In my story, it's also the adults that call on their children to assist them, not the children that take an active stance in politics at the age of eleven and use their parents to do their bidding. I also think there should be a lower assembly like the Commons, but it can (should) have less power than the Wizengamot so that it's more logical because even if you think the wizarding world is antiquated, wizarding Britain won't be solely ruled by an aristocracy. There's an argument that could be made for France and Russia, here, but not Great Britain and Ireland. It also allows to put people like Amos Diggory and Arthur Weasley into politics since the lower Chamber would be elected and the Heads of Office in the Ministry could automatically have a seat just like you would put the Heads of Departments in the Wizengamot. It also allows you to flesh out a middle class and a bourgeoisie like the Goldstein family if you want to play a bit with stereotypes or successful Muggle-borns. I could really see Hermione being in the Geongragamot before becoming Minister.

*** Well, either you go down the Roman path and go by descendence from an initial nobility or you go by an oligarchy, possibly with a census requirement (everyone with wealth greater than X becomes a Wizengamot member).

The founder bloodlines could be the equivalent to ancient figures claiming to be the descendants of Herkules, Alexander, Hector or Lysander. Maybe with some claims generally accepted due to having the heirlooms (eg Hufflepuff's cup).

*** The initial title could just have been conferred in the past - or, alternatively, future lordships could easily be given by the Wizengamot.

For instance, the Gaunt Lordship presumably would have little to no property, but come with political or economic rights, or just prestige. It'll depend on the system the FF uses.

*** This, so much. Alongside the strangely unclaimed or undistributed or uninherited vaults, this is the biggest thing I always question.

Like, what is the use for a title that's so old all of its assets have literally decayed into nothingness? Prestige, perhaps, in the case of a title like Slytherin, but most Lordships would be meaningless.

The vaults, too, are completely unrealistic. Those families are dead for a reason, or didn't die at all! Like the famous Peverell assets/title. That family is dead. That name is dead. All their assets are part of the Potter family, and the Gaunt family. Their most valuable goods were /literally passed down to Harry in canon!/

Not to mention, any body that has titles has rules for said titles. Rules which include "you may only hold one title" or "you may only hold one seat" or "a title becomes defunct once it has been made to he so, either by the holder or time"

So the fucking nuclear lordships are complete and utter tripe. The old titles are tripe and meaningless. the old assets are meaningless, because they don't exist.

I'd like to, for once, see a Lordship fic where Harry truly starts from the bottom, the meagre savings and bounty on Voldemort the only assets he has. Sure, he may be descended from Merlin and Godric and Emperor Julius Caesar the first, but all of those things are meaningless trivia, their titles and lordships and seats redistributed or dissolved.

You had nobles style themselves King of X even if they had lost those lands, sometimes even generations ago. The current King of Spain still claims to be the King of Jerusalem for example. Even though Jerusalem was lost in 1187 and the title was captured by Alfonso V of Aragon in 1441 from a more legitimate claimant when he conquered Naples and Sicily.

Real-world power is nonexistent, but the claim to the title is still there.

Although rules were a thing, there weren't always such rules prohibiting multiple titles, seats, or votes. For example, the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire had 1 vote per title, and title-holders could thus have multiple votes across multiple colleges, though it obviously evolved greatly over time. For instance, the list of participants in 1792 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Imperial_Diet_participants_(1792)]] - shows plenty of repeated names.

Titles tended to not become defunct unless the line of holders died out, or they were stripped of them - at least not in most European kingdoms that I can think of.

**** You may only hold one title usually isn't an actual rule in the real world. Particularly in the UK, heirs to big titles have traditionally been granted one of the family's lesser titles as a courtesy title prior to inheritance. Hell even only holding titles from one country hasn't always been a rule. Then there's also the non-peerage stuff which can add up for an old noble family in good standing.

I will agree it's unlikely there should be a huge inheritance coming in from the believed defunct titles, but there can be more there than cash. Lord Slytherin may only have the minimum deposit to keep the vault/title open, but would probably come with a guaranteed seat on the Hogwarts board, ownership of the CoS & contents along with an easement, and the potential ability to take a Wizengamot seat if you pay the dues or whatever other requirements to get there. Which would make you a prime candidate for a marriage contract with a rich family that *didn't* have the ability to get on the Wizengamot themselves. Something pretty common in both reality and fiction for a few centuries.

Although it it was a case where the main line pitched nothing but squibs (or lesser magic types if used), the title and properties very well could sit there for a few generations. It's not dead, it's just that there is no one who can meet the full inheritance requirements to claim it. So one of the muggleborns could very well find themselves suddenly inheriting a bunch of crap, as could Harry via his mother if she never took an inheritance test.

And in England there was a bout of troubles by Cromwell at the time that may have forced Wizarding kind to lose their nobility, but considering they separated within a lifetime, I would think that most if not all of those families would take back their ennoblement.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10710981/20/][The Guile and Devotion of a Black Heir by StarLight Massacre]]

This one is actually one of my favorites. It's believable in the way it goes about the plot. It also address Pureblood traditions, politics, and Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursley's.

Below is the actual summary:

A chance meeting for Harry sets him on a path he wasn't meant to travel. With his eyes opened, he struggles to control the furious anger after finding all of the lies and hidden agendas. A sudden adoption and unlikely allies work to split him from Dumbledore. With two Lordships and a betrothal, how will the world react to Lord Potter-Black when he refuses to fight in their war?

------

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13172983/1/][The Contract by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan]]

This is actual similar to the above fanfic, but different in so many ways! I absolutely adore this fic because of the father/son dynamic between Corvus Lestrange and Harry. Also Harry wants to become a lawyer in this one like his Grandmother Dorea Black.

Summary Below:

Rabastan/Harry! NO UNDERAGE! The only way Harry can get free of those who wish to use him is to agree to an already made betrothal contract created by Dorea Black-Potter. Will this simple thing change the course of Harry's predestined future? Will he remain neutral or will he turn dark when he learns everything Dumbledore's done?

------

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9825937/1/Bound-in-Servitude][Bound in Servitude by Little.Miss.Xanda]]

I believe this one is actually discontinued... it hasn't updated in forever, but it's definitely gives you a different prospective when it comes to Harry Potter fanfics. It becomes more about politics towards the end.... I would at least give it a read if you like slash.

Actual summary below:

Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

I'll post again soon... I know a ton of fics where Harry gets into politics. Let me go through my favorites. I know I have some that are gen & hetro fics concerning this topic.
