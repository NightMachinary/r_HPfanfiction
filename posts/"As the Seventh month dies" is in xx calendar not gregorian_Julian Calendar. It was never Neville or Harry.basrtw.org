I want a story where they all assume that either Neville or Harry is prophesied hero only for it to be someone else.

Like when all hope is fading this person stood up, fought alongside the the two. someone who doesn't have an obligation to do so but they cannot let the kids do everything. Someone inspired by the heroes and said gave Harry and the other the much needed break and assistance. No one knew that that person was destined to do so until the final battle and dealt the kill shot.

Imagine someone inspired by harry. Since prophesies are not meant to be straightforward and usually only makes sense once it has concluded. That it is acknowledged that Harry did stuff not because of the prophesy but by choice. That just because everyone assumes it your duty that doesn't mean it is really upon their shoulders.

E.G. The seventh month in Celtic/Irish calendar is Beltain. The child born as Beltane ends. So it's May 1st since the calendar starts with November. (Because that day is magic) Or somewhere in October in buddist calendar.


** What about September? It's name literally means 7th month, it's not it's fault the calender's has been rearranged a bunch of times and now it's the 9th month by common reckoning. And bonus points since the name is latin in origin and spells are almost all in latinish.

  She was never the best under pressure.

I feel like Hermione was pretty solid under pressure. From the very first book, even - knowing to use the right spell when they were all being tangled by that vine, all the way to the last book, where she was a fucking badass impersonating Bellatrix to steal from Gringotts. Actually I would say her cleverness was most obvious under pressure.

******** But she didn't know the spell, she panicked for a good few seconds until Ron reminded her she's a witch. And when Harry and Hermione went back in time she kept tripping over herself and throughout the year was slowly going insane taking all those classes. In the third book she also panicky during the appearance of Sirius and Lupin and for a good while it's Ron doing the threatening and wand pointing while she is thinking about everything being said.

I agree she's very clever but I think she has a tendency to get flusterd when something goes wrong, and her cleverness in the future is from learning to be prepared. She ruins Marietta's face in time because shd thought ahead, same with having brought all that shit to live in the woods in DH and in duels she wins, it is usually with spells she taught herself in her own time.

Perhaps one potential solution would be to make Cedric be the hero from the start, just don't inform the reader until nearer the end of the scene.

The only issue that is still unsolved there is how Harry's name was entered into the Goblet...

** Kyle the bat was an ordinary bat. Save from a minor scar on its left ear, it would have been a regular bat leading a regular life in an uninteresting forest.

However, that story would've been very boring.

So this particular bat had a scar. If it had a longer memory, it would've remembered how it had flown away as its parents were eaten by Nagini. In its haste, it had bumped into a tree and gotten that scar.

But because it was after all a simple animal, it remembered none of it and was searching for its prey.

As it flew over a Graveyard, because every bat flew over a Graveyard if it could, it saw so many lights flashing by. It didn't have very good eyesight, Flyte and Styr always made fun of it.

So when he saw those lights, it simply started going towards the source.

Lord Voldemort, the most feared Dark Lord in living history, was casting Killing Curses like it was Christmas and the curses were toys.

Harry Potter, universe's spittoon, was hiding behind a rock, desperately trying to escape.

Kyle, however, didn't see any of it. Kyle wanted that stick that made light. And so Kyle tried to snatch it.

Voldemort's wand turned in the middle of his incantation, pointing the dangerous end towards him. He could've stopped, then, but he was too accustomed to saying Avada Kedavra, and so by the time he stopped, it was too late. A green curse flew from the wand to the owner, and Tom Riddle knew no more.

Do tell me how was it, and provide additional suggestions which could make this better.
