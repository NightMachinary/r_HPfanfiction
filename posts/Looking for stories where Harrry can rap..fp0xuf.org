I just saw that Jimmy Fallon video where Daniel Radcliffe raps and got this idea. I've read a couple where Harry can sing but none where he can rap, so thought i'd ask see if that was a thing.

Thanks for your help.


** There's a fic I remember scrolling past where he's a grunge rapper or a club rapper or something - it's a sub-genre of rap that focuses on dark imagery and criminal activity and generally depraved things. No idea what it was called, but I remember the summary gave a definition of the rap genre and I just noped past it immediately.

If you google 'Harry Potter rapper fanfiction', you'll get a full page of stuff though.
