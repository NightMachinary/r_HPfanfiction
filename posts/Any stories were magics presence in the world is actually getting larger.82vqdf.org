In most Harry Potter stories magic seems to be on the way out, So are there any stories were the presence of magic is getting larger at an exponential rate ?

Like a story were the amount of muggleborns being born starts to double each year till all children born to muggles are magical?

Reasons for this could be a wizard crossbreed a magic plants into muggle agricultural plants that some how made there way into the muggle world Before the industrial revolution and the effects of this only start have an effect in the 1980s. Or mabye they crossbreed Re'ems into cattle and others magical animals with muggle farms animals.(sort of like how a fullbringer in bleach are born when the mother comes into contact with spiritual energy when pregnant with the muggle coming into contact with the magician there food)

Or mabye it's just a case that muggle animals can have have spontaneous magical offspring as well and because they aren't being take out of the breeding pool like muggelborns are the muggle farm animals all gain magic to quickly for the magic world to notice.

Or it could be the case that because of the muggle population boom after the industrial revolution there was also a equally large boom in muggleborns leading to more magic in the world, and the more magic in the world leading to more muggleborns creating a positive feedback loop till all muggle children are muggleborn.

Or you could just go,with the idea that muggleborns are the next step in human evolution and that the magic world by taking muggleborn in has slowed down the rate at which it spread.

Do you think muggle animal and plants can have there own magical offspring the way muggle humans have muggleborns?

Pretty much a any storie were the muggleborn population explodes (leading to chaos as the magical world can't Handel all the muggleborns leading to a lot of self trained magical running around ).

Also feel free to have a discussion over what might cause an explosion in the population of muggleborns in the comments even if this is a request post because if I could I would take this as request/discussion, but I can't.

Well, alrighty. By the way, on this subreddit you can edit the text of your flairs. Neat, huh?

You could pick the orange of Discussion and retitle it Request, or take the dark blue you have now and relabel it Discussion, or just type out Request/Discussion in the flair's text field...

--------------

In any case, causes of explosion of the muggleborn population; one possibility I came up with once tied into how there's so many magical races in Harry Potter (centaurs, goblins, merfolk, elves, veela, giants, etc-etc) but only one non-magical one, humans.

The idea was that magic was intrinsically tied to intelligence (so, more psionic than magic); all sapient creatures have the potential for magic, with lesser creatures (flobberworms, horklumps, all the way up to dragons) being supported by the magical 'residue' that sapients give off.

The reason that the vast majority of humans don't have magic in this scenario, is because of a powerful blood curse, cast by the first and only dark wizard to ever conquer the world; the last king of Atlantis, Ubara (I made that up), who used the original dark magic, which stripped magic out of people and rendered them squibs, to bring down his enemies.

As well as destabilising civilization worldwide, returning it to the levels of ancient technology we know of in history, this dark magic persisted in the bloodlines of humans, causing their future generations to be born without magic; muggleborns are those humans who, for whatever reason (dilution, natural immunity, love-power, etc) were born without the curse present in their blood.

So, the cause for a muggleborn population explosion is simple; after several hundred generations of humans, spread across the entire planet, Ubara's Ravager no longer possesses the power to sustain itself; within the next few generations of humans, /all/ born children will become magical.

*** Thanks and I like the idea of something suppressing the muggleborn birth rates although I would probably go for something set up for the ICW and have Voldemort in his take over of wizarding Britain break it.

I the idea that some magical animal generate there own magic and other use the magic give over into the environment is also pretty cool.

** I think linkffn(A Wizard's Guide to 'Banking') might be for you, because it kinda answers both those questions, it's a story of how and why the muggleborn presence gets larger :)

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** The the backstory for my fic, most muggleborns have a squib ancestor, but a muggle bloodline can develop magic if exposed to it for long periods of time (as in generations), so in places where there are large numbers of wizards and muggles living together, there will eventually be more muggleborns than muggles or purebloods/halfbloods. And it doesn't have to be wizardkind either. If a family of muggles were to settle in a highly magical location, muggleborns would pop up after a few generations.

** I recently read a hp/avatar crossover where magic is explained as the lifeforce of the planet, leylines spread out through the planet, and give off ambient magic, muggleborns are only born when they are born and raised over leylines. Wizards and witches (and anything else capable of using magic) produces miniscule amounts of ambient magic thenselves when they are "full" of magic. (Think full cores that overflow)

So lets explore that; ambient magic/magical surroundings =magical babies. Muggleborns leaves the wizarding world because of the bigotry and settles in Britain. Those muggleborns cant use magic infront of their non-magical friends so they dont use up the magic they produce so they constantly "overflow" and put out ambient magic in their surroundings. The more muggleborns that leave britain and live close to each other, the bigger areas have a influx in ambient magic that will result in magical babies for the neighbors. As this keeps happening for multiple generations, with more and more muggleborns not living in wizarding areas, the more muggleborns are born. This would have an escalating effect as there is more and more ambient magic produced and not used up. I can see this also effecting nearby plants and animals resulting in more magical plants and creatures beeing born. Edited for misspellings.

** Well, this /kind of/ fits. Linkffn (11251745). Linkffn (11761312). Fair warning, this will contain MAJOR spoilers.

[Magic has some very feminine qualities to it, but this has been on the decline for hundreds of years at least. Magic with feminine roots has grown a reputation as black magic for various reasons that are all bullshit. Because of this, magic in general is in decline, the world over. This manifests itself in either dark magic becoming more common, or magic itself becoming less common in general.

Fem!Harry and Hermione (who are in a relationship) are part of a prophecy that they will return the feminine magic to the world, and thus somewhat "save" magic. For example, there are pagan rituals that are regularly performed in the story, usually in the Forbidden Forest, that restore the Forest to its original state. It is no longer dark and decrepid and dangerous, but flowery and sunny, etc.

There is an epilogue chapter which takes place around 2012 (I think), in which it is remarked that Jasmine (Harry) and Hermione are two of the more important people in the world because of what they are doing/have done for the magical communities (though they aren't without opposition).](/spoiler)

The way I'm describing this doesn't really do the story justice, in case you plan on reading it. It sounds a little odd, but it is a really excellent fic. Also, read linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) first before you read The Power of Love (if you do).

EDIT: Why isn't the spoiler tag working?
