What are your unpopular opinions when it comes to HP FF? I'm sure there aren't many unpopular opinions with the very nature of FF being debatable and subjective, but there will be some. Mine for example, is that Ginny is (or can be) a fantastic character. She is malleable from the authors perspective with our only knowledge on her being her spunkiness. Written well, Ginny far outstrips any Hermione, and all of the other characters i have read. A lot of people seem to find Ginny lifeless or somewhat Mary Sue-ish, but I think thats more to do with the (poor) quality of the writing than her character. If Ginny is written well, she provides the exact, thrilling opposite to Harry; She has a large, loving family, siblings who care for her, is very feisty and in your face at all times, compared to a Harry who only pulls out any semblance of self-respect or effort when in a life or death situation, is experienced in dating, yet they share certain things, e.g. Voldemort and being the youngest/smallest.

And secondly, what's your crucial feature for a FF? What does every good FF have to have for you? Mine would be good writing and grammar with believable dialogues; Being British, There is nothing worse than seeing Harry talk like he grew up in an American high school, as the entire series is so quintessentially British it just seems wrong for it to be anything else for me.


** I'm not sure how unpopular it really is, but I don't find the Marauders' or the Weasley twins' pranking to be at all funny or endearing. They were bullies.

Crucial feature(s): Good writing, actual plot and character development. I can't stand fics where:

- The author doesn't know what a paragraph is.
- The fic is full of spelling errors or just bad writing in general.
- The plot only exists as an excuse to write sex scenes.
- The fic is nothing but a weird power fantasy with a Gary Stu Harry. I'm looking at you every single fic that focuses more on Harry's exercise regimen than any kind of coherent plot.
- Characters are one dimensional. I often find this with people who inexplicably seem to hate the entire Weasley family (except maybe the twins because LOL PRANKS).
- I also dislike blatant Americanisms (assuming the fic is set in Britain). No, throwing in a "bloody hell" every other page does not make up for your very American word choices.

#+end_quote

I assume this conversation will be an excruciatingly boring and ultimately pointless experience, and all who disagree with me will defend their dumbass beliefs to their last breath. Is that what you mean?

As for the original stupid brosef opinion: any non-consensual involvement in frightening body modification, exposure to sudden explosions, or drugging with sensory altering substances is clearly immoral, regardless of the final result. You don't assault someone first, then after they're conscious again see if they were okay with having a full contact martial arts sparing session with you.

The only possible exception is still murky. If it is your friend that you're "pranking", and they've previously made it clear that that sort of thing was fine, it is /less/ awful. But still really creepy to everyone who'd have to deal with seeing that sort of thing happen. It is very close to if you came up and punched your friend in a crowd as a greeting -- not okay, even if you both knew it was going to happen. And /very/ not okay around little kids. Which would be the Hogwarts environment.

Pranking someone in private, in your own house, might be different, but is still the kind of thing that should make right thinking people wonder if you are dangerously insane.

Bottom line: involving uninformed strangers in such activities is criminal assault, regardless of intent. No question.

--------------

I can't remember the name or details of the fic, as it was otherwise very meh, but I read one once where a prank almost killed someone early in the story, making the Twins realize that sort of thing was actually really dangerous. Though it was for a dumb reason, something having to do with magical drug reactions or something, it still seemed more realistic than everyone being okay with people randomly becoming birds, or the entire Slytherin population turning orange and the magical cops not being called by /someone/.

Say you're just trying to complete your NEWTS so you can even have a chance to get a good job after (essentially) finishing high school, but you miss a critical Charms test because you suddenly find you have cat paws instead of hands or something.

All because you were doing last minute studying with some (perfectly normal, non-racist) Slytherins during lunch or something and got caught in the blast radius of some strange "prank".

** *Unpopular opinion:* I hate shipping. Not ships, but shipping.

Shipping is this really big thing in the community, and I honestly hate every single pairing. Actually, I don't hate the pairings. I hate the pairings as plot.

There's been this very strange phenomena that I've seen where a /ton/ romance fics don't really have any plot, but are more, "Let's throw these two characters together and rip off every single other fic." Now, I know a lot of people like fluffy stories, and I do too at times, but even the worst romance novel will have some type of plot. A lot of times these are just rehashes of canon, except with some juvenile concept of love thrown in. The only drama a lot of these fics have are misunderstandings that any reasonable people would talk about.

The thing I hate most about shipping though is that each ship has its own tropes, like little sub-universes. Kwan-Li did a good summary of Hermione/Harry tropes [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/24gg4z/may_book_club/cha77fl][here]] and every conversation about ships leads back to central complaints:

- Luna is always a seer
- Hermione/Harry is always far too overblown
- Ginny has little personality as written
- Daphne in fanon is all cliche, with no substance
- Slash is... well slash. Not everyone's cup of tea
- There are very few other girls, and almost none of them have personality

And I'm honestly sick of it. Shipping is what makes people pass over good fics because of the romance in them. Really, shouldn't /any/ pairing work if the story is well written?

*Semi-unpopular, canon opinion:* I hate Harry.

Now, don't get me wrong, Harry is a decent bloke. He can be a good character. Nothing wrong with him. But christ if he isn't more boring than a vanilla wafer.

I think a lot of it is my complete inability to write Harry. I can see Harry in other's works and think, "Yep, that's him in character," but I can never nail down anything concrete about him.

He gets mad, he'll help people, he appreciates his friends, he's very curious, good at sports. I simply hate that he'll never do any of that without prompting. Harry in the story lacks agency for the vast majority of it.

He feels human in the books. He really does. In good works, he does too. I just can't help but feel that he isn't a particularly unique human. Rowling set out to make him an everyman, and damn did she succeed.

When you look at him closely, there's nothing decisive about him. His flaws are general, things any young reader could relate to. His strengths are idealized. He isn't strong because he's strong, he's strong because he represents the idealized version of what the reader would do.

He had a horrible childhood, but does it show? You can argue that it shows in his antisocial, never-succeed tendencies, but I don't think that's true. We just never see him interacting with others because it isn't plot-relevant. He had a good relationship with most of the people in Gryffindor, he clearly cared for DADA and the DA, he clearly cared and wanted to succeed in Quidditch.

I dunno, I think there's a reason that when most people say they want everyone in character, it usually doesn't apply to Harry.

*Crucial Features:* I'm going to agree with everyone else and say dialogue.

Dialogue has to be decent. I can forgive bad prose, bad description, bad everything if the dialogue and plot are good. Nothing takes me out faster than bad dialogue.

** *UO:* Canon Sirius Black isn't a hero, and shouldn't be written like one in straight canon compliant fics. Making a bad decision is good tragic backstory, but it doesn't /automatically/ make a character a hero coming out the other side.

Mr. Black is one of the good guys, clearly, but he is not a /hero/. Sirius helps Harry out some, provides a (poor) look at adult wizards, drives some plot elements, and introduces new wizarding environments. But Sirius ultimately isn't a hero, even at the end.

/Especially/ at the end.

That's my unpopular opinion. Not sure I've ever really seen it said before, in fact.

--------------

*CF:* I can stand horrible composition.

I really can.

I can stand bad pacing and dialog, poor spelling, horrible clichés, and weird AU self-insert characters.

But I /can't stand/ straight canon retellings.

They make me want to murder Ron with a spork during the first Welcoming Feast. I'll give a new story a chapter, or a few thousand words. No more. If I still see boring internal dialog alongside all actual plot developments turning out /exactly the same way as in canon/ then I'm gone.

*My critical feature* is that I need at least some originality in plotting. No matter what strange new AU characters they throw in, an author also has to do something new.

Change something from canon events. Maybe add new stuff in the gaps. Just don't simply rehash what we already know from the original stories. The shared telepathic insides of the main characters' heads doesn't count as a canon plot gap.

Your AU Malfoy is a bisexual half-Veela, half unicorn, dragon animagus? O...kay, with half-decent writing I'll go along with even that mess for half a novel's worth of nonsense. But the CoS events happen /exactly the same as in canon/? So much so that even after Malfoy marries a female (or not) Harry in a Druidic ritual in the Forbidden Forest, everything still ends just in time to save Ginny /just like/ in the original story?

I won't even review that. You get nothing. You lose. /Good day sir./

"Reads" type fics are also stupid and should die in a fire.

*** I like your viewpoint on Sirius; A good man, who still needs to prove himself. He helps Harry, but if you look at his timeline of events - Tries to murder a murderer, goes to Azkaban, Breaks out, Spends a year scaring the sh*t out of everyone in the wizarding world, tries to commit the crime he was punished for, runs around for a year then sits around for a year before helping Harry - its not very spectacular. Interesting, yes, but not spectacular. I think that he is such a well loved character - there is scarcely a bad word said about him in the books by a character that isn't Snape - and so people like to overdramatise his life to the point where he becomes a hero. The phrase "you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become a villain" is particularly appropriate; We don't see Sirius long enough for him to do any bad things, so people tend to try and canonise him in their books.

I dunno, I felt those two were trying too hard to be mature, and it kind of fell flat.

It's things like they are both quite intelligent, both have an eagerness to prove themselves. They're both loyal to someone special in their lives, Hermione being with the Trio and Draco with his father. They both have a firey side that is usually suppressed, and later on, a certain disregard for the rules (this only applies to Hermione some of the time). The list goes on.

Yeah. The stuff that doesn't really matter in one's basic personality or outlook on life, coloring every decision you make around such people on a daily basis.

I bet that turned around quick, once he was spending 9 months out of the year away from direct contact with his racist family, surrounded by positive examples of people of other races.

In fact, with his naturally progressive, moral, and accepting personality -- suppressed by all that racist upbringing, I'm sure -- why, by the end of the first year, I would guess he'd (secretly) become friends with a muggleborn student in his year. That's what happened, right?

Because Hermione was friends with a pureblood by that point, despite knowing about the social prejudice and having to constantly deal with casual, ignorant reactions she faced from that group on a daily basis.

And Sirius Black was actually kicked out of his family because he wouldn't be enough of a racist shit. I'm sure that's what happened to Malfoy, too. Right?

As a peace offering of sorts, and because I actually do like Draco's potential /as a character/, I give you my favorite Draco. The smart, self-improving Draco on a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionQuest][Redemption Quest]]:

Sometime, usually after GoF, Draco realizes Harry Potter is going to win the coming war. This is either because he learns something of the true nature of the prophecy (maybe from Snape), or because he becomes aware of Harry's field of impossible luck.

So Draco decides to stop being an obvious racist asshole, and starts to work on a plan to swallow his pride and sneak into Harry's circle of friends. While still being a /secret/ racist asshole, of course.

This is his best plan for surviving the next five years, as fighting against someone literally protected by fate sounds like a terrible idea to someone whose upbringing included learning the darkest secrets of magic. There is a reason Voldemort thinks this prophecy thing is a big deal, after all.

Executing this plot leads Draco to realize that other people, even mud- /muggleborn/, have people they care about, dreams for the future, and human feelings. And that even the Great Harry Potter has some pretty serious problems of his own... that he's not even trying to work through.

Draco confronts Harry about why the hero of the magical world is putting up with all the obvious bullshit in his life.

Then, depending on the type of story, Harry and Draco angrily make out. Like, a lot.

Ron is horrified, but Hermione sees something of herself in Draco's new ambition to help Harry better his situation, and not to be such a goddamn dishrag.

** There are two things that will immediately make me stop reading:

1. Overly sentimental/dramatic characterisations. If you feature teenage boys in the 1970s calling each other sickeningly cute nicknames and crying at the drop of a hat, you'd better have a good reason for it.

2. A-historical interpretations of sexuality. If you're writing in the Marauders' era, and you are writing queer characters, then having them be out is going to require some discussion of how that fits into the world.

Basically I want things to be as realistic as possible from a characterisation point of view. And then have dragons and magic and stuff. But two of the things that I love about Harry Potter is that the characters are not just fantasy tropes and that the magical world is deeply embedded in the Muggle world, so I'd like to see these things dealt with reasonably in a fic.

Explain in detail how Sir Felric the Fablious attended Beauxbatons, got top marks while establishing a new school dress code, then successfully sexually liberated the French magical world in a violent (sweaty, mostly shirtless...) revolution in 1862. A cultural milestone that eventually lead to a more accepting Magical Britain.

***** There's so much wrong with this. History is not a steady progression from backwards to progressive. A lot of the hostility toward homosexuality in western culture stems from Christianity. You know what else Christianity frowns upon? Witchcraft. The Statute of Secrecy was established in 1689 but relations between the magical and muggle communities had been bad for centuries before that point. Trying to examine magical culture through the same lense you would muggle culture just does not make sense. You can't just take for granted that the magical world maintained the moral framework of a culture that tried to burn them at the stake.

That's not to say that homosexuality must /necessarily/ be accepted in the magical world, but if an author's fic is going to feature gay characters then their worldbuilding should be sufficient to address the issue either way.

****** That's really how history works. There are no glorious savages in the world that are accepting of all races, creeds, and sexualities, no brief shining cultures, or ones that are now and have always been beacons of total grace and tolerance.

Suggesting otherwise would be odd, and smack of thinking some groups of people are just naturally nicer or better at getting along somehow, and that such tendencies are withered in others. Make no mistake, everyone, everywhere is naturally nearly equally horrible, without the betterment of social context and training. Nurture wins that one.

More advanced societies are just that - more advanced. And as all historic societies are at their root about social control, not social library, over time more freedoms usually have to be hacked from an establishment's grasp, including sexual freedoms. Even in ancient Greece, if you weren't going to settle down and get some sons, there was going to be a problem with your family.

Suggesting that a single religion is to blame is also silly -- and this is from the most militant atheist you are ever likely to meet. Plenty of non-christian cultures have BIG issues with the entire LGBT spectrum, both now and in the past. Attempting to automatically glorify a theoretical culture by simply stating that it has poor roots to another, less tolerant one, doesn't logically follow, especially when that insular culture already has demonstrated issues with tolerance.

Therefore, it makes no sense to automatically suggest that 1990s magical Britain is somehow more tolerant than its mundane counterpart, something that many authors assume through lack of imagination or simply laziness. Which was the point that was being made.

I never said there were. I have no idea where you're even getting that idea. Your argument seems to assume that societies are either pluralistic and tolerant or insular and intolerant, and that a society that shows intolerance in one area will necessarily be intolerant in other areas, and that a culture that did not follow the same path as post-Enlightenment western muggle culture will share the same prejudices as said culture.

Again, you're putting words in my mouth. Christianity is at least the justification for if not the cause of a lot of bigotry in the western world. I never said it was the sole cause. I think it's likely that a major underlying factor is pervasive misogyny that goes back long before Christianity. Christianity fossilized prejudices that existed thousands of years ago, though. Instead of just changing the opinions of individuals, change has to fight against the force of doctrine.

******** I always considered the idealistic world that JK created ripe for an interesting thought experiment on the consequences of having everyone essentially equal in power or potential for power.

There is clearly little to no racism, sexism, or discrimination based on physical features, and indeed there shouldn't be. While there is still the imbalance of physical power due to sex, simple spells quickly negate it. One could even argue that speed and small stature are an advantage.

What does race matter to a culture that has likely been integrated far longer than Muggle culture, what with instant or near instant travel and communication? What do looks matter when there are tons of cosmetic spells and even a potion to look like anyone you want?

Really the only thing that seemed to matter for discrimination in the books was political power, bloodline, and wealth, with the former a direct consequence of the two latter. Both bloodline and wealth really only have two direct benefits as well: Knowledge and items. I'd think that before the institutionalized learning at Hogwarts, having wealth, items, and knowledge would enable families to build up political clout, as they would be clearly more powerful as a result.

But the one thing that I can't agree on is discrimination in regards to sexuality. I like the way the Firebird Trilogy brings this up. Gay men like Dumbledore in that universe would be reviled because they would have unrestrained power and their seed would be wasted.

Now, obviously in canon there is no power loss in marriage. However, the population of the magical community in Britain is small. 3000 people, approximately. Clearly magic allows for greater standard of living even for the impoverished, leading to sometimes high birth rates, like the Weasleys. In general though, we only ever see one or two children to a couple.

This, combined with what seems to be a tendency towards population culls due to Dark Wizards every so often, leads me to believe that being fruitful would be pretty important. Sure there's Muggleborn influx, so the population isn't stagnant, but for Pureblood lines population basically is.

I could easily see Pureblood prejudice towards homosexuality. A lot of prejudice towards homosexuality tends to arise in small populations. I mean, just look at the Israelites. A lot of the hatred towards homosexuality in Christianity stems from the banning of homosexuality for the Isrealites. No one could ever claim that the Israelites were a very populous people. It would only make sense for the permanent reduction of a family line to stem from homosexuality.

A Pureblood family, with only one or two children per generation, such as the Malfoys, would despise a child being born homosexual. The child would basically be required to be married, or else a whole line of power would end. It is in direct conflict with the families health for a child to turn out this way.

Honestly, I don't like seeing an acceptance to homosexuality in works where the main characters are homosexual, unless the focus is not on the relationship. The only reason for this is that prejudice creates an interesting narrative drama. I don't mean have Harry and Draco as secret lovers getting stoned or something, but Christ at least don't make Malfoy senior accepting of the fact.

I wonder if this is actually the norm, though. In the books the previous generation had fought a civil war and didn't have much time for raising children. Look at the Black family tree, there are a number of families with 3 or more children. Both Molly and Arthur had at least two brothers. There were three children in the Dumbledore family.

********** That's a good point, and there is evidence that population has been rising after the war.

Looking at just the Marauders though, Sirius was from the main line, which only had two children. Peter was, as far as we know, an only child. James was an only child. Snape was an only child. Malfoy Senior was an only child.

Not a very large evidence pool, sure, but besides the Weasleys there's little to suggest that Pureblood families are particularly fruitful.

Also, for Pureblood power this seems to apply to male children more. Female Purebloods would take the other family's name, so even if they and have children the line still ends with them.

Still, I believe Rowling said that Britain has the highest proportional population of magicals in the world. Whether she meant before or after the war is debateable, but magicals live for a long time. Assuming ~90 years is the normal lifespan for a magical, that's barely more than 10 lifespans since Britain was even conquered by the Normans.

Long term traditions like discrimination don't pop up over night, and I don't believe that the French and Old English populations would be that large. I could easily see prejudices against homosexuality emerging prior to the establishment of England, and carrying on.

Before that, there was only homosexual behavior, and as long as an heir was produced, what rich people did behind closed doors was pretty much their business. I could see the pureblood traditions allowing for some of that on the down-low. They probably had various lovers and illegitimate children as well, who may have even been adopted into the line if needed.

I definitely see Pureblood nobles having homosexual relations behind closed doors. I don't think it'd be approved of openly, however.

The thing is, there's also a very limited understanding of psychology on the part of wizards. Homosexuality isn't a choice, but I really doubt most magicals would know that at the time. To ensure an heir, I imagine that parents would attempt to curb any such behavior.

Prejudices in the wizarding political and social world stem almost completely from Pureblood notions. Poorer, less influential Pureblood families also tend to emulate more influential ones, and in a small community it would quickly spiral out of control.

For it being a recent idea in history, that's a good point. My issue with it though is that Pureblood ideals are most assuredly not recent history, contrasting to the ideals of Muggleborns. More and more openly gay Muggleborn students would bring to light homosexuality as an identity, and if nothing else it would be seen as bad manners.

*********** I could see homosexual behavior being seen as a way of letting out sexual frustration without endangering the bloodline in the way that illegitimate children might. That is, they might support two purebloods of the same sex having relations over a pureblood mingling with "impure" blood. I think a lot depends on their views towards women, actually. Misogyny is an essential component of homophobia, and the wizarding community does seem to be at least somewhat male-dominated, though less so than the corresponding Muggle one.

I actually think that the current pureblood ideals are more recent than people would like to believe. The Malfoys, for example, have only been a "pure" family since around the 1600s, and the way they gained power was most likely through connection with Muggle nobility. Modern racism also originated around that time as a result of colonialism. The concept of "whiteness" didn't exist until around 1700, to differentiate settlers from their slaves. Before that nationality was a bigger deal. It's likely that pureblood ideals were around in the feudal era, but not in the same form. Maybe being Anglo-Norman (like the Malfoys) or English was a bigger deal than simply being able to trace back your bloodline, because of feudal allegiances. Muggles may have just been the equivalent of serfs, later replaced by house elves. (This is really interesting to speculate about. :D )

******** Interestingly, you're actually putting words into /my/ mouth here, as I was mostly making wider arguments, not specifically targeting your position. Except on the religion issue, which was a weak point that you just restated differently anyway. But that doesn't matter. This isn't productive.

The essential disagreement on historic social rights seems to stem from two different approaches to what it means for something to be considered socially acceptable in a society.

In my rough thesis, I was working from a strict legalistic point of view. That if something isn't /explicitly/ enshrined as a right, as in our modern system of governance, then it isn't a right members of the society have, regardless of whether or not most people tolerate that certain behavior most of the time. If it is a right, in this view, it is actively protected by society.

You seemed to take the position that if something wasn't widely proscribed and punished, it represented a significant level of freedom in that culture. I didn't originally consider this perfectly valid point of view. Obviously, many cultures have defacto had more or less tolerant views on social issues at various points, and this type of development isn't a straight line from less to more rights in such a sense.

--------------

You know what? I'm just going to back off on all my earlier points. I think you're right about the social forces at play historically, though you are clearly overstating the case for a small, insular culture somehow achieving advanced levels of social progress by themselves, "magically" I guess.

Ultimately, to suggest that canon Magical Britain is as likely to be as tolerant a place in general as modern Great Britain clearly overlooks much evidence to the contrary. Specific rights follow the same logic.

Even before blood purists started putting people into internment camps, something that didn't cause widespread outcry and violent revolt from the general populace, many sentient magical beings were not allowed government representation, citizenship, or even basic human rights; classes of people with incurable, but hard to transmit, diseases were treated worse than AIDs victims in the '80s; schoolchildren were regularly threatened with both expulsion from primary education and exile from society as a whole, just for minor social infractions, along with the mandatory amputation of an inborn ability; and non-magical people were regularly and casually mentally violated whenever it was convenient. As for women's rights: name one adult female character in the series who wasn't dead, a drug addict (Winky, via WoG), in jail, a teacher, or a mother at the end of the last book.

In general, not a very tolerant or progressive place at all. The racism and intolerance isn't even subtextual. It is stated by the author as a primary theme of the series, along with death.

So no. It /doesn't/ make as much sense to assume they'd be okay with open same-sex relationships, not when the thematic line was clearly drawn (especially in the last book) between Magical Britain and Nazi Germany, via some of the worst social parts of '80s Great Britain.

Nothing is wrong with characters who are any of those. But /only/ having positive females characters from a society who fall into those categories doesn't make a good case for strong rights for women in the workplace or society in general. What people are going to do after school is a major part of the school experience, and no one lives in a vacuum.

But all the single women secondary characters in the story are teachers or inconsequential. Or eventually married to more important characters. Tales of past achievements of witches long dead and gone in History class or from the WoG after the fact are interesting, but not really part of the main story, which is where it really matters.

Dumbledore is the defeater of Grindelwald, discoverer of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, head of the Wizengamot, etc. He is kindly, a little goofy, and likes lemon sweets. Moody (the real one) is an experienced Auror and a cranky, paranoid old man who put away a number of evil wizards, whose trials we actually see in the story. He hates dark wizards and has worked his whole adult life to fight them.

Nymphadora Tonks (Lupin, whatever) is the best example of a positively presented single female character in the entire series. She's young, fun loving, and has a cool ability. But her primary story isn't about being a badass Auror and member of the Order, or even her special ability, but about who she's into and /his/ struggles; her being married; her having a kid; and her eventually dying off camera. Sigh.

What about McGonagall, Harry's head of house in Gryffindor? WoG says she's actually widowed, but whatever. Close enough. She's... strict? She turns into a cat? Great. How does she /feel/ about that? What are her hobbies? What did she do before becoming a teacher?

What about Sprout? She's... jolly? Does she have interests outside of school? Hopes or dreams? Nope, just being a teacher, I guess. The /second/ most important job in the magical world for a woman, apparently.

What about Harry's mom? What were her hopes and dreams? Doesn't matter. People talk about what she did in school, but not who she was or what she wanted to do after school. She's defined entirely by the males she hung out with at various times and being a mother. The most important job of all, of course.

Excusing the entire thing as a school focused story is all well and good, but some characters get background and support details that extend further than that. Except for the female secondary characters, who are all teachers, housewives, or killed off.

Not good support for an egalitarian society if you can't point to any examples of women characters who aren't defined almost entirely by men. Or that men need excuses for being unmarried, like being ugly, dead, or gay. But more on that later.

Not...exactly. Certain rights were enshrined, like the rights of the head of households (always male). Woman's rights were very sparse, but gay rights didn't really exist as a thing.

Being gay /itself/ wasn't a thing.

Being the "submissive" in a sex act /was/, and was looked down upon. Which is why though certain behaviors with boys (very young ones, often) were tolerated and even in some ways encouraged, those were not what we'd call today power balanced relationships.

Bottom line, there were not accepted equal and long term relationships between men. Ultimately, accepting certain behaviors wasn't the same as rights for same sex couples, or even the existence of a "gay community" at all.

There are hard and fast measurements for how well a society treats various people. Some societies pass more checks for human rights than others. Ancient Greece fails theirs for same sex relationships. Soft, equivocating statements about some societies not being better than others only continue to support violations of those rights to this day.

Ancient Greece was /not/ tolerant in this way at all, and yet it is still held up as an example of a good and tolerant society by many to this day. Makes you wonder how much worse everyone else must have been at the time.

You know, the normal gender roles that are reinforced throughout the Harry Potter series?

If people want to look at magical Britain through rose colored glasses, fine. But suggesting it is just as likely that they were progressive on this one isolated issue is absurd.

Let's ignore that I mentioned Greece (We never had to say "gay" was a thing. People fucked those of the same gender and it was no big deal. They were homosexuals and it wasn't considered bad to be attracted to their own gender. You weren't telling me anything I don't already know.) off the top of my head.

However I feel like this conversation isn't getting anywhere and that you are ignoring things you yourself admitted to in previous posts. It feels tedious.

#+end_quote

Again, not what I said. Your reading comprehension here is among the worst I've ever encountered. You are missing the point entirely.

This is about world building. The assumption has to be that fictional contexts are logically constructed and extend in such a way from what is explicitly written. Otherwise, it is pointless to even discuss, as the author's vision was merely part of a "just so" story from which no one can infer anything beyond a simple and literal reading.

It matters if certain things are written a certain way. And because certain things were not said, because JKR's magical Britain wasn't written in a certain way, other conclusions can be drawn.

In a world with major themes of intolerance and oppression, to the point of bureaucrats torturing schoolkids and a government putting people in internment camps without major opposition, it is hard to see why an unsupported "sure, that was bad, but they wouldn't do that with this issue" approach would make any sense.

Sure, make a pure AU story anything you want, but that isn't how either JKR's writing or the real world works. This was my main point, that such stories needed more support. That was the reason for the review of JKR's themes and for the wider historic context I was trying to bring in.

Making laws about not oppressing people is a relatively new thing, especially on racial, gender, and sexual orientation issues. But it is something that historically has marched forward, from no laws to more.

That we only see laws against oppressing people having a hard time being passed in government in Harry Potter, and even seeing laws allowing people to be discriminated against, is quite telling for their society, and suggests that they are less far along than Muggle Great Britain.

My argument wasn't about what is not written, but about people reading what was with rose colored glasses while making unfounded assumptions about what was not written. Also, some counters to misapprehensions on how societies work historically.

#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  Let's ignore that I mentioned Greece
#+end_quote

Let's not, as that was one of the most inaccurate things you said. You might have argued that you meant modern Greece or some other historic period, but that clearly wasn't what you meant.

#+begin_quote
  People fucked those of the same gender and it was no big deal. You weren't telling me anything I don't already know
#+end_quote

What you "know" isn't what I said or what is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_ancient_Greece][historically known about Ancient Greece]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Greek society did not distinguish sexual desire or behavior by the gender of the participants, but rather by the role that each participant played in the sex act, that of active penetrator or passive penetrated. This active/passive polarization corresponded with dominant and submissive social roles: the active (penetrative) role was associated with masculinity, higher social status, and adulthood, while the passive role was associated with femininity, lower social status, and youth. "
#+end_quote

There were specific social consequences to the roles taken in those types of relationships, widely recognized by Ancient Greek society, in addition to the roles being usually segregated and power imbalanced between socially established older adults and relatively powerless young men or boys.

So it was not "no big deal." Which was /also/ not what I was saying. I have no idea what you were thinking I was saying.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  However your mentioning patriarchy and seeming to want to focus on women and backtracking and saying things are "nonesense" that you yourself admitted to in your earlier posts has shown me that I won't get anywhere talking with you.

*** I agree wholeheartedly. One of the reasons Harry Potter was/is so popular is the relatability (is that a word?) of the characters, despite the fact that they live in a magical world. They go through the same successes, problems, fun and hard times that we do, only interwoven with magic. It creates a severe longing for us to be part of Harry's clique, walk up and down Diagon Alley and catch a few snitches along the way. Some of the problems with FF are that that can disappear, leaving only a hollow shell of uninteresting characters in an unbelievable (the true meaning) world

** *Unpopular Opinions*

Draco will never be with Hermione. Bigotry runs deep. He spent seven years calling Hermione the wizarding equivalent of "nigger" and meaning it. Draco may eventually grow out of being overtly supremacist, but I really doubt that he'd grow out of it completely, especially in the short time frame most stories tend to cover.

Snape was an immature asshole. So what if Harry's dad was a douche to you. You're at least 30 years old so start acting like it. You know damn well that he was raised in an abusive household and doesn't think of himself as any sort of "golden boy."

The marauders, back in the day, were tremendous jerks and a lot of the time Lupin seems to be the only one from his generation who actually grew up instead of just growing older.

*Crucial Feature*

There need to be believable character interactions and at least an attempt at decent spelling and grammar. Demonstrating that the story is going to be readable is especially important in the first chapter or two. If I feel like I have to stop to convert what the author wrote into comprehensible English I'll probably drop the story.

** *CF:*

One of the most important parts of fanfic (or original fiction if you want to go that route) is the first chapter. So many people underestimate the strength of a good first chapter. There are thousands of fanfics out there and unless it has already culminated mass reviews, it's hard to tell which one is good and which one is crap. The first chapter needs to reel the reader in. It needs the hook which catches the reader. That doesn't mean there has to be a big surprise or an all-action beginning. Rather, it has to have something compelling.

So many first chapters are just background and setting. It introduces the characters, but there's nothing that really grabs the reader and says, "READ ME!" If you want your fic to be read (and let's be honest, everyone wants their stories to be heard), really think about that first chapter. It's crucial.

** Unpopular opinion: I can count on one hand the number of decent Harry/Draco fics. They tend to be the domain of women living out a fantasy, with the dialogue being almost universally cringe worthy. Also, about 9/10 times the sex is never in the slightest realistic. It reads more like what a woman who's never been in the situation would fantasize about, instead of being what /actually/ happens. There are maybe 3 fics that I've read (and I went through a H/D stage for about a year, where I read almost every popular one) that actually engrossed me in the story and made me believe in the pairing.

Note: I'm bisexual myself, this isn't coming from homophobia. They're just almost all terrible

Required reading: The dialogue has to feel natural. I need to be able to imagine someone /actually saying/ the shit that comes out of your characters mouth, otherwise I'm going to close the story.

Also, I have what I call a "cliche limit" in fics I read. You get three cliches per story, maximum. I can stand Harry going to Gringotts and finding out he's the heir to some noble house or another. I can stand Harry buying a super expensive trunk that has a thousand compartments in it. When you hit number three, that's when I stop reading.

****** That's true. I almost never read a fic with romance as one of the genre unless its a oneshot or its highly recommended in a community

**** Every time I've come here, without exception, someone said they hate slash. I've asked for slash and heterosexual stories with an emphasis on wanting slash a few times before and only received heterosexual stories.

Why shouldn't people ask for specific slash pairings when (if you look at the front page right now) there are almost always solely heterosexual specific pairings requested?

Saying this sub is fixated on slash is almost the opposite of the truth.

With that in mind I leave you with my favorite story with eventual slash, in case you'd like to check it out: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][The Sacrifices Arc. The first book is Saving Connor. Make sure to bookmark as this is 3 times larger than the original series. I haven't finished it because it is so long, i've lost my place before, and also this is the story that first caused me to confront that two members of my family were abusive. I've had to stop and start many times when I became too emotional. The main character is incredibly fallible. The writing gets progressively better. I doubt there will ever be a sex scene. There are very few mistakes. Though if you dislike crying you will want to stop after the first book.]]

I'm on my phone so sorry for any spelling mistakes.

***** I read the whole Sacrifices arc in about a month, and they are definitely incredibly written. There aren't any sex scenes in the first half or more, but they do happen later and they're just as detailed as the rest of the writing, just so you know.

****** Whoops I've been telling people I doubted there would be sex scenes to entice people who don't usually read slash into the story.

**** I'm not really opposed to slash on principal or anything. There's some good stuff out there, but it's a /tiny/ percentage of the slash fic written. Like in general fanfic the percentage of fics is maybe 5%. In slash, it feels more like .005%.
