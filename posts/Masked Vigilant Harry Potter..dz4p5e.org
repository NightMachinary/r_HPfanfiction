Looking far fanfiction like this one. Hary can be anyone Batman, Ironman, Black Panther or custom made . But it should not be a CROSSOVER. Pure Harry Potter fanfiction NO CROSSOVER.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4165301/1/Time-Mr-Potter][Time, Mr Potter?]] linkffn(4165301) Harry is back in time and at some point gets into the Vigilante persona of "The Phoenix".

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][Runemaster]] linkffn(5077573) he's disguised as Death for a bit.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/30/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] linkffn(5511855) in the second part of the story. He doesn't really wears a mask but fakes being a vengeful ghost. (not *exactly* as you asked but, close enough?)

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

** If you want Hermione as Masked Vigilante (actually just robbing the rich, forget about giving the poor) and Harry and Ron as aurors trying to figure out what's going on: Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Very good action scenes, interesting characterization of Hermione after her personality alteration experiment messes up her psychology, but it's not everyone's taste.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
