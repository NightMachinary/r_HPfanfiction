I've been kind of obsessed with this idea lately. I remember at least one fic, where everything /really/ goes to hell after Voldie bites it, in a zombie apocalypse kinda way, so Harry goes back in time to fix things featuring a Super-Portrait Hermione and a kind of crazy Portrait Dumbledore, but I can't seem to find it again. There's also that one where Harry becomes his own primary school teacher, and that kind of thing is good, too. So I guess not necessarily fics where he raises himself, but ones where he goes back and at least interacts with his younger self, makes his childhood less hellish. Hoping for longer fics, but anything is good!


** There's a pretty good one called Double Back on Ao3

  The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop.Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

***** Not the same, but also excellent! The first fic, an older version of Harry physically goes back in time and raises baby Harry.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
