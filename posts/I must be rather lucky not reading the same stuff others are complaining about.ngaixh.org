I've noticed some people are complaining about certain things in stories, as though they're quite common tropes. Maybe I'm lucky in that I haven't found those that others have complained about, or maybe there's another reason? I don't know.

Though a lot of the poor writing has to do with terrible bashing, and I generally don't read bashing, so maybe that's it? I don't know.

Feel free to share stories that you have actually enjoyed recently, for others, if you'd like.


** TBH sometimes i just like to read really bad fanfics because A] might give the author a nice mood boost to see someone read it and B] it can be kind of fun to read something shitty and KNOW that its shitty.

** I don't see it either I'm, mostly because I just scroll right on by now. I'm not opposed to discussion and different view points, but it's gotten to the point that fics i really like are being ruined by other people being so negative. I have enough of that in my life. Fan fiction is a little happy bubble I like to escape to and I don't need complaints ruining that for me lol.

*** I think a lot of it comes down to the same tropes being reused over and over in popular stories. They finish one fic and wanna find a new one, and all they see is something with a similar plotline. I get it to an extent. But the incessant complaining is a little much for sure.

** so the nature of fanfiction is that 80 percent of it is shit. to be completely fair this is largely not a problem to most people since which 20 percent is decent is somewhat subjective and the tag and summary system help narrow that down.

but when you get into tags or characters or relationships is when it really starts to show since your no longer skimming but attempting to judge quality

lets give a quick example

Pansy Parkinson: a named character within Harry's year who has spoken and interact with the main trio and is based on amount of dialogue one of the most fleshed out characters within the student body (not a hard bar to pass admittedly)

archive of our own: 16255 stories containing pansy: switch to highest Kudos and ?...

a story about Draco and Harry's slowburn romance after being mistakenly given the same bedroom

alright first tag to be removed:>english only 14978

remove omegaverse because fuck this garbage trope:14870

exclude crossovers: 14283

exclude relationship Draco/harry: 8496 well thats a huge drop lets see what the top story for pansy parkinson is now

a harry potter soul bond fic to tom riddle with hermione granger bashing as a tagas well as master of death harry

exclude relationship Harry/tom: 8390

top story Hermione sold into sexual slavery (remove sexual slavery tag 8376)

the first top story now is leo inter serpentes which is part of a series which ive never read but it doesnt look horrible

the heir of something or other which is second and quite good but pansy is a minor character

the next 8 stories outside of those you would think should have been covered by the above tags are now draco/hermione

and it is the 17th story ugly: in defense of pansy parkinson which i would recommend is the first story on this list where pansy parkinson is the focal character

draco/hermione is clogging up space 6469 and that story is now 8

remove harems and harry/snape its 6369

remove mpreg 6324

remove alternate universe muggle 6239

and so on and so forth. one begins to question if one will ever actually find a fic with her as a major character not only present in the tags because every student is present in the tags

** Well, to sum up my answer, people are complaining because they are too stupid to don't complain about things they don't like.

And the funny thing about them complaining about things in stories is that they are still reading them even though they don't like them (How would they know about their dislikes if they don't have experience reading few or more stories with them, hmm?).

It isn't that hard to search for something different if you don't like the things you are reading BUT who the fuck would do that when you can trash talk and complain with other people who have the same problem, that they don't even know they have, about reading stuff they don't like or straight up hate?

And the answer isn't that you are evading bashing - that thing alone isn't even a bad thing on its own. What you are doing is actually being an intellectual person and ignoring things you know you will not like.

I'm 100% certain that in few years from now bashing will be popular again. Because popular trends in books function the same way as art does. You have classicism style and after that you have romanticism style and again and again - with few periods of experimenting and doing what the fuck you want in between them. Same with bashing.

At the beginning of Harry Potter fanfictions bashing wasn't popular (I don't know how the first fics looked like but I can say for sure that the plot wasn't about bashing - the center of them was porn stuff. And how do I know that? Because it always starts with sex and so on) and then it started getting popularity until practically everyone was implementing it in some way and after that people got sick of it because it was everywhere and they wanted something original again and so it started going down into the level of extreme dislike from some people.

Guess what will happen next? It will go up in popularity because it cannot go down more than it already is. Like everything else.

(Yes, I'm aware about works that will set a new meta on their own just by existing but that's another chapter, okay?)

Oh, and now I was reading Resurrect The Living by fascinationex and it was awesome (it's finally close to that ohh so good sounding prologue and I'm more than hyped) and also finished Petrichor by BlameMyMuses. Well, they aren't both completed but I doubt the second one will get updated so it's finished xD. I started reading MoD/necromancer Harry again because I simply like it even though, like some people would say, it's cliche.

And do you know what else is cliche?

Your name :) (that's no on you NotSoSnarky but for all the people who complain about stupid shit. I'm only specifying it just to be safe xD)

*** Actually you're wrong. Harry Potter fanfiction didn't start out with sex. Agree that some works involved sex but the point was that some people tried to trick others into reading their works which would be presented as a leaked copy of the original books as people were awaiting them to appear. This phenomenon appeared as people were awaiting book 4 because book 3 ended on a sort of cliffhanger and became prominent as people were awaiting book 5 which was the longest break JK took between book releases as she got married.

**** Actually you're both wrong there was tons of porn and tons of bashing from the beginning.

I vividly recall 2001 as a wild year in the fandom for exactly those reasons.

Edit: The leaked copy thing was also real tho, and might be responsible for getting a lot of people into fanfic.

****** Yeah and the way I remember it is that the 3-Year Summer was between books 4 and 5, and the primary "leaked book" thing was prior to book 6, because the concept art for the cover really /was/ leaked and kicked off the /Green Flame Torch/ rumor.

Either way there was already enough porn by 2001 that the the fledgling purity culture got it's hooks into the fandom, and the 2002-2003 Great Purge at FFN culled thousands of explicit fics from that archive, scattering the fandom, tho mostly to the /well-established/ adultfanfiction dot net.

I'm just saying it was all there. The bashing too, although we didn't call it bashing back then, we just recognized it as an easy plot device to nix a canon ship out of the way for our OTP ;)

**** That's interesting. And to be fair I kind of expected that I'm wrong because I wasn't even alive when the books were coming out and I didn't care about HP for most of my life xD. So I just compared it to which kind of popular mods are created for games in the first weeks after its release. Like Lady D from Village.
