I know a topic like this is simply begging to be controversial, but sometimes you let curiosity get the better of you. I find the idea of someone getting off to the idea of a guy giving birth to be rather scary, but it's not like I'm without weird fetishes, so I guess I should be open minded.

Besides, I'd rather read it than Futanari.


** First, a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/41z6rt/discussion_questions_on_the_history_of_mpreg/][link to an older thread]].

mpreg is pretty weird for everyone, but it's weird in a good way for me. I once was pretty dubious as well, but once I read a few stories of quality writing (or just good writing), the mpreg tag soon became a tag like any other. After so many years in the fandom, I'll try out a new trope a couple times.

I've found that most mpreg authors will gloss over the birth part, though you do find fics that will actually get in depth about the biology behind mpreg. The pseudo-science behind the concept is actually an interesting part for me if it's vaguely plausible. And it's not so much the giving birth part that's the focus of the story, but the getting pregnant, being pregnant, and post-pregnancy that's the fun part of mpreg.

The getting pregnant part is fun no matter the character gender. Being pregnant usually adds comedic value, feels, and a happy tone. Post-pregnancy is great for kid-fics. Above all, this gives a reason for your OTP to meet and have an extended relationship. All the reasons a F/M relationship story ends in pregnancy are good reasons for M/M stories too.

To be honest, I read so many fics I think mpreg is just barely scratching the surface on things to be baffled by -- research "Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamics," for example. A/B/O is strange, but so great. There's also f/f pregnancy, though this is far less popular for whatever reason.

** I like MPREG tons! I don't 'get off' on it. It's not a fetish or an impregnation kink. It's just got a lot of potential trope awesomeness.

For one, I'm a big fan of exploring low-key body horror, so I like the idea of a character coming to terms (pun intended) with something they feel is unnatural or makes them a freak, and then something happy coming from it.

For two, I don't like it when a character gets pregnant and is happy about it, right away. That's not my jam. I like the idea of a depressing, angsty pregnancy. I don't know why. Something about it appeals to me. "Here's a totally fucked up situation, now let's power through!" This can be Fem-preg too. But I like 'different' ways of approaching creation, and Fem-preg is often a Mary-Sue'y tale of domestic bliss, complete with cravings and swollen feet and some tall handsome dude catering to their every hormonal whim. I don't want to read about some other woman's pregnancy fantasy. I mean, hey, if that's your thing, more power to you, but I'm just not interested in that.

But most of all, as a woman who never EVER wants to be pregnant but still enjoys reading the above narratives, with MPREG I don't get stuck relating to the character on a biological level. It affords me some distance to enjoy the ride.

*** I'm so glad there are other people out there who love reading the angry/angsty/not-domestic-blissy pregnancies. Give me panic, give me a roller coaster. It's better than straight up acceptance.

(May be in part due to my age, but I only have one friend who was /happy/ about getting pregnant. The others freaked out! So right now, to me, someone in their mid 20s at the oldest getting pregnant is more likely to not be an immediately good thing, like is often painted in fanfic)

**** Yes! And then even if the preggo character isn't thrilled about it at first, often all the supporting characters /are/, and they cheerlead the whole thing and drag them kicking and screaming into maternal bliss, and wouldn't you know, they were right all along!

And there's always kind of the generic outline that gets followed:

Morning sickness, shock, short period of avoidance, breaking the news to the father, eventual begrudging shopping for maternity wear, seeing something like a pair of baby shoes that brings the character to their knees and they realize they're super excited to have formed babby, employment issues, a bunch of ridiculous cravings, back aches, hot flashes, the father is basically a servant, the baby-bearer is an insufferable lump of hormones, there's a big fight but they quickly make up, a bunch of sex happens that is never realistically as awkward as it should be, and the cliche birth where the father freaks out and forgets the bag or just barely makes it on time, and the baby-bearer screams a lot and curses the father for making them preggo, and thennnn babby and everything is roses and sunshine and fucking cupcakes.

~Vomit sounds~

I can see the appeal of that to other people--god knows I like plenty of cliche tropes that are basically the same story told over and over--but it is just not my cuppa tea.

And this is not to even say you don't run into that with MPREG, because you totally do. But MPREG also embraces the non-conventional pregnancy more than FPREG does.

**** My personal favorite for HP (mind you, I'm far more well versed and fonder of this trope in other fandoms) is /Birth of a Dancing Star/ by asecretchord. It's Harry/Snape. I liked that the mystery of the MPREG was the main plotline of the story, and I felt the plot twist was very well done and fit nicely with the canon worldbuilding while also expanding on it a bit. I also liked how suspicious everyone was of the impending baby, which is just something I always love to see in mystery MPREG, but rarely actually happens.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry Potter fell in love with Severus Snape---and that is where our story begins. All Harry wanted was a quiet year to finish his education, but when the Sorting Hat raises the spectre of Voldemort reborn and Luna is telling him he's going to change the world, a quiet year becomes impossible.

** If you stop assuming it's fetishistic, and understand that it's simply another possible plot device, I think you'll understand it better. Also if you remember that a lot of slash fanfic tends to make one of the characters a girl in everything but name and, to some extent, genitals.

** ...All right, I'm going to dip my toe in, but let me preface this by saying that I don't read HP mpreg fics - only Star Trek ones, so take this with a grain of salt. I don't 'get off' to it. Rather, it's endlessly fascinating to me the technologies authors come up with to make it work. Also, the reasons for it, as in Star Trek, it has a tendency to occur more because 'aliens made us do it' than because 'twoo wuv'.

In Harry Potter fics, though? No, thanks, I don't care for any. I can't explain the appeal of those for you, as it's a whole different ball game.

** It's not something I like, and generally something I avoid, but if I'm reading a good story and it comes up and is explained and defended well, then fine. Authors can be pretty damn creative when it comes down to it. I only consider it mpreg when it's a guy in a body lacking a uterus (because there have been other situations where it's come up in fics and been tagged mpreg, which I think kind of defeats the purpose). It's not something to get off to, it's a plot device.
