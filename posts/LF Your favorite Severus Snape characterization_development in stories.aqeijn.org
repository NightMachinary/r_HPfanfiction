I know that Snape gets some eager fan girl and boys, some of them seem to forgive all of his flaws and faults, and think he's amazing; I'm a Severus Snape fan, but will be the first person to admit that he isn't innocent in everything that's happened and the like.

However; I'd love to read some of your favorite Severus Snape characterization/development; rather he's a main character, or a side character doesn't matter to me.

(As for rather Severus is or isn't the main character).

I do not want Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Severus pairings I tend to be picky about, if the character development, and interactions are believable enough; though, I'll allow it.

(One chapter he's his usual self; next chapter he's smiling/whistling/giving candy to children, or whatever); is NOT believable.

However! If there are any stories where Severus is paired with someone, I'm fine with it; as long as the progression is believable enough.

No Weasley Bashing

No Dumbledore bashing

No Harem Harry

No Super smart/powerful Harry. Harry smarter or more powerful than he is in canon is fine; but make it believable.

Other than that, am fine with anything else. Just as long as it showcases Severus' best characterization/interaction/development, et cetra.

Would also rather it be completed, but if his characterization/interaction/development is great enough, I'll allow it if it's not completed.


** I'm not much of a Snape fan, but I do really like him in /The Boy Who Died A Lot/. He's snarky, funny and cruel, and is faced with ludicrous situation after ludicrous situation, but I found it a very believable and interesting fic despite the ridiculousness. And despite the cruelty and poor decisions he makes, I really liked the character the author develops.

It's Snape/Harry slash, but if you aren't interested in that element it's still a fun and creative story and the slash bits are quite few. linkao3(670548).

** My favorite "Snape is a /good/ bastard" story is *The Best Revenge*, by Arsenoe de Blassenville. One if the best writings of his internal monologue I've ever read, and all the other characters are well-done too, especially Minerva.

** A bit of a controversial pairing, and not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but I really enjoyed Snape's character in the beginning of linkffn(*The Never-ending Road*). He is wonderfully snarky and dickish, with a lot of looking into his head at his deeper personality. The story linked is completed, but its sequel is sadly abandoned, but on the bright side, the author gave it up before the pairing could get going if you're not into that!

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF.

** I have too many favorite Snape fics to list, but I'll link a few at random.

In terms of humanizing Snape rather than treating him as a caricature, I particularly love Delphi's versions of young Severus. For example:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/65865]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/317755]])

The first implies he's incapable of change and therefore of redemption; the second shows him achieving self-knowledge (literally) and accepting a way out. (If you like Debs' version of Snape, I don't know if these will appeal to you, but they might be worth a try.)

Pasi's fics, one long and one short, are also excellent character studies:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/147439]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/256113]])

And here are a few scattered recs for different authors:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3082463]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/502384]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/342011]])

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

** I think the best characterisation I have probably read belongs to Self slain Gods on strange altars. It is gritty, bleak, brutal and hauntingly beautiful all at once. Please believe me when I say /this fic is not for everyone/. It is hard going. Full of triggers but predating most tagging and clearly written by someone with first-hand knowledge of mental illness. However it is simply outstanding, nothing else has hit me in the gut in such a visceral way. It's nasty, but its real in a way most fics don't get near.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

** Linkffn(12481024)

Slow burn, Lily/Snape, updates every Sunday. There are OCs but a good amount of Lily/Snape development and very evenhanded. A lot of World building and some political topics come up.

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

** Two that come to mind are Enter the Dragon (look on Questionable Questing for the longest version) where he is a snarky mentor the dragon Harry and wants to overthrow the government. While some people don't like it my second would be Harry Crow which has a long and well done Snape redemption arc.

*** pov, your link is borked (not that I ever manage to do them that way).

So, for EtD, the original is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][here]] and the approved adaptation is [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][here]] (no need to worry, it's in the SFW section).

Harry Crow can be found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][here]].

Snape also undergoes considerable character development in the [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.413375/][Harry And The Shipgirls]] series (which has expanded into a [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-and-the-shipgirls-prisoner-of-shipping-a-hp-kancolle-snippet-collection.630637/][second thread]]).
