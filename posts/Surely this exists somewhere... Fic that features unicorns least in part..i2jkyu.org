So, while reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/i2f4al/considering_that_rowlings_chosen_a_terfy_hill_to/][this discussion]] someone suggested this concept should be included in a fanfic. I'm betting it already has, as the HP fandom has always been very inclusive when it comes to LGBTQ youth and fics with similar themes have never been in short supply.

So, I'm looking for a fic that includes unicorns recognizing a trans person. Anyone seen something like that?
