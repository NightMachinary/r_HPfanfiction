Can Hogwarts just assign the student's house differently every year. Students beliefs change throughout their adulthood. The number of students in Hogwarts specially after the war is small so it won't be a hassle. This kind of system is ideal for Headmistress Mcgonagall if she wants house unity. It does not create divide and bias.


** The point of the house system, or at least its intention, is to create a place of familiarity at Hogwarts. You're supposed to get to know the people in your house, befriend them, rely on them, and be comfortable with one another. This would be moot if they were swapped around every year. And it would be super awkward getting to know a new set of roommates every year.
