Any fics where Harry funds or supports research or innovation? For example, a fic where he's been stuck in the past a thousand years prior to cannon and he gives money/jobs to important minds he knows from the future. Or a time travel where he helps out people that he knows will have important contributions to the world.

All fic recs welcome. Main character doesn't have to be Harry.

Thanks guys!


** linkffn(A Long Journey Home) has a fem!Harry life for 5000 years and do so little things like inventing magic itself or raising Merlin. All in all a brilliant story.

**** If you read them skip to the merlin arc and check wether they are more to your taste. If not than it isnt your story but those 4 chapters are amazing.

**** Skip to the first chapter with Merlin (I think it's called "Forging a Legend"), if you still don't like it it's not for you.

I was very reluctant at first too, but now it is my favorite fic.

*** Recently read this all the way through. I could never get past the first few chapters -- I still don't enjoy any of the current day story elements. The plot set in the past was great though.

Was also surprised that the Merlin arc was so long -- rough guess, 70% of the word count right now. From the recs on this subreddit and the summary, I expected more arcs. It's only now beginning the 2nd main past arc.

**** Well, it is the rich detail that sets the story apart for me.

We are travelling back in the past. I want some new characters, places and activities. There is a small part of one chapter that is set in Hogwarts, the rest is outside of Hogwarts, and yet I know perfectly well how everything looks like (in my head), which is a big improvement on what you usually see with fics like these.

The Merlin arc is great as well because it shows that Past-Jasmine didn't only live for the future, that she has a past. She met people there, kind people, budding dark lords. She wad betrayed, disappointed, loved, hated, looked up to, feared...

Well, you can tell I like it.

Also, it isn't at the beginning the second past arc, we already have five chapters of it. (Compared to four of the merlin arc!)

***** While I thought the fic was very well written, the plot moved too slowly and I had trouble emphasizing with Jasmine. I would've liked the fic better if it had been set solely in the past. The world building was lovely.

I'm not trying to bash on your fic, I've just read it very recently and I want to explain what exactly put me off about it. It is very commonly rec'd but I guess I fall into the minority who didn't love it.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** Really like the premise but it really pissed me off that the author was so narrow minded that they kept the LATIN incantations, which is bull because egyptian magic doesn't use latin/germanic based incantations Other than that, it's a nice long read
