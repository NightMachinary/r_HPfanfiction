I recently read a story called "Realizations" where Hermione is portrayed fairly negatively.

First she gets a D on a paper -- such horror! -- because she writes three scrolls on the Patronus instead of twelve inches on how to use it.

She attacks Harry because he let Ron be arrested after he turns to drinking to deal with Fred and gets into trouble.

It was refreshing after reading many stories where she is portrayed as an almost perfect character, with Ginny as the EvilPotionsQueen or StupidDelusionalFanGirl, even resorting to poisoning Hermione due to mental delusions caused by CoS in one...

I don't mind H/Hr, but I have read only that for the past few months, and it would be nice to read some good H/G after finishing most of the top-rated SIYE fics...

Any suggestions?

** Hermione in canon is sometimes quite unpleasant. I would be interested in a story that explored her character from the point of view of her dormmates or other neutral people in their year - Malfoy obviously thinks she is a cow and Harry and Ron obviously like her, but what about Seamus or Lavender or someone?

*** Enjoyed this. At first I thought this was terrible, because they wouldn't do such things... but that's like what Harry thinks of his parents and the Mauraders, right?

Fairly unusual, but still pretty good. I feel sorry for them.
