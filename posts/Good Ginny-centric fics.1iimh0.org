Looking for good Ginny-centric fics. Any genre is fine, as long as it's canon-compliant and everyone's in-character. The longer, the better.

I've seen some great Ginny/Harry fics, and though I'm always looking for new Ginny/Harry fics, I would also love to find some with less of a focus on Harry.


** SIYE and PhoenixSong have several that are Ginny-centric. A few off the top of my head (though it's been awhile since I read this type of story):

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1026&chapno=1][The Very Secret Diary]] by Arabella. Definitely worth reading. Probably the best Ginny-centric story I know.

  Be warned: this is not a happy diary. Tom is evil.

#+begin_quote
  Growing up with six brothers and in love with a certain hero, makes life difficult for Ginny. With a family like the Weasleys, there is sure to be plenty of laughter, pranks and fun. Add tears and danger, for with Voldemort looming in their future, life won't be as easy as snogging Harry in a broom closet.
