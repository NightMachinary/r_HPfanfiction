Voldemort can hold respect for Dumbledore for being his equal or more powerful than him or he respects Lily Potter for her will to protect her own son. The Dark Lord maybe respects any wizard or witch that defies him. He wouldn't punish his Death Eaters for minor mishaps or mistakes unless they truly screwed up. It's getting old in reading fics where Voldemort is just a murderous madman or a 2-dimensional, pure evil character.

Edit: His honorable nature can be comparable to villains such as Thanos, Wamuu, or Admiral Thrawn


** "You seem a decent fellow," hissed Voldemort, flourishing his wand, "I hate to kill you."

"You seem a decent fellow," replied Harry, arming himself similarly, "I hate to die."

  “You're 15 years old,” Voldemort was snarling, as Harry glanced warily between his wand and the potentially murderous dark wizard. “You are a child .”

  “Oi -- ”

  “Why are you even here?!” Voldemort paused, grimaced, and pinched the bridge of his nose. Good for him, the massive git. “Nevermind. Potter, go home. We're done here.”

  “Uh?” Harry said, very eloquently.

  “I said,” Voldemort grit out, jabbing a long finger towards Harry, “we are done here, Potter. Go back to school.”

  Secrets of the Darkest Artes did not include any 'side effects may include...' disclaimers. It did not include any warnings about prior censorship, either. Voldemort did not expect to experience major cognitive shifts after age fifty, but clearly, he doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to soul magic and its interaction with teenagers.

** If Voldemort were honorable, this is what should have happened:

Snape: My lord, please spare Lily!

Voldemort: Very well, Severus.

[Later]

Lily: No, no, please take me!

Voldemort flicked his wand and stunned Lily. He turned it toward Harry and killed the boy with an Avada Kedavra. Then he brought Lily to Snape, who went on to swear his undying loyalty.

** "Why Worm tail, where are your manners? A drink for Harry here, please? The poor boy is going to die, is the least we could do for him. What would you like, Harry?"

"Well, now that you mention it, my throat feels dry. A butterbeer wouldn't be bad"

"You heard the boy, Wormtail, tell Rosemerta to put it in my tab," Voldemort said then, before Peter left, he raise his hand, "Wait! Cinnamon?" He asked Harry.

"Yes, please,"

Voldemort nodded to Wormtail, who hurried to apparate away. "Good, I'll kill you once you finish your drink," the silence stretched unwelcomed. Voldemort didn't know how to fill it and his Death Eaters were looking at their shoes impatiently. "So Harry... How's school going?"

While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right? (second in a series, but can be read as a stand alone. AO3.

But that is the basic premise of Voldemort? A childish anagram, a way to lash out, created by powerful, but unpolished mind of young Tom Riddle. Voldemort was never supposed to be a person, it was supposd to be a monster.

I agree that Tom could have done better, but Voldemort is his mangled, mutilated form. I'm all for adherence to EOL or even just basic competence in antagonists, even some moral fiber is welcome, but creation of Voldemort is a result, not a cause. A villain you seem to describe wouldn't, as far as I'm concerned, make the mistakes that resulted in the Ol' Snake Face. It just seems contradictory.
