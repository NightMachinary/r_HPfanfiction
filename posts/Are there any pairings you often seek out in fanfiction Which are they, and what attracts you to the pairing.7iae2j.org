And then some other questions if you feel like answering them - has this pairing always been your favourite, or is it something you approached later on? Do you feel different pairings work best in different sorts of fics? Are there any pairings you downright avoid?

** I've been shipping Harry/Hermione for over ten years. Ah, the good old days of SS Harmony, Delusional Pumpkin Pies... Anyway, I'm attracted to the pairing because I've always identified with Hermione the most, and what gal doesn't want to end with the hero, even if you don't much like him in canon?

But these days I find it really hard to find new Harmony stories that aren't awful. There's a few by Starfox5 and Potato19 that I'm enjoying, but I'm afraid that general interest on writing the ship is kinda dying out after all this time... Anyhow, I find myself looking for quality Gen fics the most nowadays. If it has to have a pairing, I don't really have a preference although I really dislike reading the Canon ones.

*** The Augurey, A Leap of Faith and World Changer are currently updating Harmony fics that are worth reading. Moments of Closeness was recently finished and is a pretty good infidelity smut-filled fic.

I'm not really a Harmony shipper myself, but I find it has no lack of decent stories written in the last few years. In fact, most of the stories from pre-2010 I find to be horribly written (particularly those recommended on Portkey). with very rare exceptions.

I don't know about this great Harmony renaissance in the olden days, I've yet to find anything digestible past Vox Corporis and a couple of decent smutty oneshots.

** I'd like to read more Trio getting together stories.

I'd like to read at least one canon compliant H/G fic in “House of Cards” and “Contractual Invalidation” style.

I'd like to read a good Hermione/Albus Severus or Hermione/Scorpius fic without Ron bashing.

I'd like to read a Harry/Fleur in a non harem setting and with Fleur taking a mentor like role.

I'd like to read Harry/non Ice Queen Daphne fics, although I really prefer Harry/Astoria.

I'd like to read at least one time-traveling Harry/Lily, in which there is a good plot and Harry is trying to deny the relationship.

**** Lmao this whole "must hate ice queen Daphne" has just become a meme at this point. An ice queen persona is just fine, the problem in the fanon with it is that it's the most popular, meaning there's the most instances of just terribly written and cliche ice queen Daphne.

There's nothing wrong with the persona alone, and it's actually an interesting persona, it just gets a bad rep from the countless shittily written fics that have no idea how humans interact or work.

** I've been out of the loop on fanfics for YEARS and a. Just starting get back into them. During my obsession (Which started about the same time as everyone else, the long wait for book 4 to be released haha) I found myself really into Draco/Ginny (s.s. fire & ice) both with a Canon feel as well as where Ginny goes kind of "rebel". And I also really enjoyed Tom/Ginny (s.s. Gin & Tonic) in darkfics mostly. Canon wise I always was a Ron/Hermione (The Good Ship) sailor though, but I didn't really go out of my way to find them.

What I loved about Draco/Ginny was that I felt like it was a non canon ship that could actually believably happen. Ginny was/is such a strong and vibrant girl. Outgoing and didn't take crap from anyone as she was growing. She could hold her own against Draco. Especially as the books progressed I believe in HBP there was a line on the train where I think even pansy says Draco found her (ginny) attractive or something. Ginny, while poor and "dirtied" still was pureblooded so you could keep Draco still a bit prejudiced and it could work out. I just figured they could complement each other in ways.

Tom/Ginny was because I was like 13 and angsty and it was just an intriguing idea that maybe when Tom possessed Ginny she actually got a taste for the "dark side" So to speak and she always tried to suppress it but after months of pouring her heart out to him she still loved him before she knew who it was etc.

** I like Harry/Draco fics. I always fall for the enemy to lover-trope (no matter what fandom, it's my absolute favourite) and there are a lot of good fics out there for this pairing. It's difficult to get right but for some reason a lot of people have succeeded in making it believable. I prefer to read slash before het, too, so that's a double bonus.

*** I was actually just speaking with my room mate about the Drarry pairing tonight, and how disappointing we find it, as a rule. I think when you look at the ships that are the most popular within their fandoms - whether under the "slash" or the "het" label - you are often going to be bombarded with very simplistic tropes and often simplistic ideas of characters. I don't actually have any objection to the ship at all, and there's going to be some Drarry as a primary ship in my long series, as well as a piece I'm currently writing as a Secret Santa gift, but I've never really found any Drarry fics that are especially compelling.

I suppose there are some issues I have with the popular fics - firstly, Draco and Harry have very defined voices and accents, and they speak very differently to one another. They also have a lot in /common/, which I think a lot of people overlook - and not in the sense that they mirror each other or represent each other, or form two sides of the same coin: in reality, the character who bests parallels Draco Malfoy in that way would likely be Ron Weasley, not Harry. Draco and Harry are each very stubborn, very sarcastic, natural leaders, prone to isolation when they're under stress, and with complex histories of trauma and emotion. They would not easily slip into a relationship with one another, even with their canonic enmity laid aside.

Even if Draco and Harry looked past their issues with each other (and I neither think they could or should, unless the book spans a decade), they would bite at each other, exchange harsh words, and likely argue often. Perhaps I should blame Tumblr for the voracious commonality of the stupid tropes children think of as clever dialogue, such as everyone at Hogwarts "knowing" Draco is interested in Harry and mocking him openly about it, or anything similar.

I don't know. It's one of those pairings I think is kind of boring in the way it's presented, but that I think /could/ be decent - I'm just often disappointed when I try to give it a go.

Especially given that every single Draco/Harry fic, it seems, needs to bash Lucius Malfoy to kingdom come, and I don't care for that sort of nonsense at all. He's a horrible man, but he's by no means an abusive father.

I don't care if it's Angelina, Alicia, Katie or Demelza, if "they both like Quidditch" was enough explanation for the canon pairing then there ought to be stories with one of the other chasers as romantic interest as well. I'm not even looking for Quidditch career stories. But sharing a lot of time with girls and seeing them in underwear, if not outright naked should spark something.

** Harry/Tonks (I'm reading Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) and am loving the way that Tonks is being written.

I also agree with what someone said: A Harry/Non Ice Queen Daphne story would be great to read.

A Harry/Fleur story with no character bashing, would be good as well. In a non harem setting as well.

Neville/Ginny; maybe something happens during their supposed seventh year where they fall in love under harsh times, being each other's shoulder to lean on.

Harry/Hermione/Ron, that is the only way I can read Harry/Hermione without wanting to stop. I'd like a more plot related story for them with them being as in character as possible.

A Seamus/Lavender after the war that shows the after affects of what Lavender went through with the attack of Greyback would be great to see. Admittedly a popular pairing but I've never read this idea before.

A Hermione/Ron story that deals with them having PTSD after the war, with Harry as a minor character or reoccurring character, as long as he's not a major character could be cool to see. I'd just like to see them getting along with Harry being around.

A Minerva/Severus friendship story that deals with their time at Hogwarts could be cool to see. I've always liked the idea of the two of them complaining together about people like Quirrell, Lockhart, Dumbledore, Malfoy ect extra. And I do mean friendship, not romance.

A Blaise/Parvati story involving their time during their seventh year and possibly beyond would be cool. I don't know why but I like the pairing and it's sad that it's not written a whole lot.

A Padma/Anthony story involving them after the war would be cool, like Parvati/Blaise I don't know why I ship it I just do.

A Luna/Draco story where Draco is trying to make amends to the people he hurt or was involved with during the war. I normally don't like shipping a character with a ton of other characters, but Luna is just one of those characters I can see working well with a lot of other characters.

A Luna/Severus friendship story. After reading: linkfinn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know-- Yet I Live and I Love) I want to read more Luna/Severus friendship stories.

Harry/Ron, Harry/Cedric, Harry/Neville, Harry/any male or female oc standin, Neville/Luna, Neville/Hermione, Neville/Ron, Neville/any male oc standin. I like to imagine Neville as bi with a gay slant.

Dumbledore/Doge, Dumbledor/Grindelwald, Colin/any male character. Cause Colin is obviously gay, his cannon crush on Harry makes him bi at the very least

Remus/Tonks, Remus/Sirius, Remus/Sirius/James. My fannon is that Remus and Sirius did some experimenting in their youth, that James might have gotten in on if I'm feeling frisky. I'm leaving out Peter, but my fannon is that he wasn't in to the homoerotic things that the other three could have gotten up to, and that's the start of how they began to drift apart in their later school years.

Draco/Pansy, Draco/Daphne, Draco/Astoria, Draco/Blaise.

The kind of pairings that I avoid, and nope out to fics if they're a surprise or even hinted at, are between characters that canonically don't get along, or are outright enemies.

Hermione/any death eater, or death eater sympathizer, Draco/any order of the phoenix or any order of the phoenix sympathizer or muggle born, Snape/anyone but Lily.

*** I'm very picky about pairings, to be honest - not because I favour ship in particular most of the time, but just because I like certain dynamics to be explored in all of their complexities, and I prefer stuff to be /character-focused/ as opposed to /ship-focus/, which I used to assume were the same thing and then became gravely disappointed.

The ships I enjoy most in the fandom are some of the most reviled, but also some of the most /terribly written/ as a result of the way characters are either romanticized or flattened out. My favourite character in the HP universe is Lucius Malfoy, and I have a lot of affection for Lucissa, which is often made a bit too saccharine for my liking, and then I do enjoy Harry/Lucius, but I think it has to be done in the nasty, slightly self-loathing way it deserves to be, on Harry's part.

And then Harry Potter/Severus Snape I would theoretically enjoy, but I think the only fics I've enjoyed enough to recommend have still fallen very flat for me in terms of Severus' characterisation, and I just can't abide by somebody making him too romantic or Darcy-esque.

The list of pairings I avoid is hideously long, though: as I said, picky.

I honestly got bored of the constant Gryff/Gryff pairings even before I got so fed up with Hermione that I filter her out of the search options if I get the urge for a fic but that's rare nowadays, I dislike her to a point that even if I love the fic the moment I see them hooking up I give up on the fic. I also dislike Honks fics because the age difference seems to massive when Harry is 16 or less.

I liked Fleur a lot for a while but Harry is usually his usual wimpy self or a budding dark lord and they just don't mesh with Fleur in my opinion. I really wanted more Harry/Daphne/Susan fics but they are virtually nonexistent and I honestly can't tell what I even find appealing in that pairing. Anything that has to do with Snape with a student is dead to me, then again most things with Snape are dead to me so that's not fair.

Hasn't always been the pairing that I've searched for, but it is currently the one that seems the most fun to read at the moment, I believe before this pairing I read quite a bit of Harry/Tonks

I only tend to avoid stuff featuring Ginny and Slash in HP fanfic. I like slash in other stuff, but I can't seem to find myself liking any of the pairings. As for Ginny I just never had enough of an interest in her character to want to explore her further.

It's not the most /normal/ of pairings, and I've never found a good fic that can fully satisfy my craving for it, but yeah. I've never really seen Sirius as anything approaching a father figure, or even an uncle. But a friend that would let you crash at his place for as long as you need? Totally.

The thing is, I despise /slash./ Not gay sex or relationships - I'm bisexual myself - but I loathe fics that have an overly sweet, "idealized" gay relationship. "Love triumphs," "Love redeems," and all that cuddly stuff... /blech./ I need far more testosterone and adrenaline than that.

*** Yeah, I'm with you, although my actual ship preferences are a little different.

I really dislike the "slash" label 'cause it just has these connotations of a woman - usually a young, straight woman - writing it, and finding the gay relationships to be "so cute" or whatever. On [[/r/fanfiction]], a while back, there was a thread where people were talking about why they liked certain gay ships, and enough people said "well, why would I want the character I like interested in another woman?" and "I just find the idea of two men together sexy" that I ended up just not looking on the subreddit for a while, haha.

I don't claim to be a man's man - I'm an actor, and I'm flamboyant, and I /do/ like clothes and drag and pop music, so I'm pretty much a walking stereotype - but there is a difference between how men actually act toward one another and the seme/uke nonsense one sees in a lot of fanfic.

**** I'm with you regarding the "cute" gay relationships. I've yet to observe one like that in real life. Most of my gay friends that are married are just like two dudes hanging out together--playing video games, riding motorcycles, going to the theater--just regular stuff. Nothing especially cute about any of it and nothing out of the ordinary except it's two dudes. I mean, if a gay couple is going to see Britney Spears, there's a likelihood that they'll /both/ be excited rather than only /one/ of them being excited if a straight couple is going to see her, but that's pretty much it from what I can tell. :D

***** Yeah, and it's a wee bit creepy to be tokenized like that, haha. I've had my share of homophobic incidences, fights, assaults, et cetera, but it's always people implying my relationships are inherently "adorable" that make my skin crawl. Somehow, it's so much more pervasively horrible than violence.

****** It's like the South Park episode when all of these girls started making yaoi art of Craig and Tweak. I'm playing the Fractured But Whole South Park game and there's a mini-game where you collect the pictures of them you see around town. I've yet to see a relationship that's like that in real life!

**** I'm the same - despite being a gay male, I give slash fics a wide berth and read almost exclusively straight relationships. I think the only slash fic I genuinely love in the HP fandom is Turn by Sara's Girl, which managed to snag me with its good writing and a fun premise. But even that one is obviously written by a woman, so yeah... Slim pickings for real fags.

** harryxfem!voldemort or voldemortxfem!harry. i just like the idea of antagonistxprotagonist, regardless of series. and since an overwhelming majority of slash stories are just teenage girl fantasy wank with excessive angst and drama, i usually prefer the straight stories over slash.
