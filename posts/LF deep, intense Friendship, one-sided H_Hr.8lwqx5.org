Dont know, how to describe it. I want to know, if a Fic like this exist: It first starts after the Battle of Hogwarts. If Harry dates Ginny, than not for a long time. Maybe they quit mutual. Ron and Hermione might be a little longer "together", but at some time they split too. During some Circumstances, Harry and Hermione develope a deep and intense Relationship (i would call it "just Friendship". They are NOT dating at this Point or having romantic feelings, even if the Reader might suggest it from the text). Harry possibly shares his Bed with the one or the other Woman/Girl. Hermione might stay on the "dating" trip (or she dives completely into her Work/career). However, as their Friendship deepens, Hermione finds herself attracted to Harry and questions her feelings. She is having a Crush on him atleast, but convinced that she hasnt any deeper feelings for him. Harry on the other hand grows attracted by Hermione, but not in a romantical, but in a sexual way.

Allright so any of the above mentioned is just the "Guideline" to THIS particular event:

*Harry and Hermione were standing in Front of each other. Harry was cupping her Face with his Hand and the looks, they shared was intense. Harry gaze drifted to her Lips and he was grazing them with his Thumb.

"Do you love me?" Hermione asked and he could see her insecurity in her Eyes...and something more. Was it Arousal?

"I dont know. I dont know how it feels, to be in love with someone. All i can say right now is, that i have desire for you. I want you." He was looking at her Lips against and felt the Urge to Catch them with his and steal her Breath in an intense Kiss.

"What do you want to do?" she asked. It was almost like a Permission to do what he intended to. Again he was looking in her Eyes.

"That depends on what you want." The next thing he know was that Hermione was taking his Face with her Hands and putting her Lips with his. It was a passionate Kiss. No careful steps or proceedings with Caution. This was pure desire. And as they were Kissing, as if they needed it as urgend as breathing, they started in take their clothes off, piece by piece.*

So there we have our Love Making scene. Actually i imagined Harry to take the initiative, somehow its now Hermione. The Conversation doesnt have to happen exactly like that (i dont know, if something like that exist at all), but should serve as a rough happening. I find the "i dont know, how it feels to be in love" essential, because it eliminate his Love for Ginny (which was nothing more than a Crush or a sexual desire. Atleast in this Fic) and underlines that Harry really doesnt know, how it feels to love someone (as a Partner). He just knows how a Crush feels like.

The Description at the Top doesnt need to happen. It is just something i can imgaine as a Path too the mentioned Event. What more important for my request is the said Event. Hermione might have fallen for him, but even in this Situation she isnt completely sure, but she is undeniably attracted to Harry. This goes Vice Versa with Harry but he is just sexually attracted to her and unsure about deeper feelings for her. He will discover them at some point after their „session“. Hermione might be ok with this, even if it means that both are just „friends with benefits“.

I posted it in the Harmony subreddit, but i was told that this Post is hard to read/understand. I cant agree with that, as i made explanations about which passage is important to me and what is "just the path", that leads to it. Maybe some people can help me here.


** What you ask for is super specific... This fic here may push some of those buttons:

But really it sounds like you need to write your own fic

#+begin_quote
  Post-Hogwarts. One year after the Victory over Voldemort, Hermione Granger is finally graduating and Harry Potter is worryingly restless. What follows is a summer of mutual attraction, new discoveries and a misplaced 'friends with benefits' deal that will alter the most important relationship that they have.
