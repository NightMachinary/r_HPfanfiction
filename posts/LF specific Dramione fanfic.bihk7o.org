Ok so basically it's in an AU where old voldie wins the war, and mud bloods are sold as slaves. It starts off with Lucius taking Draco to buy a slave for his birthday, and Draco complains about how stupid and sick it is. He recognizes Hermione and chooses her. Draco and Hermione come up with the alias of “kitty” or “kitten” for her. Draco treats her surprisingly nice, and they end up falling in love. Towards the end, Voldemort and his minions decide to give poor Draco the mission of killing her (shocker!). It gets kinda fuzzy after that, but I remember that they go out and have fun in the muggle world and Draco jumps into a fountain, and they have sex later? Then they get into a quarrel and Hermione stabs herself in the arm to show that her blood isn't muddy or something? It was left unfinished and it was updated last in 2013 or something lol. Any help in finding it would be appreciated. It was one of the first fics I'd ever read, so it's pretty special to me. Thanks!
