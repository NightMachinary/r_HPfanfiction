What if Harry is everything their parents wanted his sibling to be. Maybe they gave Harry to the Dursleys or put him in an orphanage or he's neglected as the "disappointing child" or he was thought a squib... whatever it is Harry and the Potters aren't exactly 'close' by any stretch of the imagination.

The sibling gets special training, the Invisibility Cloak, the Marauder's map, love and affection... they have all the keys to be truly successful but unfortunately none of those keys fit in the locks.

Everything their parents worked for years to try to foster falls apart immediately after the wcwl starts Hogwarts.

Harry goes to Gryffindor, the sibling goes to Slytherin. Harry is top of all his classes, the sibling barely bothers to show up to their classes. Harry is popular with people from all houses, the sibling has only a friend or two and a bunch of 'fans'. Things like that.


** THat would be an interesting story. There aren't any i've seen like that. :(

*** Isn't that how most wbwl fics end up anyway? Usually Harry is a dark, broody Slytherin and the sibling is the light version of Malfoy but the result is the same... Harry is a prodigy, the sibling is a dickhead.

**** yeah, I was trying to read some ages ago and it's like

Snape: Harry bad

Harry: I'm really smart haha fuck you snape

everyone claps and woops and yells

hirry: But bruh I'm the boy who lived

everyone booed hirry for he was not the boy who lived, harry had told them so. Snape stabs himself in embarassment and voldemort dies because he is bad. Also there are goblins who did some hadrian stuff.

***** I honestly can't take seriously a story where an alive James and Lily abandon Harry to the /Dursleys/ and then don't even bother to check up him due to a sibling. That would make them instant assholes and just bad people all around.

Heck, it would be interesting to see one where they thought him a Squib so they kept his sibling, and then the Dursleys actually cared for him as a middle finger from Petunia to Lily, and then it turns out he is a wizard but gives zero fucks about his birth family and prefers to do stuff as a muggle-born or something.

*** Yeah it's 'child'. I sometimes use it to show I don't care if the sibling is male or female.
