I was thinking about the Animagus in the Hp universe (especially Peter Pettigrew), and I was wondering several thing about them :

- /Do the animal form always share the human characteristics?/ We all know how Pettigrew lost a finger, and that's how Sirius could identify him as Scabber, or how Sirius is emaciated in both his form in Poa. But is it always the case?\\
  For example, if a wizard lose a finger, will he "keep" this injury while transforming into a Beetle, or a Snake, something that don't have an "equivalent" part into its body?
- /Do they keep their animal injuries while turning into human?/ For example, if Sirius decide to fight a Werewolf while being a dog. While he wake up the next morning with broken ribs or not? While we are at it, Sirius said that the Maraudeurs were sage to hang out with Moony while on animal form. Is it because the werewolf does not want to bite animals, or is it because even bitten while being a dog, Sirius will not turn into a werewolf (and what happen if a Animagus is bitten by a werewolf while in human form? Does he not become a werewolf, loose his animal form? Something else?).
- /Can Peter still transform after Voldemort return?/ After the resurection of Voldemort, I don't think we ever see Peter using his Animagus form anymore. Is it because the while Order know about it (making it almost useless to spy), or is it because the fake hand of Voldemort stop him from transforming? It seems in character for Voldemort to "punish" Peter by taking his form from him, but I'm not sure it's what he did in Canon.

Si, what do you think about it?


** so if you transform into a starfish, could you regenerate lost limbs completely?

** u/ForwardDiscussion:
#+begin_quote
  Each Animagus bears an identifying mark on their animal form that is caused by something on their human body. This may be a physical trait like dental structure, or an acquired trait such as glasses. For example, both Minerva McGonagall and Rita Skeeter have markings on their Animagus forms caused by their spectacles. If an Animagus undergoes a major physical change, such as the loss of a limb, their animal form will also reflect that, as in the case of Peter Pettigrew missing a finger.

That's an uncited entry in the Harry Potter wiki, so take it with a grain of salt.

** I think the answer to all is yes. It seems very much to be that one's animagus form is simply the answer to “what if this person was this animal”. So injuries carry over.

In the specific case of Pettigrew, my hypothesis would be that the arm changes with him.
