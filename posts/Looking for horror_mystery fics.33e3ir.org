Looking for well-written horror/mystery fics. Good characterizations. Unique interesting plot with minimal clich√©s. Era doesn't matter.

Don't care about pairings but won't mind if they're there.

(With the exception of dramione. Absolutely no dramiones)

I don't think the ending is at all what it appears to be, and I love it for that.
