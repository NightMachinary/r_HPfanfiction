After seeing another pet peeve thread with some user's decrying "Mugglewank" in the fics they've been coming across while others defended it or decried "Wizardwank" in return, I decided to put together a little survey to get some data on what the subreddit as a representative portion of the fandom thinks.

[[https://forms.gle/3bMc9FXvCJhYpU3XA]]


** I don't think the survey is phrased very well. It asks you to rate whether wizards or Muggles are better at X but it does not ask you how important X is (if at all).

E.g. Physics. Do I think wizards have knowledge of physics? No. Physics is a Muggle discipline which is not taught at Hogwarts.

Do I think physics is a true description of the universe in the HP world? No, any non-magical description of the universe is fundamentally wrong and the description of the universe taught at Hogwarts is superior.

Therefore the fact that wizards are ignorant of physics is not a weakness but rather an advantage. They are in possession of a superior description of the universe to that provided by physics - magical theory.

Since the survey seems to assume that physics has worth, I will respond that wizards have better knowledge of it even though they don't. This will more faithfully reflect my view that wizards have the advantage in this area, even though their advantage comes from the fact that they have a superior alternative to physics. But ideally the survey would allow you to give weighting to the topics asked about.

*** Yeah, many of these questions are utterly irrelevant. Do magicals have any real understanding of physics, chemistry, or biology as we know them? No. Does magic obey the observable laws of the universe as we know them? Also no.

None of the scientific disciplines matter when the world operates on the principals of sympathy, contagion, and symbolism.

**** Engineering a disease may not be an option, but they could alter the lycanthropy curse, either on purpose, or accidentally while trying to cure it.

Instead of controlling the wolf mind but allowing the transformation like Wolfsbane potion does, they could prevent the transformation but still allow the wolf's mind to take over. Portkey a bunch of infected people into populated areas and, if they're still infectious without the transformation, you'll have an army of fast, aggressive zombies every full moon. Maybe even 24/7 if you can tweak the magic just right.

Plus you can blame their behaviour on drugs or a disease or something so there's no obvious breach in the Statute of Secrecy and the wizarding world can claim plausible deniability.

You might think a stronger shield spell could protect against a high powered rifle, and a different spell could protect against chemical weaponry, but that high powered explosions can only be avoided through apparation. The question doesn't give quite enough flexibility in answering that fully when crammed all together like it is.

** This was interesting to think about, particularly the weapons / fighting section. I've thought about it before, and seen it done in a few crossover fics, about how the average protego would stand up to varying firepower, which leads to discussion that neither really is infallible. Its def a great back and forth though on how much power it would take on either side to get a jump on the other, be it one-on-one or large scale.

From what I've seen in fics, I would like wizards to have more physical combat training as I think they rely too heavily on their wands to protect them. Literal pieces of wood that could get snapped or easily fumbled out of hand, be it by force or a surprise expelliarmus

** Nice survey, but I think you missed the point with all the combat questions.

They don't matter at all. Between Muggle-Repelling Charms and Mind Control, the odds that there would be a fight are slim to none. To put it in fantasy terms: Your far too focused on damage, and miss the Control spells. (Also, there was no option for "I believe a shield spell will protect against... for a time, not forever")

*** Thanks for the feedback. There's definitely room for improvement with the wording of some of the questions, as well as some missed questions. I put 90% of the survey together at 3 in the morning last night, and should probably have refined it for a few days before posting it.

​

On the combat questions I went with the assumption that people would answer according to their thoughts on the subject, eg wizards would "win" the fight in small group combat by putting up muggle repelling charms. I think there could be more explicit description of what constitutes a win, rather than what is currently written, which might imply the question is all about damage as you say. I think that ill-defined win condition is especially relevant on the country and world wide scale questions, as reaffirming a strong level of Secrecy on the part of the magical people would most likely be considered a win but them more so than taking over the entire world.

​

I got a little worried that the various permutations of combat questions was making the section too long and the last few questions definitely should have been spread out to handle a lot more options for people to choose from.

​

Depending on reception of the survey I might make an updated version to post again in six months or so to account for all the great feedback on the question design.

**** Possibly however canon is not clear that all muggles are susceptible to mind magics which we know can be resisted. Plus if it was so easy to stop attacks then why wasn't that method used instead of passing the Statute of Secrecy and hiding from the mundanes?

I think it boils down to whether you believe the Statute of Secrecy was passed to protect the wizarding world from the mundanes (which is what the Harry Potter wiki states) or was passed to protect the mundanes from the wizarding world. According to the wiki the witch hunts were slaughtering magicals. If they were so much more powerful then how did that happen?

Bottom line though is that we all have individual tastes and preferences for what we read. I'm just one of the ones who don't mind either genre. When I read the mugglewank i look at my own skills and knowledge and go yep I can beat those wizards and when I read wizardwank I'm like yep I'm that powerful that no wizard or mundane can beat me.

It's just nice that there are so many fics that hopefully you can always find something to read and enjoy.

****** I understand that but if you read the wiki lots of adult magicals were killed (i think nearly headless nick is mentioned as one of them). And that's during a timeframe where the weapons weren't as powerful or long range.

I think a full conflict ends badly for both. I think mass weapons fiendfyre, diseases, chemical, nuclear, etc would end badly for both. Eg according to canon most magical enclaves are in the heart of mundane cities so an attack to harm one group would harm both. Plus with magicals being so few population wise they can't accept as many losses. If too many young and childbearing magicals are killed the population wouldn't survive (eg not enough in numbers, and not enough in biodiversity).

** Your survey is overly focused on combat, specifically a line of wizards squaring off against a line of muggles and attempting to reenact scenes from the Avengers.

More realistically, any conflict between the magical and mundane worlds is likely to evolve gradually and subtly. Remember the status quo is one where the magical world is being actively hidden.

The most likely way for that situation to change is through a process that goes unnoticed not something quick and dramatic.

Also, if you assume the mundane world starts off knowing nothing, any first response is likely to be a quiet information gathering effort. The kind of thing that takes years and slowly builds up steam. Some discrepancy is noticed either by a government or perhaps an independent group and people begin investigating.

Even when sufficient information has been gathered and the secret can be assumed to be effectively out at least as far as an investigating muggle group is concerned and said groups existence is likewise assumed to be known to some group of wizards that is unlikely to lead to the two worlds facing off and battling to the last.

And whatever is decided by both sides, plans are likely to change over time and more importantly take years to get anywhere and involve an extended period of negotiation, jockeying for position, planning, skirmishing and so forth from both sides.

** War between wizards and muggles makes little sense. Both groups contain different factions that would be for or against it. It'd be a three side war of anti-muggle wizards vs pro-muggle wizards & most muggles vs anti wizard religious extremist muggles. Expect most magic battles to be between wizards, with some having muggles with enchanted guns for support, attacks on muggle infrastructure from the anti muggle wizards, pro muggle wizards magically rebuilding and enhancing muggle infrastructure, and maybe a few ISIS suicide bombings in magical places.

Magic makes so much so easy, the wizards could be way more advanced if they wanted to be but due to the low population they have very little innovation. When it comes to things that magic doesn't help with, intellectual property, innovation, books, art, research, journalism, etc the muggle world is wayyyy ahead, although they obviously cannot research magic related things.

Understanding science could help wizards understand certain things better and open up new possibilities, but the complexity of it is too much to be really practical and they don't really have a need for it.

If someone had a decent understanding of science and a good understanding of what's doable with certain fields of magic, and a decent amount of funding, the ability to hire top magical innovators and scientists, engineers and software devs and get them to work together, the possibilities would be almost godlike. For example say "Let there be light" and turn Jupiter into another sun with several terraformed habitable worlds around it.

** Not a bad survey but I had an issue with several questions as I didn't like the answer choices mainly because the scenarios are much more complex than the simple answer choices.

For instance on the protego shield vs muggle weapons while you listed the weapons it wasn't clear how they are used. We also have to assume the shield is already in place before the weapon is fired otherwise it's doubtful the wizard could get it activated before the bullet reaches the wizard.

In canon we know for most wizards a protego shield will "break" after 1 - upto a specific # of "hits" depending upon the strength of the spell and the strength of the protego shield.

So would a single handgun round break the protego shield maybe not but a triple tap probably would (depending upon the kinetic energy and whether you believe muggle weapons could defeat wizards at all). Though IMO I'm pretty sure firing multiple shots from a gun will be much faster than multiple spells (at least from what I can see from canon)

I actually have no problem reading mugglewank or wizardwank as long as the story can hold my attention. Personally I think if it came to a true full blown conflict that both societies would not like the results. Eg both sides would lose out.

I always thought from what I saw in canon that the Statute of Secrecy was to protect the magical world from the mundane because if it was so easy to overcome the mundanes with the weapons of that time then why didn't the magicals do that instead of hiding. In today's world with much more powerful weapons I think that would be a tougher problem.

Plus unless the mundanes attacked unprovoked I do not think the conflict would be magicals versus mundane. Instead I think it would be bigoted magicals and supporters versus mundanes, disaffected squibs, muggleborn, and other magicals. In my mind that definitely changes the situation.
