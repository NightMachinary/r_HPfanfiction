Soooo... this was touched upon in the post below, about where to /post/ your fanfiction so it doesn't get lost in the shuffle. That's quite hard--there is so much of it out there! So this post is an attempt to collect advice from all the writers here (and the readers, who know what appeals and what offends) to share information with writers.

*Suggestions I've Seen So Far (and tried)*

- Review other authors' work.
- Join forums, like the Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenge forum on ff.net. Or, my suggestion: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/forum/The_Reviews_Lounge_Too/70706/][The Review Lounge, Too]].

*Things I've Tried*

- Posting links to story-announcement threads in the forums mentioned above.
- Posting update announcements on a tumblr account that is specifically about my writing/reviewing.
- Letting appropriate communities on LiveJournal know about recent stories/chapters (though many of those communities seem quite slow nowadays, unless I am only finding the inactive ones).
- Posting links here.
- I've shared stories that I like via these various communities and let the authors know that I did it.

*So, What Else?*

What else can an author do to build a readership? Is it partly just sticking around long enough? Or is it happening to write that popular ship?

In the past, I remember fanfics and series having entire Yahoo Groups dedicated to them! It was wild!


** Depending on your genre you can probably find a forum your favorite authors frequent.

Try: [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/caerazkaban/]] [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/3_or_4_Part_Harmony/]] [[http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/seelvorfanfiction/]]

CaerAzkaban especially is VERY active, you can participate in all sorts of discussions, and if you have a story you can ask for feedback on it in the group before posting to a site. Once you build up a following in the group they are likely to recommend it to friends too, and many of these people frequent the other groups. Be careful not to tick off the group owners though, ask for permission to post your chapter/story idea.

To build up a following, you have to post consistently. You don't have to write it all before posting chapter 1, but be good at staying on a decent schedule.

And finally...Don't Suck

Honestly, get a beta to help you, and bounce your ideas off friends in the community (hpfanfic, not your neighbor unless he's into that). If your idea sucks it will get shot down quickly, if it has ANY promise at all you will get lots of help offers because we are STARVING for good stuff to read.

** Not sure how everyone else finds stuff to read, but I just stick to search engines of ff.net and the other few sites I use and try out stuff based on description of the story.

So for readers like myself it would mostly be a matter of your story fitting their search criteria + having an interesting premise that is well described in the short blurb + not containing many spelling and grammar mistakes in first 2 chapters + not being poorly written.

Also "in the past" is much harder to repeat now because so many archived works are available - fics that tend to build that kind of following, are the long novel length type. Readers who prefer novel lengths fics now don't need to wait to get them chapter by chapter because there is plenty of completed, or at least far progressed works available. I am sure I am not the only who uses word length as one of the main criteria when looking for stuff to read. So for many, even a perfect fic won't hit their radar unless it gets long enough.

I wouldn't worry about it getting lost in shuffle even on huge sites like FF.net - everyone is looking for new works to captivate them, and once a fic meets a given searcher's criteria and gets into the result set, many will check out the newer ones.

** One suggestion I have is Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenges on the ff.net website? They're pretty well-populated and people are always posting challenges. If you do a challenge, its posted on the thread for everyone to read. I've written fics for challenges before and they always get more traffic. If people like it, they check out what else you've written.

** I think that good description of story may be critical. There is ridiculous amount of fics and selection is absolutely necessary - I think that during my search 99% of stories are discarded based only on title and first sentence of description. Part of this is that I discard certain types of stories ("Fred kisses Hermione (...)" -skip-, "Draco and Hermione entered a relationship" -skip-, "Scorpius" -skip-) but starting from things "This is my first ever Fan fiction" or using "DracoxLuna. Enjoy! (All right's belong to JKR)" as entire summary is suicide.

  These mini stories were originally written for the livejournal community hp100, which is now sadly defunct. It is now being resurrected on the Harry Potter Fanfiction Challenges Forum. New participants welcome. Ongoing project.

Potential new readers are unlikely to be interested in origin of this story - it may be better to put it somewhere inside (NOT at start of first chapter) - in fact your AN would work way better as description

  The challenge was to take a prompt and create a vivid, well-characterized scene in 100 words or less. They were written pre-Deathly Hallows.

Others are OK, but nothing that makes me think "I must read this" (but this is probably rare and depends on person).

I think that titles may be bigger problem - as "A Very Impractical Man" and "Even Unto the Seventh Generation" are interesting and intriguing, "Snapshots: Vivid Portraits in 100 Words or Less" works as description but ones like "Unacceptable", "Star-Crossed", "Poetic Justice" are not really better than choosing "Rock" as title.

From my list of favorites - examples of titles that caused me to notice story: "Far Too Many Time Travelers" (I always wanted story like this), "The Perils of Innocence", "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality" and "Growing Up Kneazle".

Obviously title part is highly subjective, but I really doubt that "Unacceptable" is title that will help story to find readers - I would describe it as bland.
