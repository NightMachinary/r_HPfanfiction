I love these stories because of the angst and grief and sometimes I really need to cry to a fanfiction. My all time favourite fanfiction is Recnac Transfaerso with all its sequels. I also like The Darkness Within because Harry gets injured a lot and he goes through stuff that makes me sad. I'm having trouble finding good stories that matches this theme so I'd be really happy if someone has any suggestions:)

Let me know if you want spoilers before you read it. In the first story Harry is supposed to be dead, in the second he's really dead.

** Recnac is one of my favourite series as well! I've probably reread it more than I have any other HP fic. I also love Hero by the same author, which I'm sure you've already read.

Some other angsty and/or hurt Harry-centric fics that I can recall are:

- Harry Potter and the Power of Emotion (and its sequel, which I believe has more angst/hurt?; complete) linkffn(1673267)
- Too Far from Home (in progress) linkffn(5757945)
- Sticks in a Bundle (abandoned?) linkffn(5501419)
- In Care Of (complete) linkffn(4927160)
- Love and Love Again (in progress) linkffn(7624618)

And while not Harry-centric (in fact, he dies as a baby), this one-shot hit all the right emotional/angsty chords for me, if you want to check it out. linkao3(4308630)

#+begin_quote
  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
