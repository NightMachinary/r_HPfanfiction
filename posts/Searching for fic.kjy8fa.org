:END:
James and Lily had twins, FemHarry and a boy. The boy name was Charles(I think) and I don't know about the FemHarry. For some reason they abandon FemHarry at the Dursely. They later through newspaper finds out that she was being abused. The Dursely are in prison and FemHarry is missing. Frank Longbottom is working with Amelia to find her. Lily and James visits prison to confront Dursely and James punch Vernon. Charles gets angry to find that he had a twin, who was abandon, abused and now missing. He refused to talk to his parents. Sirius and James finds FemHarry in their animagus form. She recognised but pretends otherwise and helps them instead. Later she meets Charles in Hogwarts Express and thinks that he isn't a prat after all.
