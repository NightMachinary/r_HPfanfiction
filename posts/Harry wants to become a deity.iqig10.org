Basically looking for fics in which Harry's end goal is to become some kind of deity, kinda like in the myths. The only time I've seen this was in linkffn(13611465) in which after he heard some old myths and learned the gods were real he got the goal of becoming one. Saviour of magic kinda does it too but it was more of an epilogue kinda thing and it wasn't Harry's goal.

  Harry and the sorcerer's stone come into an odd chance of fate, giving birth to something new, a Gamer System! Wait until he shows the magical world what he can do! Grey-ish independent Harry!

  Death messed up his job at Halloween 1981 and now neither Voldemort nor Harry Potter are dead. As if that wasn't bad enough that noisy little brat appears to be able to see him. All of that was quite unexpected. Still it doesn't explain how he somehow found himself stuck to raise the baby. Alright, now that's just awkward. Complete (sort of)
