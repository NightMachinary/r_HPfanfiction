I'd love to read a sort of "House of Cards" type fic where Tom Riddle manipulates his way to the very top via politics. After all, the boy was pegged to be minister at like 25


** Caveat: I've still not seen House of Cards (I know, I know, I'll get to it eventually) so I don't really know if this fits, but it's a Tom manipulates his way into politics kind of fic.

linkao3(Choosing Grey by betagyre) and the sequel linkao3(A Marked Deck by betagyre)

The premise is based on Hermione/Tom time travel. Tom does not suddenly become a loveable genius who just wants to help people, he is definitely still all kinds of fucked up. It's tagged for BDSM but tbh I can't remember that being a big part of it, should definitely be possible to skip this part if it's an issue.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?

#+begin_quote
  Minister for Magic Tom Riddle has a family and a position of immense political power, and he must adapt to the responsibility that comes with both. But Hermione has much to adjust to as well, married to someone who is still very much a power-hungry Dark wizard. Follows Choosing Grey.
