Hey there! I recently read Blindness and really enjoyed the idea of magic and Muggles or Muggle technology being mixed (with or without permission)

So I'm looking for any good fics, preferably on the longer size that have a good focus on introducing Muggles to magic, mixing tech with magic, or generally just having the world of magic exposed to the mundane world.

The main character doesn't matter though I suppose I prefer Harry-centric fics.

Thanks in advance!

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** I still need to get around to writing that snippet where the basilisk escapes Harry and petrifies Ron, Hogwarts is shut down, and petrified Ron is discovered centuries later by future muggles and successfully cured...
