I know he couldn't have possibly known, but shouldn't the officials know that since Harry didn't enter his name into the Goblet of Fire, if he refused to participate then [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity_of_contract][he wouldn't be bound by the contract]], since he didn't enter his name himself.

Then by that logic, someone should have told him that he didn't need to compete, as he never submitted his own name, and the person who did submit it will be bounded by the contract instead.

Boom, fourth year averted. And you can't tell me that nobody knew, seeing as they had 3 headmasters, multiple teachers, and also multiple tournament officials. Information on contracts could have been found in a library or even taught!

Also, seeing as Harry didn't enter his name and multiple officials demanded for him to compete, why can't Harry just: No, I refuse to compete as I didn't enter my name!

Edit: A lot of people said that the Goblet didn't have a binding contract, although the Harry Potter wiki quoted a line from Dumbledore stating otherwise. I don't have the book on hand though, so I can't check.

It's not that they didn't know. They believed him to have entered his name somehow and for some reason. That's one of the problems with that.

Harry knew he didn't; Dumbledore asked and believed him when he said he didn't, and Hermione believed him.

The vast majority of the students and professors, however, didn't believe him. Even Ron didn't believe him.

So, even if there /is/ such a concept, that will only come into play if:

- They believe and can prove that Harry didn't enter himself into the tournament beyond Harry merely saying that he didn't enter; and
- They can even find a similar concept in the Wizarding world.

That's assigning a Muggle concept to the magical world, which is not always feasible, especially when said world has the concept of a "binding magical contract" that implies that it goes deeper than a mere written one.

What happens if it's violated? No one knows but the fact that Crouch and "Moody" used it as a sort of finality implies some terrible outcome.

*** I think the wording here is especially important. The quote says, "the placing of your name". It doesn't indicate that the person who's being placed has to consent to it. Harry's name was entered into the Goblet, and therefore has entered into contract with the goblet. It sounds horrific, but much in line with the rest of the Wizarding World's cavalier approach to consent (love potions).

** Because he wanted to win

Canon Harry often likes to prove himself, and is a competitive person. Many fics often portray him as wanting to be normal or just being Harry. But I think that's a rather misinterpretation of his character, because he actually enjoys well-earned fame (as often shown after Quidditch matches), and he only once mentioned "just call me Harry" in the first Book.

  “Well . . . it is amazing,” said Bagman, rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at Harry. “But, as you know, the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure. And as his name's come out of the goblet . . . I mean, I don't think there can be any ducking out at this stage. . . . *It's down in the rules, you're obliged* . . .

  Bagman wiped his round, boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at Mr. Crouch, who was standing outside the circle of the firelight, his face half hidden in shadow. He looked slightly eerie, the half darkness making him look much older, giving him an almost skull-like appearance. When he spoke, however, it was in his usual curt voice.

  “*We must follow the rules, and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.”*
#+end_quote

Drawing this all together:

- The champions are bound to complete in the Triwizard Tournament by the rules of the tournament as agreed by the participating countries' respective Ministries of Magic.

- Those rules bind the champions to compete as a matter of "binding magical contract". The meaning of this phrase is somewhat ambiguous. Possible meaning 1: binding in magic itself, like a spell. Possible meaning 2: binding in magical law (i.e. it's a wizarding contract, not a Muggle one).

- However, the discussion between the organisers appears to imply that it would be /possible/ to choose to disapply the rules - they simply decide instead that the rules should be followed. This would suggest that the "binding magical contract" is binding as a matter of magical law, not magic itself.

- Under the rules, entering your name into the Goblet of Fire binds you to compete if your name is chosen i.e. there is no provision in the rules for backing out.

- The role of the Goblet of Fire is that it is the object nominated under the rules to select the champions. But the Goblet itself is not binding champions to complete - it is simply the champion-selection mechanism under the binding rules.

Although movie canon isn't the same as book canon. It's heavily implied that Barty Jr used a signed piece of parchment from one of Harry's assignments, as his (Harry's) handwriting was shown when Dumbledore pulled his name from the goblet.

In terms of the goblet, it wouldn't really care that Harry was signing an essay or a magical contract, just that it was his signature.

** The problem is that this is not explained or commented upon in the books and that (/not/ the fact as such, i.e. that Harry is competing) is one of the largest plot holes in the books, yes.

We (and the characters) know that "contracts" range from "The goblins hunt you if you don't pay" to "You will die if you break it". So which kind of contract is it? What is the consequence for a breach? No one asks that, and that is a problem, IMO. Before you ask "why doesn't he just not compete", this is what you have to clarify. But since we never get that far, you question has no answer.

In contrast, I don't think that Harry didn't enter his name himself is an issue. As Dumbledore notes, the *placing* of the name creates the contract. And this wouldn't be a problem either, since by definition the most worthy champion can't be one that actually doesn't want to compete. So placing someone else's name in there as a trick won't work, except if you're fake!Moody and create a new school with only one participant.

Bottomline, one of the weakest scenes in Canon. The characters don't behave like we think they should, given the knowledge we know they have. And Rowling can do better, compare e.g. the potions basin in the cave in HBP, where it's made very clear the /only/ way to empty the basin is to drink, because all other ways are magically voided. Something like this is lacking in GoF, and gives rise to dumb scenes like Harry conjuring deck chairs in the dragon arena to chill out, since "compete" might be understood to meaning only "show up".

I usually assume it's one where the contestants lose their magic if they don't compete, makes more sense than killing them or other consequences.

Personally I think that scene was also done badly. Did Dumbledore have to drink it? No. The potion just has to be drunk and transfiguring some porcupines will do the same, minus the death risk.

** The Goblet recognises someone's magic from the piece of paper that is thrown into it from their handwriting. It is known that the paper Crouch threw into the Goblet was stolen from one of Harry's notebooks and thus had his magic on it.

Essentially, a person could write anything on their piece of paper, names of other people, etc... it wouldn't matter and it would still be recognised, except nobody would know who it belongs to, only the person who threw it in and that person be the one who would have to compete. Let's say Harry wrote down "Tom Riddle" and threw it into the goblet, and it was chosen, it does not mean that Tom Riddle would have to compete. It would still be Harry, even if Tom Riddle competed, Harry would still lose his magic. A proxy could also throw in someone else's name for them, since Dumbledore merely made an age line that no students under 17 could cross, hence why he even asked Harry if he asked one of the older students to do it for him. In theory, one could just also simply throw in their names into the goblet from outside the age line.

Unless of course the whole "Crouch somehow got his hands on a piece of paper that Harry wrote his name on from his notebooks" is not canon and i only read it in other fanfics, though i could swear it is discussed and Harry recognises it as his own.

*The whole "Binding Magical contract" that is referenced throughout the book several times,* can be interpreted in many ways and it's not clearly explained, but you'd assume there are severe consequences for breaking it, something Harry did not really want to find out.

For example, "An Unbreakable Vow (incantation unknown) was a type of binding magical contract cast between two parties,[1] that if broken by either party, will result in the imminent death of whoever broke the contract."

The same could happen if you don't compete. Or you could lose your magic.

​

It is also not known what is meant by "competing"

Does it mean merely showing up for the tasks, and simply failing them immedietly, or do you have to put in real effort for the Goblet to recognise that you truly tried to compete and not just mess about? Again, something Harry did not want to find out, thus he went for the safest option to try and at least attempt the tasks and do his best. At least for the first task. In the second task, Harry was more concerned about saving whoever was down in the lake, rather than competing.

****** Not at all. Without it, it'd be literally impossible. With it, it's hard (I definitely agree it'd be difficult) but it is easier than trying to guess who the baddie might be without it.

Getting Harry into the tournament isn't an 'ultimate end' sort of goal, it's one that allows for further consequences which are more likely to be the goal of the baddie. They might want to get him into the tournament so he'll die, they might want to ruin his reputation, etc, but the ultimate goal is something after getting Harry into the tournament.

So, that means that something is probably supposed to happen within the tournament (maybe after, but that at least gives time to prepare and guess what it might be). But the goal being something happening in the tournament means they're going to interfere with the tasks, or maybe the judges, but it's going to be something relating to the tournament. So, that gives you a more limited area to watch. You know to look at people involved and around the tournament events for suspicious behaviours.

For example: If the goal is to kill Harry, maybe they'll mix around the first task to make sure he gets the most dangerous dragon. That means you know to watch the selection process somehow (and keep watch on the bag of model dragons beforehand). Or maybe they'll make whatever Dragon he faces more deadly somehow, so you watch the Arena set-up and see if any of the people preparing the Arena or looking after the Dragons are acting suspicious. That kind of thing. If something happens and you know you saw Moody acting all suspicious around the thing beforehand, then you know to check into him and see if it is him.

** We don't know the specifics of how the Goblet enforces participation. As other's said it is not referred to as a "binding magical contract" but the phrases "he'd have to compete", "Harry [has] been chosen to compete ... therefore [he] will" and "those whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to complete in the tournament". So the phrase "bound" is involved.

Consider one interpretation, that the binding magic of the Goblet is designed to make sure contestants don't chicken out. In this case the magic of the Goblet might exert some sort of general pressure on the contestants mind, ensuring that they don't attempt to sit out any tasks.

***** Yeah, but that doesn't make sense. My take on the binding means the Goblet takes the magical signature of the person that submitted the paper. Since it was Confunded and Harry accepted, it thought that the magical signature was Harry's. If Harry didn't accept, then it would have binded Crouch, I think.

****** I mean, it does make sense. It might not be your preferred explanation but it is canon compliant.

The exact quote regarding the contract is

"Once a champion has been selected by the Goblet of Fire, he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end. The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become champion."

Note that what establishes the contract is "the placing of your name in the goblet", not "you placing your name in the goblet". It is the presence of the name in the goblet that establishes the contract, not the intentional act of placing it.

Your take is fine for an AU, but it isn't canon as Harry was the one that competed and not Crouch. So either the contract applied to Harry as specified in canon, or the contract didn't actually exist, contrary to canon.

The idea that the contract literally /obliges/ (def. binds to a course of action) champions to compete through mental coercion that prevents them from having a change of heart or even considering not participating is a valid interpretation of how that binding magic could present.

Despite what fanon tells us, there was no risk of losing his magic should he choose not to compete; just a whole lot of manipulation in the form of Barty Crouch Jr using his Imperioused father as a mouthpiece to cow Harry into competing (citing beuracratic nonsense), and Dumbledore going along with it for vague, and probably not entirely well thought out reasons.

**** True, but it's also a case of "if he doesn't, he dies" so it's a rock and a hard place. Ultimately, I think that McGonagall or Snape would not trust Moody. McGonagall due to him using Transfiguration and I think that she'd alert Dumbledore to that. Snape after the theft of the polyjuice ingredients. Moody searched his office before they went missing(I believe), so it's not a leap to immediately go to him.

If it happened after, then him going to Harry would immediately lead to someone openly questioning why Dumbledore trusts Snape. Especially with no evidence

McGonagall... probably not, with Moody's attitude on Constant Vigilance, I'm pretty certain this is how he trains aurors. Also, even if she alerted Dumbledore, he's just be like "Alastor Moody has my complete trust."

Snape would distrust him, but what would that do? He's a Death Eater, Moody probably hates him.

********* I think Dumbledore did check Harry's scar after that night. In canon, he knew harry's scar is a horcrux, after Harry slammed one down on his table.

Strangely though, he didn't seem to realize that since Riddle didn't understand love, any love based ritual would get rid of it. Or hell, even a loving family would weaken the horcrux significantly.

Also, his reasoning for the horcrux was dumb as shit. If Harry was an accidental horcrux, then it means that Voldy has to have at least 5 accidental horcruxes with the amount of people he killed. I think a ritual is needed, tbh. Makes more sense than somehow ripping your soul apart on a whim.

It allowed Harry the /option/ to survive the Killing Curse after it destroyed the Horcrux--he could have chosen to go to the afterlife--but it's not like it made the Horcrux itself weaker.

And the presence of a loving family, in itself, didn't weaken the Horcrux. Harry still had a piece of Voldemort's soul inside him.

I'm gonna say this once: Fanon is not canon.

The fact that fans got it in their heads that being the Master of Death meant ultimate power to zap everything out of their way does not validate it whatsoever.

The Master of Death is the one who greets Death as an old friend. Who accepts his mortality.

In this, canon blows fanon out of the water, as it does with most things.

#+begin_quote

Because literally nothing in canon indicates it's at all possible?

The only thing that gets rid of a Horcrux is remorse. And that has to come from Voldemort.

This would not have made the Horcrux go "poof"!

Your own quote does not say that love makes Horcruxes poof--understanding love and sacrifice would make Voldemort realize that Harry had a failsafe, but this failsafe isn't foolproof in itself.
