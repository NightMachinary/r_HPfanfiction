Does anyone know any good fics with a transgender harry? I just finished with linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10843233/1/Truth-in-Transformation]]) which was really good, and I want to find some more.

​

​

EDIT: Interesting idea, if anyone wants to discuss, but if Harry is transgender, does that mean she wouldn't be the subject of the Prophesy anymore?

I believe that no, she wouldn't.

  “I think we've got a lot to figure out. But together we'll get it sorted.”Harry kissed her forehead.“Together. Sure.”It didn't sound any less impossible when Harry said it. But then, impossible was their speciality, wasn't it? Or, the one where Harry is a trans woman, and she and Ginny are still in love.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

**** Here's a couple more in that category.

Linkffn(Season of Change)

Incomplete but interesting. Similar to Son of Potter, Daughter of Black (it's one of the author's inspirations for SoP,DoB)

Linkffn(A Fair Life)

This one's still being updated. It's a response to reptilia28's Don't Fear The Reaper challenge but Harry was born a girl.

I know another one where Harry was turned into a boy as a baby, but still sees herself as a girl (physically), just that no one else sees her. And one where Sirius is released from Azkaban when Harry's young and is able to take guardianship, and Harry reveals that she's trans. I stopped reading it after a while, but I don't remember if I stopped liking the story or if it was just incomplete.

I'll check back later to see what's already bern posted here and I'll see if I can't find these two/more stories for you.

** Finally my moment has come! Honestly though, most of these I read years ago so I can't be sure there's no smut or of their quality. That said, I did save them so I thought at one point that they were at least decent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11578510/1/Becoming-Harriet]] - Trans Harry, with a straight OC pairing (I remember finding the OC compelling and he didn't feel shoehorned in.) I remember that sex occurs in this fic but I have no idea if it goes into explicit detail. This is probably at least partially angsty because figuring out you're trans can be kind of a whirlwind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9037058/1/Red-Headed-Stepchild]] - Trans Harry, I remember literally nothing about this fic so I include it only for comprehensiveness.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11827911/chapters/26692608]] Fem Harry/Trans Fem Draco, there's definitely angst and definitely smut in this one. Once again, including for other readers of the thread.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501]] - My favorite Trans Harry story. Short, sweet, and utterly beautiful.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11063298/]] - Trans Harry, a pretty realistic view into what being trans is like I think. At least I can see how I would relate if I were the same age and also had magic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11458551/]] - Trans Harry, I don't have much to say about this one, I enjoyed reading it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8495269]] - Trans Harry, total power wank ft. extremely powerful women, very gay as typical of the author (I say with the utmost pleasure :p). No idea if this one has smut but enough of her work does that I would suggest assuming it does. Currently on hiatus.

  Molly tried her best. When Harry had told them, Arthur had asked excitedly, "is this a Muggle thing?" Hermione had hurried out a "no!" and a frantic history of gender diversity in the wizarding world. "It's just that I'm a girl," Harry had said, and Arthur had nodded and asked her about how telephone booths worked. He would call her by the right pronouns until the day he died at the respectable old age of one hundred and thirty three, and he would make it seem easy. But Molly had to try. Hermione explained things faster and higher-pitched every time Molly messed up a pronoun. Molly frowned and muttered and put extra potatoes on Harry's plate at breakfast. Harry slept in Ron's room, which didn't bother either of them but which made Hermione scowl. Harry got boxes of sweets and warm hugs, as Molly chewed things over. For her fifteenth Christmas, the Weasley sweater she would receive would be a bright, friendly, terrible pink. The next time Harry visited, Molly put her on Ginny's floor to sleep-- for some definition of sleep that involved Hermione hissing threats at three in the morning if Harry and Ginny didn't "shut up about Wronski feints, do you know what time it is."

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else.
