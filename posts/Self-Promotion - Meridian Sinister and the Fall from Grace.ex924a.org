Hey everyone! If there's any interest in AU fics with heavy focus on original characters, and also has some audience participation if one wants to, then I'd like to put my fic out there! It's set in an AU in which the wizarding world is real, but the characters of the books (save for a few who were embellished by the author) were not. And while events such as the Wizarding Wars never occurred, witches and wizards who grew up aware of the books' events aspire to recreate the fictional Voldemort's plans and learn from the mistakes he himself made in the series.

  The year is 2019, a world that knows peace and is oblivious to the danger that lurks in the shadows. From the most unexpected of moments the order rises, the Neo Death Eaters, and it becomes clear what their intentions are with their first strike against the wizarding world. Meridian Sinister only knows one thing among the chaos: She's got a target on her back. SYOC OPEN
