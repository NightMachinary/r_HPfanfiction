I'm on the hunt for a multichapter fanfic that includes element powers. The only ones I ever find are discontinued. So if anyone has a completed elemental fic.

I am alright with

- Bashing
- Hate
- Super!Harry
- Odd Pairings
- Anything really


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]] is a pretty active WIP, updated earlier this month.

I wasn't familiar at all with the Avatar universe before reading it and I followed along just fine.

** Read the SSHENRY fics if you are okay with H/G and soul bond. I'm pretty sure that Harry and Ginny both had elemental powers.

** Here's one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] by RusyRed. It's probably abandoned, but it's a good story and it's over a 100,000 words.

Another one that's long and still being updated: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4118383/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Elemental-s-Power][Harry Potter and The Elemental's Power]] Not as high quality, but my standards are high.

Some stories that use odd or unique magic systems similar to what you're looking for. All of these are good stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived]] Just recced this on another thread. Abandoned, but long and later on has rituals and elemental magic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][Circular Reasoning]] Slow updating, but still in progress. Time travel, necromancy, and stuff you don't see in your average fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By The Divining Light]] Old Magic, definitely unique

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Wastelands of Time]] One of the best Harry Potter fanfictions period. Old magic, a time-traveling protagonist who's crazy as hell, scotch, and a pirate hat. It's exactly as weird as it sounds.

** I'm in the process of reading [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120802052602/http://onj1.andrelouis.com/hp/Department%20Of%20Mysteries%20Day.txt][Department of Mysteries Day]]

It has elemental magic (but it's not the focus of the story) and is quite long so I thought I'd chip in. It's a Time Loop story, with Harry repeating the same day over and over and over, so he does all kinds of crazy things to not go insane from boredom and trains to be a better wizard.

Other elements:

- Harem!Harry (the link is to the uncensored version, I think you can find a censored version on fanfiction.net)

- Super!Harry

- Bashing of literally everyone (the way I read it at least)

** Dark and Light by Faust VII It's focus is more on the super Harry aspect and it's pretty dark but I think you'll like it just as well. Bonus points if you like Petshop of Horrors, since it's a bit of a crossover but you don't need to know anything about PoH to understand the rest.
