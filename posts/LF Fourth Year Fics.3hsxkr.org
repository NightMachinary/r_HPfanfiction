My favourite book is the Goblet of Fire and I'm going on a long car journey and I'm looking for any fics that are based on the fourth year or begin in the fourth year. Harry being the main protagonist is a must for me. I've read a lot of these fics so any new or not that well known fics would be amazing. I'm open to slash as long as it isn't Harry/Draco. Any recommendations would be amazing, thank you.


** This is the first one that comes to mind

Harry and Hermione devise a plan get get him out of the tournament. Major Ron bashing, but its done in a funny sort of way. I'm not really a fan of bashing but the absurdness of it in this fic didn't bother me.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
