The Pureblood Pretense and its sequels, along with the Alexandra Quick series, have to be the two most /excellently/ written fanfic series I have come across.

Same goes for female protagonists, I suppose. Applied Cultural Anthropology was a beautiful fic.

I don't know why, but I'm finding stories with female protagonists much more interesting. There's a subtly different perspective in all of these fics that's intriguing, and keeps me hooked. There's also something along the lines of what first drew me to indy!Harry fics - every one of these stories manages to pull off an independent character with resolve, but through /character development/, rather than blasting it in your face like traditional indy!Harry stories.

*Anyways, some preferred traits I'd like to see in similar fics:*

- Capable protagonist
- AU
- Action/Adventure
- Worldbuilding

**** You're not the only one. Awesome premise and execution, that story.

I'd say it's surprising that it isn't ripped off constantly (as other good FF is), but it's just too bloody hard to replicate.

****** True. It's still kind of sad, since it's just so exceptionally good.

I'd easily put it in the top-50 of all HP fics, including the ones I didn't read, and it's in my personal top 10.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: The author built a new, very different world completely from ground up. Hermione in this story is adorable and yet scary, intelligent and yet mistake prone, incredibly strong and yet very sensitive. The Trio had also compiled a huge body count throughout their adventures.

"Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994): It's another smart and ruthless Hermione story. This time, she led a small guerilla group of Muggleborns and dished out massive losses to Death Eaters and its Ministry minions. But Dumbledore, Harry, and Ron were doing their part too.

"Call Me Moriarty", linkffn(11602420): This dark fem!Harry is too intelligent and over powered, but the story is bloody fun to read.

"Murder Most Horrid", linkffn(10099028): There is no Voldemort in this AU, and Bellatrix became a cynical auror/detective instead, until she met Hermione. It's a very good crime/mystery fic with the Bellatrix/Hermione pairing.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I'll submit linkffn(Resistance by Lorien829); Hermione-centric fic where Harry gets captured in the first chapter, setting off Voldemort's victorious take-over of Magical Britain. Dark, almost cruel to the good guys fighting as insurrectionists on the run, but it doesn't bash anyone. In fact, there are some great Weasley moments all the way to the end.

** Are you alright with genderbender? linkffn(11862560) is probably the best i've read so far.

Harry's (Mel's) development as a character is absolutely fantastic, his slowly coming to terms with the fact that yes, (s)he is a girl, and really, she always has been, even if she occupied the body of a boy and coming to terms with the fact that she's not a freak, confronting her past and the abuse she suffered from the Dursleys makes for very interesting reading.

Fair warning, it starts with the simple premise of Harry turning into a girl but quickly moves into bigger AU territory and it can be a little off putting for some people. I really don't like some of the things the author has done to James' character and the way marriages work but it's certainly worth a read despite that.

The author is also writing a fill fem!Harry story but i haven't read it yet.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

*** Because some people do have an easier time with identifying with female characters, for one, and when you read a story it is most common to try identifying with the protagonist. As the amount of stories of any kind centreing on female protagonists rather than male ones is fairly low all things considered, it is fairly obvious why some people would want to read or write stories with such and thus search for them.

Add to that the thing with sexuality being a different thing entirely than one's gender, and there you go, there is reason enough to make an originally male protagonist female even if you pair them with another female character.

That said, in this case the slash character was supposed to serve as an “or” rather than a mark of a pairing.
