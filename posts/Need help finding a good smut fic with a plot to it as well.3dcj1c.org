** A Big Happy Weasley Family or Dragon Lily. Both by Werewolf Warrior. Both were abandoned and deleted from hpfanficarchive.com but are still around. ABHWF was completed. DL was not.

** linkffn(Whatever Happened to Bromance) is an excellent and realistic First Time fic.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5120617/1/][Who and Why]] by the object lesson is another First Time, canon compliant.

[[http://emmagrant01.insanejournal.com/263180.html][Five Times Ginny Weasley Fucked Harry Potter During the War]] is an old favorite of mine.

Antosha has some excellent H/G/L stories, Back to the Garden being the best among them.

Lunalovespotter has some excellent dark and twisted smut stories. [[http://llp-twisted.livejournal.com/1171.html][Battle of the Sexes]] (Ginny/Cho and Harry/Ginny) and its sequel [[http://llp-twisted.livejournal.com/2123.html][Water Music]] (Harry/Ginny and Ginny/Luna) are very good.

Edit: I swear this bot hates me.

** I recall something like "Harry's seventh year series" on adultff.org. I'm sorry I don't have the time right now to narrow it down with google. It's a series of stories that starts with a one-shot, but goes on to something like a dozen stories that cover the end of the war.

It's got a lot of smut in it, of a number of different configurations (you read a lot about various members of Harry's army), but it's plot-based.

Edit, I lied, I did do a quick google. Here's the author page. The fics are NOT listed in order for some odd reason. [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/authors.php?no=1296786804]]
