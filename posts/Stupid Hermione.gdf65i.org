In canon, Hermione was often rather stupid. She forgot that she could create fire with magic, so she lacks common sense. Divination actually works, so she was blindsided by it entirely.

This is a prompt based around the idea of a Hermione that superficially appears to be as smart as she is in canon, at least from Harry's perspective, but she is actually rather stupid. Maybe spellcasting relies on confidence instead of words, so things like Wingardium Levio-sah are just her being stupidly confident. Perhaps she creates spells on whims like "Point Me" that could result in her death like what happened with Luna's mom, but she is just extremely lucky. Maybe Professor Lupin was being patronizing to the her when he stated that Hermione "was the smartest witch of her generation." Maybe the trio get points taken away every time that Hermione does their homework, but the teachers never take time out of their schedule to tell them that they are getting points taken away for that.

Tl;dr: The outline of this prompt is the following.

1. Hermione is stupid. She could be studious and hard-working, she simply has to lack common sense and be impulsive to be stupid despite that.

2. From Harry's perspective, Hermione should appear to be intelligent.

This could be built off of other student's POV's, such as Draco thinking she is a stupid mudblood after being punched by her in the face, as an idea, especially due to him being the son of a School Board member/politician.

I disagree with this. She had a moment of panic when she was 12 years old and in a frightening situation, that doesn't make her lack common sense, and we don't see much indication of that beyond the one incident. And yeah, maybe she's a bit narrow minded about Divination, but no one except Parvati and Lavendar took Trelawney seriously. Even if Hermione was wrong in the end, all evidence pointed to the conclusion that Divination was a load of crock. That doesn't make her stupid.

*** Smart (or at least good at memorization) but narrow minded does describe Hermione quite well.

**** Yup, that's one of her failings. She's highly intelligent but is skeptical about things she doesn't have solid proof for, and a part of her probably shies away from things that don't come easily to her because she's used to being good at everything, and she's terrified of failure (we know this from the boggart). I believe she bases her self-worth on her accomplishments, so she takes it very hard when she doesn't excel at something, and she'd rather write it off as irrelevant than examine it further.

*** What about trusting Draco in the 6th book?

Besides, this is a funny prompt, don't take it personally.

**** Oh, I have no problem with the prompt, I actually think it could be funny. I just didn't like the flimsy reasoning for why canon Hermione was stupid. And she didn't trust Draco, she just thought Harry was being too obsessive. In any case, bringing up every time Hermione was wrong about something is not proof of her being unintelligent. She's not infallible. I'm not attacking you personally, btw, I'm just arguing the facts. It's all good, man.

**** She didn't trust Draco. She thougth so little of him that the idea that Voldemort would have a use for him was riddiculous to her.
