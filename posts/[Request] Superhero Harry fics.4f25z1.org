*** Seconding this suggestion. It's not precisely what you requested, OP, but it's by far the best HP/Marvel crossover out there. In fact, imma go read it again!

** Hoo, boy, thats exactly what this is except harry isn't the main character, Regulus is. Now if I can only remember the title . . .aha,. Google is my friend. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina by Karmic Acumen). Harry makes a wish, and then divine being that answers rescues Regulus from the cave and makes him. . .well. A superhero. Pretty good, if you're looking for a place where a few small personal powers (able to defeat anti-apparition wards) make someone truly ridiculous.

Linkffn(a black comedy) has some of this feel, too.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
