  AU, time travel. Voldemort won and Harry lost. Life under Lord Voldemort's rule isn't what the Purebloods thought it would be... so a half-baked plot to twist time to save their sorry hides is concocted. But will it work? [WIP]

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

#+begin_quote
  Thanks to a clever bit of magic and the help of an old acquaintance, Draco is given the chance to relive his years at Hogwarts with the knowledge of what exactly is in store for the future. However, when things tumble out of Draco's grasp, he finds himself losing his memories of the life he's already led as everything takes a startling turn away from what he'd always assumed to be his destiny.

  A few years after the Battle of Hogwarts and everyone is struggling to adjust to all that's happened with the war. The one having the most trouble is Draco Malfoy, who faces scorn from everyone, as well as every other Slytherin. He tries to think of a way to fix things, to make things better, to maybe...maybe make up for all his mistakes.He devises a plan to go back in time to the very beginning. To where he first met Harry Potter. If he can befriend him- Really befriend him, then maybe things could change. Slytherin could be seen in a more positive light, he and Harry could be friends, and he could stop Voldemort sooner. He didn't know everything - not all of it, but he knew enough to make a difference.To save lives.If he was able to do that one thing...sacrifice all his years to save so many people- To do something with this life, well... Wasn't it worth it?

** This sounds like a fantastic idea for a story, but I suspect most stories that have this will be written by people who are already in love Draco. Which means they will miss out on everything that would actually make it interesting (the internal conflict in Draco, coming to terms with his new role, dealing with his hatred for the trio in an authentic manner). Most non-dark!Fics featuring Draco have him converted into a good guy who's a little rough around the edges within one chapter.

I can understand that. Everybody loves that kind of snarky/cynical good-guy character who's sarcastic and sometimes a little mean. It's just totally not Draco (I'd expect him to be more withdrawn, uncomfortable and practical if he changed sides). I prefer stories that use Blaise, Theo or even Daphne (or an OC) for that role... If Draco joins the Trio and is quipping and lightheartedly teasing them it just feels completely alien and wrong to me.

  Through a dark ritual, Draco Malfoy is sent back in time, from his seventeenth year to his eleventh. Now he has the chance to use his superior knowledge and skill to change everything and save all his friends and family, but there's a terrible complication: it turns out that not even time travel can cure a case of lycanthropy.
