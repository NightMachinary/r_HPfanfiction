im always seeing fics where dumbledore/the weasleys/whoever is using potions on harry to get him to act how they want and it made me wonder if theres any where the reverse happens?


** Just to be clear, the fics where Dumbledore and/or the Weasleys do it are invariably bashfics where the potioners get their comeuppance at the hands of the newly liberated Harry. Are you asking for a Harry-bashfic where he gets his comeuppance at the hands of his victims? Or, are you looking for a fic celebrating the depraved triumph of this Harry?

That said, linkffn(Compound Interest by Cillit Bang Bang) has Vernon have Harry brew potions for him to use on his coworkers, business partners, and competitors.

  Vernon Dursley is an ambitious man. And when he finds a freak at his front door, he opts to see it not as a burden, but as an opportunity. An opportunity that shall provide him with rich rewards in due time.
