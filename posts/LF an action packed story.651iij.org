What's your favorite action packed story? Prefer M rating but if it's good lower is fine too, romance is a plus! No Male Slash though please (just a preference). the longer the better! OP Harry is ok! Thank you!


** linkffn(Sum of Their Parts). Ministry betrays the trio several years after the war and Harry takes revenge and kind of becomes a "Dark Lord". Harry, Hermione and Ron's friendship was really well portrayed.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute). An adult Harry, after a very long and brutal war, goes back in time to the Third Task. He has 12 hours to destroy the Horcruxes and end Voldemort.

linkffn(Backward with Purpose). Harry, Ron and Ginny time travel to their first year after most of their friends die in the Battle of Hogwarts. A common criticism of this story is that they needlessly stick to the previous timeline. That's only true for the first half of the story. Then the characters realise they've made a mistake in not being pro-active enough. I don't think having characters make such a mistake is wrong. In any case, the second half throws canon out the window and has pretty good action.

I've heard good things about linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) and Morocco, a Rose/Scorpius action/romance. Given what I've read in recommendations, Morocco might be closes to what you want. I've not read it, however.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** /Stages of Hope/ proves once again to be a worthy fic. Several battles, tons of action. Not much in the way of romance, though. Harry's not quite OP, more of a berserker.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
