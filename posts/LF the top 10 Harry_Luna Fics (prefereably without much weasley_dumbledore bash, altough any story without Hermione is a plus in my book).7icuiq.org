*** A few things. It mostly comes down to how a majority of authors write her, and that's badly.

A bunch of authors love to write Hermione as a Mary Sue, usually giving her some level of super intellect. In these, she often comes off as incredibly pretentious to the point it becomes grating to read. It's not odd for these to be 'bash the stupid magicals' stories either, where Harry and company act pretentious about their perceived moral, technological, and magical superiority.

The same bunch like to write her as essentially Emma Watson, basically they go on about how beautiful she is and how other girls don't compare. Canonically when Hermione tried to look good she didn't compare, she was described as 'pretty' where others were 'beautiful.'

HP/LL stories with Hermione tend to become HP/HG/LL stories, which tend to be filled the brim with cliches, we're talking bash Ron, Molly, and Dumbledore, Lord!Potter!+50 other lordships, Harry&Co know better than everyone about everything, soul bonds, married at 11, everyone Harry is friends with is an heir of a founder and they shove it in your face, etc...

There's definitely other stuff, but that's what came to mind for me.

**** Ditto, also i hate prejudice and the fact that she (like a lot of muggleborns in fanon) would like to transform the magical world into a magical version of the muggle world annoys the hell out of me. One simple phrase that i liked and express what i think about it is that Magical Britain isn't Muggle/Mundane Britain, its another country, so if you want to live in Magical Britain you should at least respect its customs and traditions, even if they are "barbaric" to your point of view. Not that I'm saying that I would agree with everything in the magical world (ie: Love potions, compulsion charms, memory charms and imperious can have devastating effects on a person and its vile to do so, imo)

****** I didn't generalize all muggleborns, just the ones that do what I said i hate that they do. The basis of prejudice is judge something you don't know about or don't understand, not the fact that you don't like a group of individuals. That would be akin to racism, which this isn't either.

*** Not the OP, but the reason I hate Hermione in fanon is because she tends to written as a Mary Sue, and the tendency for authors to shoehorn her into being pals with Harry when it doesn't make sense.

I'm fine with canon Hermione, but people have ruined her in fanon for me.

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

** linkffn(7352166) is my personal favorite. Hermione and Ron are both present in this fic -- it would be tough to find one without them, honestly -- but their presence is minimal.

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.
