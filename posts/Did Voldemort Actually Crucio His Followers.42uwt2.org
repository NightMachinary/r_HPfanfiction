Perfect timing with that recent thread about forgetting what's canon and what's fanon! Anyways, I was reading The Last, Lost Hope, and the author mentions that Voldemort liked to torture his followers. Which made we wonder - do we actually have canon support for that? I can understand very, very, very huge fuck-ups but as we know, many authors act like he tortured his followers regularly at best and, well, every time they breathed at worst. I only have a copy of SS so I can't check.


** He crucio'd Pettigrew for allowing crouch Sr to escape in GoF. I'm also pretty sure he crucio'd at least one follower (I wanna say Avery or nott, but I'm not sure) in the graveyard scene. After GoF I don't think it mentions him doing it, but we don't get a lit of pov's of just voldemort hanging out with his followers

*** Yep, Pettigrew and Avery in GoF, and in DH he commands Draco to Crucio Rowle. In OotP he talks with a trembling Rookwood, and the way Rookwood acts suggests he was either tortured, or expects to be tortured. There might have been more instances that I don't remember, but Voldemort definitely likes to punish his followers for their failure.

** When I read canon, i always had the view that voldemort crucioed occasionally, not incessantly. It is his punishment of choice, yes. But he doesn't just do it for kicks and giggles when he is bored, or for minor disappointments.

Pettigrew let crouch escape: that could ruin his resurrection plans, big failure

Graveyard scene: followers denied him, make an example of them so they won't ever do that again

Crucios seen through Harry's connection: the connection is triggered from voldemorts extreme anger for the most part. So obviously those times will be big mistakes by his followers.

Crucios are used to make a point and keep in line, or else people would stop following him willingly. Fics that feature constant Crucios by voldemort bother me, since it doesn't seem realistic. Its a caricature of a dark Lord, not how a brilliant and charismatic evil leader would act

*** Yes! Ok, that's what I was trying to say - like I said, I can see him torturing people about big failures - letting Crouch get away? betraying me to the point where only Pettigrew can be bothered to resurrect me? smashing the prophecy from the DOM? Big failures. Telling me that the deli was out of roast beef? Not so much. It's one thing to use heavyhanded crucios to show a descent (further) into madness, but as just part of a normal villain's day - it's weird. Like you say, it's a caricature, not a realistic view of a leader.

**** If you want a competent Voldemort, then crucioing his followers should be reserved for the very worst cases, and only if he's quite sure it won't do more harm than good. "Crucios will continue until morale improves" is a path to ruin.

*** I've often thought she/ffauthors miss the boat with the creepy servility of the DEs. Masters of the Universe, Nature's Nobility, the arrogance of the pureblood supremacists, and they all fall over one another to serve V. It's not how the 1% act.

**** I think it's structured after the nazi elite, many of them were very servile (at least in his presence) towards the FÃ¼hrer.

In my opinion it also fits stupid aristocrats who would like to live in the past, and a world were personal power (with a wand) means much, much more than in the real world.

And I personally think the Death Eaters are in their core followers, not leaders.
