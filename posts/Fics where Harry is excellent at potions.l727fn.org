Just that. Preferably no bashing, I don't like them. Or pureblood culture. Just a fanfic where Harry is gifted at Potions.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629][Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions]] by Wyste. Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples. Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world. Complete. Ao3.

*** From what I remember of this story Harry isn't actually that good at potions in this, just likes the subject

**** And he works really hard, and therefore becomes good, and uses them for loads of things and ends up being apprenticed to Snape.

** linkffn(11115934) is the best Potions!Harry that I know of, but it's a LoTR crossover.

There's also murkybluematter's series, starting with linkffn(7613196). Part 4 of it just got completed like 6 hours ago.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  AU Harry is abused by the Dursleys. he hopes to be able to save himself somewhat through the use of potions since underage magic isn't allowed. Will Snape help or sabotage him? Set after PoA - Snape as mentor - no slash - Abusive Dursleys - No Triwizard tournament and Horcruxes are not a thing. Trigger warning for suicidal thoughts. Graphic violence. COMPLETE
