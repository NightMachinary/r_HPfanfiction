:END:
I remember downloading this fanfic a few years ago, and I don't really remember all the details. I remember that they have triplet daughters, and that the fanfics are divided into separate stories on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], it's a long story and is a series.

That one kid out of the three is kinda powerful. I'm sorry for the vague description. Google has failed me, humans of reddit, do your magic please XD


** I cross posted this on [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] subreddit and got a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/jns37x/-/gb417sy][response]]. You can check it out and see if that's the fic you're looking for.
