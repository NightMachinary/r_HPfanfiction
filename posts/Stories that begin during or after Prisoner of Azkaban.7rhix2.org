** I'm currently writing a post PoA story in which Sirius arranged for Harry to be picked up by the Tonks family. I guarantee that there will be no graveyard scene at the end of the triwizard tournament and that the "bad guys" are no braindead morons. So far 36k words are written and I hope I'll get the next chapter done by Sunday.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.

** Linkffn(Weres Harry) has an En Medias Res at the climax of PoA, then backtracks to cover years one and two, before getting well and truly canon-divergent.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12311860/1/Old-Scars-and-Future-Hearts][Old Scars and Future Hearts]] by AnotherGirlWithAStory might be a story you'll like. I was definitely became invested in this story awhile back. Basically, Narcissa and Draco visits Grimmauld Place where Draco finds a diary before his 3rd Year of Hogwarts.

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.
