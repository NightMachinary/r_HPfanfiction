Pretty much what the title says. I think it would be interesting to see the two worlds collide as they are pretty similar in some ways. Sadly I don't think there's too many of them, as I can't find anything.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Harry-Potter-and-Skulduggery-Pleasant-series-Crossovers/224/3282/?&srt=4&r=10][Yes]]. No guarantees of quality, though.

E: I misread the title and didn't see the word 'good'. I cannot vouch for these stories- I checked once last year, but the one story that caught my eye didn't match expectations, so I dropped it.

Ninja edit dos: on a quick one chapter skim, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9173332/3/The-Fifth-Champion][The Fifth Champion]] doesn't look all that bad. Grammar is fine, plot is somewhat sensical, and the author seems to know their shit about at least SPverse.

*** Thank you! I didn't think there was many. Perhaps I'll write one of my own if I can't find much.
