I've been on a comedy kick, and something I read in another story made me want to look for more stories like this, where Harry just kind of trips his way into success. Would prefer something funny, especially screwball comedy, but serious stuff works too, because sometimes, the world just works in weird ways.


** I know this great series by an author called J.K Rowling.

*** Yes, that's my take as well.

The best fic in which Harry won accidentally is the original 7 Books. He had no coherent strategy whatsoever, and only reacted to what his enemies threw at him. Of course, his enemies never had a chance as he possessed the 4 most powerful weapons in fictions: Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiat, Plot Armors, and the Lucky Hero trope.

**** He also had Dumbledore pulling his strings. The entire seventh book is a series of unlikely events that somehow Dumbledore completely engineered in advance. In reality, Dumbledore is the hero of the series, Harry is just a puppet, which is why it feels like he wins so accidentally.

Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

Start with nobody knowing him, ends with people thinking he is a super spy

*** I don't think people think that he's a super spy at the end of A Black Comedy. Also, I'm not sure that his success was all that accidental?
