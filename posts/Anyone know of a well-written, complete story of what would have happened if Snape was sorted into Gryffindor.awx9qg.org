We know that the sorting hat occasionally makes mistakes. I wonder what would have happened would Snape have been sorted into Gryffindor. I'd love to read a fic that had this happen and kind of touches on;

- how his relationship with Lily would have progressed
- the progress of Death Eaters and Voldemort
- Would Snape have turned into a completely different person?

Any recommendations? I'd like them complete and well written.

** Firstly, sorting hat never made mistake. With the given data it can read from a mind of a eleven year old, it did fairly well.

The problem is people often mistake "courageous" with "good". What Peter lacked wasn't courage, but loyalty and moralfiber. Peter Pettigrew had enough courage to do what was needed to facilitate Voldemort's return... I mean, it's not like chopping your own right hand for a dark ritual is an easy task.

And second, Snape /could/ have been sorted in Gryffindor. It's not like he had zero courage. But more than courage, he had ambition and he was inordinately attracted to dark arts. That's why he was sorted into Slytherin. But yeah the possibility of him getting sorted into Gryffindor exists.

His relationship with Lily would have been same. Mind you, Lily and Snape were close friends even when he is Slytherin, until he joined Voldemort.

But then again, Lily would have known about his vindictive nature lot sooner, so their relationship would have gone sour even earlier. It all depends on particular events.

But one thing is for sure. He wouldn't have gotten place in death eaters. Even if he joined, he wouldn't have gotten into their inner circle with ease like he did in canon.

*** I'm not sure if his falling out with Lily would have happened at all.

Snape wouldn't be living in a house full of people who will judge him for every interaction with her. There wouldn't be peer pressure to call her a mudblood. He would be a /lot/ less likely to fall in with the Death Eater crowd. The marauders wouldn't necessarily like him, but they wouldn't be able to hold being a Slytherin against him, so that escalation of viciousness would be severely reduced. I kind of doubt that McGonagall or Gryffindor house in general would let the marauders have nearly as much slack if they really targeted a fellow gryffindor, nor would Snape have as much room to respond in kind.

** The only thing close I have is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/]])

let's go though the checklist;

- well written? that's subjective but I enjoyed it
- complete? yes
- Snape in Gryffindor? yes
- Snape turned into a different person? yes
- completely avoids talking about the other things because snape is a time traveler and has been told by the Grim Reaper that halloween 1981 must go the same way? yes

** Snape would almost certainly be a completely different person.\\
A halfblood Gryffindor is unlikely to end up friends with death eaters (well people who will grow up to become them and very much held their views), the fact is the future death eaters likely wouldn't have really spoken to him if he wasn't a slytherin, and with the house rivalry they'd likely have been somewhat hostile to him.

This means he never calls Lily a mudblood, never joins the death eaters, never spies on the prophecy putting Lily in danger and consequently never becomes a spy.\\
Those events are what really shaped him, they gave him his personality and motives.

Now some things might be the same, there's a chance he would still have been somewhat antagonistic with James (because both would still want Lily), though it may well not be to the same extent (his death eater leanings, future death eater friends and even being a slytherin clearly made him seem an acceptable target to the marauders, and perhaps more importantly, only James would really have an issue with him, Sirius wouldn't have reason to hate him enough to send him into the clutches of a werewolf etc.

As for changes to others, there's every chance that either: the prophecy is never partially overheard, and if as some suspect it's self fullfilling it may well never come true and Voldemort may win, alternatively someone else overhears, but they wouldn't run to Dumbledore when they found out the target, nor would they ask Voldemort to spare Lily. This means that there would be no fidelious and betrayal (so if Peter is still a spy he wouldn't be exposed), and depending on how important Voldemort asking Lily to step aside and her chance of survival was, she might not save Harry with her sacrifice, and again Voldemort wins.\\
Of course Voldemort might not win, it might be that he still fails when he attacks Harry, in which case You'd have a story where Harry actually has his godfather and parent's friends in his life. I think it unlikely Peter would try anything, he's clearly the type to join the winning side if given the opportunity, so he'd probably just do his best to hide the fact he was a spy.

*** His relationship with James and Sirius (and maybe Remus & Pettigrew by association) probably wouldn't have been improved any. Instead of being a Slytherin, Snape would be a Gryffindor who was already on record (on the train ride) as stating that he preferred Slytherin and that Gryffindors are "brawny rather than brainy," i.e., stupid.

Maybe he and Peter would have been good friends and they could go off and be murderers together.

***** True, but James & Sirius were already predisposed to disliking him and he already predisposed against them so it's not suddenly roses and sunshine just because they end up in the same House.

Do we? Who are you thinking of?

IMHO the Hat making a mistake is only a trope in fanon and not present in canon. I'm not against the idea of a sorting mistake as a plotline but in fanfiction it's only ever used in the most assinine of ways, like "Hermione should've been in Ravenclaw" or "Neville should have been in Hufflepuff", completely missing the point of their characterisation.
