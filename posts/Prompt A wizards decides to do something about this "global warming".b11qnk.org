But how do you change the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale without anyone, especially the muggles, noticing?

  without muggles noticing.

Easy, fill the world with Dementors.

- Muggles can't see them.

- If muggles die, there are less polluters.

- Dementor presence lowers the ambient temperature. Warming's the problem, cool everything down!

** The fanon explanation of the /aguamenti/ spell is that it gathers water from the atmosphere - otherwise using it for drinking water would violate the well-known exemption to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. If that is how it works, then gathering components of the atmosphere together is within the art of the possible with magic.

Space expansion - such as might be used to fit an entire nature preserve in a small leather travelling case - gives you a place to put the carbon dioxide. As for finding a way to sequestrate the carbon when you've got it enough collected to unfuck the atmosphere, I'd go looking for alchemists. Base metal into gold is /hard/ transmutation. I suspect CO2 and water into something that can be dropped down abandoned mines or dumped in the deep ocean is probably a tad easier, being not distantly removed from plain old non-magical chemistry.

Making the muggles not notice would be ... more problematic. Taking care to make the rate at which you're working look like environmental protection measures are working better than expected would be finicky, but doable.Your programme of mind-controlling important business figures and politicians - to ensure that those environmental protection measures are actually going through properly - would take a lot more brainpower and would have to be hidden from the Aurors.

** You don't have to worry about the Muggles noticing - they will just invent an explanation or change their models until they fit the new reality. Alternatively, have the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee prepare something beforehand.

** Option 1:

Use self-refilling and feather-light charms to create rockets capable of lifting payloads we can't dream about

Use those rockets (probably with some sort of charm to avoid detection by satellites) to set up a solar shade in Earth-Sun L1

Watch as muggles loose their shit thinking aliens are protecting us and creating a solar shade to hold back global warming

Option 2:

Use magic to create a massive azolla boom ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla]])

*** *Azolla*

Azolla (mosquito fern, duckweed fern, fairy moss, water fern) is a genus of seven species of aquatic ferns in the family Salviniaceae. They are extremely reduced in form and specialized, looking nothing like other typical ferns but more resembling duckweed or some mosses. Azolla filiculoides is one of just two fern species for which a reference genome has been published.

** Use conjuration, levitation charms, etc to carefully deploy [[https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/23/health/sun-dimming-aerosols-global-warming-intl-scli/index.html][aerosols]] into the atmosphere. The advantage over muggles is that in case of a huge mistake it should be easy to remove those aerosols again... just way more control over the entire process. They could also probably come up with better particles with more ideal properties.

** With the standard spells it would be hard. Fiendfyre could possibly create a firestorm that would carry particles to the upper atmosphere and temporarily cool the earth, but the idea of Nuclear Winter is doubtful, so it's possible that the effect wouldn't be that great or that long lasting.

If you get to invent new spells: making ice unmeltable and casting it on glaciers and sea ice in the arctic. This would keep the earth's albedo high if you could cast the spell on an area large enough. The best thing would probably be a spell to make an area of permanent night on the equator.

More realistic ideas might be to use feather-light charm to allow a moderate-sized rocket to lift a huge sunshade to the earth-sun L1 Lagrange point. In practice this would almost certainly require co-operation with the muggles, ideally with them designing a special rocket to exploit the feather-light charm to its full.

The power of incoming sunlight is huge, something like 1 hp per m^{2} on average, despite the night. A sunshade at L1 would probably block something like 2 hp per m^{2} sunshade and thus a one km^{2} would block something like 1.49 GW.
