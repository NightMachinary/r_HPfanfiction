I've always been curious about any stories where the Sorting Hat places students somewhere they didn't expect to be. Like why does families like The Potters get sorted in Gryffindor, Black family gets sorted into Slytherin, ect extra.

Any stories where the Sorting Hat takes a stand (so to speak) and decides to place the students wherever it wants? So say sorting Hermione in Ravenclaw, Harry in Slytherin, Draco in Ravenclaw/Gryffindor, or set in the next gen the next gen characters being sorted in a place they didn't expect. Or even the Marauder Era as well.


** Ummmm... doesn't the Hat already place the students where it wants to place them? Yeah, it takes the students' wishes into account, but it's not governed by said wishes -- otherwise Neville would have become a Hufflepuff since that was the house he was aiming for.... and, if you take Cursed Child as canon, Albus was placed in Slytherin pretty much against his own wishes.

If this is canon, then every HP fanfiction is canon as well.The shittier it is, the more canon it is.

**** If you think Cursed Child is bad, you haven't read truly bad fanfiction. I'm not saying Cursed Child was a classic or anything, but holding it up as the Worst Thing Ever like so many fans do just convinces me that said fans don't have a clue what BAD FANFICTION really is.

Cursed Child had tons of problems. But there was no character bashing, no self-inserts, no gratuitous sex scenes, no pointless crossovers, no parts where Harry inexplicably becomes "Lord Potter-Black" and goes on to rant about what awful, awful people everyone-apart-from-the-author's-favourites are, no scenes where Death shows up to tell Harry that Hermione is his true love and Ron and Ginny suck... and no instances where Hermione's parents are named "Dan" and "Emma."

All right, we got a couple of pretty eye-rolling twists and some questionable character choices... but it wasn't THAT bad. At least there was some good dialogue and Scorpius Malfoy was a damn cool character.

***** I've read truly awful fanfiction. CC is not that bad, yes. But it's more awful, then it is mainly due to the fact that it's JKR work, and there for should be canon. Not that we would/do accept it as canon. Plus Time travel? Come On! She said she wouldn't do that. Not that her words matter any. She changes her mind more frequently than a teenage girl.

  It's 1998, and Tom Marvolo Riddle has apparently won, so the Sorting Hat decides to travel back in time and *try* to do something about that. Alternate Universe results. Manipulative! Sorting Hat. One-off piece. Humour/Tragedy, rated 'M' for occasional swear-words or strong language. (Punctuation corrections, 9th March, 2014)

** Hogwarts Houses Divided (this story is in the book club this month). It's next gen (Teddy as a main char). It is not really sorting people to unexpected houses, but after sorting, the hat claims it put some kids 'somewhere they don't belong'.

  For a thousand years the Sorting Hat has put students where they fit best. Only a handful of times throughout history has it ever been said the Hat picked wrongly. In the year of 1991, that's the only thing people were saying. On the one-thousandth-and-one year of Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat decided to change things around. Pity it didn't tell anyone beforehand.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

** So, the Hat puts kids where they want to be, with a little consideration for their natural talents, and a large amount of consideration for how many kids are being sorted into each house. The primary function of the Sorting Hat is to separate kids into easier to manage groups.

The End.

It is often treated like this is a monumental life-changing moment... but the only reason that might be true is because the kids /make it true/. If you tell a kid 'you are a brave person' then they will almost certainly attempt to live up to that deceleration, regardless of their personality. The Sorting Hat doesn't give a shit where you go, what house you're stuck in, or what you want, except in a sort of advisory capacity. The main reason for its existence, and the existence of the houses, is to make children easier to manage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11766805/1/Faith-And-The-Devil][Faith and the Devil]] highlights this fairly well.

Not the only reason. There's also the “you are moulded by those you spend time with” factor.

But yes, it's made into a whole lot bigger deal than it is.
