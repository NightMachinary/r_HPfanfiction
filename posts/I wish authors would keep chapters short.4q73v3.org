I've been reading The Pureblood Pretense which starts off with great chapter lengths but progressively increases in length to the point where chapters are 30k words. 30k words is a novella! Maybe its just me, but I wish authors would keep chapters below 5,000 words.


** 30K seems a bit excessive, though I consider 4-5K about the minimum length these days.

** I don't mind a long chapter as long as they actually use the words to tell the story instead of using them as filler.

** Sounds like you need a kindle. It'll save your place for you, and I guess you could read in sprints of 5k words. There's no need for you to read all 30k in one go.

I, personally, love lengthy chapters. It's the chapters below 1k that get me. It takes time to mentally shift to a story, and if the story's only progressed a few paragraphs, its likely unfulfilling to read since the plot has moved little. So while I read WIPs gladly, I'll wait a few months to check on a story if updates are fairly small.

*** Reading fic in my Kindle has changed my life. 100% support this suggestion.

**** Do the newer kindles have larger screens or a scroll option? I had one of the earlier touch screen ones and I would read it so fast that my arm hurt from having to constantly page forward. I ended up giving it to my sister, it just was not functional for me. Scrolling down on the laptop is so much easier.

***** There's several sizes available now, I believe. There's also non-touch screen options with page turn buttons. Maybe that would be easier for you?

****** Thanks, it would be nice to find something more portable. My laptop is a touchscreen, which makes it easy to read on, but it has a 17 inch screen and is somewhat heavy. Its great for reading in the bed, but not so much for taking to appointments. I guess I just want something middle ground, easy to carry, but not so small that I get annoyed. Back to the original question though, a friend told me yesterday that I can install the kindle app on the laptop, its free and includes all of the normal features like bookmarking. I will be checking it out as soon as I get home.

** Agreed. Even if the app I use saves my place, I still hate stopping mid chapter. Though I've always felt a good chapter should be between 3k and 5k. It really depends on the flow.

** Unlike conventional novels where the writer is contending with the publisher over how many pages they need to write in order to make a bestseller, fanfiction exists in a different model. For the long stories that are published at an inconsistent pace, each chapter becomes more like an episode of an ongoing tv series. Each chapter has to tell its own portion of the story, preferably with a consistent theme or tone throughout. That's how I write them, anyway. It takes more words to convey all the happenings within that framework.

** 30k for a chapter? Woah.... Sounds like something I'd like, but I download the fic to my google play books, so I can save my point wherever. Reading that much on a computer must be a mess.
