#+TITLE: What would you think of someone writing a story from another fandom that is NOT a HP crossover, but incorporates Harry Potter 'world' elements? Set in a different century and country, no HP specific terms?

** of course you are free to use whatever you want! It's fanfiction, and even if it weren't, this kind of derivation is common to fantasy.

** I mean you have complete creative license when writing your own works. If you wish to loan ideas from different worlds that's fine. I'd be hesitant in my avoidance of using certain terms though. Describing something as Quidditch with the caveat of it not being called that is weird. There's nothing wrong with similar terminology and it won't suddenly cause it to be a full fledged crossover.

*** Thanks for the encouragement. So far in this story, there was only a reference to the guy having played a Quidditch-like game in dialogue, and not an actual scene of anyone playing it, so the name didn't come up. The character is a French guy, so it's possible that the French at that time could have had their own name for the game, like 'Ballon Ã  balai,' for broom ball.

** It is not a fanfic at that point, just call it a original work. How many fantasy works got inspire by tolkien? You are free to be inspired.

*** Thanks. I'm probably going to develop this story into an original work later. It doesn't feature the main Disney characters, though they are mentioned by name. Later that can be changed if I decide to P2P. :)
