After reading that fic, it does feel like a waste that the car was only mentioned in the Chamber of Secrets but never again seen in the other books.

I also now know why I keep on seeing the Forests of Valbone get recommended. Too bad that its intended sequel never came out.

Updates: No one has recommended anything yet so I'm going to bounce around some story ideas:

1) Sirius Black uses the car as a hideout during the time he was lurking around Hogwarts to kill Wormtail and eventually uses it to escape instead of riding on Buckbeak. The story then turns into a series about Sirius Black's Radical Roadtrip.

2) The Ministry Six use the car to go to the Department of Mysteries instead of riding on Threstals.

3) The car helps out in the Battle of Hogwarts.

4) Hagrid initially hates the car that he sees lots of times in the forest as he does his game keeper duties because it's not a magical creature but the car eventually grows on him.


** Does a fic where Aragog and the acromantulas use the car as a communal 'cum-sock' count?
