From what I can tell by skimming through various sources, there's no mention of Viktor's middle name or anything about his parents beyond referring to them as Mr and Mrs Krum.

As you may know, in many Slavic countries it is custom to have a patronymic as a middle name. Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia in case anyone's unfamiliar:

#+begin_quote
  Typically, a Bulgarian person inherits the last name of his father's family (family name), as well as a patronymic based on his father's given name, with a gender-agreeing suffix usually added. For example, Stoyan Georgiev Draganov would be the son of Georgi Petkov Draganov.

  Patronymic, name derived from that of a father or paternal ancestor, usually by the addition of a suffix or prefix meaning “son.” 
#+end_quote

Now obviously Viktor doesn't /need/ to have a middle name, but I wanted to pop the question in case anyone has/recalls the information. If it exists.

And in case JKR never mentioned it, is there a fanon/headcanon out there about it? I'll come up with some background on him myself in any case, but if someone's already got ideas I'm open to suggestions.


** I'm pretty sure that you have already put more thought into this than Rowling ever did. I can't recall ever seeing Krum's middle name in a fic, much less a fandom consensus, but I also haven't read many fics where he's a major character.

I do think following the Slavic tradition makes sense though.

*** I am afraid he knows more patronymics than JKR did.

*** Except Dagmar is a female name so it doesn't really work as a patronym.

** I've never seen any middle names for Viktor Krum before and I'm not well-versed in patronymics, but here are a few names that you could derive the middle name of your choice from:

• Boris -- “typical” Slavic name, but it could mean “short,” “wolf,” or “snow leopard”. Latter two meanings could suit Viktor quite well imo.

• Ognyan -- Means “fiery”

• Stamen -- Means “firm”

• Tihomir -- Comes from name elements meaning “quiet” and “peace, world”

Disclaimer: I got all of these names from the /Behind the Name/ site, which could be wrong about their meanings. However, they haven't been wrong yet on their confirmed (not submitted) names, so I trust them fairly well.

** The way Viktor was described in the books (not how he looked in the movies) he was weird-looking and ungainly on the ground, graceful only in the air. “He looked like an overgrown bird of prey.” His walk was described as “duck footed.” That made me wonder if Rowling was hinting at some non-human ancestry in his background, like he inherited flying skill but not looks from some veela ancestor or something. You could look into Slavic folklore for some flying mythological beast, and pick a name related to that.

** It's Viktor Chadev Krum, since his father was Chad Theman Krum
