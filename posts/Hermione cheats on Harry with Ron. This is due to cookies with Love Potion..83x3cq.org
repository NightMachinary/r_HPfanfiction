**** I don't think I've ever rage-quit a fic like I just did this one. I have pretty think skin and usually tolerate the troll fics and seriously bad stuff long enough to get bored or laugh at it or stop for other reasons, but this one made me want to print out the fic so I could burn it.

I mean damn, people really think thinking like the characters in this fic is ok?

****** It was basically the underlying view of the fic seemed to be "Your girlfriend you were about to propose to lost her virginity involuntarily (rape) thus it is OK to dump her.". Or to put it more harshly: The main person wronged by the rape was the boyfriend/girlfriend of the victim.

And I wouldn't even of had a problem with it if it was a single characters view or if it was portrayed as morally questionable or whatever. It isn't even that this fic is an argument that this is the right thing to do, it is merely accepted as background that this is how the world works.

I was really really really not ok with that.

I have more details in my resonse to [[/u/AutumnSouls]]

******* That sucks. Seems like it'd be a good guilty fic if the whole 'love potion' thing was just erased, and everything was consensual.

****** The first few chapters of the fic (that I made it through) basically devolved into "Why it is your significant others fault if they get raped and it is ok to abandon them as impure".

I don't even know why this needs to be said but: If you abandon your significant other *because they are raped*, you are an evil person.

And not some character or group holding that view, or someone feeling this irrationally or whatever. Literally every situation in the first few chapters is reenforcing this.

- Harry and Luna are good with "You were under a love potion, so now you are impure and not worthy of dating". Harry does this immediately after setting up to propose.
- Hermione and Ron (the ones put under a love potion) immediately sees it as a betrayal of Harry instead of a violation of themselves. Ron starts out refuseing, but it is portrayed as his selfishness/thick. As soon as they said "what if it was luna" he immediately changed to the default position of this fic.
- All the spectators (Weasley family, black family) are immediately behind this.
- Hermione's father and Luna's father are immediately brought around to the self blame. Hermione's father is brought around by saying "Well what if it happened to your wife".

You'll note that everyone seems to come around to 'what if it happened to you', giving only the barest cardboard cut-out to responses that would NOT be ok with this that are all immediately knocked down.

I was pretty damn sure if I kept reading it would be announced in the paper and the entire world would be behind Harry in this. :|

It isn't that the premise couldn't be done well. I would have been fine with any of the following:

- Harry leaves in a rage before the truth can be explained, and you get a series of miscommunications / escalations that make it impossible to reconcile. Bonus points here if he ends up with someone besides who he started with, instead of the traditional 'fair' resolution
- Harry or Luna feeling betrayed even though they know it is irrational
- The weakening of the relationship causing things to break later when they didn't in cannon.
- Setting it up so Magicals view love potions differently than muggles view rape.

So it isn't so much the premise I had a problem with. But this fic signaling that these characters were acting appropriately for the situation.... No. This is not ok. :|
