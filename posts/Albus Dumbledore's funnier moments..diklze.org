I've been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay]], and one thing I've noticed is that Dumbledore is a highly talented goofball who's responsible for quite a lot of the fic's funnier dialogue.

I'm only halfway through, but I think I'll be up to date on the latest chapter fairly soon, so when that happens, could anyone recommend other fics where Dumbledore is entertaining? With witty humour or getting into absurdist situations or who-knows-what?


** Albus and Harry's World Trip linkffn(13388022)

Harry gets expelled after the Chamber of Secrets. So Dumbledore offers his services as a private tutor for the low cost of 1 knut a year (he actually hasn't directly taught in years you see, there should be a discount).

#+begin_quote
  Albus knocked on the door of the building and spoke in Gobbledegook to the goblin who answered the door.

  Harry bowed. "Thank you for welcoming me to..." and then faithfully repeated the Gobbledegook phrase he had been taught by Albus.

  The goblin looked at Harry for a moment, then looked up at Albus whose eyes were sparkling with joy. When he spoke to Harry, it was in clear English. "Can you repeat that?"

  Harry frowned and concentrated. He repeated the phrase precisely, then spoke in an uncertain voice. "That is how you pronounce the name of the village, isn't it?"

  The goblin looked back up at Albus and rolled his eyes. "The name of the village is Dewbrook. What you just said was 'Goblins are Awesome'. To be fair, we are awesome. Come on in."

  Harry looked up at Albus in shock. "I thought you wanted to build my trust."

  Albus's eyes sparkled with blatant mirth. "Pranks don't count. Come on, let's make you a fortune."

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

**** It's been a while since I've read it so I can't recall any specifics to confirm or deny that claim, but it generally leans into the humor/crack/absurdist side of things. (Harry, raised by a Naruto villain? It could hardly be anything else IMO.)

Also, you were specifically asking for entertaining Dumbledore, which it has in spades.

**** I wasn't a big fan of the fic as a whole, but god damn does it have the most hilarious Dumbledore I've ever seen. I would LOVE to read an abridged version that cuts out the Naruto stuff (which I've never read, so it's meaningless to me) and really just focuses on Dumbledore.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
