This offers an explanation of why special magic, like metamorphmagus ability, pops up out of nowhere and then runs in families. The first metamorphmagus in a line really needed the ability sometime in childhood and got lucky, and their kids pick it up with less luck and less need because their magic can use the parent's as an example to imitate.

Also, it explains why parseltongue is where it is and not elsewhere. It's reliably passed down the Gaunt family because growing up surrounded by snakes and by people who communicate primarily in parseltongue, Gaunt children have a lot of need for the ability and also a lot of early childhood exposure. It would take phenomenally bad luck for one of them not to pick it up. It's rare elsewhere in Britain, because who there has a pressing need to communicate with snakes in early childhood? But in places with relatively many snakes, especially venomous snakes, like parts of India and Australia, magical children who play outdoors often develop parseltongue. In Magical America, parselmouths are stereotyped as Floridian rather than as dark magic users.

Further, something similar but to a lesser extent could explain why Padfoot, Prongs, and Wormtail picked up the Animagus transformation so young, when it's supposed to be very hard even for adult transfiguration experts. They were young enough to still have somewhat malleable magic, and spent most of their time in the presence of Moony, who regularly got turned into an animal and could provide an example of how human-to-animal transfiguration works. This could also explain why the Ministry didn't expect Sirius to escape Azkaban using his dog form: usually, the animagus transformation is intellectually difficult, and no one can do complex calculations when near Dementors, but Sirius can turn into a dog without much thought because the transformation is inscribed on his magic rather than on his mind.

This is an excuse to write an OP Harry, or to inconvenience him with bizarre abilities that are more confusing than useful. Here's some ideas for extra magic abilities you could have his undifferentiated magic activate when it's frantically activating all the things:

- Obviously parseltongue
- Metamorphmagus ability, just as obviously
- Seer ability
- Veela allure and wandless fireball creation
- Conjuring temporary gold, like leprechauns
- Something that goblins have but don't brag about, so we don't see it in canon, like a magical sense for how much gold is in a container, or automatic skill with bladed weapons
- Something that hasn't appeared in the magical world in generations, because the situation that used to activate it out of nowhere doesn't happen anymore, and the families that it ran in died out or stopped inheriting it

  - Like maybe a magical sense for distorted spacetime, which used to be activated when fae stole children into pocket dimensions full of wacky spacetime, and Merlin sealed off the fae realms as one of his final acts on Earth

  Everyone knows that wizarding children often take on an aspect of magic during their childhood. Innate specialties. Children of quidditch players might be able to fly without a broom for a time, those raised by fisherman might be able to manipulate water with great ease. Harry Potter comes to Hogwarts able to heal from any injury. At least he's got Tom keeping him company.

** Harry's talent for Defense could come from him growing up with the Piece of defensive magic that was Lily Blood protection and what ever Dumbledore Did to it to make it last as long as he Thought of Privet drive as home.

Could also be why Harry Learns the Patronus So young and can teach it it others.( or the Effects that learning it as his First piece of Big magic as such a young age could have on him)

*** Imagine if the Fidelius charm affected him with some bizarre ability to hide secrets in his mind.....not as a full occlumens but as someone who subconciously keeps certain things to himself only. Like how Snape couldn't see his childhood or any memories he doesn't know or atleast have an idea about. That would also explain why Dumbledore is against him learning about the prophecy until he knows occlumens since Voldie also knows about the prophecy so Harry's shield won't work on him.

** Just a few snippets from how I imagine this to go:

​

"Hermione, I woke up covered in gold again"

​

"Ginny, stop trying to get into my pants, WE ARE IN THE GREAT HALL" -Male Veelas exist

​

"Colin, stop trying to get into my pants, WE ARE STILL IN THE GREAT HALL"

​

"Fuck it, I'm gonna be a woman today... RON STOP TRYING TO GET INTO MY PANTS" -Genderfluid Harry because why not

​

"I have a horrible feeling that that rat is going to try and kill me one day. Last time I got a feeling like this the soup incident happened. I am therefore going to put this rat in an unbreakable cage."

​

"Why is everybody so surprised I can talk to snakes? I mean, I seem to have every single other magical gift so why the hell not this one?"

​

"I'm having cravings for milk again. Nobody tidy up tonight, I got this"

​

"The dragons are arguing about who has the hottest flame. I don't know what you expected, honestly."

** So, in other words, when a trigger event happens, the wizard's magic recognizes the event from the state of the host, the surrounding context, and the flood of stress responses. The magic then discards everything it doesn't need, distilling itself down to one efficient, case-specific task suited to the host.

Sounds like /Worm/ mate.

*** You seem to think I said a bunch of stuff I wasn't trying to say. I guess there's some similarity to Worm, in that special abilities can arise in response to a need, but there's minimal customization for the host and context (abilities are just picked or not from a list), no discarding (metamorphs and parselmouths get to keep their general-purpose magic), and no actual need for a trigger event and a stress response.

**** I suppose I may have misinterpreted your statements about "bizarre abilities" "popping out of nowhere" in response to "needing all the help you can get."

I assumed some level of customization must be inherent in your progress for such niche bloodline abilities to emerge with no precedent (E.G. Salazar Slytherin, the supposed first parselmouth, who originated an ability not seen from the "list" before).

The /Worm/ mechanics also include the heritability effect you mention, where Shards/magic can "pick up" the powers of the parent, and group triggers which result in capes with near-identical powersets, which fits with your Marauders example.

I believe the "stress response" interpretation was me being conditioned by the fanon "magic is about intent" trope, which made me assume that the wizard had to, at some level, believe they needed said powers for them to be unlocked by your mechanism. I see now that this was not your intent.
