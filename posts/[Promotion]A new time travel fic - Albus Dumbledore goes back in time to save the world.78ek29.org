Probably the best time travel fic you will ever read (well, at least if I don't write another one).

** -Probably the best time travel fic you will ever read (well, at least if I don't write another one).

We need to know why it is the best. What seperates it from others? Why should we read /this/ one?

Edit: +OP is a troll+ He ain't OP, that's sarcasm.

Edit2: Read the story, sorry mr OP of post.

** It's pretty amazing. I especially love the double theme of redemption that you've got going on, where Albus accepts responsibility for his past mistake of judging Tom back in the orphanage by extending him a true second chance. Tom, finally being allowed to be the person he always wanted to be deep down, will slowly learn that the world is not completely against him. being a positive yet leading influence in the world will allow him to reach his true potential and probably slay mad pussy too because let's be honest all those curcios are just sexual frustration peace out.
