** I don't recall any fics in particular, as most of them sucked, but I have seen hatred against Muggles justified through the Dursleys.

Huh. Interesting AU plot point - Voldemort influences the Dursleys in a way such that they hate Harry. Harry grows up to hate Muggles, and he's "saved" by the magical world. Actually, it could do without Voldemort, but still a possible way to justify distaste against Muggles as a whole.

Still, it's difficult to justify outright racism, especially with muggleborn characters like Harry's /own mother/ and Hermione existing. It would require quite a bit of indoctrination for Harry to reach Malfoy-levels of Muggle-hate, and much more for him to be openly willing to kill Muggles on sight, or not batting an eye at the death of a Muggle or Muggleborn.

** linkffn(3464303) this one satisfies your request bang on. In this Harry looks down upon muggleborns and hates all muggles due to Dursley's treatment of him

also linkffn(6254783) also shows a purist Harry who only discriminates upon magic. He sets out to unite all wizards against muggles

*** I tried reading "dark lord potter" but despite the excellent premise I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. the author uses too many all caps for things that don't really deserve them, set harry up as an immediate friend of the goblins as well as the Malfoys and his friend Tonks seems too accepting of the fact that the dark lord killed her father. in short there are so many cliches and inaccurate character reactions that it makes it not only a difficult read but an unbelievable one at that. normally I wouldn't be so bothered but I love the idea of a Dark!harry potter and seeing a fanfic that could have been excellent merely be mediocre hurts.

  Seven Year AU. Suppose the Dursleys had not been Harry's only living relations. How might the young hero that we know and adore have been changed by a loving childhood? The differences might not be as universally positive as one might think. Discontinued.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
