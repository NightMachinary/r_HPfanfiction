Well some may have chosen to fight because they hated the Death Eaters, I would assume that at least some such as the Lupins or Fred died to protect Harry. So wouldn't that reactivate the protection? It could be that the killer has to commit the murder themselves or that in fact it was a newly added protection that knocked Voldemort out in the forest but since no unplanned horcrux was created his body remained intact this time. Thoughts?


** They didn't die to protect Harry, and, most importantly, they didn't die willingly.

"...I didn't defend myself. I meant to let him kill me."

"And that will, I think, have made all the difference."

*** Well Voldemort's warning is something along the lines: "Give me Harry Potter and none shall be harmed." and actually the whole battle of Hogwarts happens because they are trying to give Harry time to find the Horcrux.

**** But they're not sacrificing themselves, they're fighting. It seems clear that part of what is needed is for the person to basically stand there, willingly accepting death, and let themselves be killed in order to save someone they love. Not in a heroic last stand, but as a willing lamb to the slaughter. Think like Jesus

***** I think that might be the correct explanation but it's not specifically mentioned in the books. After all is the Lupins, Fred's, Collin's and the other fifty nameless people's sacrifice lesser than Harry's?

** Did Riddle himself kill those people? Besides, it isn't love for Harry, in this case. Save for a few people, it's loyalty to Harry, or to Hogwarts. There are those who chose to fight because Britain under Riddle's thumb is unacceptable to them.

Also, Riddle got knocked to the floor because he inadvertently killed a part of himself. Aside from this instance, Canon does not tell us what happens when someone destroys their own horcrux. Had it been the protection reactivating, Riddle would have been incorporeal again.

*** That's what I said. But in Lily's case it was only one person required to perform the sacrifice so it shouldn't matter whether there were a hundred people or just one.

** There's a LOT more to the protection than simply dying for someone, otherwise there wouldn't be only one ___-Who-Lived. For instance; Voldemort would have to do the killing (which he couldn't have due to sitting out the battle), the person dying must have preformed whatever ritual/enchantment/potion/spell/process ahead of time or already been in possession of the protection, the individual dying to activate the ability specifically must be given a chance(or three) to be spared, and the example in question didn't deactivate it was only potentially weakened and no longer fueling Dumbledore's wards on #4 Privet Drive(which paired with Voldie's ability to physically affect Harry from GOF on made it useless against anything except for the AK in conjunction with Harry's semi-Horcrux status).

*** The ritual part is fanon. In fact Voldemort finds the Potters completely unprepared and Dumbledore uses the word 'unknowingly' several times when referring to Lily's protection. Also Harry performs no ritual and still gives everyone else the protection. He is also asked only once to meet Voldemort in the forest.

**** As mentioned, Harry had the protection and as such had the ability to pass it on. And again, if Lily didn't do something ahead of time then why aren't their any other People-Who-Lived in the current day and age? Besides, it's mentioned in Voldemort's return speech in GOF that he was academically aware that the sacrificial protection was a possibility(Old Magic, he called it if I'm remembering correctly), if not seen in use for ages and therefore incredibly rare and likely complicated to preform.

***** I don't recall ever being stated that Harry passed on his mother's protection. He just re-did the whole thing when Voldemort asked him to come to the forest as he had allowed his friends to die for him and if he doesn't he threatens to kill all people that may try to harbor or help him. And that's when it goes into effect.

Ah, no. That wasn't the protection, at least not the same one from Lily. That was the elder wand rebelling against Riddle. None of those spells rebounded on Riddle, did they?

I mean look at Riddle's final fight before Harry reveals himself in the Great hall. He's fighing three people, at once. They're holding their own against the guy. Then Bella dies, and instantly all three people fighting him get knocked down because his magic reacted through his body instead of the wand.

Riddle lost this war at the end because he was too stupid to realize the wand he was using was still fighting him after Snape died. Had he used his original wand, he would have(at the very least) killed Harry in the great hall.

***** No, Harry applied his own protection by meaning to die for the defenders of Hogwarts,

***** It's actually something that Harry states. I don't have the book near me so I'm paraphrasing but he says something along the lines: "you won't be hurting anyone anymore. Because of my sacrifice you can't hurt any of them any longer."
