To give context after some years of not reading the books and just reading fanfiction, I started to read the books once more but found out that thanks to fanfiction and all the notions it gave me (right or wrong) I can not enjoy it like the first time, I concentrate to much on details that in the books don't matter that much but in fanfiction are the points that cause the divergence.

Has anyone else experience this and if someone can recommend to overcome it I would be thankfull


** To me, the 6th and especially the 7th book are the reason I started reading fanfiction, because I disliked too many things in them. So I don't really have that issue, I mostly reread parts of the books while writing atm, to make sure I'm compliant to the parts I want to be. (which is never book 7)

** Personally I find the opposite to be the case.

The books are like a cleansing wind that reminds me why I like HP in the first place, and all the Flanderization of Ron and Hermione, sympathetic portrayals of Snape/Draco/Voldemort, helpful goblins, trust vaults, jogging and training, and point-and-shoot magic just blows away like the annoying dirt that it is.

** Most of my go to fanfics are some form of super!Harry. Reading through canon Harry blundering his way through the obstacles presented to him just makes me want to scream now.
