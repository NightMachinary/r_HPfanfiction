Fics where Harry is powerful, but like not the "goblin heir" type. A fic where he gains the power in a logical way and has to earn it and isn't just some 11 year old old blowing up shit.

Linkffn(The World I Leave Behind) is a great example and I loved it

Preferably not a fic where he is too OOC or one of those 'Lord Potter-Black-Peverell' and whatnot

Thanks


** You know these stories with ridiculous Heir bull crap really gives a bad name to the few good ones. Like I literally saw a story where was the heir to 20 houses and it was so obvious they only do so they can have a "logical" reason to have a harem.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  Harry went into the forbidden forest to let Voldemort kill him, but was taken prisoner, instead. He is believed to be dead, and Ginny, Ron, and Hermione struggle to find a way forward. Canon is followed up to Chapter 34 of Deathly Hallows. Please R&R.
