I'm looking for the wistful, melancholy sort of sad fics, rather than the grimdark, everything-is-terrible sort of sad. Basically, more unhappiness, no torture. I haven't really read many in that area, so I'm curious what's available.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** Imma reccommend linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean69)

It's a marauder story with Remus from 1st year to OoTP. It's not always sad but jesus it tugs the heartstrings. Especially the Epilogue Out of the Blue...

It's the story that brings me to tears at multiple points. I've reread it god knows how many times and still, just any part of Grant and I'm in bits.... Even thinking about Grant in the record shop and I'm weeping.., or Remus and Hope....eugh.

Oh also!! li inkao3(into the arena by LullabyKnell).

There's a chapter where Teddy and Harry meet...some important people and oh holy crap, just gets me every single time. It's the story I go to when I need a cry. That heartbreaking "oh darling no!". Bawling. Absolutely bawling. Again, the whole fic isn't sad but the sad bits hit like a tonne of bricks.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

  Canon-compliant up to most of DH, more than 10 years later in a hyper-magical, post-apocalyptic Britain, a spectator sneaks into the empty Once-Ministry to watch Harry Potter and Voldemort's final duel. Unfortunately, just as victory finally arrives, an unlikely escape triggers an unexpected beginning.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

*** The anti-torture thing is more of a "Please, no torture porn or gore-nography" deal. I find a lot of that stuff falls into really shitty body horror territory quite quickly, but some people count those kind of stories as 'sad fics' and since I really don't enjoy reading about bodily mutilation and people being forced to do things to their squelchy bits, I felt it was important to state in advance that it was a no-no.

Oooh, I like the look of your one. True Form is definitely going on the list. Thanks!

And the story it was inspired by: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][Dudley's memories]] by paganaidd. Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Complete. FFNet.

Now, nearly a decade later, Regulus's world changes again when his brother is released back into his care- damaged but alive.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/][I see the moon]] by hctiB-notsoB. Avengers crossover. Gen. "While on the run, Bruce meets a young man who speaks to the moon. He's probably not quite the sanest friend Bruce could have made, but, well...beggers can't be choosers. Unfinished. FFNet.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11799474?view_full_work=true#main][The Blood on my hands .. It scares me to death.]] by Rosemary Rabbit. Avengers Crossover. The fight against Voldemort went on for years. In the final confrontation, Harry found himself not at King's Cross, but in a whole different world - one without wizards, and without magic. He flew under the radar for two years, but when the Chitauri invaded Harry couldn't help but act. His attempt to protect civilians caught the attention of SHIELD. After meeting the Avengers, Harry quickly finds himself entangled in far more than he bargained for. All he wanted was a safe place to stay off the streets during the winter.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9622291/1/][Avatar]] by Von. Avatar (movies) crossover. Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom.
