Teddy who is being raised by Harry and Ginny is kidnapped by Remus I think? All I remember is that harry is a professional quidditch player, he and Ginny live in the Godric's Hollow and teddy is really young, like 4 or 5 years old. I don't remember anything else but I think that story was well written and I had liked it at the time.

If anyone remembers what this is please help me find it!


** Pretty sure its on SIYE but cant remember the title or author. Try on the Harry/Ginny reddit page
