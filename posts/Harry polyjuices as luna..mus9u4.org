Harry becomes fed up of the bullies and Luna is being passive as always. So he secretly takes one of her hair and convinces another one of his friends to keep Luna busy while he deals with the bullies. The result? Half the Ravenclaw students are suddenly terrified of Luna after a rather unfortunate string of incidents.


** Luna as always probably already know what Harry did, after Gibbs slapping him she says thanks

** But for some reason, and to her dormmates relief, Luna had been stuck at the entrance of the Ravenclaw room trying to figure out whether there's a sound if a Whomping Willow knocks an enchanted car and there's no one to hear it.

** I actually remember something like that where Luna befriends Hermione and her friends and about 5 of them terrorise the bullying Ravenclaws but Luna has a rock solid alibi because she was in the Great Hall the whole time and the bullies sound crazy talking about 5 Lunas attacking them. I think it was linkao3(coven by naidhe)

**** Darn, I knew it was something I'd read recently about Hermione and a group of friends but it seems I got the wrong fanfic. You're right, it is in New blood.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”

** Pretty similar to one of the side plots in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood][New Blood]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/494464/][artemisgirl]]

*** With 666k words in 275 chapters... could you give the general neighbourhood of the scene? +/-5 chapters.

And since I'm already at it, what did you like the most about the fic itself?

**** Yes definitely- this fic follows Hermione‘s life through years one through seven at Hogwarts with one point of departure: before she reaches Hogwarts, there is a prophecy told about her. She ends up having a very different experience and the author does a great job of building a complex, deep magical world.

Each chapter is one scene. It's an uncommon structure for chapters but I really enjoy it

***** Sounds interesting. And the general location of the Luna subplot? If it's not too much trouble, that is.

** A similar plot happens in [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/73][chapter 73 of /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], during a 10-chapter arc about heroism and bullying. Anticipating a bullying encounter, one student gets an older student to pose as them, to catch the bullies off guard. I won't spoil in this comment who those students are.

(Warning: /HPMOR/ is a polarizing story, and many commenters on this sub-Reddit dislike it.)
