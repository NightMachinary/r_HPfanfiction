Hey guys,

need something to read ;)

This time I'd like stories about a Harry that's affected by the Dursley abuse, because frankly: It's bloody unlikely that someone can take all that abuse (cupboard, being called freak, being hit (no, not beated all day every day, but every once in a while...frying pan scene, enough said!) etc. etc.) and turn out decently (unless Dumbledore kind of messed with his head so that hatred can't develop or something...now that's an interesting premisses, as it would explain a radical personality shift if those bonds break or get removed!) normal (and Harry is pretty normal, he only has a sad lack of self-worth because he never sticks up for himself and thinks everybody elses life is worth more than his!)!

Can be anything from distrusting all adults to prefering to live on the streets to the Dursleys and everything in between (plotting revenge, wanting to protect himself at all costs, being cold like Tom Riddle, being driven etc. etc.)

Bonus points if he doesn't forgive Dumbledore for sticking him there and for having the Dursleys punished (Azkaban sounds like a great place for them!)

As always:

- please no slash
- only very very very good Harry/Ginny

There, the stage is your's :) and thank you for your recommendations in advance!

greetings LAX


** I really like how it is handled in this (completed!) series:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Series-1-The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs]])

The first Book spends a lot of time "fixing" Harry's hangups from the Dursleys. Later the series moves on from that topic though.

** linkao3(Stealing Harry) and linkffn(8246904; 11585823) are good. linkffn(12698097) has brief mentions and in chapter 4 Remus finally takes Harry out of the situation.

  How different would Harry Potter's first year of school have been if the Dursleys had successfully suppressed Harry's natural curiosity? This NARRATIVE shows what could have been.

  In the presence of lighthouses, the children whose eyes brim with hope and daring, she momentarily forgets that XXXX stands for dangerous and that there are people you must leave to drown to keep the light on. How frightening it is, to have something worth losing. [mermaid!OC, AU, Remus-adopts-Harry, wizard!Dudley]

  AU The Dursleys taught Harry to fear and hate magic and all things magical including himself. Now how long will it take the wizarding world see the damage done? And can they ever hope to fix it? Disturbing. WIP
