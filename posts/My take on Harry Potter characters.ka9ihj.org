To begin with, I would like to say that all this is my opinion.

So I have read Harry Potter fanfiction for years and this has lead me to a lot of places. I felt the need to discuss my views on the characters. This is all my opinion but I would like to see how other people view them. Also, some of these opinions are a tad bit unfair. This is because I am almost certain that She Who Must Not Be Named did not plan everything out from the beginning. Some of the same characters that I dislike on here are my favorite ones in certain fanfictions. So it really all depends on how they are portrayed for me.

Dumbledore- So this is by far the hardest one for me. I truthfully do not think Dumbledore is super evil or anything. However, the canon Dumbledore is either grossly incompetent or an absolute bastard.... or both. My main point for this is Harry's first year. So Dumbledore knows or at least suspects that Voldemort or a really competent minion of his is after the Philosopher Stone (why else would he move it out of Gringotts). So, he moves it out of a supposedly super secure bank.... to a school full of children. Now, this is where my issue comes up. Let us assume for a minute that he was just be extra precautious and did not actually think anyone was gonna attempt to get it.... Then he receives news that someone attempted to steal it and managed to escape Gringotts. This shows that he has to know that the person is somewhat powerful and, most of all, dangerous. Then the troll gets out. So it got somehow let out... This should have been a wake up call. Ignoring all this, Voldemort is supposedly insane and the most evil dark lord like ever (I doubt that sometimes but some fanfictions do that title justice). If he was really desperate, or just insane, he could have just set the Basilisk out to be a distraction.... or to attempt to kill Dumbledore. Really anything could have happened. And seeing how Dumbledore did not know about it, the Basilisk could have gone into the great hall and killed a ton of students. Of course, one could argue that Voldemort would not do that because his minions children were in the school.... However Voldemort was hopped up on unicorn juice and was not a very generous dude. I think if he thought for a second it would benefit him, he would sacrifice all of them. Anyone, this is getting a bit long, so to summarize I think cannon makes him seem a little incompetent or at least willing to sacrifice anyone for 'the greater good'. Saying this, I can only read so many stories that show him as this evil/manipulative dude before it gets really stale. I truthfully like fanfics that make him more interesting. Not the same old manipulative old coot.

Harry- An angsty teenager (given he has some right to be). I love reading hp fanfics and most them show him, so I do have a fondness for him. However, he is just a brave/angsty teen trying to do good. Him as a character in Fanon is where stuff gets interesting. I have read everything from him being a God/Satan to him being dimwit. He is, in my opinion, a very easy character to change to your liking to make into anything you want.

Hermione- A nerd.... with the potential to be a total badass. Seriously, I love stories where she rips reality a new one. I have gotten really tired of stories where she is a stuck up dimwit though. It gets grating after a while.

Ron- A friend who was a youngest child and a bit jealous/disloyal. However, I love fanfictions that add more to his character. It gets really boring reading bashing after a while. He was not a saint (and personally I would not have been his friend), but dear god when 40% of your fanfiction is bashing then it sucks. I really appreciate stories that just have the main character not interact with him if he does not like him. That way, even if the author does not like him, he does not focus his story around his dislike for him.

Remus- Like every other character on here, Remus can be really cool if done right... However he gives me serious dead beat dad vibes. Maybe that just me.

Sirius- While he made some questionable choice, Sirius give me cool/irresponsible uncle vibes.

Molly- Dear god am I tried of stories that rag on her. I do not even like her. But you can only read so many stories about this evil witch mastermind of love potions before your brain rots. I prefer it when the author either makes her an interesting/normal character or does not involve her much in the story.

Ginny- So I have never understood why people use the excuse that she looks like Lily Potter to not pair her with Harry. I, personally, feel like she is a really bland character and generally would rather her not be paired with Harry. However, some fics make her seem like a cool, badass tomboy so that is fun. I get tired of the fangirl bashing thing though.

Snape- So I am kind of mixed on this character. On one hand he is a dick, but on the other he is still a dick. Do not get me wrong, some stories show him as a great mentor/father figure. Just that, more Canon then Fanon, he is an ass who bullies kids. Guess it depends on the story... though I have one fanfic where he travels back in time which was really awesome.

Anyway, that is it for now. As you can probably tell, Dumbledore is my biggest hang up Harry Potter. More because it is really hard to make a case for him without beating Canon with a stick... or maybe I am wrong and missed something?


** The way I look at it is that Dumbledore was a manipulative bastard in canon and it's very easy to make him rotten to some degree because of it. At least if you want him competent; otherwise senility works. But a kinder way to think of him (when playing him more positively) is the academic in the ivory tower. He's been Headmaster and isolated to some degree in Hogwarts for so long, he's lost touch with people (he no longer teaches, there's no open door policy, he mostly only sees the children at meals and in passing). He sees things in the abstract and has forgotten how contrary and messy people and life itself are. It's like that Simpsons clip when the Principal wonders if he is really that far out of touch and then decides that no, the children are.

Remus is another that is so easy to put on either side of the fence. Short of outright cruelty, I can accept the deadbeat dad vibes but I can also see him as the supportive but (frequently) out of the loop guy. I rarely can predict which version I'll get in a story. I'm actually having a hard time writing him positively in my own story. I'm having a far easier time portraying Ron mostly on the side of the angels! (which was a deliberate switch from my original outline)

While there are supportive Snape stories I like (including ones when he has a violent turnabout when he finds out Harry was at the Dursleys and not being pampered somewhere else), I prefer him to be darker and a touch less ambiguous. (is the time travel story "Fixing Past Mistakes"? That was good if with a dark start)
