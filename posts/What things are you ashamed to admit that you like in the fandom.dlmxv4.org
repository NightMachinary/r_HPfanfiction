  AU. Petunia Evans might not have been a witch, but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. As a squib, Dr Evans found her niche: Discovering and exploring tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew as a single aunt.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157]] Stealing Harryverse: There is some excellent mutual pining, and it's long. It's not finished but there are author's notes at the end so I felt closure.

first story: linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214]] The Secret Language of Plants: literally the only snape/lupin I've ever read, and it works in the story. Harry is a little bit woobie when young, but I liked it overall.

first story: linkao3(9323225)

Also another one that I can't find, perhaps someone can help? But Sirius raises Harry and all of the constellation relatives are involved, especially Cassiopeia who tutors him in dueling, and Sirius ends up "blood adopting" him, and it does end up being draco/harry I think, also there is a hufflepuff grandma who lives in Italy that likes to cook. It's a little far fetched, but memorable.

** I have a weakness for bashing stories if they're over the top and funny enough. They're a guilty pleasure that I have to be in a certain mood for and need to make me laugh. I also like Super!Harry stories that have interesting concepts even if they can be MarySueish and overpowered. Jeconais's fics are a good example of the type I'm thinking of. I've also got a thing for Lord!Harry and Indie!Harry when someone does it in a manner that I find compelling.

Also twin speak amuses me, and Fred and George using Forge and Gred.

Probably my biggest thing in HP fanfic?

I'm not ashamed of it, but I am a complete Harry/Luna fangirl and happily glut myself on the ship from time to time. I also commit HP fanfic blasphemy and think Luna would have been a much better love interest than Hermione or Ginny.

I'm also of the opinion that they'd understand each other much better. They've both been outcasts and completely alone for a lot of their lives, they've both lost parents, both have been bullied, and both have similar moral codes.

****** Big D easily defeating Big V only works when the bad guy holds the idiot ball, which is easy to assume given all the canon contrivances, though if you make one of them smarter and more capable, the you have to do so for the other, or else it wouldn't be a very dramatic story.

It would be interesting to read a story with a very capable and proactive Dumbledore doing all he can to prevent Voldemort's return, only to find a ridiculously paranoid Voldemort had been 10 steps ahead, outwitting the old wizard even in "death," leading Dumbledore to put all his hopes on Harry.

It would also be interesting to see some of Dumbledore's perspective plans, rather than just what Harry experiences as the end result. "Raising the boy like a pig for slaughter" would obviously be the last resort. Conducting investigations, doing research, performing rituals, recruiting, the political maneuvering, etc. It's pretty obvious from canon that the political situation in wizarding Britain is completely fucked, and Dumbledore is on the minority side of power, despite his own individual position.

It's also worth noting that despite Voldemort's defeat, there were still Death Eaters out there, and sympathizers aplenty. Giving Harry to the Dursleys is obviously a bad decision from Harry's point of view, but it's possible that Harry's situation was supposed to be temporary that just kept getting extended as more and more signs pointed toward Voldemort /not/ being truly dead.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

So a couple in a fic, whether they're gay or not, having sex as part of story doesn't come off as out of place to me. Like, sometimes the tension is built up in such a way that the lack of its dénouement in a spot of furious sexing seems more jarring.

The fic I just recced, there's explicit sex involving a character that's not Harry that's actually really important for plot development, and since the writer is so excellent with the prose it doesn't feel out of place.

I was pretty vehemently against him for a while but as I read more fics that had neutral or positive portrayals of him I realized that his character is very much open to interpretation and he's actually pretty morally ambiguous. Essentially my opinion on him changed due to my own growth and my understanding of the world changing as I finished highschool and entered university and met people with different circumstances.

******* This is admittedly a much better response than I was expecting! People have quoted fanfiction dialogue to me as "proof" of Dumbledore's true canonical character, though, so in my defense, I've seen it all.

I don't read fanfiction with Dumbledore in it mostly because I'm interested in fics that happen before or after the series, so I can't say from experience how Dumbledore is portrayed generally in fanfiction, only what people tell me about it. I'm also writing an essay about Dumbledore, so... my investment in this topic is more than the average person's.... so I get a bit nervous about the idea of fanfictions forming people views of canon, because the books are a complete literary unit and in terms of analyzing the books as literature, I don't see how fanfiction has a place. If JKR has done her most basic job as an author, these characters are knowable within the context clues and literary elements and devices used in the books. Of course one could argue she has not done her job (there are some areas where I think this myself, so it's not something I'm necessarily against considering), but people fight emotionally and tend not to do the research - either from the books or from the precedents set by literary analysis in the past. I guess the easiest way to explain myself is: I'm not so much interested in what people think, I'm interested in the standards they use to decide it.

An example I mentioned in another comment was the repeated idea that prophecies are difficult to interpret and don't remove free will. Dumbledore introduces this idea in PoA, Firenze reinforces this idea in OotP, and Dumbledore adds on to this in HBP. This repetition is a pretty standard way for authors to tell their readers "pay attention to this", yet in the hundreds upon hundreds of conversations I've had about Dumbledore in the last five or six years, and in the dozens of articles and essays I've read about him, I have never seen any other person suggest that maaaaaaaaybe Dumbledore /doesn't/ trust prophecies. I can think of only one person who commented about how this apparent contradiction relates to the Fate & Destiny of prophecies, she decided that Harry's only real choice is to accept his fate, as in, he accepts he doesn't have a choice. "The difference, it seems, lies in the willingness and the acceptance of your personal fate. When Harry accepts he also makes a free choice and chooses to follow his fate." (Source: [[https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/37051/Olsen_Master.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y][Lisa Theresa Olsen's essay]]) - in other words, Olsen can have her cake and eat it too. She can still interpret that prophecies are inevitable while also sensing that choice is a major theme of the series. This was her way of making those two contradictions work together. And maybe this does make sense and I'm just the idiot? Fine, but then there's more to say - on a character level, this would require Dumbledore and Firenze to be lying or misinformed. Olsen and people in general have no trouble assuming Dumbledore is lying, so let's say he is, then what does it say about Firenze? Is he also lying? Is he misinformed? What are his motives for lying to an Divination class? What are the devices present in the text which suggests that the reader should not trust Firenze? On a broader level, if we view stories as a unit of wholeness where each element works together in support of the whole, then what does this say about the overall theme? These are the nuances of interpreting the series as a single literary unit that are lost when fanfiction is the primary source. But I also realize I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. I'm interested in this sort of thing, but not everyone is. I'm not a literary major or anything like that, I just love analyzing Dumbledore so much and realized (and continue to realize) how little I actually know about how to do it, so I read up on this stuff a lot so I can hopefully feel confident in what I say and actually write stuff worth reading. But not everyone is interested in literary analysis, or at least, not everyone is interested in literary analysis that is founded in the history of literary analysis, and I don't think we need to be in order to enjoy the series. Our interpretations are not invalidated by not having this literary education. But this also goes back to what I said before - I don't care what someone thinks, I just care how they got there. To bring it back to why I brought any of this up at all, I like encouraging the idea of understanding where our ideas came from, basically.

**** i never viewed dumbledore negatively when i read the books. for me then it made total sense that harry was the chosen one to kill voldemort so of course dumbledore would want him to do so. the only betrayal was not telling harry earlier about the prphecy etc

***** Thanks so much for this comment! In a very general way, I think fanfics have a dim view of him because he is conveniently placed to make Harry a victim so that Harry can overcome adversity. I assume people like Harry being a victim, because to be totally honest, that's exactly what I like from fics too.

This is getting away from the purpose of this subreddit, but I would actually argue Dumbledore neither wants nor necessarily believes fully that Harry will be the one to defeat Voldemort, not at first anyway. I would argue he does not consider prophecies inevitable and therefore would be skeptical of its foretellings and that he only truly accepts that it will actually come true at the end of OotP. But he does not accept that it will come true because he has decided prophecies are inevitable, he accepts that it will come true because he sees that it is the most likely outcome based on the reality and facts he witnesses in real life. Firenze supports the same skeptism toward interpreting prophecies, and he has even devoted his life to interpreting them. The emphasis in these moments are not that prophecies don't or can't come true, but that they might not, and more importantly /interpreting/ them is actually quite difficult to do, as easy as it might seem in hindsight. As a result, the books let the reader know that true wisdom is to /not/ inherently trust prophecies, rather than to inherently trust them. Despite these clues, I feel like most fans inherently trust them, and assume Dumbledore shares this inherent trust. Dumbledore might know that some prophecies come true, but he does not know that /this/ one will until it aligns with what he sees in real life. This is obviously different from what most fans and what Snape believe by the end of the series. But this is why I'm interested in the effect fanfiction has on people's view of canon. Fanfiction's best feature is to warp and change canon to the new story's needs, but this also means it can't truly represent a canon character; the characters in fanfics are always shown through the eyes of the authors' interpretation and more importantly, their needs for their unique story.

If we rely too heavily on fanfiction, then we are not analyzing the original story by literary standards. For example, if fanfiction trends don't include Dumbledore and Firenze emphasizing the difficulty, imprecision, and effective uselessness of interpreting prophecies, then fanfiction readers may forget this was ever emphasized in canon. Because readers trust the prophecy, they assume Dumbledore always did too, and judge him accordingly. Furthermore, the prophecy is extremely grammatically and semantically vague. If Dumbledore has some non-linguistics means of determining the one true correct meaning, then what are his means? Is he able to do it just because he is smart? Smarter than Firenze, too? What is the literary purpose of Dumbledore's /and/ Firenze's advice to not trust prophecies if not to provide the reader with the various perspectives about this? The more I analyze the grammar and word choices of the prophecy, the more I decide it's a pretty wooly subject too. Therefore, if Dumbledore smiles when he sacrifices others, then I need to understand how these aspects of canon fit in to that interpretation or else I'm not going to be convinced the fan is interpreting the book in a literary way.

I don't want fanfiction to change. I'm into Merlin fics, and warping canon is pretty much required for me. With HP, I tend to be more interested in interpreting canon, and based on these experiences, I've considered for awhile that fanfiction might be the main reason people view Dumbledore negatively [edit: I should say, more negatively than perhaps is deserved. There are definitely negative aspects to his character] - perhaps they aren't viewing canon Dumbledore at all. I also get the sense, though I have no way to test this to see if this is true or not, that there is some group bias - the idea that whatever idea is more popular is more right.

**** Dark Ginny who doesn't throw in her lot with Voldemort is quite rare. I like the one in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Ginny]], linkffn(6160345), a lot. This Ginny is fanatically loyal, powerful, sexy, and slightly sadistic. Unfortunately, this fic suffers from some typical indy!Harry tropes and is way too short.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), features an adult Ginny who is also a long time adversary of Harry. She has committed quite a few atrocities in the name of her country, but can still be identified as the canon Ginny. This fic is however on hiatus, and she hasn't appeared as often as I have hoped.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), both Hermione and Ginny can be considered dark and bloodthirsty. They are following Grindelwald enthusiastically and are the primary force dragging Harry along for the ride.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]], linkffn(8823447), has a very dark Hermione in the future timeline. Despite falling very deep already, she still regretted everything that had happened and initiated the time travel for Harry (and perhaps for herself). This fic is progressing very slowly and has just returned from a 4 years long hiatus.

Although not stated explicitly as dark, she and Harry have done some serious shit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005). The main plot of this fic is no longer dealing with British blood purists, since these have been systematically liquidated early in the game; but against other European Pureblood regimes. There is a moment very late in the story where they could have completely fallen, but Starfox5 didn't quite have the heart to cross that line.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]]

There's this fic that has /vibes/ of Harry x Vector.

I also very much like good Dumbledore. One that is logical, supportive and powerful. Perhaps, he can be old and not that powerful anymore, but still awesome.

This is probably the reason I can't stand them. I mean, yes, you could write a fic where Remus is a decent husband, but that just feels like cheap whitewashing.

You don't have to overly alter anyone's character to make Harry/Lavender or Harry/Katie work. But in order to make most canon pairings work, you need to make fundamental changes to one or both characters which will leave me thinking "that's not how X would act". Lupin ran away, Bill didn't stand up for his fiancé and so on. You'd need to remove scenes which were quintessential for the canon characterisations.

However, there's a second canon pairing without red flags. Cedric/Cho. Just a regular teenage romance with nothing that's wrong.

*** If he is as awful as he is in canon (HBP), he belongs in prison for life. His attack on Katie and Rosmerta alone would make sure of that. I mean, he basically forced Rosmerta to strap a bomb vest to Katie and force her to carry out a terrorist attack. Do you have any idea how many war crimes Malfoy committed during that stunt? Nevermind the Unforgivables or the regular crimes such as treason, grievous bodily harm and attempted murder.

I'd love to read a good Dramione fic, but IMO you'd need to diverge before the second year, most definitely before the third. Once the buckbeak episode goes down, no game. Not in a hundred years. Malfoy was enjoying the suffering of somebody, who at that point, might have very well been Hermione's only friend. And even if Malfoy magically changed, Hermione wouldn't forget what he had done. She has a long memory, is vindictive and holds grudges.

I think that's probably true for most of the comments in this thread. If people truly felt ashamed of what they liked then they wouldn't be so happy to tell everyone. In my case, like you, I'd never feel ashamed of liking something if I have good reasons for liking it, which I do.

The guy has talent yes. The premisse is good,yes. But, If you are a person of colour...a member of a minority group...and you care for such questions...It is heartbreaking to be enjoying a read, to be immersed in a story and then...BOOM the author is a racist shithead.

Then you start to question the people reading this fic claiming to separate the author from the fic. Racism is not a political instance...should not be defended or normalized. Yes, great artists of the past were bigots...and racists. But guess what? Up until some decades ago they could be, because the people they hated was.not consumming their art and did not have a Voice.

I am very glad we are now able to call out people on their shit. I am not forced to consume their shit. And I have ALL the right to get annoyed at people who has not have an ounce of empathy.

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, I can certainly understand the author being accused as a misogynist although I don't necessarily think he is. But racist, I don't know.
#+end_quote

Look, I am not going back there to copy and paste passages to convince you...sorry. Just point to you the the passages of Harry in Egypt and what happens next to that part of the world in the text. AND, of course, the author´s notes, where he willingly admits to being a islamophobe and ,unwillingly, as a racist.

It is not my fault he is an ignorant bigot who sees himself as the second coming of Enlightment...because in his notes he does claim to be anti Religion- anti Islam in particular, but the real problem is about brown and black people.

IF his problem was truly, and only, about Religion, he could add in his text Harry thinking it would be okay to bomb a large geographical section of the USA who elected Trump precisely because he would push their Ultra Christian agenda. ( and no, pissing off a bunch of fictional religions equally is not proof he is REALLY just anti Religion)

But no, it is all about brown and black people being, in his view, savages and ignorants. Because brown and black people do not even deserve to be looked into detail, you see? He just goes on and say that the Middle East should be bombed- nervermind there is significant christian populations living in many countries of the area, or that Israel, who is a democracy, exists...

No,no... the author you /seriously/ do not think as a racist admits he is and you are still not sure about it?

It is 2019!

HINT: if the author thinks it is an amazing idea to bomb and exterminate all the people- because they are all the same, right?- in a geographical area indiscriminately...then the author is suffering a serious case of racism.

I mean, in a sense, I am /glad/ he is writing his worst thoughts out instead of shooting churches...

racist people, bigots , they can also be great artists.

To be honest, I just have two problems with this fic: first, is that I, who was clearly not the audience he was aiming, read about half of it BEFORE he came out as a piece of shit.

Seriously I have a limited amount of time in my hands...and I aim to spend it the best I can.

The second reason of my dislike for the fic? A part of faithful readers, who keep coming here and saying " Oh, I never noticed..."

WTF?!

Either you live in bubble, where questions like racism and misogyny do not bother you because you do not have to face it OR you are capable of brushing this things off as to not disturb your enjoyment. So, yeah, either you lack genuine curiosity about the real world- because, as you point out, you keep seeing people speaking about the problems of the fic, but this obviously, until now, never prompted you to truly reflect on it or research those questions to make your own informed decision...or you lack empathy to a degree you know the fic is indeed all people are saying, but you do not care.

No, I am not calling you out for being a bad person- I am sorry if you read this way. I do not know you personally to say so. maybe you are young, and have no true real world experience...or, as I said, you are fine with the way your life and the world is.

In short, I do think it is /entirely/ possible to like this fic for what it is while admitting the author is a disgusting human being you would most likely not want to meet. Disturbing, to me, is as I said, claiming there is nothing wrong with the fic when the author itself admits his own misguided vision of the world.

I like Harry with just about anyone except Ginny, particularly Luna, Daphne, or Fleur. Maybe if the writing was better it's be different, but I can never get over feeling like she married him simply because he was rich and famous and groomed by Molly to be his wife.

I also like Snape as the secret parent, mentor, or becomes the parent. No idea why they appeal to me though. 🤷🏻‍♀️

**** Unfortunatley, I don't have any real good ones. However, some that I did enjoy (a little bit, at least) were:

Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter\\
linkffn(4630606)

The positives for me is Tom and Hermione are very close to their canon counterparts (though not exactly so) and the romance is actually well-done to an extent. However, the Grindelwald storyline is really bizzare and unbelievable, while Tom's meeting with his Death Eaters is just a bunch of folly. This story is complete.

What The? by Madam Dee\\
linkffn(4420759)

This is actually more of a comedy than anything, and is like a breath of fresh air. Hermione's interactions with Tom at Wool's Orphanage is really entertaining, though there are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout and is not completed.

The Three Portals by violingrl07\\
linkffn(3566859)

This is a good read in that much of the story deals with Tom and Hermione at Hogwarts. In the beginning, there isn't any undercurrent as to why Hermione went back in time, but instead deals with them in classes and trying to out-perform the other in academia. It kind of reminds me of canon when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were in class learning about magic. Of course, the story deviates from this as it progresses but being how intelligent Tom and Hermione are, it's fun to see them go head-to-head. This one is also completed.

Also, you might want to check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1905759/Winterblume][Winterblume's page]] as she(?) has written 13 stories all dealing with Tom and Hermione. Her story, Ultima ratio is 772K+ words long, and is her(?) most famous work. However, I couldn't get past Chapter 12 or 13. I found the characterization was completely off and it kind of dragged on for the first couple of chapters. But, maybe you'll like it more than me.

****** Same, most of them are really dumb and OOC, especially the Time Turner ones. As if a Hermione who suffered all she did in canon would want to be with some dude who has killed and petrified muggleborns at age 16. 'Cause it's all okay if he's sexy and treats her as his "exception"?

So many of them follow the same terrible, unrealistic, unhealthy relationship tropes perpetuated in modern YA fiction. The recommended fic "Ultima Ratio" is one of them, that one has Tom Crucio Hermione for information and abuse her for being muggleborn and she still ends up falling for him. 🙄

  Hermione has always been a warrior for the Light. But when an attempt to salvage more than a Pyrrhic victory lands her in 1944, she quickly realizes that sometimes it is best to allow a lesser evil to flourish, because defeating it only creates the conditions for a greater one to rise. With conspiracies, schemes, and difficult choices in every corner, and a charismatic young Tom Riddle who is increasingly interested in her, she will eventually have to answer the question: How much darkness and grey in him can she accept?

**** The only good one I've come across is Unlike a Sister by MADharmony.

linkffn(6574535)

In my opinion, Unlike a Sister is one of the best Harry/Hermione stories around. The characterization is spot-on, the romance between them feels organic, and the interaction between all the characters is charming. There isn't any bashing, so that's a major plus, and there's a lot of comedic elements mixed in with a bit of mystery and societal issues. The only major drawback is that it remains unfinished. But don't let that deter you! There's still 21 chapters and 225K+ words for you to enjoy!

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

** I love harem stories (except without smut. I'm not a smut person.) and OP!character stories. Not specifically overpowered!Harry stories, although those are classic. I love OP!Hermione and OP!Snape and OP!Good!Draco and if I could find fics with other OP characters, I'm sure I'd be all over those, too. I'm not so ashamed at liking OP characters, though. I know harem stories are kind of looked down on since that can be pretty toxic and taboo, but I just love seeing a bunch of characters fawn over one character and all get along and settle into a great big cuddly relationship together and not be jealous over each other.

**** IRL poly marriages in places where poly marriage is a culturally common/expected thing has ended up with hierarchy systems within the marriage. Such as one wife is the first/main wife, then there's second wife and third wife, who are considered lesser than the first wife. (using gendered words bc this is the common dynamic) In real life, what ends up happening is that the man loves one wife more than the rest, and so the rest get jealous when he spends all his time with her, and then also collecting wives is seen as a status thing and also sometimes as a way of acquiring wealth through the wives' families. There's also a habit of men marrying a younger woman when his first wife gets older/uglier and less sexually active. It has its roots in the idea of taking in poor women, disabled women, and servants/slaves so that the family name would protect the woman, but in most places, it's morphed into all that I said above.

I took a college class on African women writers and boy, let me tell you, I read a lot of short stories and novels set in places where poly marriages are common. African women writers are...very disillusioned with poly marriages, and since these stories were expressions of African feminist power in reaction to societies where they felt oppressed, often these plots ended up with the woman rejecting polyamory or the whole system of marriage altogether.

The more Western rejection of polyamory that you'll find online is because the female characters are usually just to prop up the man, tools to sexually fulfill the man, and the sexual fantasy of a man being loved and having sex with multiple beautiful women. Meh.

Sorry for the educational lecture. But, now you know.

Despite all of that history and how I've learned just how terrible these things can become, I still love the idea of a super-cuddly relationship and the fantasy of being adored by several people on a squishy romantic level.

** I hate bashing. It feels like a cheap way to entertain people.

I like reading stories where everyone is competent. Or if they aren't competent, they're useful. Or if they're not useful... you don't write them.

Dumbledore as a master manipulator but sympathetic and genuinely caring for Harry are some of my favorite characterizations of Dumbledore.

I like stories where Harry is independent, but not necessarily an asshole. Willing to work with Dumbledore, but not for him. Rightfully not trusting his authority, but understanding that they have the same goals and both respecting their choices.

I prefer Gen!Harry, with a secondary preference for HHr. A tertiary preference for HHrRW.

I don't dislike HG or anything. And I can see how it would work. It just feels boring. I enjoy the dynamic between the Trio.
