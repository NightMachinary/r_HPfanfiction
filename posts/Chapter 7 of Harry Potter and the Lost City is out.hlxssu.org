*Title:* Harry Potter and the Lost City /(Previously HP & the Path To Knowledge)/

*Rating:* M

*Genres:* Adventure/Fantasy

*Summary:* A different upbringing gives Harry Potter a thirst for knowledge and a passion for magic. It leads him all around the world in search of the truth behind the Dark Magic in his scar while wizarding Britain remains deaf to the mutterings of death and war and ignorant of a prophecy that has yet to be fulfilled. Very much AU
