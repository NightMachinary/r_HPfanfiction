I really like the idea of Ron/Harry/Hermione. Like always Ron and Hermione stay on Harry's side and follow him through life. They are all striving their own goals, but always have time for each other. They respect each other and enjoy life.

Same for Naruto. I'm extremly fond of Naruto/Sasuke/Sakura.

I think that really says something about my future.

Anyone thinks the same?


** Ron/Harry/Hermione is one of my favorite ships of all time and it's surprisingly rare, or at least hard to find good/long fic for

Bill/Fleur/Tonks is also one I'd like to see

** I like the idea of Ron/Harry/Hermione ending up in a 3 way open relationship. Lot's of room for drama as they work things out or face judgement and comedy as people misunderstand things.

Also, you can eventually transition the story away from the relationship and leave it as a background element while you amp up the challenges they face, have them grow to overcome them.

All in all, a lot of potential and a real shame that I can't seem to find any stories that explore the concept in an interesting way.

** It would be ideal, but would need an AU or OOC Ron to work. He doesn't handle sharing well.
