** Isn't that in like every fic ever written that had Harry confronting LV in any way? Sry, don't have a specific recc for you because it is such a crazy common trope that it doesn't even register with me. But yea, it would be harder to find a fic in which he doesn't call him Tom if you go to ffn and pick a fic at random.
