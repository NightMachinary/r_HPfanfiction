** Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is my favourite Haphne and frankly my favourite romance-oriented fic period. Daphne is an unapologetic aristocrat, and blood purist, and her politics don't magically change just because she starts dating Harry. She feels like an actual person who exists, not just a prize to be tamed and won.

In those she is portrayed as the daughter of a Death Eater who wants nothing to do with the war, but her pureblood-bias beliefs and cowardly nature eventually has her siding with the dark. Though when she joins the Death Eaters it's technically through peer pressure and you're meant to feel bad for her, she's also not a completely innocent of a person either. It's Haphne and only half way through the second story, I think it's designed as a slow-burn trilogy.. Think of it as a casual old-fashion racist being forced into an extremist KKK society kinda story.

** Is it allowed to bump threads?

Anyway, given the OP mindset is precisely what made me write Unatoned and I like reading myself write, have some general thoughts on the feasibility of creating that kind of story, and then, with the caveats that will have been mentioned, some stories.

Principally, there is a /reason/ people do the cold exterior, warm inside thing, and I don't mean "people are unimaginative copycats" (there is that, too, but at some point it had to have been original). It's that, in order to write a romance that at least approaches the common idea of what this word means, you /need/ some warmth. And the natural conclusion of "needing warmth" and "cold, selfish Slytherin" is to create the duality of outside cold, inside warm.

And taken /at face value/, that is a solution, too. It needs a character that is complex -- that is, /at the same time/ selfish and not, because love is never selfish. The problem with this is that it requires experience and talent to write it.

I have not found a story that does this all the way in about 15 years of FF. There were always aspects that were missing, one way or the other. (I haven't written it either.)

What most writers do, instead, is declaring one side the 'true' side and thus getting rid of the complexity, which results, as you noted, in the annoying problem of having a tell of "cold, selfish Slytherin" (yay!) and immediately afterwards a show of "golden heart girl next door" (nay!).

But going back to "needing warmth": Without it, you can only do two things: Redefine what 'romance' means, or just not write a romance at all. The former is what I did; you can substitute love for hate, attraction and lust, and you will get some sort of dark clone of a usual relationship. The problem with /this/, in turn (and the reason there can't be a sequel to Unatoned) is that by its nature it's self-destructive. It's unhealthy, and the people in it are unhealthy; two broken people create a broken relationship and the result must be either redemption (urgh) or a tragedy. Not many people like to read (or write) that.

The other way, just not writing a romance, ends in some sort of political relationship: A partnership for mutual gain, two powerful people using their relationship as an alliance to be better screw with the rest of the world. The selfishness here is the recognition that the own aims are furthered even more by partnering up, and keeping the backstabbing within the relationship at a minimum. There is no love, but respect, and possibly attraction and desire. This story could be a marriage contract fic, /if/ people would stop using it as a way to be lazy and get insta!pairing and insta!love.

So, with that said -- recognising that there are no perfect fits that I know of -- here is are some few examples that I recall OTTOMH.

- Armortentia by ExcentrykeMuse: That one comes close. It's also one of favourite stories. Romilda is vain, bitchy, arrogant, selfish to a degree, scheming definitely, and does love Harry. The original doesn't exist anymore, copies are floating around. Try googling it with "rtf", for instance.

- The Malachite series by Lazov: Harry is fucked up, Daphne is fucked up, and together you get the whole destructive relationship thing. No golden heart anywhere.

- The relationship for mutual gain might be the easiest to find if you look for it not as the main point of the story, but a side plot. Many Slytherin AUs might fit; say the Sarcasm and Slytherin series by sunmoonandstars. But as far as the actual premise being "Slytherin girl snags Harry for social/political gain" goes, I think this is one of those plots that still remains to be written, even after all these years.

Hope this helps.

Thanks

Edit: Meh, turned out rather slow and one of those fics where Harry gets 'rescued' from the Dursleys and a lot of problems get fixed (by her parents D:) before the next school year even starts. I really hate those fics where a lot of problems get solved by things that make sense but do nothing in terms of plot, tension, or reader satisfaction.

Also, Pansy is a little bit of a Mary Sue (and way too nice). I definitely dislike her turning out to be flawless and beautiful. I think the reason behind her hiding her beauty is rather stupid, and getting rid of the 'pug-faced' look somehow robs her of her most defining feature. Flaws are often times more interesting than beauty and perfection.
