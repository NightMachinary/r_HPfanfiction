Hey!

Anybody got some good fics, preferably complete or at least semi regular updates, about Harry dimension or time traveling back to his grandparents and/or parents time and meeting them? Doesn't matter if he's an adult or a kid or an adult in his kid body, just with a good amount of interacting between them!

Thanks so much!


** Does linkffn(stages of hope) count? He does dimension travel and does meet his parents, they're just... Different and yet the same people but with a twist.

Edit: the story itself is really good though and interactions between harry and lily are done well, lot of touching moments but not angst, worth a read in any case.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] has some nice Harry/James/Lily/Snape interactions. When he finally revealed his true identity near the end, this is what Bellatrix has to say:

  Bellatrix rolled her eyes. "I think you can spare them more than that, Harry. And for the benefit of the younger part of our audience, I would like you to tell the story of your mother competing with her daughter-in-law for your affections back in the day."

*** This has a really unfortunate ending. It's technically complete, but I wasn't prepared for it to be completed simply because it was preceding a part two that never came.

Warning to anyone before they start, this is not a standalone story. The ending is abrupt and, as far as I can tell, there's no reason that this would be considered a "Part One" on its own. There is no Part Two.
