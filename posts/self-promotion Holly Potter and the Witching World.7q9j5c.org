So about two months ago, in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7cq26e/whats_the_fic_youd_like_to_write_but_lack_the/][this thread]], I wrote about an idea I had for a total AU fic, in which the wizarding world was in fact "the witching world" and 90% of the magical population was female.

Well, I've started writing the story! It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492][Holly Potter and the Witching World]] -- and yes, it's fem!Harry. I specifically wanted Harry to be a girl for this.

We're only five chapters in and the plot hasn't really taken off yet, but I'd value your opinions on it!

** So I've only read the first chapter so far, but I'm already digging this something fierce. It's a shame it's on AO3 - something about the format of the site has always rubbed me the wrong way, but that's nothing to do with your writing, which is engaging AF.

Thanks so much for sharing!

*** Well, thank you. :)

When it comes to AO3... I've heard people saying they don't like the formatting of the site, but I'm not quite sure why. I think it looks good, especially compared to FF.Net. I suppose tastes differ.

Besides, I like the anything-goes policy of AO3 better than the censorship of FF.Net... I highly suspect that this story will take an adult turn at some point and when/if it does I'd rather not have to worry about the fic getting lost in the next great purge. :)

*** Don't know who Seyllianii is... the link led to a "Page Not Found" message... and I haven't actually read Y: The Last Man. I keep meaning to, but then I never get around to it. :)

There is another fic, or rather trilogy, with a predominently female magical world, though. Namely the Firebird trilogy by Darth Marrs. It's got its fair share of fans... but to be honest I don't really like it much.

  Time-travel is an intricate magic prone to failure. If it succeeds, the ripples are not just confined to the future, but extend to the past. Everything can change. Harry has arrived in the past. So has the Empire. Time-travel AU.

  All Holly Potter wanted was to know was what strange and mysterious secret was hidden in that cupboard under the stairs, which her Aunt and Uncle never let her go near... and what did it have to do with "those lesbian freaks" Aunt Petunia would complain about? (Total AU, in which 90% of the magical world is female.)

** Engaging story, interesting plot, not a canon rehash, and good worldbuilding elements already.

Pacing is fine, if a little slow, and there are very few grammar mistakes. I feel like scenes could be little more active, with more exposition delivered through dialogue and narration that refers to Holly's point of view rather than an all-knowing entity.

Nonetheless, your writing voice in interesting, engaging, and adds small bits of comedy that break a smile on my face. To add, the characterisations are developing nicely, particularly Holly's character being 8 years old and naïve. Truly, a great read and I hope to see more chapters uploaded soon.

Easily around 4.5/5 in rating. However, the rest of the story might change that (make sure you use the plot points you've brought up, though by what's already been posted, I don't doubt your skill).

*** Thanks! Yeah, I know it's a little slow... that's my main concern with the story. And this is AFTER I've gone through each chapter and tried to streamline as much as I could. I suppose I'm just a slow-paced writer... I'll try to at least keep the pacing above the speed of a snail.

What grammar mistakes did you catch? I try to weed them out, but sometimes I miss a few. Blame it on English not being my native language. :)

**** Oh, there are 3 tiny grammar mistakes throughout, like one comma that was off place somewhere and a word with a wrong tense. I can't remember where but it really isn't offputting and would be hard to notice for anyone who doesn't speak english day in day out.

That said, for someone whose native language is not English, the prose is very well done and the grammar is practically perfect. Great job!

** After reading it I have to say, this a really good fic and I especially like the world building and while I understand that Dumbledore can easily take on an antagonistic role without bashing him, I really like to read about a Dumbledore who is happy and had a good life, even if he had his problems. But what I Iiked the most weirdly enough, was the spell Holly get´s taught, it somehow feels very magical for lack of a better explanation, something really wondrous, I don´t know if this was a real spell or more of a trick that makes it easier for younger kids to use their magic, but I just somehow really like that detail.

*** It's a trick more than a spell. Since the story is blatantly AU anyway, I'm taking a few minor liberties with how magic works compared to canon. :)

And Private Investigator Dumbledore is surprisingly fun to write!
