** You've probably already heard of HPMOR, but that matches the criteria reasonably well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is very good but unfinished, I'm afraid.

Holly in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is smart, imo. I don't know if that's what you're looking for, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9315209/1/Out-of-the-Night][Out of the Night]] is good but again, abandoned.

These are the only ones I can think of right now, I heard about most of them from here to be honest!

**** Author here.

At the time I started it, I hadn't written anything longer than an 8 page term paper and knew that my ability to describe things was limited, but I had a thousand ideas for this story. I set up the journal format so that I could speed through irrelevant parts (at least the things Holly thought were irrelevant ) so I could focus solely on the changes from canon and their consequences. I was chafing at the arrangement because most people wouldn't include dialogue in their diary, so I added the quick-quotes quill in CH06 which provided the means to bring the reader a bit closer to the action.

Over time, it became an intellectual puzzle- how do I present what comes next in a way that recognizes that it has already happened but keep it immersive. It developed a sort of 'Private Eye voice-over' style and I kept it going, in some ways because it was easier for me to plot things with the excessive limitations imposed by the format. I'd had plenty of complaints, but once I'd gotten a groove going, just to stop mid-story and shift styles seemed like a cop-out.

Funny thing- I miss those restrictions now, and my progress on the sequel has really gotten stuck in the sludge of 'what do I show vs. tell?' & 'how much of the other characters' experiences need to be included?'. The story is plotted, but I just can't seem to find the right balance.

***** Wow, thanks for the explanation. I will definitely give the fic a chance since you took the time to explain it. Reading Denarian Renegade first, but Holly's next on the list.

**** After not very long, it's increasingly mostly conversation transcripts, if that's any consolation. I didn't mind the journal style myself, but I see where you're coming from, it's a bit odd.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/21003][The Well Groomed Mind]] has a reasonably smart Harry that gets there due to his mind splitting. No slash on this one.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door][An Unfound Door by joe6991]] is probably pretty close to what you're looking for. Harry is in Ravenclaw and is described by multiple characters as one of the smartest and most clever students at Hogwarts. It's pretty well written, but the author hasn't updated in more than a year. I think he's writing original fiction nowadays and I think he's actually been published if I remember correctly.

Despite being short and probably abandoned, I still think it's worth a read.

*** It starts out quite promising then all of a sudden Harry becomes a god who doesn't need a wand. It could have been interesting but unfortunately it isn't.

*** I read it. I dislike protagonists who just have everything fall into place for them. Every magical race falls in line to kiss his ass when he shows a tiny hint of kindness, no one can do anything intelligent to stop him, he has easy spells to make him super smart with no consequences, facts arrange themselves to support him, his mere presence makes people more stupid. Ugh. Not much intelligence.

  I'm going to get tired to pimping his story here, but The Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. Harry's twin brother follows the canonical story, while Harry himself is smarter and during the first year, takes up extra lessons from Quirrell to become considerably more advanced. When no other professor will consider letting him out of lessons, he transfers to Durmstrang where they will - he of course keeps in touch with his brother (who is best friends with Ron and Hermione), his family, and eventually returns to Hogwarts (not as a student). It is a fantastic story.
