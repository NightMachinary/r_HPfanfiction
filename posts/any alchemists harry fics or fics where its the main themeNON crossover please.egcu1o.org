  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.

**** Here it is! I almost didn't read it because I wasn't sure with how it started but honestly it's so good. Can't wait until new year, that's when the next update is if I remember. Also theres no Ed. Which took me a hot second to get used to. But it is /so/ worth the read.

Also gonna throw this one in. Snipers 99% is a recent blessing to this fandom. Most commented fic in fma already. We all hype out here. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794]])

Aaand might as well give you this one. All three have a v different approach n I love them for it. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11052627/chapters/24641256]])

  When Roy Mustang went to retrieve his eyesight from Truth, he wasn't expecting to end up doing a job in exchange. It couldn't even be an easy job, of course, because Edward's assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.

  Ed had thought, after the whole Promised Day, homunculus, entire country harvested for alchemical batteries thing, the batshit quotient of his life would have settled down some. He really ought to have topped out the meter with that one. But no. The bullshit is just getting started. “Are you fucking kidding me,” Ed demands. “The wizards?” Podfic available! See notes
