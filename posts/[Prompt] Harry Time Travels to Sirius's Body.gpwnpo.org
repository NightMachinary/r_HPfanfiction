Harry Potter, savior of the shattered remains of the wizarding world floated backwards through the mists of time. His timeline free from the influence of Voldemort at last, but a hollow, bittersweet, victory at best.

Now his soul drifts through the years seeking out that soul most familiar, at the time when change was most possible.

Now the drifting slows even further, flashes of days long past, a ten year old Harry Potter, sleeping fitfully in a cramped cupboard. The broken man's mind tensed in anticipation of the opportunity to repair what had been broken and save what had been lost.

But he drifted past.

The soul of the young boy too pure and whole to join with the weary and broken soul for the future, marred by the lives he had taken, the horrors he had seen, and the losses he had suffered.

He drifted onwards, through space now if not time, across land and the dark sea. To a black island surrounded by the essences of despair and death, through the walls he floated, to a cell where another broken soul slept fitfully as well.

Sirius Black, who had also suffered terrible losses, who had killed in war, and who had seen horrors of his own.

The two souls joined, and twain they became, tied together, memories and magic blending and healing the holes left by those they lost. And then they awoke, and the walls and bars of Azkaban could not hold the strength of their will.


** This idea has been kicking around for a while, from that horrible fic where Harry's soul ended up in Lockharts body and the two became something of a combined person that is a mix of both, and the threads discussing how adult Harry really can't conceivably go back to being an 11 year old.

Bonus thoughts of the prompt

Harry and Sirius become their own individual, with personality aspects and talents of both of them.

Harry, Sirius, and Harry!Sirius are able to directly converse through occlumency/mind palace

Sirius!Harry rescues Harry from the Dursley's

Wormtail is the first thing they take care of.

Everything canon except Voldemort made another Horcrux before the battle of Hogwarts and only had his body destroyed again, returning soon after and guarding his horcrux fiercely. Causing the war to go on for years more.
