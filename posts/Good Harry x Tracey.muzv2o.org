Really enjoy the dynamic between fanon Tracey and Harry in fica that she is in mostly haphne fics). Does anyone know some good Harry x Tracey fics?


** Sidenote, does Tracey Davis exist canonically, or did some author just throw her in?

â€‹

This one's a PJO x HP crossover. I've recommended it before, and was given the feedback that it's a bit confusing. I personally liked it. It's PJ x DG, and HP x TD. Harry's not the main character, but he's the secondary protagonist.

*** I believe she exists but only as a random line of text mentioned once or twice.

**** Nope. Daphne is only mentioned one random line of text. Tracey didn't even get that. She just comes from Rowling's notes.

*** Oh god, the first one is gold! Tracey's characterization is amazing, and the Slytherin girls... actually act like teenaged girls! What sorcery is this!

  Tracey Davis is a Nobody Extraordinaire, ignored by the whole school. As the Yule Ball is announced, a Bossy-Bushy-Know-It-All puts none other than the Boy-Who-Lived in her path. Merlin, help. Rated T for language and questionable teenagers

  Harry has a crush on a Slytherin, only it's not the girl everyone would think of.

  After the fall of Voldemort, some people could deal with what they had to do in the War, others could not. Harry had pretty much left Wizarding Britain, thought not magic. Having a quiet drink in a pub, someone from his past re-enters his life HP/TD/DG
