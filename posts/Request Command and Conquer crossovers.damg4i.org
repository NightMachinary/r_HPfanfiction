I'm looking for crossovers between HP and C&C, specifically the Tiberium universe. I only know of one, and it had Lily returning from the dead to preach Christianity in the USA. I don't mind any religion, nor do I mind them in fics, but it was weird. Does anyone know a crossover between these two besides that weird one?

Thanks!
