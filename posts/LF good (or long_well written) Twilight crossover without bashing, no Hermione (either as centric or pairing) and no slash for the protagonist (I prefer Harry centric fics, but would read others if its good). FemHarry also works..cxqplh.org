#+TITLE: LF good (or long/well written) Twilight crossover without bashing, no Hermione (either as centric or pairing) and no slash for the protagonist (I prefer Harry centric fics, but would read others if its good). FemHarry also works.

** Oooh ooh I can help I can help! I've not read /any/ of these in a long time- I'm opening my HP/Twilight folder and seeing what is marked read that I remember being good.

Linkffn(The Girl Who Imprinted by CCRevival) I remember being really good, though at times it gets a bit crack-y. Mostly when involving Malfoy. This is the best Harry/Leah fic I'm aware of- I really liked the idea of that pairing, but there's very little there sadly.

Linkffn(Follow You by flarsanzian) is, from what I recall, /very/ well written. I also recall it being slow and it's not all that long so.. yeah. It's Harry/Renesmee.

Linkffn(Chrysochlorous by janedethrone) Yo, /fuck/ having to spell that title. That said, excellent fic. From what I remember this is pretty much the best written HP/Twilight fic I'm aware of. It's definitely the best Harry/Rosalie fic.

These are all from either Harry's pov or his s/o's POV. Hermione is, at most, a supporting character.

  The Volturi ran off with their tails between their legs, but a gathering that large of supernatural creatures attracted attention from the magical world. The magical world is still rebuilding from Voldemort so Harry gets sent. He finds trouble quickly with vampires - and an infatuated shape shifter.

*** God, TGwI is hilarious. Hermione on her crazy moods and Draco is also so dumb and Leah's yandere personality... I really enjoyed it.

Chrysochlorous is, to this day, the best twilight fanfiction I've ever enjoyed, even considering core fanon fics.

Boy, how I wish Follow you was complete, I liked Renesmee in there so much... It made me search for other fics with her as main, but they're almost exclusively with Jacob (with an obvious reason why)

Thanks for the suggestions, but I've read them all, and enjoyed all 3 of them very much.

**** Ah, oh well. Hopefully that reply helps someone else out later!

Is there a subreddit you're aware of for Twilight fics? I dislike the canon, but some of the fanfiction is really good. There's just no subreddit I can find.

** I stumbled upon this little story a couple of weeks ago; Another Life, Another Love, Another---oh, whatever linkffn(13308730)

Short, light and... different. It's too cleverly written to be defined as pure crack but it definitely doesn't take itself too seriously. The author exercises brevity in a really enjoyable way, which is always a win to me.

It's a Fem!Harry but also a trans character so I don't know if the slash warning applies here or not. Definitely doesn't feel like slash, although it technically is? I'm not sure, it's one of those confusing ones.\\
Anyway, could be a fun read.
