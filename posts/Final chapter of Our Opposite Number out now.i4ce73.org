So I've recently published the last chapter to my harry potter fanfic, Our Opposite Number.

As you may know its a small, focused story around how muggles would react to being told their child is a wizard and how the child is simply a pawn in the great game of espionage between the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds. Mainly focused on original character but Dumbledore does make an apperance. Now that its finished (though I might add an extra chapter later, not sure) please let me know what you think of it.

  A perfectly normal family in a perfectly normal London suburb recieved a mysterious letter from a place called Hogwarts. Unfortunately the father of this family worked for her majesty's security service. This caused all sorts of trouble.
