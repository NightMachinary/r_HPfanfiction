** This is a not-uncommon LF.

You'll have to try harder than that for any proper judging.

**** I'll rephrase: You'll have to try harder if you want other perverts like myself and [[/u/CastoBlasto]] to judge you. For example, there was the one thread a number of months ago about the most twisted fics people could find. One of those was Harry/Dead!Hermione.

Don't be the guy who asks for necrophilia and you'll be ok.

*** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/12370765/1/][*/A Tale Of Two Lillies/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6664607/DylantheRabbit][/DylantheRabbit/]]

#+begin_quote
  After a disastrous battle in the Department of Mysteries that claims her life Harriet Potter is sent back in time to prevent the second rise of Voldemort. A response to Anubis' Two Lillies challenge. Rated M for adult situations and some rather fruity language. Femslash HP/LE and possibly more. Wink wink.

** There aren't any good ones. It's too difficult to get 'right', and I don't even know what getting it right would entail. linkffn(11517235) gets close and does so by handwaving the incest aspect from an emotional pov via a plot contrivance. Couple of one shots or thereabouts from DLP. And that's it, I guess.
