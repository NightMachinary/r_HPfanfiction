I am looking for COMPLETE Fix-It Time Travel fanfics. Happy ending would be appreciated. Don't have a problem with ships, as long eras don't get mixed, as an example Remus/Sirius is fine, Sirius/Hermione is not. Remus/Tonks is fine too

Bonus 1: If it is set in the marauders era Bonus 2: if the marauders play a major part

I hope you can help me, thanks in advice!

Harry's world ends at the hands of those he'd once fought to save. An adult-Harry goes back to his younger self fic.

Al tiny bit of Harry Voldi but Harry is older.

**** no I was ambiguous, I have planed a very long story with Hogwarts being the first part.

- First Harry, will fix Hogwarts and introduce the inventing spirit in the students. He will encourage inventions as the year end projects and group projects. He will create funds so that this kids are financed and then help them later to introduce it to the world later.

- right now, Hogwarts is the producing mindless service workers who plan on being a healer or auror or minter (all which are service based jobs)

- Harry plans to introduce and bring about the inventers, entrepreneurs, thinkers, artists, writers, poets, musicians...

- He plans to bring out the Wizarding world from the middle ages by bringing about the changes... not the muggle inventions just copied pasted .... There will be no simple wizarding TV or Mobile Or INTERNET and Harry will not simply find a way to make magic work with electricity.

Last two wars has stagnated the society and politics and death and fear had ruined the society.

I have a question, *Why dint Hogwarts produce a single Wandmaker in all those years? When Ollivender disappeared people had no one who could make wands for them?* That's the kind of change that's needed

So it will be small and slow changes that will bring about the change from the inside without like simply enforcing the muggle inventions

Harry will bring lot of capital in the market, he is going to turbo charge the economy.

I am planning to make this fic reach 500k Words...but that is the ultimate goal I am hoping to achieve if all goes well.

** I'll recommend *enigmaticblue*'s two-fic series, [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1692316][*The Many Lives of Sirius Black*]]. In the first fic, My Sun Sets to Rise Again, Sirius is given a second chance to live after he falls through the veil, and has to choose which turning point in his past he wants to go back to after previewing how things could play out. The second, There Is No Man, However Wise, is after he makes his choice. Both are great!

*** I quite like how the author shows Sirius thinking things through. He may have strong feelings about Snape, or Peter, or Dumbledore, but he doesn't just blindly oppose anyone, he weighs everything in the balance, tries to understand others' points of view even if he doesn't agree or respect them, and ends up acting pretty much as a Gryffindor anyway, but with a cooler head.

***** Are you following the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series? It has some similarities in its start, with Sirius escaping when Harry is eight and retrieving him. No time travel, though, and they go to ground in Grimmauld Place under Fidelius, rather than France.

Book two onwards has Harry at Hogwarts, broadly following canon, but with many things going differently as a result of the divergence.

******* You could read just book 1, if you like. At that point it becomes an alternate version of the canon years with Sirius present. All of the stuff about Sirius' escape and the manhunt and reaching out to Remus and so forth and trying to clear his name is all in book 1.

I quite like the series for making everyone just people. No prodigies, no fixing everything with a hand-wave, just Harry getting a flawed but caring parental figure. (He does eventually become an Animagus, but that's only to be expected. And it's not a fast process.)
