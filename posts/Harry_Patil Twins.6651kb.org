Parvati: "Is the Headmaster still trying to rope Harry back under his thumb?"

*Closes door*

  How difficult can it be for Harry Potter to get a date to the Yule Ball? Extremely difficult if you have a jealous Ron Weasley scaring them away. Warning for Ron bashing. Rated T for themes and language.

** I remember reading a oneshot where Veela had taken over the wizarding world, Harry got trapped in a vault and when he was released he was claimed by the Patils as a servant.

Damned if I can remember where I found it, though.

  Harry is struck down by a nasty curse that requires some non-traditional medical care in South India. Hermione, Padma, and Parvati volunteer to assist in his care, and a menage-a-foursome is born. Harry/multi.
