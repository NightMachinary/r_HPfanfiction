Hello all,

I'm no longer going to be able to add to the wiki. I'd love for someone to take up my role on the subreddit and continue making posts and organizing the wiki for the future. This community is great, and I love it. It's been great seeing the subreddit grow, betaing y'alls fics, and making the wiki.

Fanfiction no longer interests me, and I've decided to quit reddit, mostly because it's been a huge time suck for the last couple years, and I no longer can justify sacrificing time to be on reddit and maintain the wiki. I'll be deleting my account shortly.

So long and thanks for all the fish,

[[/u/Psantium][u/Psantium]] signing out.


** Thanks for all the hard work you put in over the years.

I'm a bit of a lurker and I want you to know that all of that effort you put in, all of that time, it's really appreciated.

Good luck for your future!

** /To whomever wants to continue the Wiki Project:/

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/pages][Here are all the pages of the wiki]].

My To-Do:

- Organize the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/crossovers][cross-overs page]] into categories for each fandom.

- Organize the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/timetravel][time travel page]] for which character time traveled.

- Continue adding [[https://www.reddit.com%0A/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/book_club][Book Club]] threads to the list.

- Add to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/history][history]] if something meta happens.

- Add to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/romance][Best of Romance]].

- Add more to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/writingcenter][Writing Center]].

I'm probably forgetting a couple of the things I was doing around here. Check the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/wiki/index][index]] for some more ideas. Hope someone continues this!
