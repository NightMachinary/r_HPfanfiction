Fairy Tale Logic Strong uncanny/ alterity Other examples of the ‘mood' I'm searching for: Juliet Marrilier, Sevenwaters (original trilogy, novel); The Tale of Tales (movie); Calvino, Castle of Crossed Destinies; Diana Wynne Jones' Chrestomanci & Howl novels; Spirited Away (Ghibli) exemplifies it too

What I liked most about ‘The Seven Wild Weasleys' was that the structure of the archetypal fairy tale was in place but the kinds of magic associated with each Weasley was... hmmm... I guess I couldn't say whether I thought it was of the author's own imagination or drawn from other folkways. & that's there's a sense of internal fairy tale logic that doesn't necessarily become any less opaque to the reader, & doesn't let the reader question it.

I'm open to all lengths, WIP or complete, pairings, no pairings etc. Just a particular genre/ mood I'm interested in... thank you!
