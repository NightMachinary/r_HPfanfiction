Im interrested in fics where Harry (somehow) ends up in the past/different universe and takes care/protects his younger self/alternate self.

Im especially interrested in fics where its his female counterpart he rescues from the dursleys, or just takes care of his female self. I dont mind if he ends up in a relationship with her, as long as he takes care of her

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

**** It just gets really fucking stupid.

- Dumbledore goes from a seemingly decent guy to straight up evil in a second. He goes from going out of his way to save Rose, then starts hunting Rose down to kill her when she doesn't want to give him credit for killing Voldemort.

- A secret Illuminati-esque order starts hunting down Harry and Rose because apparently entire realities will collapse if two people with the same souls (Harry & Rose) are together.

- Rose travels to the dimension Harry left for at the end, and it's this hellish place where the sky is red and Bellatrix is leading a giant army of zombies or something. Then it just ends there.

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.
