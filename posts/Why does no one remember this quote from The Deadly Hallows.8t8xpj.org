  He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face:

  He wanted to see it happen, the destruction of this one,

  inexplicable danger. The child began to cry: It had seen

  that he was not James. He did not like it crying, he

  had never been able to stomach the small ones

  whining in the orphanage ---

  “Avada Kedavra!”

  “No u!” he moaned.

  And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain

  and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the

  rubble of the ruined house, where the child was

  trapped and screaming, but far away . . . far away. . . .

** /The one with the power to vanquish the Meme Lord approaches/

/Born to those who have thrice outmemed him/

/Born as the trebuchet flies/

/And the Meme Lord shall mark him as his equal/

/For he will have deez nuts that the Meme Lord does not/

/And either will die at the hand of the other/

/For neither can live while the bee cannot fly/

/The one with the power to vanquish the meme lord will be born as the trebuchet flies/
