The entire Gryffindor table stopped and stared at the /thing/ that had just stolen a bread roll off Harry's plate and swallowed it whole.

It looked...like a little red devil about 6 inches high. Red scales, red horns, little bat wings, little furry loincloth, and carrying a trident in a sheath on its back.

"Harry...what is that thing? Do you know?" Percy Weasley asked tentatively, while the other students erupted into muttering, snippets of sentences coming across like 'house-elves don't look like that' and 'was mum right about witchcraft?'

Harry blinked and looked down at the little devil, before looking up, "Oh, he's...um, he said his name was Tom. And he's...uh...I forgot, Tom, why do you look like a devil?"

The little devil called Tom looked up, "Because I'm actually a shard of Voldemort's-" dozens of people gasped, squawked and otherwise made noises, drowning out his next few words, "-Potter here; it's a symbolism thing, I'm a devil because I'm evil and I'm small because I'm one part of a whole."

"And he is evil, you wouldn't believe the trouble he gave the Dursleys," Harry added on to that, "But then, they couldn't see him for some reason, none of the...muggles?, could, so they blamed me for it."

So yeah, anyone know any fics featuring the horcrux physically manifesting as an imp and causing mischief and providing commentary?

*** *A couple of years before Harry goes to Hogwarts*

Halloween. Vernon Dursley actually liked Halloween.

The reason why was simple; he liked candy. Eating it, or giving it out to trick-or-treaters (to bolster his image of a warm and proud family man, of course).

He could appreciate the costumes, too...well, as long as he put /them/ out of his mind. Just one day of the year when.../it/, was normal.

Vernon's day had come and gone rather quickly; drills were made, contracts were made, and overall his day at work went splendidly.

He had even found time to take Petunia and Dudley down to the park to feed the birds some leftover bread, and gotten home in time to watch his favourite show.

Now, however? It was time for bed. Petunia was already asleep, or pretending to be, so Vernon was quiet as he slipped into his pajamas, snuggled down into the covers-

-and yelped loudly as something sharp jabbed him /hard/ in the sole of his foot.

Shooting up in bed, disregarding the squeak as Petunia was disturbed by the shifting of the blanket (and his previous yelp), Vernon clutched at his foot, feeling it over.

There was nothing there. Not in the sense that his foot had vanished, no, it was perfectly fine; but there wasn't any blood, or any bruise, or anything to indicate that Vernon's foot had been stabbed by a fork as he felt like it had.

Trying to ignore the sore feeling in his foot, Vernon looked around slowly before whispering a quiet apology to Petunia and sliding back under the covers.

And then his foot was jabbed again, which of course made him yelp again and ruined any chance of him or Petunia getting to sleep.

"Vernon, what's wrong?" Petunia whispered.

Vernon clutched at his aching foot; again, there wasn't a sign that it had been touched, "Something's up with my foot, it feels like someone's poking a fork in it..."

And then Petunia Dursley yelped and flailed, tossing the blanket off the bed with her kicks, "Something's got my foot too!"

Vernon growled loudly, then leaned over and switched on his desk lamp, causing Petunia to wince and cover her eyes as the room was bathed in dim golden light.

Nothing. No miscreant stood at the end of the bed, no fork laid on the floor, no...wait, one of the photos on their mantlepiece had fallen down.

Vernon grumbled and stood up to go over to the mantlepiece, "Maybe we should go to the hospital tomorrow, Pet."

Petunia nodded nervously...then threw up her hands in fright when Vernon jumped a foot in the air, howling and clutching at his bottom.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
