** Jewels has an earlier fic, which is also James/Lily. Just in case you missed it.

** I enjoyed [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony][Tears on the Balcony]]. It was one of the first really long fics I had set aside the time to read, and I've gone back and reread it as well. It is part of a trilogy, the third story was updated about a month ago (WIP).

Even though it's one I definitely recommend, it was started about ten years ago before some clichés were considered as cliché as they are now in fandom. Some of it is repetitive, but it's written from the point that they actually are teenagers, not miniature adults with fully developed personas yet.

Lily/James wasn't the only pairing in it, but it was the primary pairing.

*** Piggybacking on this, I would only recommend the first one. The OC are kind of 2D IMO, and so is anyone not Lily and James. However, the second and the bits I've read of third start delving into the side character subplots, without developing the characters themselves.
