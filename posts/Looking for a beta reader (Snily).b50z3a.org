Hi everyone!

I recently started working on my (long-ass) piece of FanFiction again, and I'm ready to start writing towards the end (it's over half a million words long). I'm writing it in English, but since it's not my native language I could really use a beta reader that could help me filter out the spelling and grammar errors that I make along the way. I've looked for a beta reader on the forums of FF, but so far I haven't been able to find anyone, so I'm hoping to find someone here.

My fic contains the following:

-It's titled: Severus Snape and the Art of War. I currently have 150 chapters up and I've written little over 200. I expect it to be around 300 chapters by the time it ends.\\
-It's a Snily (Snape and Lily) story, so I know it's not everyone's cup of tea. Their relationship, however, is not the main storyline. The main storyline is Severus taking over Harry's place in the uprising war.\\
-It's M rated because it contains abuse, drug use and sexual content. HOWEVER, nothing is too explicit and only supports the story in certain ways. It doesn't carry the story.\\
-It's got a ton of references related to the 70s in it, including music.\\
-I try my hardest to balance adventure, romance, suspence and funny bits into it.\\
-No character bashing.

As a way of saying thank you, I'll send you a box full of HP related stuff that I have acquired over the years, including things that I got at the actual HP shop at King's Cross station.

My username on FF is also CypressWand, so PM me there if you're interested in helping me out! :)
