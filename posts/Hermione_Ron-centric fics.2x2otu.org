Canon-compliant preferred but there's a little bit of leeway. If Hermione and Ron get together a little bit earlier than Harry realizes, it's fine.

Hr/R should be central pairing, though it doesn't have to be a 100% romance fic.

Excellent author who has written multiple R/Hr fics, most of them Hogwarts-era and canon compliant. She made me fall in love with Ron as a character, as well as Ron/Hermione together.

She has a knack for capturing those little unimportant moments that we don't see in the books, like sitting around the common room talking about trivial things or just having lunch at the Burrow.

** its not finished and i doubt it will ever be finished but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4843238/24/Mirror-Mirror][this story]] is still a great read. Canon Ron goes into AU and has to turn a dark Harry to the side of light so Harry can fulfill the prophecy to destroy Voldemort.

** I manage a community for Hermione/Ron stories on ff.net

The overwhelming majority of stories are Ron or Hermione centric. Here's a link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/SS-Romione/117640/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]

I'd recommend going through the top favorited ones first to see the most popular. Keep in mind some of the earlier stories diverge from canon since they were published before all the books were published.

Some author recs who write many Ron/Hermione stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4185673/diva-gonzo][diva.gonzo]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfASlug]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1146256/TMBlue][TMBlue]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1408980/mugglemama][mugglemama]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2559733/writergirl8][writergirl8]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2641492/jesrod82][jesrod82]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3204486/HawthornBlood141][HawthornBlood141]].

I also recall reading some great ones on thequiditchpitch that are not canon compliant but I'll drop links if you're interested.

**** You're welcome! Make sure to check out the author pages. Most of them write tons of this pairing. And most of them have tumblrs where they post stories that haven't made it to ffn.

p.s. I think Ms. Binns and HawthornBlood141 are working on a sequel to Australia as a fusion of their fics in one universe.

***** I'll definitely check it out when I get the chance. Currently working my way through the Alexandra Quick series, but I've always been disappointed by my inability to find quality Ron/Hermione, so I'm quite pumped.

** I know, that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][this]] isn't really what you're looking for, but it features a likeable Ron/Hermione pairing. Of course the story still is about Harry, and a girl Harry at that, but, you know, good Hermione and Ron. That's not nothing, right?

** One of my own R/Hr fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793014/1/The-Wedding][here]] - Biil & Fleur's wedding from Ron's perspective.

Little bit of future thrown in at the end, but I like to think it's still canon-compliant :)

I would recommend "His Return" a little higher as far as how much I like them, but it's not very canon :) Still strong R/Hr

*** Wow, wow, wow. That story is old! I remember reading it a long time ago. It was very nice.

And it's nice to see you're still around! I thought maybe you died or something since your last updated story was years ago.

**** Aww wow - it's nice to "meet" someone who's read my stuff XD Thanks!

Nah, just started putting a lot more time into school/work and my own original fiction :)

I keep opening up "How the Head Git Got the Girl" every few months and not making much progress :p

The format is a bit strange at start, but worth a read
