I've been looking for this specific story where Harry is immortal, but not because Master of Death. From what I remember, something dimension-y happens and he ends up around the time of the Quidditch World Cup and injured in the woods and passes out. He wakes up at the Flamels, and has a conversation where they figure out he's immortal like them. All while he's being secretive and ensuring they don't mean him harm through oaths. Their immortality comes not from the Philosophers Stone but from Phoenix tears/super strong poison mixing in their blood, and some other qualifiers. Harry also defends Fleur at the Quidditch World Cup (which may have been where he gets injured and ends up at the Flamels).

I can't really remember much else besides that. Appreciate any help.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** when stories update after long timespans I usually have to read from the beginning just to remember what the heck is going on. This can be good, sometimes not. The one that I hate is.reading a story and come across something familiar, but nothing else is , and you realize the author ripped the idea from some other story. the stories written for the Reptilia28 challenge are particularly bad for that, I have had to backtrack and look at the title too remember what I am reading. Why am I posting this here? because Kathryn518 has updated one of her stories and I am looking forward to starting again from the beginning.
