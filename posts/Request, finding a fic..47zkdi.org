  Harry didn't appear at Hogwarts causing concern. Albus immediately head's out to Privet Drive to find out what was going on, along with Minerva and a reluctant Severus Snape. What they find out changes everything for everyone in the wizarding world. Is there a chance for anyone to go back and fix past mistakes? is there any hope at all for the magical world? cover pic - Harry's cub

** Could you give some more information? What you describe, describes a lot of stories. Perhaps something that is very story specific such as what happens to Harry(adopted by Snape/magical family, lives on streets, gets found by someone magical or non-magical) or what happens to Snape(searches for Harry, quits Hogwarts). Otherwise I'll try my best to find something but more info would help lots.

*** If I recall correctly, Snape goes back in time with help from the Gringots' goblins, saves Harry by substituting a golem, and raises him in another country.

**** Was just about to look for it again but looks like it's been found. I totally forgot about this fic so I guess I'll have to give it a reread now.
