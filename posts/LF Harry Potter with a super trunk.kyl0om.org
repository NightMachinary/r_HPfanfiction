:END:
I've seen many fics with harry have a trunk that's huge and awesome. I'm looking for one where he makes one or inherited one and after tinkering with it a bit finds a potter family one that's even bigger with farms and with a living Lily and James in status because she used a ritual that switched them out with transfigured pigs at the last second. It's an older story and on ffn. Pretty sure it's on hiatus or abandoned, but would be great if it got completed since I've read it last.

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.

*** Fwiw, that story is complete. There was a sequel started that is not. It's been a little while, but, IIRC the "end" isn't a bad ending, it stands alone reasonably well
