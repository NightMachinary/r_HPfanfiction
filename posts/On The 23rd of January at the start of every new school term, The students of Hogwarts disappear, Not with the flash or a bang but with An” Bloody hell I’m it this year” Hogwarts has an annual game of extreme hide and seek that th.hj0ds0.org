in previous years Oliver wood Had been found to have shrunk himself to the size of a church mouse and hidden inside his own sock drawer. Hannah Abbet was notorious for horrific hiding places having ones just stood behind a suit of armor screaming ‚Äú You can't see me for over an hour‚Äù

The Weasley twins tended To scale the astronomy tower with Lee Jordan and a bottle of Ogden's Finest and hide out until the final hours.

‚Äã

Harry potter had a bad habit of being found in the first five minutes not that Ron Weasley helped matters the ginger could never decide on a decent hiding place until the search party was upon them.

** One year Harry decided to ditch Ron (maybe he was snogging with Hermione, which incidentally let them last a lot longer as they weren't, respectively, in the library or in wide open corridor this year) and just went under Invisibility Cloak.

Hufflepuffs were intrigued when Harry Potter and Ron Weasley weren't outside the Great Hall.

Maybe it would be a challenge! It's a smidge worrying, considering it's /Potter/, but surely he won't release another basilisk or anything, haha... but look! Ron and Hermione! He must be near.

... He isn't.

Finally they got almost everyone from Gryffindor. Potter is still unaccounted for.

Hufflepuffs became more nervous the longer Harry is absent.

Some swear they hear footsteps in empty corridors. Some confess they felt a chill like a breath down their neck. The bitten apples and other snacks appear in weird places, always when their backs are turned to them but for a few seconds.

Finally, after a nerve wrecking three days and hordes of jumpy, skittish and distressed Hufflepuffs, Dumbledore decides to end the game. He calls Harry to reveal himself in the Great Hall.

/Harry comes out from behind Dumbledores back./

Dumbledore drops his wand. Some students schriek. McGonaggal spills her goblet. Snape snapps. Some Hufflepuffs cry tears of relief. They couldn't bear to live like that anymore.

Gryffindors cheer. For once victory was theirs. Harry high fives Ron. Hermione hides her eyes in her hand. Dumbledore twinkles. Once again interhouse unity prevails. Professor Sprout gives away calming draughts.
