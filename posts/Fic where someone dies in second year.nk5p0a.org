I'm looking for fics where someone is killed by the Basilisk in second yearbefore the chamber is found, preferably as a point of divergence.


** Not a point of divergence but Linkffn(Deal With A Devil) has COS turning into a deadly horror show till the school is closed. Continued in an unofficial sequel.

A certain unmentionable 800k fic by Noodle hammer has Terry Boot being killed by the basilisk. Being as divisive as it is, search around before reading it.

Linkffn(Her Mother's Love) The basilisk is released into the great hall and several students are murdered in the Chamber.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)

** Though not by the basilisk, but in linkffn(Forging the Sword) Ginny does die during second year and is the fic's main point of divergence.

  ::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)
