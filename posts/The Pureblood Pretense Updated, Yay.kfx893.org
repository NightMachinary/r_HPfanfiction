*** I avoided it for a while because the summary sounded like it would be pretty ordinary, maybe just a canon rehash. It's the opposite, though; it completely reinvents (and significantly expands) the canon world. Even when there are recognisable elements and characters, they're part of a very different story.

Most of the changes stem from the fact that Tom Riddle started a political party instead of a war. That has a lot of ripple effects. It means Riddle is alive, not trying to regain a body. It means the Potters were never attacked, and Harry grew up with both her parents. It means the Longbottoms are healthy, and so are dozens of other people who died in canon (both Light and Dark), and many of them (including Sirius) have children who didn't exist in canon.

It also means that it's become normal for the majority of witches and wizards to be pureblooded, and for muggle-borns to be officially excluded from most employment. It means that non-purebloods are barred from attending Hogwarts, and the penalty for "blood identity theft" (eg faking your family tree) is life in Azkaban. And it means that excessive inbreeding is creating a fertility crisis, where families with no recent muggle blood at all are likely to have only one healthy child. But most of them don't realise that that connection exists, or would be too stubborn to admit it if they did, and Riddle's chosen solution is characteristically extreme.

The author has crafted a rich and expansive world, and having Harry navigate through it all, while pursuing her one true love (potion brewing), is a fascinating ride.

*** The reason people freak out about updates for this fic so much is not just because it's good, it's because you get almost a novella's worth of stuff per update. The latest chapter was around 50,000 words; the series itself is pushing 1,500,000 at this point. And the words are not empty space.
