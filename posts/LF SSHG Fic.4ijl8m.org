All I can remember is that Hermione is dosed a potion that makes her do the opposite of what she wants to do. BC of that Snape accidentally rapes her (he doesn't know she is non-con). They are both scarred by it, I clearly remember him being devastated that she didn't see him as beautiful,etc as everything she said was the opposite of what she actually felt. Does this ring a bell to anyone? I know for sure it was on ffnet at least a year ago.


** Absinthe by Aurette. I will edit with a link in a few minutes when I can.
