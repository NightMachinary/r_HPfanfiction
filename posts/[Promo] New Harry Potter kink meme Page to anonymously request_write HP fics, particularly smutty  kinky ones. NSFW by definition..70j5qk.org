**** They kind of already do. Whatever your intentions there are several other very established communities or FF sites that do exactly what you are trying to do, and several which also allow underage. The only "advantage" I can see on your end is the "request" part, but since you dont allow underage (below 14 anyway), my guess is that a good portion of those who would want to request anonymously wont show up because those are likely to be the people who would want that anonymity.

Edit: and just to clarify, I am not attacking you or your idea, but just pointing out that this is not exactly new ground, and you are (to a certain degree) getting rid of a significant portion of the community that would "want" to be anonymous because of the underage stigma.

Also, heres hoping some Harry/Teacher stuff shows up there ;) (Above 14 of course)

***** A kink meme is a specific kind of thing, and there aren't any active Harry Potter ones, which is the only reason I wanted to set it up, honestly. Obviously prompts and requests can go up wherever, it's just that a kink meme has a set of established ideas.

Don't worry, I totally follow what you're saying - it doesn't feel like an attack at all.

***** I guess we read very different things? I for one very rarely see underage smut, in the HP fandom at least. So I'm not quite sure where you're finding this endless amount of it. I'm sure it exists, but the extent you claim? I don't know. As for it being a huge chunk of the fandom, again, I don't see that. There are an endless amount of kinks and fetishes out there and, personally, I don't really consider "underage" to be one since it's such a slippery slope to begin with.

Just to note: age difference is different than underage, so if that's what you're thinking then yeah, that definitely is in abundance.

****** I actually don't read "Extreme" underage smut as described by the OP. However when you define underage, technically that's ANYTHING that deals with Harry Potter while he's in school. That's a GIANT swath of the HP universe and FF stories. You literally can't do anything smut or even mature romance related without it being underage if your story has them at school.

A large portion of the time people want anonymity because something is not very accepted and is frowned upon. Underage smut fits that bill, DESPITE being very realistic. Kids become sexually active beginning around 11-12 years of age. Keep in mind sexually active does not necessarily mean having actual sex, but masturbating, petting, and the like. By 13-14 sex is a very real possibility. So I am merely pointing out that by saying extreme underage is not allowed, you get rid of a big reason why a certain set of people may want anonymity. In addition, by stigmatizing anything under 14, you also by default somewhat stigmatize underage in general, meaning even people who were looking for ANY sexually active HP fics that dealt with school-age HP (As I explained in the paragraph above) feel stigmatized.

Also bear in mind that "underage" does not necessarily have to be a kink or fetish. It can simply be a byproduct of a fetish or kink. For example, I like Student/Teacher material and I am not afraid to say so. But a large swath of Student/Teacher features an underage individual and thats just the nature of it. I am more interested in the dynamic of the relationship and its taboo nature then the age of the student.

At the end of the day the OP is opening a site that is then limiting the very crowd it caters to by stigmatizing a certain subset of those who wish to be anonymous, and since the "anonymous request" aspect is probably the part that will most draw people to it as there are many other "posting" sites, it hurts that very draw.
