I don't have any particular preference regarding pairings; I find I can enjoy most if they are well fleshed-out. Excellent writing quality is most important, and I enjoy a strong sense of place and subtle characterization.

Kinda just looking for an immersive dose of uncanonical optimism :)

** Mottsnave's series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/981534][The New Skin]] is excellent for this, although a heads-up for those who are picky: it's first-person POV, and this is a far more self-determined and self-aware Snape than we see in the series. Which is fine by me, but not everyone will click with the characterization.

** Hmm.

A bit of a twist: linkffn(The Snape Chronicles) is a canon-compliant full Snape biography. However, it has an alternate ending, linkffn(Miles to Go Before I Sleep by Rannaro), which is pretty much what you've asked for.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

*** Downvoter(s): I can hardly fix whatever you thought was the problem if you don't identify it. As far as I can see, "Miles to Go Before I Sleep" fits the OP request quite well, so I'm left puzzled by your unspecified objection.

** I like linkao3(7292632), but it doesn't have to be everybody's cup of tea. The author is Catholic, and although it is not sectarian (actually, this is the story with only known to me mention of the North Ireland Troubles; how appropriate in these days!) if you intensely dislike Christianity this is not for you. Severus hides in a monastery (full of magical monks) and confronts his past sins and mistakes.

** My WIP is a long-fic post-war Severus Snape POV. It is, however, set in 2006 so not 'after-mathy' per se. It is also a sequel to a canon-compliant story set during PoA. I can guarantee excellent writing quality and on-point character development (or you can check my reviews for yourself). I post weekly / fortnightly.

It's also on A03 if that's a preference. Same title.
