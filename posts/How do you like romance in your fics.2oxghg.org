If you're reading a fic with a pairing, do you prefer to have the "build up" to the relationship last a long time? Or do you just want them to get it out of the way?

Personally I like the author just sort of getting the pairing together at the beginning. I prefer "established" couple stuff, yes they still have some things to figure out, but its a little more fun for me to read.

I also think if they are already paired, it becomes less focused on them, and the story around them can flourish. The trouble with the build up, is if it is also an adventure fic, the build up often takes away from the rest of the story (in my point of view).

But what do you prefer if you're reading something with a pairing?

*** Me too. I can't stand it when I'm reading a good long series, and somewhere in the middle they decide it's time for pairings and pairing drama.

**** Oh god, yes. The worst offender of this in my mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] which had an interesting premise, decent writing, and a story that was shaping up to be pretty cool... and it was all thrown away so that two people could fuck each other's brains out and hasn't been updated since.

** Mainly I want the romance not to interfere with any character's ability to form their own goals and act independently. Good examples:

- The Problem with Purity has Hermione/Snape. Despite her relationship, Hermione still manages to cure lycanthropy, become an animagus, and ace her NEWTs.
- A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy has Hermione/Draco. Draco wants to keep custody of his son. Hermione wants funding for her school. They solve each other's problems and discover the true meaning of Christmas.

Bad examples make it mostly immaterial which woman ends up with Harry. It's no more than flavor, and maybe setup for Harry to be a hero -- for instance, if Harry ends up with Daphne Greengrass, he'll likely defend the family from Death Eaters trying to recruit her father. If his girlfriend is from any Dark family, there's a good chance he'll have to kill her sexually abusive father.

Terrible examples have Harry forming a harem whose members are differentiated mainly through hair color.

** I seldom see it, but I'd love more /in media res/ romantic relationships on main characters in fanfics. A story labeled "romance" should be about the romance, so treat it the same way you would the action scenes in a summer blockbuster movie.

No good action movie starts out with a thirty-minute, in-depth discussion about why they're about to get into some really awesome action over /here/ and not this /other/ action that /some people/ might think they might get into, but is totally not right for this action protagonist.

*** I think both ways can work, but it takes a much more talented writer to make an already established romance compelling. If there's a buildup, there's inherent tension. If they start out apart, and gravitate towards each other, it's fluid and dynamic. An already established romance can be this as well, but more often than not it's static. And even it's not static, the problems you see introduced tend to require one or both of the characters to pick up the Idiot Ball. I was a lot less interested in Jim and Pam's relationship on /The Office/ once they got together, in other words.

**** A lot of good romance movies and books start with two people teetering on the edge of breaking up, and that almost never happens in popular fanfics. If a story wants to be* original, it should try to break out of the "end with a kiss" trope where the story is over once the couple gets together. Or, dog help us, the also-popular "babies ever after".

Ugh. Why, WHYYYYY

I've read final chapters that contained /nothing/ other than a list of who ended up marrying whom and how many kids they spawned.

***** I'll agree with you on that point, for sure. "Babies ever after" I don't think I've ever seen done well. Might just be a taste thing, but it's usually so sweet it gives you a toothache.

And yeah, ending right as the couple gets together isn't great either.

Personally, I like to see the whole width and breadth of the thing. If it's important to the story that they're together, then it's important /how/ they got together, and I want to read about it.

** I have come to despise romance stories written about teenage kids. If you go back to canon, note how the romance scenes were by far the worst of the series (Won-won and Lav, cringe-worthy Harry/Cho, Monster in the ChestÂ®, etc.). Fanfiction writers seldom do better, often adopting the "oh noes, she doesn't like me, so let me cut myself" angst or "golly, we're Soul Bonded and are soooo happy!" in lieu of any sort of development. Most anything realistic for kids of that age is superficial and boring.

If I do read a romance story, I prefer it to be about adults who bring maturity and perspective to how they view the world, their place in it, their relationships with others, and their responsibilities toward others. A post-Hogwarts Harry/X, where X is some non-central canon character (e.g., Tracey Davis or Su Li) or OC would be my preference. I also don't much dig infidelity. Torrid Harry/Hermione affairs when both are married to Weasleys turn me off very quickly. (To me, these are the least readable of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]]'s stories.)

**** Aside from the humor of answering the question as if it were a martini, what I meant was that romance of the gushy, oversweet variety isn't very interesting for the observer, in fiction or in life. If you're going to include romance, make it funny, or poignant or plot-relevant.

If it's a key factor in whether the hero is betrayed at a critical moment by a spurned lover, I might be happy that I understood why the hero hooked up in the first place and why they broke up, leading to this moment of spitefulness. Even so, I doubt it'd matter what was in the favorite meal or how the hero danced when they were in courting mode.

** As a Snape Hermione shipper I prefer a very slow build up. Since their circumstances don't lend them to easily pairing up immediately the meat of the story is, for me, how they finally get to that point. After that, I usually find the rest of the story much less interesting.

** Get the drama portion of the pairings out of the way ASAP. After that I don't mind if the story has a lot of smut or romance, but I prefer if the actual plot still goes somewhere. Voldemort getting hit by a bus while Harry and Hermione are occupying broom closets isn't worthy of writing except as a comedy piece.

** I am not a fan of romance and very rarely read a story that focuses heavily on romance. But when romance is in a story I prefer:

- natural progression to relationship. I don't want to be told that Hermione and Snape are together. I will not be able to accept this if I do not see them getting there in a way that makes sense.

- no character bashing / die for our ship. I don't mind if you ship Harry/Hermione or Harry/Draco or whatever, but there is no reason to bash or kill the characters who you feel threatening for your ship. You can handle the situation more intelligently than that.

- Other interesting things happen, too, life goes on. I like to get the feeling that not everything in the world suddently revolves around the couple.
