It is such an obvious premise, but I've never seen it anywhere.

Bonus points if he goes back in time after some other time traveler goes to his time to give him the idea. I get a little annoyed when I see time travel stories in which there aren't unique circumstances making repeated time travel a bad idea or impossible.


** You're right, it is an obvious premise. And it's actually [[https://youtu.be/tNXSJIRGTHA?t=204][the plot of Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald.]]

Grindelwald wants to stop WW2, but instead of time travel to get the information, he uses his personal form of divination: magical bong ripping. ðŸ˜‚

*** Perhaps Seth Rogen would have been more appropriate a casting choice.

*** Ive never understood really why crimes of grindelwald went the way it did if preventing WW2 is his objective.

Using Voldemort as an example since we have little lore on the actions of darklords in hp universe. We assume the imperious exists and that grindelwald is powerful. Why not take the same path and voldemort and start taking over ministries (and muggle governments) with imperious/agents?

I would think it near impossible to have a war if you imperious the top 5 or 10 people in any given government and make them work towards peace.

I guess maybe the imperious was harder back then or all those people who believed in grindelwald couldnt cast it? maybe grindelwald was secretly stupid and missed the obvious way to get people to do what you want?

none of it makes any sense.

**** I never understood why Grindelwald had to look like Coldsteel the Hedgehog?

Like, is this seriously the man who commanded armies and worked with the nazis? If I saw that guy on the streets I'd stare at him because he looks like an idiot.

Polyjuiced auror grindelwald who just escaped prison actually looks more fitting.

Like, all they had to do was give him an attempt at a contemporary haircut for that era and have him not portrayed by johnny depp, was that too high a bar?

***** yeah when i first saw him i thought it was some sort of a disguise to look absurd...

Voldemort looked goofy post resurrection but i always sorta figured it was a temporary body or would have fixes coming when he won the war (in terms of his plans)

But grindelwald? fuck that just looked like it was someone trying to be fuckin weird and stand out as much as possible which doesnt really make sense.

One or 2 odd things can set you apart and make people pay attn if that is your goal, you can play them up or down based on your goals but looking like some albino clown who stuck his dick in a light socket?
