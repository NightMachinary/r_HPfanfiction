** Godfucking dammit.

I hate this fic. The author's interpretation of the Star Wars universe (particularly the Jedi and Jedi Code) is utterly surface level (except the red lightsaber thing in chapter 13) and relies upon fairly galling misinterpretations of a hell of a lot of things.

I can't stop reading this fic. I don't know why. Maybe it is because the level of skill a Harry [[/spoiler][this old]] has is actually fairly realistic. Maybe it's the fact that the Force Unleashed stories will never happen in this universe. Beats me. But I can't stop reading this, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMeSUu1pqdc][I don't want to stop.]] Motherfucker.

*** I, for one, don't really care so much about it's Star Wars accuracy. Nothing in it jumps out at me as blatantly wrong, and that's good enough for me.

And, yeah, I like it too. :)

**** It's really all the bashing on the Jedi, and the terrible misinterpretation of "There is no Emotion, there is Peace."

***** I haven't read this yet, but I will. Can you expand on the 'correct' interpretation of "There is no emotion, there is peace."

****** It all has to do with not allowing your emotions to control you, but to let them go and trust in the Force. It's /not/ about suppressing your emotions.

******** It's not ignoring the emotions either. Acknowledging, and letting go. Sometimes this is easy, other times it takes meditation to acknowledge and move on. For example: Qui-Gon after Tahl's death in the Jedi Apprentice book. Took months to process and then let go of his grief over her death.

** It's been a while since I read it, liked the first few chapter when it gave the vibe of Havoc Side of the Force. Then it got too repetitive. Chapter after chapter you read other people's account on just how awesome Harry is. Basically male Mary Sue.

Also the characterisations were way off. From what I remember, I left it at one of those chapters where it started to look like a harem fic.

** This is one of those fics I've really been enjoying since I started reading it. I'm a very long time fan of both universes so I generally love star wars x HP crossovers. The main reason I got into this fic is also because it was new and I've read most if not all of the already existing crossover fics.

**** Both Belgrath and Darth Marrs have some good stuff up on FFN if you haven't read them yet.

Also "The Lightsaber" by telemicus sundance on FFN is pretty good, but it's more star wars tech being put into the potterverse.
