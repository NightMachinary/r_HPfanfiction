I would like fics involving any interaction between Harry and Lily's parents.


** I know about only one such story, linkffn(Strong Blood by CooLibrarian). However, it is a strange story. It has some very strong elements (e.g., it is the only story I know about dealing with Harry's maternal ancestors; very interesting Dudley; elves), but it is also strange and convoluted (NO SPOILERS!). I still don't know what to think about it completely. And yes, it is also unfinished work.

  Harry and Dudley learn about their muggle grandparents, and the struggles they faced while facing challenges of their own. Rated M for serious issues.

** Great minds think alike, I was going to ask this lol.

It would be nice to find an AU with Lily's parents surviving the war and raising Harry.
