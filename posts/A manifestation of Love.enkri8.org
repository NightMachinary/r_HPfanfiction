A bit like linkffn(deprived) but instead of Harry gaining a loyal demon of hate he gets a gardian angel of love. Love would be a small, cute, cupid and can see the emption everywhere. Love is only visable to Harry and together they become match makers and defeat Voldemort by helping all the death eaters fall in love and gain reasons to avoid the war. It would be a crack fic with a ton of outlandish pairings.

  On that fateful day, two Potters were born. One was destined to be the Boy-Who-Lived. The other was forgotten by the Wizarding World. Now, as the Triwizard Tournament nears, a strange boy is contracted to defend a beautiful girl.
