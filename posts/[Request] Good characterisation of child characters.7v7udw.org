Anyone know of fics where the children actually speak and act like children, rather than tiny adults? I occasionally come across this done well, and feel happy, but was silly and didn't actually note any of them down. Don't get me wrong, I like me some glorious OP!Harry adventures on occasion, but I've always preferred the subtler stuff in general.


** This is a crossover fic with MCU verse, however, this fic does a great characterization of 4 year old Harry acting like a 4 year old would, trust me.

** These are a couple more suggestions that you would definitely love.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12179062/1/Of-Old-Soldiers-and-Missing-Wars][Of Old Soldiers and Missing Wars]] by NonchalantxFish has Tom Riddle as a young boy. He does act kind of adult like as you may expect considering his circumstances, but his childlike side does shows up enough to melt your heart. A fair warning though, I cried reading this fic.

- This one is a crossover series with the MCU' verse where the story is centered around Luna Lovegood. The series is extremely underrated. I just needed to at least attempt to spread it considering I absolutely adore the writing. It's like looking at a painting except with words.

The Under the Moon series starts off with a chronological series of one shots or two shots that eventually turns into a multi chaptered fic. This series is posted by MerciaLachesis:

- Basically, this series is a HP and MCU crossover. The story starts by focusing on Ron growing up in America with Clint. So Ron would understand plenty of pop culture references by the time he goes to Hogwarts in the sequel. It's a fun read overall. I was surprisingly invested in the story enough to reread the series a couple of times.
