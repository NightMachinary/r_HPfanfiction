From crack to wack. I want to find the greatest worst stories of hp fanfic i can find. From "so bad it's good", side splitting hilarity to "was the author legitimately on drugs?" I want it all!


** The most obvious is My Immortal. I read it all the way through once and it was shockingly bad in a funny way.

There's also [[http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html][this]] piece of brilliance done through predictive text.

One of the highlights:

*** I just need to mention that there's linkffn(My Immortal Lily and the Art of Bringing Me to Life), which is seriously disturbing, both as a fic and as proof that even My Immortal can spawn something good.

It's a crossover between My Immortal and Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus, and it takes all the surrealism from My Immortal and brings what reaction a (questionably) sane individual has to those things.

***** Not at all, I hadn't caught up with the fic in the past ten chapters and I was as lost as someone who had never read it. Lily gives nicknames to characters and sticks with them - The Horcrux in her mind Voldemort is called Wizard Lenin, Diarymort is Wizard Trotsky, Ginny is called Tequila (Kind of like Ebony now that I think of it) because it briefly mentions plot points from the fic. It's a clever look at My Immortal but I think I was really bothered by the idea of Lily and Tom having sex since they had this deep friendship for so long in the story. I guess that was the point. I still don't understand the ending to this story to be honest

Is Diarymort not by definition also Horcrux Voldemort? If the one you're calling "Horcrux Voldemort" is, say, from the Locket, then call him Locketmort. Ravenclaw's Diadem, Diademort. Etc.

Honestly though, why haven't you read Sisyphus!? It's my actual favourite fic. Give it a shot! There's another spinoff (crossover with Pokemon) that's so so hilarious it'd be worth it by itself.

******* Well, it's an AU with Fem!Harry, who at an early age, dies in an accident to find out she's Death (yes, I know, I know, but it is well done) and meets an alternate universe's Harry Potter, as Uncle Death, and the Horcrux in her head, as Wizard Lenin (again, i know).

It's very well written, has interesting plot lines, so many amazing spin offs and shorts, and very good ones too, ones not seen otherwise, has a time travel plotline to rival Lens of Sanity's, and is just an overall very different, good fic.

Because it has fem!Harry paired with Voldemort. Or to articulate further, not only does that story pair Harry with the dude who killed her parents, it also only used the gender switch to avoid being slash. Not touching either of those, no exceptions.

Synopsis: There is no synopsis.

At some point Harry astrally projects and gets half is mind stuck in the CERN computers because he's in the way of the first supercollider test. He is present and the instigator of more or less every major event during his life. He also has crazy mental powers where he can read minds, copy data and skills (both to and from himself).

And there's a weird interlude where he serves as an avatar of an aztec god and fights another aztec god (I think it's been a /long/ time since I read it), but it never actually goes anywhere or is relevant ever again.

And then he goes to hogwarts because he turns 11.
