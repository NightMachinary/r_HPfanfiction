Rowling's recent comment (regarding upcoming stories centered around the "dark side" of the wizarding world) has left me with a hankering for some good fic.

What are some fics that explore the darker aspects of the HP universe? I'm not necessarily talking about dark wizards or Death Eaters, or even dark!Harry, but unpleasant realities - whether it's corruption in the Ministry and sanctioned use of magic for creative torture, or the slow dilapidation of wizarding society in modern times. Dangerous magical research, hazardous artifacts whose purpose has long been forgotten, disturbing spells... that kind of thing. The grimy underbelly of the amazing world that so entranced Harry in his first year.

I'll read anything. Gen, het, slash - anything goes. Doesn't have to be perfectly written or anything. If you recommend me a thing, I'll give it a shot. :)


** I'm currenty writing "Divided and Entwined". It is centered on a civil war between multiple factions, and each side thinks they are the ones in the right/just defending themselves/taking revenge for murdered loved ones.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

** Marriage laws represented one of the worst parts of the Wizarding world.

I like five levels of different responses to it:

Level 1: Protagonists ran away as in *Escape*, linkffn(11916243)

Level 2: Protagonists led an exodus of a large amount of people, as in *Harry Potter's Reaction to the Marriage Law*, linkffn(6049450)

Level 3: Protagonists asked a third party to take out certain individuals, as in *There's Always a Way*, linkffn(2612901)

Level 4: Protagonists took out instigators of the Marriage Law by themselves, as in ?

Level 5: Protagonists overthrew the government and systematically executed anyone who voted for the Marriage Law, as in *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005)

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand.
