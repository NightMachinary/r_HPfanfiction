One of the biggest things in Hermione's favor is that she is literally the only person in the series who sees Harry as Harry and not the BWL or something else. Even Sirius sees him as a sort of reincarnation of James. Everyone else is either in awe of him or hates him because of his image. But Hermione isn't impressed by his celebrity status. Why this would be a good thing in a relationship is obvious, I hope.

She's also his most loyal supporter and friend. Ron abandons him at crucial points several times, but she stays loyal to Harry even when it costs her dearly. She believes him after the Goblet of Fire incident, even when the rest of the school turns on him. She follows him to fight Death Eaters at the DoM, despite having serious reservations. She abandons her education, something that's extremely important to her, to help Harry on his horcrux hunt. She even stays with him when her douchebag boyfriend abandons both of them.

In short, she's always there for Harry, even at the cost of her personal goals. The only time I can think of her acting in a truly selfish manner is during sixth year, when she is annoyed with Harry's potions book and becomes obsessed with Ron. (The former is understandable because it violates her sense of fair play, but the latter is so unbelievable that it stands out starkly as OOC. She somehow got turned into Parvati for half the year).

Moreover, she's good for Harry. They were both alone and ostracized in their youth (for different reasons), and I think he recognizes that in her. She's pushy, sure, but she's always pushing Harry to be better, stronger, and smarter than he currently is. He would not have developed into any kind of leader without her backing him. Neither the DA nor the horcrux hunt would have been possible without her.

(Crucial point here: despite her influence, Harry is the leader and Hermione the follower in canon. The ‘Herman' crap is a result of fanfic writers exaggerating Harry's abuse/incompetence and creating scenarios in which only the flawless Hermione can ‘heal' him).

It's also clear that each finds the other physically attractive. She tells him how ‘fanciable' he is and he is gobsmacked at how beautiful she is at the Yule Ball.

So what's not to love about the ship?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yeah, I can practically hear some of you muttering in disgust. ‘She's bossy! She's self-righteous! She's obsessed with proving herself! She's slavishly devoted to authority! She's afraid to break the rules! She's got bad hair! She farts in her sleep! Her cat has hairballs!'

It's all true. (Well, maybe not the flatulence, but even the British eat Mexican food sometimes, right?) None of those things undermines her character because she slowly grows out of her most annoying quirks.

Slavish devotion to authority? She tells Umbridge and Trelawney to stuff it. She doesn't give unearned respect. Desperate need to prove herself? She selflessly abandons her education to help her best friend. Afraid to break the rules? She slugs Malfoy, bewitches McLaggen to help Ron, helps Harry create an illegal organization, etc.

Bossy and self-righteous? Sure, but it's almost always motivated by her sense of justice or her need to protect Harry. She confiscates his broom because she thinks it was from Sirius Black (And it was). She tries to help the house elves because she despises slavery in any form. (And she gives up when she realizes her efforts are counter-productive).

Hermione's most annoying aspects have their roots in childhood insecurity. She is clearly vulnerable to doubts about her self-worth, which is why she feels the need to prove herself to those with authority and pursue justice for the oppressed. The same thing extends to her physical appearance.

You may or may not find this endearing, but she grows out of her insecurities during the books, and it is her relationship with Harry that allows it to happen. She may push him, but he rescues her from a life of lonely obscurity and low self-esteem. He's good for her too.

Thus endeth the tl;dr.


** I'd just like to present one argument against: Harry does not find Hermione attractive. He emphasises her ‘flaws'; big teeth, bushy hair etc. Compare how he describes her to how he describes girls he's actually attracted to: Parvati, Cho, Ginny. His reaction to Hermione at the Yule Ball is actually really unflattering, considering he doesn't recognise her at first.

He also finds her nagging, and lies to her to avoid that.

** You bring up a lot of good points as to why Hermione is such an amazing friend to Harry, but not a romantic partner.

Her loyalty is admirable and also a trait one needs to have in a friend. But her loyalty has nothing to do with whether Harry enjoys her company enough to want to be with her for the rest of his life. Time and time again, we see that when it's just the two of them and they aren't trying to solve an issue or protect themselves from danger, they don't really get along. Harry even mentions in GoF that without Ron, things are just not as fun. Harry also has a wicked, dry and almost evil sense of humor. Hermione does not share this sense of humor and really just isn't that funny, which Harry strongly desires in a partner.

Harry is frequently annoyed with Hermione's nagging, even if its for the best and comes from the right place. Her nagging and often-judgmental behavior comes at the worst times. For example, when Harry uses Sectumsempra on Draco in HBP, he feels truly awful. At that moment, Hermione is more concerned with being right than comforting Harry. It's actually Ginny who loyally defends him and knows that what Harry needs at that moment is comfort and support.

And I hate to bring up Ginny because this isn't really about her, but I'd argue that Ginny is equally, if not more loyal than Hermione. The example from HBP being one such example, but Ginny has always shown unwavering support for Harry, too. And one could argue she risked even more in the Deathly Hallows to help Harry considering she was directly under the thumb of Death Eaters and still found ways to help Harry.

You are partially right that Hermione is the only person who never saw Harry as anything but Harry. She did know about him first as the BWL when she met him on the train, but it never seemed a big deal to her. Ginny was very much a fan of the BWL, as was Ron. But them and many others clearly stopped seeing him that way. So yes, Hermione may have been the only person to /never/ see him as anything but Harry, but it's incorrect to say she is the only one who doesn't seem in another way. And it's not the worst thing in the world to see someone as more than just them. It's ok if Ginny sees Harry as just Harry, but also her hero who saved her life. It doesn't mean she wouldn't work for him.

Finally and most superficially, Harry and Hermione never displayed romantic interest in each other. They always had a brother/sister relationship. You could give every amazing justification of why they should be together and it wouldn't work for this very basic fact.

Good analysis on why they are such a good example of strong friendship, though!

Ginny was not the one who helped with the tournament and she did not believe the Death Eater Draco theory either. I mean, I am not saying that Harry and Hermione are a match made in heaven, but that reason for Harry/Ginny is just wrong.

Edit: I was referring to the MORE LOYAL than Hermione part, for which there is no evidence. No one believed Death Eater Draco, so that is not a point against Hermione. And besides that one instance, Hermione was the single most loyal companion to Harry. That does not mean that they should bang, that means that the statement that Ginny was MORE loyal than Hermione is wrong. In all other instances, either both were there for Harry, or Hermione was there for Harry while Ginny was doing nothing notable like defending Harry. That does only prove that Hermione was more loyal, not that they are a perfect couple. Stop putting things into my mouth which I did not say.

**** Hermione didn't belive Harry when he said that they should go to Godric Hollow.

She didn't believe him when he said that the broom wasn't jinxed.

Ginny was here for Harry after he felt bad for using Sectumsempra on Draco. Hermione was gloating on being right.

And what's with this argument about "no one". First of all, Harry only told this theory to a few person. Ginny NOT included. How could Ginny believe him then? Besides if someone slaps you, but no one thinks it's wrong, how would you feel about it? Bad. So IT IS a point against Hermione

Is that even an argument? Ron was the best of friend after all he STILL stayed his friend at the very end.

Hermione didn't believe Harry when he told her about Draco until it was too late, and she didn't believe about Godric's Hollow until it was too late.

And no! It isn't plausible that Voldemort engineered this trap for a long time because he prefered keep Nagini with him.

********* *Argument*

In logic and philosophy, an argument is a series of statements typically used to persuade someone of something or to present reasons for accepting a conclusion. The general form of an argument in a natural language is that of premises (variously propositions, statements or sentences) in support of a claim: the conclusion. The structure of some arguments can also be set out in a formal language, and formally defined "arguments" can be made independently of natural language arguments, as in math, logic, and computer science.

In a typical deductive argument, the premises guarantee the truth of the conclusion, while in an inductive argument, they are thought to provide reasons supporting the conclusion's probable truth.

**** Wait, so your argument is that Ginny is not as loyal to Harry because at a time when they weren't friends and Ginny was not involved in the solving of the tri-wizard mysteries, she didn't help him? That really has nothing to do with loyalty, and even if it did, it would have no bearing on things.

Did Ginny reject the Draco theory? Not sure if that is in canon, but even if so, all that means is that neither her or Hermione believed him. That doesn't make the argument that Hermione is more loyal because she also wasn't loyal in that moment.

I mean, ultimately we are arguing an opinion based on evidence, so neither of us can be right or wrong. But my main argument that they are equally loyal has in no way been proved wrong by your argument.

Your argument is that Hermione works best for Harry because of loyalty, yet the actual canon pairing for him has displayed incredible loyalty as well. Sure, she was not able to show that loyalty as much simply because she wasn't his good friend until the 5th book, but loyalty isn't measured in quantity.

*** I agree that per canon, Harry and Hermione had a sibling type of relationship. And while I dislike this fact, it was pretty clear from Order of the Phoenix that Harry and Ginny would end up together. (I think many readers missed that JK Rowling sprinkled hints about their future relationship in the fifth book.) Nonetheless, I don't particularly have a problem with Harry and Ginny together. I do, on the other hand, have a problem with Hermione and Ron together. I don't hate Ron. I actually like him as a character. But I can't reason why he ended up with Hermione (who's one of my favorite characters in the series). Alas, we have FanFiction which is good as I do usually enjoy Harry/Hermione romance-type fics or Charlie Weasley and Hermione stories.

**** I am rather indifferent to Ron and Hermione. Realistically, they probably aren't a great match because of how much they bicker and how little they actually seem to have in common. But the books do show a natural chemistry between them which is something that is just an intangible in a relationship. And the fact that they make it seem like Hermione wants Ron from such an early age, despite all his flaws, makes it easier to digest when it actually happens. Clearly, Hermione's character is such that she is drawn emotionally and romantically to funny, lax guys like Ron, or just Ron specifically. Maybe she puts so much stress onto herself with school and overall achievement, that she is attracted to a person who allows her to relax or is just the embodiment of a personality she may wish she had.

It's funny because while everyone harps on Ron not being good enough for Hermione, if he never made a move on her, I could buy him easily moving on to someone more his speed, whereas Hermione seems to have such a specific type in Ron that perhaps it actually would be tougher for her to find someone else. She doesn't go for guys who are much like her, or moody, deep guys like Harry. So that leaves the lax goofball, but then you have to consider Hermione also loves Ron for all they went through together. No other guy could give her that.

Amazingly, despite my many issues with Cursed Child, the idea that Hermione might wind up a bitter single if Ron never got with her, yet he would marry someone else, is somewhat plausible. Not to say I approve of it.

Why this would be a good thing in a relationship is obvious, I hope.
#+end_quote

Don't you remember how her reaction when Harry introduced himself? Let me help you:

#+begin_quote
  "Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
#+end_quote

It's not because she never talked about it later that she didn't see him as the BWL. Plus it also has to do with the fact that she a muggleborn. I don't remember Dean Thomas gaping at his scar or anything like that. And by the way, Sirius never saw him as a reincarnation of James, that's just Molly's opinion.

#+begin_quote
  She's also his most loyal supporter and friend. Ron abandons him at crucial points several times, but she stays loyal to Harry even when it costs her dearly. She believes him after the Goblet of Fire incident, even when the rest of the school turns on him. She follows him to fight Death Eaters at the DoM, despite having serious reservations.
#+end_quote

However, she did turn back on him during their sixth year because of the Half-Blood Prince's book. Even when Harry needed emotional support because he felt disgusted with himself after using Sectumseptra on Draco, she didn't try to help him. She just gloated about being right. Not exactly something you're looking in a friend, even less in a romantic partner.

#+begin_quote
  She abandons her education, something that's extremely important to her, to help Harry on his horcrux hunt. She even stays with him when her douchebag boyfriend abandons both of them.
#+end_quote

Do you think that she had a choice? Do you think that a "mudblood" would have been able to attend Hogwarts under Voldemort's reign? And before you try to tell that she could have attended any other magical school (Beauxbatons, Durmstrang...), she couldnt! Or else, Dean Thomas would have already changed school instead of deciding to camping with a goblin and a grandpa.

#+begin_quote
  In short, she's always there for Harry, even at the cost of her personal goals. The only time I can think of her acting in a truly selfish manner is during sixth year, when she is annoyed with Harry's potions book and becomes obsessed with Ron. (The former is understandable because it violates her sense of fair play, but the latter is so unbelievable that it stands out starkly as OOC. She somehow got turned into Parvati for half the year).
#+end_quote

Hermione has absolutely no sense of fair play. Don't you remember what she did on Cormac? Hint: it's about a certain Confundus spell. The only reason why she was annoyed (completelly pissed of) at Harry was because she can't stand anyone be better at her. And her obsession with Ron is totally in character. Hermione couldn't stand seeing someone she like being with someone else. She even cursed him for it. How can anyone like her is beyond me.

#+begin_quote
  Moreover, she's good for Harry. They were both alone and ostracized in their youth (for different reasons), and I think he recognizes that in her.
#+end_quote

Oh yes! Being ostracized because Hermione was a know it all and a teacher pet is EXACTLY the same as Harry being mentaly abused by his own family, locked in a cupboard. Poor Hermione. I'm crying.

#+begin_quote
  She's pushy, sure, but she's always pushing Harry to be better, stronger, and smarter than he currently is. He would not have developed into any kind of leader without her backing him.
#+end_quote

The only thing I can agree with is that she is pushy. Harry never got better because of Hermione. He got better because he had Voldemort after his head. And I don't see how someone with poor social aptitude like Hermione could help Harry become a leader.

#+begin_quote
  Neither the DA nor the horcrux hunt would have been possible without her.
#+end_quote

Hmm... let's see. The DA was a total catastroph. Why in hell, would Hermione make everybody sign a contract if it isn't to protect their secret? Edgecombe got punished /after/ she revealed the secret. Hermione is either incapable of solving real life problems, or she didn't care about the club.

Now, let's talk about the Horcrux hunt. She was useless. She didn't destroy any Horcruxe. And don't bring up the cup because it was Ron's idea to use the Basilisk. The book (Harry), The ring (Dumbledore), the locket (Ron), the diadem (Crabbe), the cup (Ron's idea), the snake (Neville) and Harry (Voldemort).

Even Voldemort was more useful against Voldemort than Hermione.

#+begin_quote
  It's also clear that each finds the other physically attractive. She tells him how ‘fanciable' he is and he is gobsmacked at how beautiful she is at the Yule Ball.
#+end_quote

He was ONCE gobsmacked at how beautiful she was. And it was only after she "wasted" hours to present herself. And seriously, give me some magic and a few hours and I would make a monkey look sexy.

#+begin_quote
  So what's not to love about the ship?
#+end_quote

Harry could/would never be attracted to Hermione. The only reason he is his friend, is because he was lonely for all his crappy childhood. That's the reason paedophile befriend lonely child. Because they crave for friendship.

I'm not going to comment on the second part because I would mostly repeat myself.

** I actually like Harry and Hermione pairing, but I don't think you can justify a romantic relationship between them based on Books.

Your argument against Ron conveniently leaves out the fact that Ron was under the influence of the Locket and minutes after taking that thing off, he regretted leaving and wanted to come back. Besides, it was Harry who had that brilliant inspiration to put a Horcrux around their necks.

And what did Harry do after Ron left? He was spending hours a day stalking Ginny's dot on the Marauder's Map, while leaving Hermione crying to sleep in her bunk. Hermione, on the other hand, was using the highly unpleasant portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black for company. Very awkward.

To Harry, Hermione behaves truly like an annoying, caring, intimidating, loyal, nagging, and trusting big sister. He would protect her with his life, he would trust her with his life, but he would not want her as his wife, especially if another more attractive alternative existed.

** I agree :) - they bring out the best in each other and a relationship with her could really cure/fix some of Harry's problems, because let us face it:

Harry would at some point tell Hermione about his childhood (strange that she didn't pick up on the abuse, I mean Harry has an aversion to being touched and stiffens when people do so and its not to hurt him (Note: No, the Dursleys didn't beat the shit out of him daily, but there weren't non-violent either! They tried to "stomp out the magic" after all and Petunia does try to hit him with a damned frying pan - sure it doesn't happen every day and Vernon is not a rapist like some fanfiction says he is, but the Dursleys still are physically and mentally abusive and Harry suffers for it and has bagagge that he doesn't even notice IMHO! Like his aversion to learning...he never received praise which means he lacks drive to earn more praise!) and when he does Hermione will send him to a therapist (even if they have to invent a codeword or voice-recognition locked memory charm to do it because wizards seem to lack mind-healers!) to heal!

They both also have the same background and Harry does not belittle her for her houself-crusade (he doesn't agree, but he's not Ron who laughs about it!) and other things (Ron makes fun of her academic inclination but Harry never does!)

It's a two-way-street, too because Harry also fixes some of Hermione's issues! He tempers her impulses, takes her mind of constant studying, he offers company (Hermione would be quite alone without Ron and Harry, but Harry is better company for her than Ron is - he doesn't belittle her after all etc.), he breaks her out of her slavishly adoring authority (hell, telling her that it was her adored Dumbledore who left him to be abused for years, not to mention that he put Harry on the doorstep like a bottle of milk - in winter no less!)
