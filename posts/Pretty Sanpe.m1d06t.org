:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Another fic that is at my tip of my nose, i think it had...

- Lily and James are alive with a WBWL sister, who follows more of the trope as a being a major brat

- I think it had Heir Hary-Too-Many-Names-Potter with a side of neglect from parents, more from James I think

- I think Snape basically adopted him

- I remember a scene where Harry and Snape are making a potion when BAM, it explodes and some land on the face of the Bat.

- the potion removed all the fumes from potions and pranks done by the murarders and he turned a into a handsome squidward.

- a small scene where it showed that girl-who-was-spoiled has a small crush with snape

- it had a fight scene between James and some one in the main hall


** Okay, no joke, i think that I have read this one. Do you recognize the name Rose Potter? I think it might be....

Of course, I have gone through /many/ WBWL fics, because I simply love the trope, so I may be completely wrong, and I apologize for wasting your time.

  When Voldemort attacked he didn't kill Lily and James. When he met his downfall they mistook Harry's twin as the GWL, they send their son away to the Dursleys but he doesn't quite make it in to the Dursley's loving care. Harry will take Hogwarts and his 'family' by storm and by the time the 'light' realize their mistake it will be too late for them to fix. OOC!Dark!Powerful!Harry.
