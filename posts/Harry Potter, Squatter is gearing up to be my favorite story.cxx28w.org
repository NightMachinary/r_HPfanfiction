Story: Harry Potter, Squatter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1]]

Great crossover with Percy Jackson. Looks like Harry is going to be crazy overpowered eventually but the writer is doing it in an interesting way.


** You have to remember though that this is a world with gods and goddesses. So OP Harry might be strong but as long as he doesn't get god level strong it'll be ok.

*** I more meant he is being tutored by a bunch of God's so his knowledge/skills will be OP compared to other demigods. I can't wait till he steamrolls Hogwarts if he goes

** It sounds pretty fun... How necessary is knowing the Percy Jackson fandom for this fic though?

(Maybe I should just read Percy Jackson...)

*** Percy Jackson is a solid YA read. Not super necessary but helpful when he meets up with a few characters just so you get why they are important. Everything is explained if you don't know the characters

** Just gave it a quick readthrough and thought it was great. I was wondering if there is any other stuff that's worth reading? A lot of the PJO crossover stuff ends up being very OPHarry focused and Squatter does a great job making it a slower growth.

** While I can quite clearly see and acknowledge the potential for OP Harry, the slow build up, amazing character interaction and Harry's pure innocence make me not give a damn about it. I dearly hope that this fic continues in this manner.
