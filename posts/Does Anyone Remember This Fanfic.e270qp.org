:END:
Several years ago I remember reading a fanfic where Hermione goes undercover at some pureblood ball or masquerade. Part of the ceremony is toasting and drinking something that she later discovers is a lust potion! She is then cornered by Bellatrix and Narcissa and drama ensues...

Can't seem to find it anywhere! If anyone remembers this fanfic or has a link, I'd love to re-read.
