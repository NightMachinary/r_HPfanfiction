I'm looking for a fanfic/oneshot where someone actually concentrates on Harry's mental health (because i think we can all agree that in canon --- although yes, he did have his reactions on traumatic events like Cedric's death, most of his trauma was kind of omitted). I'd love a fanfic that is something like canon rewrite just with Harry having realistic responses to like, burning his teacher alive or almost dying every five seconds, but more AU things are also great. Does someone know something like that?


** This is one of the central themes of my fic (sorry for the shameless self-promotion). One of the reasons I wrote it is that I always wanted to see a more realistic exploration of Harry's struggles. The kid's been through a lot.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts ended in tragedy. Now, as he faces a world darkened by Voldemort's return, he must cling to those he loves more than ever. Struggling with his guilt, Harry resolves to work harder so that he can protect others from Cedric's fate. Follow a slightly sadder Harry through a different fifth year at Hogwarts as he deals with an evil pink-clad professor, a mysterious connection to Voldemort, and the very real trauma of his past.
