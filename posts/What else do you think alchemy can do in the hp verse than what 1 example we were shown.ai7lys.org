In other fantasy universes it can do alot of cool stuff

Alchemy is basically an almost clean slate for the fanfiction community to work with. Lets use it!


** The problem with alchemy, which is essentially about turning physical substances into other physical substances, is that transfiguration largely makes it redundant. Some authors nerf transfiguration so as to make room for alchemy, but this isn't very satisfying. While there's some room for continued usefulness of alchemy in relation to the limited areas where Transfiguration cannot provide an answer (e.g. the 5 exceptions), in most situations alchemy is going to represent the long way around to achieving the same thing as Transfiguration.

With all that said, when considering continued application of alchemy in modern magic, I generally look to its more spiritual side. Alchemy is not just about transformation of physical substance but also of spirit. Transfiguration is purely physical and cannot e.g. transform the soul. So I imagine alchemy as being capable of transforming magic as well as physical things; alchemy would be the source of bloodline abilities like parseltongue.

Edit: another use for alchemy would be where it's important to eliminate the possibility of untransfiguration.

***** Just remember: Harry gets lost in those Pure Blue Orbs. Also Ron gets bashed because he hates Harry hanging out with those "filthy snakes." And Daphne can either have jet-black, silky hair or long blonde locks.

** You can think of the ritual at the end of Book 4 as an alchemical one rather than plain old potions, if you're interested in explaining away the wildly convoluted plan Voldemort and Crouch Jr cook up to kidnap Harry. That the elixir required a certain number of months to brew, needed the enemy's blood to taken fresh, and whatever else strikes your fancy.

Permanent transfiguration comes under Alchemy, so Peter and Voldemort take three ingredients to create a new, permanent body for Voldemort.

Transfiguration is already permanent. The transfiguration timer is completely fanon.

**** Not so. There is Untransfiguration, which is the process of reversing transfiguration.

It would be funny if Voldemort's body were to be reduced to the twisted one resembling a baby with a simple wave of a wand, wouldn't it?

Isn't it just another tranfiguration?

Nothing says you couldn't transfigure his body. He'd just probably kill you before you have a chance tho

** In my works, alchemy is a two spoked discipline,one line covering magic in and how it reacts to objects and the other line covering the permanent creation of something without the use of a wand to fuel the transformation.

There are peaks of both. The creation of the magical categories such as spells hexes curses ect. Is the peak of line 1's understanding of magic and its reactions. While the Philosoper's stone is the peak of line two. Capable of extending and creating extra time for a drinker of it's elixir, and capable of transmutation of gold from other objects, it is the perfect example.

While transfiguration is common, it doesnt create anything, it shifts things. Harry in my work hasnt discovered this, but conjuring in water is harder than in air, because you aren't conjuring anything, you are transfiguring the air. Vanishing is the same. You arent vanishing something, but transfiguring it into the air, with magic doing the work.

Alchemy for me, is work outside of that. Its not a shift but a creation and destruction. It is a perversion of natural physics, utilizing magic as a fuel for things impossible.

** I think you need alchemy to create hybrid creatures like the blast-ended skrewt. Spell-based transfiguration functions under subtle rules that seem to prevent someone from changing something into something that doesn't exist somewhere already, to be used as a template. Alchemy is when the wizard uses substances to warp an existing thing into something new. My take on it, anyway.
