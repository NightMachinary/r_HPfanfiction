So what I remember of this fic is:

I'm pretty sure Harry was rich and probably an heir to the Black fortune as well as the Potter one blah blah blah.

Wizarding Britain was mostly split into Pagans and Wizarding Orthodox, and Harry was being asked to pick one to show that he was invested in wizarding society and not rejecting their traditions.

Wizarding Orthodox Christianity was fleshed out a little, as a separate thing from other Orthodox Churches. There was a bone church.

Harry is counseled by a priest at his local church, [[/spoiler][who turns out to be working for Voldemort]] and end up choosing to be Confirmed as an Orthodox Christian. He learns that he was Baptised by his parents as a baby, I think.

[[/spoiler][The priest comes up with some excuse that Harry has to spend the night at least appearing to pray in the church before his Confirmation, so that he will give the impression of great devotion. The Order of the Phoenix are on guard around the church, but it all goes wrong and I think a throat gets slit. It's all a plot to kill Harry.]]

I read this a few years ago, I think, and I mainly remember just being interested in the ideas of how religion worked in wizarding society. I'd love to find it again and see if that part held up.


** I know a fic with a bone church, but I don't remember the confirmation part - though it has been a looooong time since I read it. Anyway: linkao3(Two Households II: Two Weeks Over Easter by mad_martha). Obviously, from the title, it's actually second in a series. And the series (if not this part) is slash, which may be why no one around here remembers it.

*** I think it might be that series, yes. Thank you! I must have read it during a phase of Harry-gets-rescued-from-living-with-the-Dursleys. It looks like the religion stuff mostly starts at the end of that part, and must get more explored in later parts, although the wizarding culture stuff is sort of threaded through.

Thank you!

** I have definitely read this, it does exist. Damned if I can remember enough other details to ID it though. Will keep thinking.
