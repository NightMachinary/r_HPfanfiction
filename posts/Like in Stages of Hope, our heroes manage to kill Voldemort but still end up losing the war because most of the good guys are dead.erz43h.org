At the end, most of the good guys are dead, and even though most of the evil guys are also dead, the ones still alive along with all the sycophants, cowards and enablers still maintain the status quo of the Death Eater Ministry. They refuse to change now that they have power.

Points to the stories where this happens because the protagonists and the Order are close to their canon selves and simply not ruthless enough to fight a war, whereas the Death Eaters aren't holding the idiot ball like in canon and are actually competent villains.

Don't particularly care if the story deals with the war itself or with its aftermath.

No Death Eater apologism, no Death Eater pairings

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** That's not far off from canon really. JK Rowling waved a magic wand at the situation and said it was all better now. Realistically that was not the case.

Nearly all of the competent adults for their side of the war were dead. They had a child martyr who came back from the dead and that was it. That's the grand total of their political power.

While tons of laws passed by the ministry during DE reign gave what few remaining pureblood supremacist alive tons of power politically.

That is canon, and JK fixed it with her magic wand saying everything was okay now. It's not okay, it's just not actively getting worse still.

**** You understand that I am saying her shit of an epilogue was her magic wand right? She realized at the end of her book it was a war torn hell scape with no bright sunny future. Instead of a new dawn they were looking forward to only a less horrible tomorrow.

She fucked up and realized she had painted herself into a dystopian win so she just epilogued.

So ignoring her frankly clumsy and poorly made attempt magic wand it away canon HP is exactly what you are looking for.

When you write something so dark you have no idea how to fix it without a massive time skip you have created a nightmare scenario.

You understand that what I wanted was a nightmare scenario of the Battle of Hogwarts and the preceding Death Eater coup right? Where most of the good guys were already dead before the final battle? Where there's no survivor from the Order and almost none from the DA? Where the Death Eaters aren't holding the idiot ball and are actually competent villains who ensure their opposition is dead and the random survivor is too fucking scared to put this neck out?

I know that JKR waved her magic wand to make everything be okay but I'm not talking about /just/ the epilogue.

No it isn't. I'm looking for something /much/ worse. Where something like the epilogue isn't possible at all, and not because of the political situation but because there simply aren't enough good people alive.

You have read Stages of Hope right? You know that in that story in the original dimension of our protagonists, at the end, most of the good guys are dead except Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna? All the Weasleys except Fleur and her baby?

****** Damn, that's some dark stuff man. I'm not really into that stuff. I'm okay with no win scenarios so long as the hero goes down swinging. What you seem to be looking for is worse than that by a large margin. Brutal stuff, best of luck to you.

Not being facetious, I genuinely wish you luck. I cannot help as I would never read something like that. They make me angry to read as unless they are extremely well written they have to hobble characters to make it work.

On the discussion we are having about canon I mean that the epilogue is impossible to have happened in canon HP. There is no way the world would have turned out that way. It would have been a far darker world with revolution still brewing or it would already have happened.

******* Oh, I agree with you regarding the epilogue. But I'd dearly suggest reading Stages of /Hope/. It's very well written. It contains elements of this prompt and the ending is hopeful.

**** Scotty looked over to Captain Jack Sparrow as the incoming hail of downvotes approached their location.

"Moar Powa!"

The Waaagh broke free as the Wookie named Harry (redundant right isn't, like naming your aunt's chihuahua Kick Me) smashed the joystick across the TV.

Picard facepalmed as Dumbledore started turning everything into Lemon Drops.

Pheromone Gangreen was too busy trying to force Yoda to accept a dirty sock to pay much attention.

Shaggy had just intorduced the only known example of a sentient black hole called Ron to weed and buffet owners across the multiverse cried out in unknown terror.

Daphne was busy being introduced to joys of hardcore domination bondage by Watson to listen to Sherlock telling her the entire story of her life based on her right index finger.

Suddenly Iron Man swoped in and punched Dudley across the face before Fred Flintstone arrived on the scene.

Getting his genres confused Fred ripped Voldemorts head off trying to take off his mask.

Batman appeared and started ranting about copyright royalties owed to Wayne Industries as Anakin was forced to watch his family die.

Finally Stewie arrived in a flash of CooWip and stated the downvotes would continue until the subject agreed to change their opinion.

With her last breath Luna said You Will Not Pass and dove into the river of sanity.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
