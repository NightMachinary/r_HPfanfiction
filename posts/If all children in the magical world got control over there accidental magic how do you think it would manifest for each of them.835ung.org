How do you think it would have manifested for each of the students in harry year?

For Ron i think it would manifest while he was playing check either learning to read his opponents surface thoughts or in Divination were he Literal is predicting 3 moves a head(with how far he predicts ahead getting better with practice)

for Neville i think It would be in his plant with his being able to use divination to see to there needs.

I think that one of the reason that Divination do well in the harry potter world is that it has More incommon with getting control of accidental magic than wand based magic

how do you think other people would manifest there magic as children?
