I'm looking for a story where harry dies and voldemort wins. I think its a series of one shots where as people die they are judged where they end up in the afterlife.


** Is it this?

  Harry Potter was sent to Azkaban and died a traitor's death. What happens when the world finds out the truth? Voldemort lets the world know. VERY dark. If you are looking for a happy ending, this story is not for you. One-shot.

  Third in the Boy Who Died Alone universe. This continues the Ultimate Rewards in a world where Voldemort wins because of the betrayal of Harry Potter. Suggested that you read The Boy Who Died Alone and This is Your Reward first.

  Follow up to my one-shot The Boy Who Died Alone, the ultimate "rewards" are handed out as each person passes away. This will include at least the trio, Dumbledore, Fudge, Luna, Sirius and Remus. What will each receive? CharDeath
