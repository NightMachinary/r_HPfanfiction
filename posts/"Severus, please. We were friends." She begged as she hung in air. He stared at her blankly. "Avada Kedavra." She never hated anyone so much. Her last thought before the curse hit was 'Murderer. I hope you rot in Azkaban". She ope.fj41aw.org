** There is a german fanfiction that tells canon from Snape's point of view. It's really amazing and Charity is basically Snape's best friend, also she is the one who originally taught Voldemort (and later Snape) Legilimency and Occlumency. Sadly the author stopped halfways through book five. Sorry, I just had to throw that in, that scene destroys me every time I am reading it now, because the story fits so perfectly into canon and I can't see them not as friends anymore.

**** So if someone were to take on this prompt, it would be ‘what would the muggle studies professor do if thrown back in time'?

Could go quite a few ways with this because Burbage is technically an OC with so little information about her. Her background as a muggle studies professor wouldn't be much help because muggle studies is woefully out of date.

If I were to have a go at this, I honestly seeing it going close to The Rune Stone Path (minus the four pairing), with Burbage learning everything she can about Harry Potter and trying to mentor and guide him to better version than he was in her timeline.

That is if she just doesn't just gtfo of Europe lol.

Depends on if she's a Pureblood or Half-Blood in said story, and to be honest? It depends on how the author spins her class. I find it entirely plausible that Charity could be a half blood with exposure to the Muggle world and knew her shit, but had severe restraints on what she could teach due to the Board of Governors. Could make for a fun fic with a more cynical slant on Hogwarts, interesting school and wizarding politics, and Charity trying to guide Harry into embracing the best of wizarding and muggle culture.

Since it's a time travel AU anyway. You could even make MS relevant and not outdated for the lulz.

******* That's certainly a plausible interpretation and would fit with canon.

I just thought a much more muggle savvy half blood Charity would make for a more interesting and capable mentor in this sort of AU. Also opens the door for some interesting adventures in the muggle world and potential for poltics. You could also make her a bit more jaded and burnt out given the severe restrictions she faced, and the shit she got as a half blood. I think her being a HB would give her more motivation to mentor Harry, and bit more of a connection. I also kind of like the idea that in this AU Charity went to university and has an advanced degree in something unusual. I admit the idea of Charity with a PhD in a STEM field trying to teach muggle studies amuses the hell out of me.

"One thing to steer clear of for me would be not to have Burbage argue for bringing in muggle weaponry, cannot stand fics that bring in guns/armies etc."

Fair enough. I've found a few that do it well, but most do not. The only one I've really liked is an X-men crossover that focused far more on mutant abilities than technology, and no armies or guns were involved. It was an interesting look at how mutants would fair in the Wizarding world, and having Jean Grey as a Muggle Studies professor was kinda cool.

**** I think the reason there is so much hate for Dumbledore because in story most of his decisions seem straight up incompetent or malicious as new concepts and inconsistencies are introduced.

For example a point people make is why wasn't the third corridor guarded with an age line. We know that it is because the concept of an age line did not exist in universe and was only added in GoF. But in story one cannot fathom a reason for it's lack other than incompetence or malicious intent.

Another example is the protections point. In OotP Dumbledore says that not even his most powerful protections could have kept Voldemort out if he returned. However in DH Voldemort is stopped by the protections put up by the Order around Tonks house. So they interpret this to mean that Dumbledore was either incompetent or malicious. A more reasonable explanation could be that Voldemort just didn't bother after he was once again unable to kill Harry due to the wand performance issues; given that they were breached later in the war by death eaters. JK Rowling's explanation for this does not help much either. According to her the death eaters were too afraid to break the law with the ministry still around and we all know how law abiding Voldemort was.

Hope this helps.

***** A lot of these points really just draw from plot holes and inconsistencies to hate a character, which personally I don't think is a very good reason. Rowling has never been good at keeping all the magical lore and trinkets straight, and you can see how her intentions and approach to writing the stories shifts over time. There are a lot of instances of Rowling justifying and reconciling previous plot points with new developments, like the Dursleys being Harry's best protection against the death eaters. The basic plot structure is completely servicable to Harry's journey and character arc, but isn't comprehensive or consistent enough to answer all of these questions. Harry Potter, at its core, is a story about a young boy who is rescued from his mundane and miserable suburban life and thrust into a fantastical magical world where he blossoms into a smart, brave, and special magical wizard with people who love and care about him. It's a concept ultimately written to appeal to children and young adults, with just enough charm and likable characters to also captivate adult readers as well. I don't think that dissecting the plot inconsistencies in that way and making them the focal point of a fanfiction in order to bash a character (whether it be Ron, Molly Weasley, or Dumbledore) creates interesting stories or developments. It's moreso the product of people who are too invested in the minutia of the Harry Potter universe, which imo is its weakest aspect. Obviously you guys and writers can write whatever you want and whatever appeals to you, but that's my personal perspective on why none of the character bashing fanfics interest me, and I think a lot of others feel the same way. Although I do now understand better why someone would hate Dumbledore.

Even if you chalk leaving him with the Dursleys as a poor judgement it pretty obvious he emotionally manipulated Harry throughout. He recognized Harry's goodness and loyalty and exploited it for all it was worth. He more or less admitted as much in the books.

That's why the only part of the series that really, truly bothered me was the epilogue. While I don't think Canon Harry would hate Dumbledore or even Snape, there should be conflicted feelings there...naming his kid after them was silly to me and missed the point of everything that came before.

People are angry and call for reparations and real change louder and louder. They want the death eaters and those supporting them to pay. Take away all the old money of those families and their political influence, they want to shut down Slytherin for good, after all that toxic ideology was nurtured and kept alive for far too long in that house.

But those developments are like a confirmation to all those bigot ideas held for so long. See those mudbloods and blood traitors try to steal what is ours, they try to destroy our traditions.

And once again the magical world is that the brink of civil war and Harry is tired of it and brought up on the idea of personal responsibility. That individual behavior and actions are needed not a system change or something like this. So he tries to unit people again with a little show of naming his own son after both a Gryffindor and Slytherin headmaster.

Dumbledore is not omniscient. He had no idea when Voldemort would come back. He could've came back literally a week after he killed the Potters for all Dumbledore knew.

From Dumbledore himself, Order of the Phoenix, page 835:

#+begin_quote
  “My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive. You were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized. Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters --- and many of them are almost as terrible as he --- were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead."

  "Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. *I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so*, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you."

  *“I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power."*
#+end_quote

So from Dumbledore's perspective, Voldemort could come back at any time. And his goal was to keep Harry alive. This decision was likely reinforced when the Longbottoms were tortured into insanity less than a week after the Potters were killed.

#+begin_quote
  and given that Grimmauld Place was apparently secure enough to house both Harry and the Order in,
#+end_quote

It housed them for less than two years, and that was with Sirius and other Order members (Dumbledore included) also guarding it. The same could not have been done with Harry then.

Dumbledore would need to trust someone if he wanted to place the Fidelius over Harry, and who did he have to trust? If James's best friend turned out to be a Death Eater, who was he to trust? McGonagall was too busy. He was too busy. Hagrid is a stupid choice. Remus is a stupid choice. /Who/, then?

This is ridiculous. Dumbledore risked the lives of others to keep Harry happy. Harry never once thought his life was worthless, and Dumbledore never once did anything to imply he himself thought Harry's life was worthless.

I do have a problem with the claim that Harry should have never go to the Dursleys. I don't think it is fair to assume that he should have known that Harry would be abused there. That is not normal behavior. Most people would never abuse a child like that. Normal people if confronted with the orphaned child of their estranged siblings would take said child in and love them. The Dursleys showed a very abnormal behavior towards Harry.

Voldemort had been vanquished hours before, but his supporters --- and many of them are almost as terrible as he --- were still at large, angry, desperate, and violent. And I had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead."

  "Did I believe that Voldemort was gone forever? No. I knew not whether it would be ten, twenty, or fifty years before he returned, but I was sure he would do so, and I was sure too, knowing him as I have done, that he would not rest until he killed you."

Not really. The situation was far more nuanced than that.

There's also the fact that the protection clearly worked. Nobody was able to get to Harry for 16 years. Death Eaters clearly tried. /And/ everybody else trusted Dumbledore.

So we're left with either two conclusions:

1. Dumbledore was being truthful.

2. Literally every single person who trusted Dumbledore is a complete, utter, wholly delusional moron for never figuring out these things that you have. This includes Hermione. In DH, she is an adult in a time where Dumbledore's character is being questioned. Despite this, she remains more loyal than even Harry.

You can go with the second if you'd like, but I'm going with the first. I'm not really a fan of the "Everybody is stupid" approach to canon. We can agree to disagree. I don't think I'm changing the mind of someone who thinks Dumbledore is the epitome of evil, though.

********** I guess that's what's great about the HP lore... the fact that so many things are left for interpretation so the community is still going strong 13 years after the last book. JKR had her reasons for creating the story that she did and of course after years of re-reading it you can find lots of plotholes. But on the other hand, now you can write a whole fic around what it entails to become a secret keeper and why would Dumbledore have avoided it in the first place.

******* Ah I suppose you could see it that way. I always had a lot of suspension of disbelief when reading the books and sympathy for all the characters so I never hated on a character except the ones Rowling intended. I will say however, even in the context of the story Dumbledore is enacting the plan that has the only chance of possibly defeating wizard Hitler by preparing a kid for the struggles he must experience.

From a story construction standpoint, Dumbledore is the driving force behind Harry's heroes journey. He orchestrates his call to action, his struggles, and teaches him the life lessons he needs to learn to overcome the evil. Not to mention that putting kids through trials and tribulations to kill the bad guy is a pretty common trope in fantasy.

**** It's not completely unreasonable. I, myself, almost went down this route before remembering about Burbage. She's not exactly the most memorable part of Deathly Hallows. The ambiguity is there, we don't see Snape interacting with the muggle studies professor enough to even hint at being friends. Lily being Severus's friend is an important and far more memorable part of the series. If you forgot the spinning part and then assume the woman is Lily Potter, it's not a completely unreasonable deduction to assume that some time travel/alternate universe/body swap type of thing happened. Granted, assuming that Snape is in Azkaban is a leap I can't find any justification behind.

********* Oh, sorry. I mixed up the snape scenes. I seem to recall him asking that at some other point, must have slipped my mind.

#+begin_quote
  Albus is saying please kill me to stop dracos soul being ripped in two. And he's like “what about my soul” indicating his soul is still intact.
#+end_quote

Because of my mistake, this is a valid point.

#+begin_quote
  As a death eater before he switched sides he was unimportant and he could've been tailing order members, drumming up support, brewing poisons, regular torture.
#+end_quote

I also seem to recall him being a member of the inner circle, but that may have come after gifting Voldemort the prophecy. He was part of it after the resurrection, so he must have become that at some point before that? Oh, and there was a lot of time between Voldemort discovering the prophecy and being killed, so he could've been made it then.

We have one clue, which is that he was staking out Hogsmeade, which is how he discovered the prophecy in the first place. So it may really be like that, that he was a minor spy. However, he also joined up and was onboard until Lily was threatened, and considering everything they did between Voldemort being dusted and him joining up, I find it unlikely that he didn't kill.

#+begin_quote
  Given what he said above it's unlikely he has murdered anyone.

Perhaps his soul fixed itself with time and regret?

In fact, Snape didn't even want to do it - he did it only because Dumbledore asked him to. Dumbledore's reason was that a)he was dying a painful death so he might as well make it into a plot to help get Snape in favour and b)he knew Draco was set up to fail, and that if he did allow himself to be killed, it would fuck him up for life, since he was only 16/17.
