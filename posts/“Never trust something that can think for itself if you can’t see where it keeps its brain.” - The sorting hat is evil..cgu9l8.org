****** Riddle knew almost nothing about his own parentage, but from what we do have, we can draw a fairly safe conclusion that he did not believe himself entirely Muggle-born, but likely believed he was a half-blood. I draw mainly from two pieces of evidence:

- Dumbledore recounted to Harry that Tom spent a substantial amount of time searching for some evidence of his father having attended Hogwarts. As we know, he failed, and when he did concluded correctly that it was his mother's side of the family from which he drew his talent.
- Tom's own words to Dumbledore during their conversation at the orphanage. In his own words: */"My mother can't have been magic or she wouldn't have died."/*

From this, I conclude that not only Tom believed himself to be a half-blood, but that he thought his father was a wizard and his mother was a Muggle. Therefore, as far as Tom himself knew he was likely a half-blood. The Hat would've known this.

******* How much research could he have done before getting to Hogwarts?

How much stock do you think the hat puts into the thoughts of a mentally unbalanced 11 year old? Tom thinks it, so the hat accepts it as truth? Nah.

/Pfft, this lil' shit is pretty desperate for the nonexistent proof that his blood isn't mud. Well, he'll learn the truth sooner or later. May as well be sooner.../ "SLYTHERIN!!!"

** My head cannon is that the sorting hat is the remains of Godric Gryffindor's horcrux. You think a medieval god-wizard warlord would have cared about muggles enough not to murder one for immortality?

He felt remorse eventually, which is why the hat remains intact, rather than being burned or stabbed with acid.

** Voldemort was done hunting ate that stupid sword that always disappeared as soon as it got the chance and wasn't in the hands of a worthy Gryffindor.

Even keeping the hand of one of those fool attached wasn't doing the trick.

So after a moment of quiet reflection, the answer came to him. It was so obvious. Not only was it an artifact of Gryffindor, but of Hogwarts itself. He would connect his very soul to the soul of Hogwarts and probably the most powerful artifact in all of Britain. Every wizard's and witches journey started with it. It shaped the destiny of so many young witches and wizards.

​

Yes the sorting hat was the ideal Horcrux for him.
