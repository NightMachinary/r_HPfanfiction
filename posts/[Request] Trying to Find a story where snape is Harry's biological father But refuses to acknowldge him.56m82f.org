Hey y'all

I'm looking for a story I read a couple of years ago. Premise was that Snape is Harry's biological father and everybody knows it. However, he refuses to acknowldge it and Harry gets bullied because of it.

Any suggestions as to what this story was would be appreciated! Thanks!


** Now that's just fucked up...first Severitus and then Harry doesn't even get acknowledged? Way to kick him while he's already paralyzed from the neck down.

** I think i started reading that...it was on AO3.

If I remember correctly Dumbledore had suppressed Snape's memory of what had happened between he and Lily and that block gives way because Snape was checking to see if Lockhart had ever used a memory charm on him.

Is that the one?

*** I believe you are referring to In Blood Only by EM Snape on ff.net

I'm pretty sure its not that one, but thanks!

*Edited: If that's not the one you are thinking of let, me know what is!

**** Nope you're correct. I only made it a chapter or two in before deciding it wasn't for me.

Good luck with your hunt.

  Against his better judgement Severus Snape let a part of himself be used in a spell six years earlier. Now the consequences of his actions cannot be avoided any longer and Snape finds himself the father of a five year old boy-Harry Potter! Complete.

** Hmm...in *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11888152/1/Carry-That-Weight-A-Long-Time][Carry That Weight (A Long Time)]]*, Snape doesn't acknowledge Harry but I'm not sure the bullying is in there.

Also, there is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1807847/1/Prometheus-Bound][Prometheus Bound]]* where once people find out about H's paternity, he is shunned in Hogwarts. Harry has a lot of bad things happen to him in this story too.

*** Carry That Weight is a new story to me, I've never heard of it, so thats not it. But I am going to read it.

Prometheus Bound, now, there is a story I haven't thought about in ages. Still not the one I'm looking for (though I'm beginning to think I've dreamt it), but that ones needs a reread. I love angsty fanfiction.
