Slash, H/G, H/Hr aren't my cup of tea. So anything other than that is fine.

Preferably with a smarter, stronger Harry too. Waiting for suggestions :))


** Do you have examples? I'm not really sure what your definition of "realistic" is since it's a fantasy series.

*** I think the poster means less fairy tale elements, and more nitty gritty details. For example:

After capturing the Trio, the Death Eaters strip searched them, then hit them with a little Cruciatus before dosing them with Veritaserum. There would be no hiding Harry's identity, no calling Aberforth via the mirror, and no lucky escape. After verifying Harry's identity, Voldemort was called and he personally interrogated them via legilimency. Once Voldemort found out they were after his Horcruxes, he killed them on the spot. GAME OVER.

*** True. Realistic as in cause and effect. Harry actually training and not winning because of a fluke. Being a part of a war and not killing. Realistic as in not the whole heirs, harems and suddenly OP Harry.

***** Well...there are some I know. A cadmean victory, on the way to greatness. The old ,,a second chance to life" - which is epic. The house of Potter rebuilt, circular reasoning, the mind arts. The sum of their parts which I love, etc

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), would have been a good fit, but it's canon pairings. I'm impressed by its detailed military ops, political intrigues, and fight scenes. In the first half, while Hermione is busy killing rank and file Death Eaters, Harry is training for his final confrontation with Voldemort. No, canon Horcrux Hunt would have completely failed as this Voldemort had done something even more devious.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has a much more brutal war. People's homes getting blown up, the inhabitants kidnapped, dosed with veritaserum and killed. Voldemort using muggle children as disposable shields. Aurors getting called only to arrive at smoldering ruins full of dead bodies. Really dark curses. And homemade napalm.

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.
