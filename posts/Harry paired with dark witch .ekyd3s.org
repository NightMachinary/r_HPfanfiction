Hey guys, i like very much pairings like this.\\
Fics with Harry/FemTom Riddle, Harry/Bellatrix or even with Delphini, and so go on.\\
So send me the best fics where Harry is paired with a Dark Witch.\\
The fic has to be a little long so that i can distract myself for some time.\\
No FemHarry.\\
I don't like Dumbledore Bashing, so it would be better without it.\\
I would't like harem.\\
Im okay with everything else.

I know that the deffinition of dark witch is something very subjective so i will tell how i would like the fem character to be.\\
A witch that has a deep knowledge of the dark arts and use it to do bad things, most of the time for the sake of some objective.\\
I like female Riddle fics because i love how Riddle's personality and Harry's iteract with one other (With Riddle being the girl), so it would be great if the female has a personality simillar to Voldemort ya know: Arrogant, sense of superiority, cunning, ruthless.\\
Please do not send me fics with a psycho Hermione, i don't like the concept.\\
Can be OC, im okay with it.

Thanks! cy@!


** I would recommend linkffn(5353809) although this fic is unfortunately unfinished and it is unlikely to be ever completed.

There are some additional unreleased chapters, which show more of the relationship. Those can be found at DLP. The chapters were also uploaded at fanfiction.net by another uploader, just search for Stargate-Lover to find it.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** SeriousScribble's /Unatoned/ on ffnet has Harry paired with a super dark Daphne. It's a pretty good story if you're into noir or hardboiled fiction.
