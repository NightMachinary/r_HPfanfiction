If you want to know how a muggle-born, Mexican-American exchange student who was sorted into Slytherin navigates through a pretty chill year at Hogwarts (all things considered), then this is the fic for you!

Half-Blood Prince was always my favorite since the film came out on my birthday but at this point I have no idea what possessed me to create this “different angle” fic. (I first had the idea in 2016) I'm too deep in now to stop, so it looks like I'm committed at this point. 9 chapters done so far!

Also I'm very proud of my Cover that I photoshopped together on Microsoft PowerPoint. If you like the fic please leave a comment!! I absolutely love feedback.
