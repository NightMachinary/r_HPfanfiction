I can't figure out the order of his books, since I sorted it by published, it seems like the "oldest" instance is this:

*/Air Of Disharmony */

My OC Jimmy O'Bannon returns to Salem. Along with trying to convince Americans Voldemort is back, he also has two unwelcome exchange students to deal with. And why are his fellow students suddenly at each other's throats?

But I almost feel like *In The Grip of Darkness* might be first? But I just have no idea. Any help would be great!


** By publish date, The Puck Drops Here appears to be the oldest. Unless my sort function has a malfunction, anyway.
