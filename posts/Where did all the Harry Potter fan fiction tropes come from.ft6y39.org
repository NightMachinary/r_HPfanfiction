I always find Harry Potter fan fiction that has ideas that aren't in canon, but everyone uses. For instance, who came up with the idea that Susan Bones has a big bust? Who came up with the idea that Daphne Greengrass is an Ice Queen? Why do people think Snape is Draco's godfather? Why do people always bash the Weasleys, but never the Weasley twins? Why is Luna always portrayed as a Seer who can see every possible future? Sorry for all the questions, but I want to know where they came from. If I missed any popular fan fiction tropes, please remind me,


** u/Ash_Lestrange:
#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass is an Ice Queen
#+end_quote

Blank slate character who JKR said was a Slytherin, her sister married Draco, then put her name on the Sacred 28. A fill in for the blue-eyed, Slytherin Prince Draco Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  Why do people think Snape is Draco's godfather
#+end_quote

Because Snape was seemingly very close to the family and favored Draco above all else. It takes the favoritism to a familial level and could possibly have something to with Harry's godfather being Sirius.

#+begin_quote
  Why do people always bash the Weasleys, but never the Weasley twins?
#+end_quote

The only members of the family they liked in canon.

*** I think it's a bit simpler for Daphne - it's that she's the only one really positioned as the potential classic Slytherin love interest for Harry.

IE, there are 4 named Slytherin girls in his year. Pansy, who we see in the books and is obsessed with Draco/horrible, Millicent Bulstrode (who tends to be described as a female version of Crabbe/Goyle, so not all that attractive for a fanfic writer to pair up), Daphne and Tracey Davis. The latter two are blank slates - but Tracey is a half-blood, so she can't be the pureblooded, perfect/archetypical Slytherin.

That leaves just Daphne - and what you've said obviously fits in after that. But I think the process of elimination runs down to her pretty quickly - and after 1-2 fics get written and that interpretation of the blank slate pureblood Daphne gets widespread and in people's mind, it self-perpetuates.

** The source of the tropes is the same as the source of fanfiction in general

What If

Why

I Don't Like That

I Do Like That

Most tropes start out as one of the first three, but become tropes when other authors like them and incorporate them into their fics, which then enter fanon and you end up with people that think the tropes are canon.

Seer Luna usually comes from a point of "What If" Luna wasn't just weird and everything she said had meaning. "Why" does Luna insist that nargles steal her stuff when it's obviously bullies, maybe its because her fantastical creatures are deflections that hide real and possibly magical observations. "I Don't Like That" Luna is so weird, I want her to still be quirky, but not awkward, maybe I'll make her actually a seer.

** In my experience in fandom (20+ years), it's because a talented author wrote a well written story with an original idea that everyone loved and decided to include in their own story. Before you know it the idea's fanon and you can never get away from it.

** The Snape is Draco's godfather one is a bit different from the rest. It has some putative basis in fact since apparently it came from Tom Felton saying JKR told him so (on the set of GoF IIRC).

Figured I'd look for a good link to attach here, and along the way realized this claim isn't as legit as I thought it was. (Good, since that didn't make a ton of sense to me.) The closest thing to a real source I could find is this Quora post talking about it, where the top commenter spells out the grapevine: [[https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-either-in-the-books-or-statements-from-JKRs-that-Severus-Snape-was-Draco-Malfoys-Godfather]]

#+begin_quote
  Where did all the Harry Potter fan fiction tropes come from?
#+end_quote

Plotholes, inconsistencies, bad backstories, etc on JKRowling's end. And alternate interpretations.

​

#+begin_quote
  Why do people think Snape is Draco's godfather?
#+end_quote

Because Draco is so Gryffindor it makes your teeth hurt. Because he is everything Snape publicly accuses Harry of. Because he is annoying as hell. Because he is so un-slytherin it makes Salazar roll over in his grave. Him being Snape's godson is the only way for Snape not to want to snap his neck. Because he HAS to care for him.

​

#+begin_quote
  Why do people always bash the Weasleys, but never the Weasley twins?
#+end_quote

Probably because they never looked at Harry like he was the Boy-Who-Lived. Besides the initial reaction and some ribbing, they treated Harry like Harry.

​

#+begin_quote
  who came up with the idea that Susan Bones has a big bust?
#+end_quote

Does it matter? It's a novel. Set in a school. Full of teenagers. The one with the biggest knockers and biggest arse are ALWAYS talked about by hormonal teenaged boys. I think Susan got picked at random. She's practically a blank slate character.

​

#+begin_quote
  Why is Luna always portrayed as a Seer who can see every possible future
#+end_quote

Who else could be the seer? We've only ever seen one seer in canon. Luna acts oddly enough and sees all of these creatures and wants to look for things. For all we know, her inner-eye could let her see auras and whatnot.

*** I'm not looking for recommendations, but I honestly can't think of any story that singles out Susan Bones as having a big bust so that's a new one to me - usually I see her used as a way for Harry to get easier/better access to Amelia's legal expertise.

**** That particular trope is used mostly in fics where she is Harry's love interest (or in smut fics where she shows up). She is also almost always a redhead in fics where she's more than a background character.

** I think it all started it HP fanfic was starting. People used other people's ideas because they liked them so much. And it just became fanon. I also think imo that a lot of people just had similar thoughts regarding a tropes. Like it's not to far of a stretch of an idea for Severus to be Draco's godfather.

Also Weasley bashing except for the twins - I love AND hate it. They're likable but I've hardly read any twins bashing or just simply portraying them in any bad light.

Same with Luna being this perfect seer.

I would love for the twins to be bad guys, or just bullies. And show them in a bad light - they test their pranks on students without them knowing or their permission. They can be cruelly written just like all the other Weasley's.

And Luna could really just be a weirdo that other people avoid. She doesn't suddenly have to have the ability to see into the future or be Harry's personal seer. She can make people uncomfortable.

** I've never heard of the Susan one and find it odd that it's first on your list. Greengrass was most likely a pretty girl, and a slytherin, makes sense to develop overtime if people want recognized slytherin women but dont want Pansy. Snape and Lucius seemed to have a close relationship, honestly makes sense and what someone else said about it being the only reason Snape likes Draco is a great explanation. The twins never went after Harry for his fame and even made fun of it -- meanwhile Ron regularly abandoned harry, ginny was a starstruck child, percy has no personality, and we dont see charlie or bill much. Luna sees things people dont in canon, why should she be limited in fanfiction?

** Usually, there are one or two 'seminal' fanfics that are extremely well-received, and other authors piggyback off those ideas. Daphne, in my opinion, came about from a spate of "Slytherin!Harry" fics. Writers need a blank slate character that they can use, so any character we actually know anything about can't be used.

The Susan-with-big-knockers thing is not universal. There are several fics where she is portrayed as skinny/thin.

So.... I guess my answer is that someone had a unique and novel idea, and it fit the 'headcanon' of other fanfic writers.
