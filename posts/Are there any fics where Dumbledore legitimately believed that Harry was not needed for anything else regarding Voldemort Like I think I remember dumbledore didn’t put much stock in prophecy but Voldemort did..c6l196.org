So Harry is at the Dursley's to protect him from assasination from angry Voldemort supporters. Dumbledore believed that he could deal with Voldemort without Harry's help. I think I remember reading a fic where the mirror of erised could trap spirits for instance.


** I think canon Dumbledore was just pulling another lie out of his ass with that "I don't care about the prophecy - but Voldemort does!" crap. I mean shit, if he REALLY didn't believe Harry needed to be the one to kill him, or destroy the horcruxes, he never would have based /ALL OF HIS PLANS AROUND HIM./ He would have told him to sit back, live his life, have fun, and I'll take care of this myself kid. But he didn't. He obviously believed in the prophecy. Just like in sixth year when every time Harry came to him about suspicions on Draco, he kept lying to his face about "I take this school's safety seriously!" when he KNEW he was letting a murderer keep attending the school and making attempts on student's lives.

Basically Dumbledore says the fucking opposite of the truth.

*** The problem with Dumbledore is we're told about how good he is but we're shown how manipulative (and callous) he is. So we get the 'cult of personality' perspective as we can trace the decisions he made to how they served his goals.

*** But he couldn't take care of all of it himself. Harry is still a horcrux.

**** But didn't it get implied/stated dumbledore didn't know how Voldemort was alive until he saw the diary and began to suspect what it could be? If we take that as true and it's a Dumbledore that doesn't care about the prophecy or even that he didn't want to even try to teach Harry to beat Voldemort because he should have a childhood and because what are the chances that Harry could learn enough that he'd have a chance against Voldemort?

*** When he made that statement about the prophecy though didn't he say that he wanted Harry to have a normal childhood?

** RemindMe! 3 days

I like your fic idea, but will have to go through my favorite to see if I can find one. It seems like the setup for a flawed but good Dumbledore.
