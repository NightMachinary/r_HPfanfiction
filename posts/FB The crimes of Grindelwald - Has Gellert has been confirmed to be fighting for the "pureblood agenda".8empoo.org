I was browsing along checking on the progress of the movie, when I noticed the plot summaries of a few places matching:

Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  At the end of the first film, the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to *raise pure-blood wizards* up to rule over all non-magical beings.

Rotten Tomatoes is the same.

The Harry Potter wiki omits the pure-blood part.

Are those sites pulling the pure-blood part out of their asses? Cause it'll be a damn shame if we're set to see the same old rehashed conflict again. Not because I give any fucks about purebloods (I don't), it's just so fucking banal at this point, the fandom is sick of it. They could have literally used a million other things for G's motivations.

My spider-sense is telling me they're going to use it again in order to tie it to a modern-day racism narrative, and thus sell more tickets.

Thoughts?

*** I don't think I trust J.K to stay faithful to canon, to be honest. I believe she'll twist things to fit the narrative she wants to present.

In so many words, CTRL-C Voldemort, CTRL-V Grindelwald. Boring.

**** Wouldn't it be the other way around? Grindelwald came before Voldemort and was also mentioned in Philosopher's stone.

And you have to remember that the first half of the 20th century was a breeding ground for revolutions, so Grindelwald would have used different methods than Voldemort. A lot less sneaking around and a lot more "blast the door down and raise the Red Banner".

******* Can't speak for Mussolini, not studied him in nearly as much detail, but Hitler got his spot as Chancellor expressly because his party gave the non-socialist-aligned coalition a majority in the Reichstag. It was a genuine fear in Germany at the time - soothed somewhat by Stalin's policy of not helping reds in other countries than Russia - and the NSDAP played on it heavily.

It was very much a live issue in Germany at the time - again, don't know about Italy - because their revolution of 1918-19 included a lot of reds who'd tried very hard to make it properly socialist instead of the basic social-democratic regime change it turned out as. The spartacist uprising had had to be put down by armed force.

******** In 1930-33, the KPD (communist party) was very far from reaching a majority in the Reichstag. While street fighting with right wing groups and the police, but they were still far from power. And Hitler became Chancellor after Hindenburg spent a couple years giving everyone else the job. He was certainly opposed to communism, but his main goals were restoring the old borders, revenge for Versailles and conquering new Lebensraum.

********* The KPD were never much of a force, no, not even a majority in the SPD-led socialist coalition let alone the Reichstag itself. Opposition to 'the reds' in Germany at the time wasn't just limited to opposition to the KPD, however. And it was blaming the Reichstag fire on the KPD that let Hitler exclude them from the vote on the enabling law; with just the SPD and their allied splinter parties in opposition, he had the supermajority he needed to make himself legal dictator.

I'm not sure this is true. In as much that "pure-blood" in canon is associated with political power (it mostly isn't), they tend to support the status quo. The Statute of Secrecy was a product of the wizarding political classes. That same political class is unlikely to support tearing it down.

It seems to me that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods are much more Grindelwald's natural supporters. Those with more contact with the Muggle world may have reasons for tearing down the Statute of Secrecy that pure-bloods lack. We even see it in this sub - people suggesting that wizards have a moral obligation to, say, cure cancer for Muggles. It's a short step from there to Grindelwald's philosophy of ruling Muggles for their own good.

**** We know Grindelwald is recruiting pure-bloods, as shown by Vinda Rosier. Bellatrix, Andromeda, and Narcissa's mother had the last name Rosier, so they are an old pure-blood family, and Evan Rosier was a Death Eater killed by Moody.

** I think a dark wizard who wasn't anti muggle born would be more interesting. Hell, a muggle born dark witch/wizard who genuinely believed that they would take over the world and then end world hunger, war, and diseases muggles have no cures for (maybe he/she had a parent die of cancer?) would be way interesting.

I don't think that's going to be Grindelwald's thing though.

** Grindelwald in the books wanted *all* of Wizarding kind to rule supreme over the muggles.

Some pure-bloods have the blood purity beliefs though, so they would probably join him (since muggles are dirtying the wizards with 'dirty' blood). But it wouldn't only be pure-bloods, no.

I would rather they didn't do blood purity again. But it is easy to follow the points from the HP-series and it makes money. So it probably will be.

** See, in my mind I always pictured Gellert as a gent who utilized and uplifted the muggleborns, because to muggleborns of the 1900s the magical world must have seemed highly advanced, and having a charismatic leader tell you something like "You are special. You can help make the world a better beautiful place where the muggles stop darkening our planet with smog and corruption. I can lead you to green pastures and clear skies, where our children can fly free." And it would be pretty compelling. If magical beings have all of these skills and work together, couldn't they make a brighter future? Sure, some people might rebel but there always is someone against change. It would be easy for a muggleborn from a working class family to want to fix things for the better and ask questions later. I like the idea of Grindelwald having a muggleborn militia, because he was for all magical beings as supreme, with himself as the head.

** As people have said before me, Book-Canon Grindelwald wanted all magical beings to rule over all non-magical beings.

From what I understand, your fear is that J.K. Rowling will ignore that anyway and change his ideals? It has a slight chance of being possible but I think its unlikely. From what we have seen, he hasn't shown any signs of any pureblood agenda.
