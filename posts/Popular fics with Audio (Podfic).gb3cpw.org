Could anyone please recommend me some podfics? I was particularly looking for popular fics within the fandom that have a Podfic version recorded. I used to read a lot of fic and I wanted to get back to it, but due to eye problems I can't read for too long. Any recommendation is welcome ðŸ˜Š


** If you get the Fanfiction.net app, then I believe every story has an audio feature. It's in a slow computerised voice but it's still better than nothing if you can't view a screen
