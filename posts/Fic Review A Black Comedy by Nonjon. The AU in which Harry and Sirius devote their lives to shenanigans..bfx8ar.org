Warning below for language and discussions of sexually explicit and unsavoury topics. The fic itself is not NC-17. Sex is talked about and referred to almost constantly, but there is almost nothing in the way of graphic depictions of sex scenes.

I'll note before diving in that this fic was written as Deathly Hallows was coming out and is not compliant with the last book.

Buckle in guys. This is a long one.

​

*The Premise*

The year is 2005. Harry and Sirius find themselves in an alternate universe in which they had died and Lily and James had lived. How do Harry and Sirius decide to spend their lives in this universe? By becoming master pranksters who rob Death Eaters of course. Voldemort is still up and about in this universe too but is less of a threat and more of an irritation. Harry shows no interest in defeating him this time around.

​

*The Writing and Plot*

Basic writing quality? Can't complain. Every fic which comes highly recommended here on Reddit has been well-edited for spelling and punctuation. But where most very good fanfictions are highly immersive and help you forget about the author at the other end, I kept finding myself being taken out of the story and observing something the author was revealing about themselves through the text, sometimes in some pretty bad ways. It's very likely that Nonjon is a straight, white, male US citizen over the age of 35. I wouldn't usually be comfortable making those kinds of assumptions about someone whose only reference point I have for them is their username and whatever they choose to put on their ff.net profile, but in this case I'll show examples for how he demonstrates all of the above throughout the rest of the review.

Very little effort is made in contextualising a British setting. A feeling of the all-American ‘cool guy' oozes out of Harry, with starkly different dialogue and attitudes to what we see in canon. It does not feel like the world of Harry Potter. The over 35 part I inferred from some dialogue where Harry's mirror image thrusts out his hips and says, “I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a big, bright, shining star.” This is a reference to Boogie Nights, a sexually explicit film about the 60's porn industry. It came out in the 1997, which places the author at at least 15 when it came out for it to have been a relevant pop culture reference. Since the line was uttered by a very well-endowed male porn star whilst the camera panned down to his money-maker, the implication is that Harry has a giant dick.

There is a decent plot surrounding Voldemort, but it plays second fiddle to the shenanigans of Sirius and Harry. Extensive detail goes into the planning and execution of their heists, and some of the best writing in the story details how wards work and how to bring them down. In fact, I give points for how integral magic is throughout the story. A lot of Harry Potter fics skim almost entirely over anything magical in their fics, and in my opinion that takes away from the setting and the atmosphere that drew so many into the Harry Potter universe to begin with. Nonjon not only includes a great deal of spell-casting, he also writes his own immersive laws and limitations of magic, which function quite naturally.

The plot does reach its own crux and conclusion, but I'd say that the real climax of the fic occurs around the halfway point, and the intended ‘crux' was rather anti-climactic, as the big bad was taken care of entirely off-screen. Also in this AU Diary!Tom Riddle is apparently quite a nice fellow after all and definitely not a psychopath. It boggles the mind a bit that the happy ending includes Harry supporting Riddle in becoming Minister for Magic.

On the weaker side, there are a number of what seem to be side plots which just sort of bloom into existence and go nowhere.

- Harry and Sirius make overtures about entering business with the Weasley twins, but this is never spoken of again.

- Harry and Sirius abduct Hermione to take her on an adventure to Africa. Once the side-venture is over, Hermione is never seen again.

- Ginny is a 16-year-old ghost from the original universe who is anchored to Harry. Despite Harry being repulsed by her she believes she is his soulmate. Apart from occasional quips and one instance of exposition, there doesn't appear to be any reason for her existence in this fanfic, beyond perhaps establishing the author's distaste for the Hinny pairing.

*Characterisation*

Canon Harry Potter is nowhere to be found in this story. I'll stop short of calling him a Gary Stu, but he's very OP, overly rational, strategic, a forward planner, materialistic and power hungry, without a hint of the morality that canon Harry was so defined by. He calls Dumbledore ‘Albus', shows no one any kind of respect and faces no consequences for it. He's going to march right into the Ministry and tell all those stuffy old wizards exactly how they're going to run their government from now on, and everyone will fall into line because no one else is as smart and amazing as Harry is. The author's hubris comes through in Harry's outright dismissal of wizarding politics. Harry also has invisible ‘magical arms' which he can use for extra physical or magical functions, is an expert at dismantling wards, duelling, and did I mention that his Animagus form is a ghost? And that's without going into what a catch he is.

​

*The Humour, AKA ‘ism's and phobias*

Here's the meat of it. The fic is brimful of awful jokes. We have garden variety sexism, we have insidious racism, we have homophobia, transphobia ....you get the idea. The whole thing has a distinctly Adam Sandler flavour to it, only if Adam Sandler were James Bond in his own movies instead of being a goofy character with a growth arc. If you're a fan of Adam Sandler movies, this fic may work for you. There are some genuinely funny moments throughout, but if you're not into dick jokes and punch-down humour (*spoiler*, I'm not) then this is an extremely cringey ride. I don't begrudge anybody the dick jokes mind you. Each to their own on that one. But the thing is -- the punch-down humour doesn't age well. In fact, it ages with all the grace of chicken -- toxic to such an icky extent that you just know that no one should be touching it anymore.

​

*Sexism*

Harry and Sirius' attitude to women is extremely 90s: Emotions are for girls; sex is for boys. Boys make sure they run screaming from any kind of connection with a woman that doesn't start and finish with the pointy end. Luckily Harry and Sirius are mysteriously both sex gods - they can't turn left without some pretty young thing throwing herself at one of them, despite Sirius' advances resembling nothing so much as the creepy uncle you avoid at Christmas parties. Check out this line Sirius says to a handywoman who comes to connect their floo: /"When you finish up with that fireplace, I'll show you mine. Common courtesy would be for you to show me yours.”/ This is about the extent of female involvement in the plot, with the exception of Lily.

There is a running joke of absurdity in the sex, but that's more to do with the mysterious way all the women they sleep with turn out to be connected to each other in some way, and not because Harry and Sirius are drowning in panties. Sirius sleeps with Amelia Bones the same night Harry sleeps with Susan. Sirius sleeps with this universe's Ginny Weasley (now Gin), whilst Harry sleeps with Luna. Probably the most eye-roll worthy example -- my eyes were in serious danger of leaving my skull -- was when Sirius picked up a pair of twins (because siblings /love/ sharing their sex lives), and in the morning it turns out Harry slept with their triplet. The cringe increases when the twins exclaim in surprise that they thought the third girl was gay, and she shyly says “Not anymore.” Yup, you heard it folks. Harry's magical penis will change your sexuality - he's just THAT good. And sure, I get it, it's a power fantasy. Doesn't mean it isn't cringe-worthy.

When Harry or Sirius experiences any kind of concern or anything bordering on genuine emotion, the other makes sure they know they're ‘being a woman'. One genuinely touching, affirming moment between these two in which they talk about how important the other is to them, Harry wraps up the conversation with, /“Now do us both a favour. Act like a fucking man, you little bitch.”/

Or in the final chapter, they're having a conversation in which Sirius is worried that Harry may not spend as much time on heists with him anymore. Literally that's the extent of the emotional investment in this conversation, but apparently that's still too many feelings.

/"I have a hypothetical question." Sirius was doing a poor job of concealing his concern. "How much justifiable jealousy is permitted before I turn into a woman?"/

/Harry arched an eyebrow at his godfather. "If you have to ask, you're a woman."/

When later in the conversation Harry notices Sirius still looks concerned he says, /"What's got sand in your vagina now?"/

I just love constant reminders of how the absolute worst thing is in this world you can be is feminine.

​

*Homophobia & Transphobia*

In true 90s fashion, being gay is gross, even though Harry & Sirius are obsessed with penises. Some examples:

- They briefly share a broom, and immediately have a gay panic moment about having to touch each other.

- Sirius puts the ‘evilness' of dark wizards down to ‘uncontrollable homosexual urges'.

- They insinuate through second hand stories that Draco and Snape are gay or trans and express disgust and a desire to throw up. If I were being very generous I would say that the disgust is only because Harry hates both of these characters and not because of the possibility of their being gay, but it's worth noting that Draco and Snape do not receive the benefit of their redemption scenes in DH because of the author writing pre-DH release, so it assumes they're both evil, thus throwing ‘gay' and ‘evil' in together as heavily connected if not synonymous.

​

*Male Rape*

Harry & Sirius decide that Lupin isn't getting enough sex, so they get him pass-out drunk and facilitate Bellatrix Lestrange having sex with him whilst he's asleep. To top it off, she's trying to get pregnant from the experience. And you know, the whole thing is just SO hilarious because male rape lol. Though at first horrified, Lupin eventually decides he likes it because hey, he's a man and it's sex, right?

​

*Ableism*

There is also a side scene in which Harry punishes Sirius, Kreacher and Remus by transfiguring them into people with dwarfism and forcing them to interact with children in a public park. Harry calls it “Midget detention”, and it's very much a throwback to the use of people with dwarfism being used as circus side shows or for general slapstick humor.

​

*Racism and House Elves*

One of the worst moments of the fic is the second heist, in which Harry and Sirius stun a house elf upon entering the manor (fair enough, you don't need the elf implicated or raising the alarms), but then Sirius decides to go further with it. He takes everything from the master's bathroom except for the toothbrush. He then sodomises the unconscious elf with the toothbrush, takes a photo, then leaves it for the unwitting master to brush his teeth with later. This is apparently fine and hilarious. Had Sirius done this exact same thing to the death eater master of the house I might have found it funny, but the fact that it's done to a slave of the household felt underhanded and gross.

This author seems to have a very problematic view of slavery. And by that I mean he seems to be totally fine with it. Harry winces when Sirius tells him what he's done to the elf but says nothing. Whilst house elf magic plays something of a role in the story and the mechanics of the magic are interesting, no one in this universe has any problem with house elves being slaves, including Harry.

Even James and Lily have a house elf named Nappy, and she is one of the most problematic elements of the fic. There's no getting around it - Nappy is written as a Black American slave. This insidious, perhaps even unconscious association that slaves = black people is the reason why I'm pretty certain the author is white. Not all the house elves speak like Nappy does -- Kreacher and Dobby retain their canon voices -- but at least one other OC elf in the fic does speak like Nappy, so this is a pattern, not a coincidence. Check out this little gem:

/"Yes'm, Massa," Nappy replied as she appeared. "I din't mean fo' choo t'hear dat. Iza sorry, Massa."/

/"Are you okay?"/

/Nappy nodded her head./

/"But you screamed."/

/"Yes'm, Massa. Iza sorry fo' dat."/

/Lily tried to sound gentle. "Why did you scream?"/

/Nappy looked embarrassed. "Choo know Iza like pickin' cotton."/

​

Are you cringing yet?

​

*Final Thoughts*

I wondered a number of times when I was reading this story if I was just being too sensitive. Is it up to me to call comedy better or worse according to whether or not it offends me? Does humor have a responsibility to punch up? The short answer is probably not. It isn't up to the author to please me. He has a right to write whatever he likes. There are obviously loads of people who find A Black Comedy hilarious, so I can't be a gatekeeper about what is funny and what isn't.

I will say that the comedy here is written for and by straight white men, and that's almost certainly the only audience who will think this fic is amazing, since it inherently if not explicitly exalts this group at the expense of everyone else. Personally I haven't found that kind of comedy funny for a long time. The fic certainly had some strong points to it, but they were kind of drowned out by the vicarious power trip. I really struggled to bring myself to the end, and honestly would not recommend it to anyone.

​

Please let me know your own thoughts on this fic below, or if there's another fic you'd like to see reviewed.


** I will say that, despite explicitly being a comedy in its name and being a hell of a power trip wank fic, the development of an actual mystery plot (namely who is "that fucker" and what are his goals) and subsequent reveal of the answers to said plot were rather well set up IMO.

It also scratches that itch I sometimes have for a fic starring a Harry (and co. where applicable, Sirius in this case) that has seen enough shit that nothing really fazes him anymore. Although I'm still waiting for the buddy +cop+ auror fic co-starring Ron where they find themselves physically incapable of taking petty criminals seriously after surviving Voldemort.

My impression is that the joke wasn't "House Elves = slaves" but rather, "Wizards = slave apologists"

The explicit depiction of Nappy as a 'happy' Black slave (a la the absurd claims of George Fitzhugh and his pre-Civil War contemporaries) is designed to make the readers uncomfortable, so they might reconsider the way 'good' Wizards in the books ignored the issue and the way Hermione's obsession with SPHEW was played for laughs in canon.

Thus the joke isn't "haha slavery" but rather "haha, on second thought canon/fanon was seriously F'ed up."

#+end_quote

A very common trend in fanfiction and in YA literature is to have the main character of the story enact some kind of self-insert or wish fulfillment of the author. There are a number of indicators which point towards Harry in A Black Comedy being one of these examples.

Ginny being a ghost anchored to Harry just so that Harry can repeatedly express his distaste of her is one indicator. There is no real reason to have her in the story aside from showing a shipping preference. Another is Harry's particular criticisms of the way parliament is run, since these scenes only seem to exist in order to show "Harry's" opinions on the ministry and the Wizengamot, and don't have any bearing on the plot or the heists either. Parodies are after all often designed to point out things the author thought was silly about the original.

The fact that Harry is very over-powered compared to the other characters is almost a universal indicator of wish-fulfillment.

When we take this into account, it's not unreasonable to assume that what Harry and/or the narrative excuses, the author is excusing as well. Harry objects to the things he finds morally reprehensible (which admittedly is not a great deal in this story, but it does occur). However he never shows any distaste at all for owning house elves himself or for others owning them.

The accepted attitude towards owning house elves just seems to be "treat them kindly", not "don't enslave them".

If you try to equate house elves with black American slaves and don't say boo about slavery in the same story, then yes I see a problem with that. I don't know what the author's intent of the portrayal was, since there were no Author's Notes about the subject in the text. Nonjon may be more accessible to ask this kind of thing directly to than say, J.K Rowling, but the fact is that it's an author's responsibility to write a story which stands on its own and portrays what the author intended to portray.

*** I agree with you. I assumed the point of Nappy was to show that the elves are slaves; and are treated as such. The author probably only was exposed to examples of slavery that fit that bit. The stereotypical Hollywood black slave.

This piece goes down weird alleyways while rubbing its nose, but it's also not a spotlight into how white people are unconsciously feeling guilty of owning slaves in the past like the rest of the world.

A Black Comedy is the quintessential 'dudebro fic' and I think that was the whole point. Like the author pointed out, Harry/Sirius end up sleeping their way through Britain while also supporting a Tom Riddle horcrux that is only alive being it killed Neville Longbottom.

Come on. Why would people take this fic at all seriously? Everything about everything that happens in it is dialed up to 10.

**** Here's the thing. A Black Comedy is not absurdist humour. Seventh Horcrux is, but it's a very different kind of story. There are certainly absurdist elements to it, such as labeling the vigilante "That Fucker", the connections between the women Harry & Sirius sleep with, and probably the entire adventure in Africa, but Nonjon isn't writing a purely absurdist fic. He also goes to great lengths to rationalise how Harry and Sirius got into an alternate universe in the first place. He details immaculately how they're able to break into Death Eater mansions, and how Harry's "magical arms" work. He writes the characters of James, Lily and Dumbledore quite realistically. None of that is absurdist.

House elves are extremely well-known to be slaves. You don't need to put a black slave's voice onto one to establish their position in the world. And the author's reference points for slavery in the media could not be limited to black slavery, since they have also read books 1-6, which detail their accents, limitations and other characteristics pretty clearly.

I think this is the crucial part about good crack. You take bad things and make it so ridiculous that it stops being sad.

Apart from occasional quips and one instance of exposition, there doesn't appear to be any reason for her existence in this fanfic, beyond perhaps establishing the author's distaste for the Hinny pairing.

It's funny. Nonjon is/was a DLP author, and back when this story was written, they were vehemently anti-Ginny, Nonjon included. So it's always amused me that this is really the one part that is my least favorite part of the entire fic. There really is no point to it.

I will say that the whole "aging well" argument is kinda overdone. I first read the story 10+ years ago, and I've read it this year, and my enjoyment of it is pretty much the same. It was absurd back then, and it still is now. All the things I dislike about it, I still dislike. And all the things I like, I still like. Though obviously the humor gets less effecting the amount of times you've been exposed to it, but that's to be expected.

*** I always assumed that ghost-Ginny was less about panning the Hinny pairing and more about making fun of the soul bond trope which is so common in romance fics in this fandom. After all, alternate universe Ginny gets plenty of moments to shine, so ghost-Ginny's place in the story can't be explained by the author just having a hate-on for the character.

It only took me a few chapters to realize that I absolutely could not stand either the humour or the main characters.

A lot of times the humour was punching down, and I don't care much so long as It's funny.

At the same time, though, I don't think this review was a condemnation of the people who enjoy the fic, nor even necessarily a condemnation of the author (though, mentioning his assumed age, race and gender to make a point was certainly toeing the line).

The fic gets recommended a /lot/, even by myself at one point, and no one ever mentions the negative aspects which are /readily/ apparent. Sure, some people say they dislike it because of its low-brow humor, but this is the first review I've ever seen which brings to light its blatant homophobia, transphobia and ableism (I've never voiced it, but that scene where Harry turns people into midgets as a punishment really made me uncomfortable).

Perhaps you like the fic; But notice that your comment is stating that you shouldn't take it too seriously, not that OP's review is /wrong/. On some level, I think you must agree - or at least you notice and can't argue the points which were well made.

*** Engaging more seriously with the topic of the review, I think there are three main conceptual problems at play in the OP. Those conceptual problems will not be unfamiliar to most internet users, as they are propagated by certain online communities as well as finding a home within US university campuses.

The three problems are:

*1. Bad epistemology*

This is the belief that the content of what a statement says should be judged based on the identity of the speaker rather than on the objective merits of that content. This is philosophically unjustifiable. It is most obviously intellectually bankrupt with respect to truth propositions ("X is Y"), but it has equally little rational grounding in value propositions ("X" should be "Y"). Both truth and values must be justified rationally; any other basis for deciding these things is by definition irrational.

*2. -Isms disguised as anti-isms.*

The distinction between punching up and punching down has two problems: one rational, and one moral.

On the rational front, being able to punch up and down of course requires a hierarchy of who can say what to whom. Not only does this fall foul of the first problem (bad epistemology), it has an additional intellectual hurdle to cross, which is that the hierarchy is made up of /categories/ of people ranked by "privilege". So, for example, black people can make jokes about white people, but not vice versa.

The intellectual problem with this is that it ascribes characteristics to individuals on the basis of membership of a group, but those characteristics may in fact be entirely false. As an extreme example to show the problem, take Beyonce's daughter. She's black and a girl - two groups we are to understand fall somewhere lower down on the hierarchy, so that their members have the right to "punch up" against, say, white men, who cannot "punch down". But the proposition that Beyonce's daughter is unprivileged compared to some working class male in Alabama is laughable. She's one of the most privileged individuals in the history of the human race.

Ultimately, membership of a group can at best provide a generalisation to which there are many exceptions. The only rational basis to treat individuals is on the basis of that individual's actual characteristics and situation, not by assuming that because they are a member of X group, they must be Y.

By now the moral problem with this "philosophy" should also be obvious. To generate the hierarchy, you are categorising people by group characteristics like race, gender, etc. and creating rules based on those characteristics about what things people can and can't say to each other (in the sense of being able to speak with legitimacy, not in the sense of being able to speak at all, which I don't think anyone has suggested... yet). You are literally creating a racist, sexist order in pursuit of the elimination of racism and sexism.

The typical response to this criticism is "but our racism is /justified!/". So racists have always said.

*3. Misunderstanding the nature of humour.*

A joke is not reality.

Firstly, humour has nothing to do with truth. When a comedian tells a funny anecdote, do you think it actually happened? Of course not. At the very least it has been distorted and exaggerated, but most likely it's completely fabricated. We all engage in the game of pretending it's true, comedian and audience together, because it's funnier if it has the veneer of authenticity.

Secondly, humour has nothing to do with values. Do these people think those who make holocaust jokes think the holocaust was okay? Of course not. Telling a joke does not mean you endorse any particular view. Professionally offended people consistently fail to understand the difference between a joke and reality.

--------------

Now, this doesn't mean a person has to enjoy Black Comedy. Personally I think it's just too crackish. But to say there is some kind of moral problem with the fic (or any form of humour) has poor intellectual foundations.

The House-Elf speaking in a stereotypical "black" manner was actually one of the few decent jokes in the fic. It's not funny because "haha black people speak funny". If you thought that was the joke, you missed it. Rather, this scene is a comment on the HP fanfiction meta: namely, the widespread way in which certain people talk about House-Elf slavery as if it has no factual or moral distinguishing features from real life historical slavery of humans. By giving the House Elf an exaggerated voice associated with a stereotype of black America, nonjon is poking fun at those people by making their linking of the two explicit.

I do not know the personal details on Nonjon, and I have said as much. I have judged his fanfiction as it stands upon having opened and read it without any previous context about who Nonjon is. I have not judged his content by his identity, rather I have inferred information about his identity through his content. The things I have inferred about him could be incorrect, I acknowledge that, but regardless I would stand by the comments I have made about his content. If Nonjon is a woman, that would not make (her) comments about women in the fic not sexist.

​

*2. -Isms disguised as anti-isms.*

I have to say I'm impressed at your lengthy justification to essentially call me a racist for pointing out racist writing. That's some turnaround.

#+begin_quote
  To generate the hierarchy, you are categorising people by group characteristics like race, gender, etc. and creating rules based on those characteristics about what things people can and can't say to each other
#+end_quote

For one thing, whilst it's flattering that you think I can generate the hierarchies you described, what's considered racist and sexist has long since existed outside of my humble opinion, and has much more to do with historical and demonstrable oppression between different groups. I'm not going to spend the entirety of this reply explaining what those are, since you don't have to take my word for it in any case and I'm fairly certain you don't exist in such a vacuum that you are unaware that they exist either.

Your example about Beyonce's daughter is also misleading - you're wholesale wiping away the validity of group oppression by pointing to individuals who either represent exceptions or have succeeded in spite of oppression. I could just as easily invalidate the struggles of the working class man by pointing to the ones who made it rich. I don't, because the existence of exceptions does not disprove rules in a social context.

Whilst it's true that Beyonce's daughter's wealth sets her privilege above that of the working class white man, her skin colour does not. If you were to make a joke at the expense of Beyonce's daughter based on her skin colour, or for example if you were to talk to her in the accent Nappy uses in this fic, absolutely that would still be punch-down humour. If you were to make a joke at her expense because of her wealth and publicity, that would be punching up. Context matters.

If you argue that there is a moral problem in ascribing characteristics to a group and creating rules about those characteristics, then there is a moral problem in the way Nonjon creates humour, since he does the same thing; creating rules about what men (etc) are required to do or say in order to be men.

I /do/ believe that an individual's characteristics should speak for them. The issue with oppression and hierarchies is that they remove or reduce a person's ability to be seen as the individual they are, which is why calling out racism or sexism is not a method of 'boxing' the people affected by the joke so much as it is calling out the person using a joke to 'box' them. You are being intellectually dishonest by claiming that I am the one creating the hierarchies and oppression by pointing them out.

#+end_quote

Are you serious? Humour has /loads/ to do with the truth. Do you think satires like Who Is America have nothing to do with reality? Or that the way Blazing Saddles subverted racism in the 70s had nothing to do with values? Do you think that the things that make you laugh exist in a vacuum of all the things you've experienced in your life? Are you likely to laugh at a particular soccer club's in-joke if you're not part of the club? Of course not. The jokes have to be relatable on some level or else they aren't funny.

A comedian's anecdote isn't supposed to be a literal surface truth, or 100% true, but they are telling something which is at least related to a truth we understand. Sometimes comedians are pointing out uncomfortable or shocking truths with their anecdotes. Sometimes they're making a point about society through sarcasm and irony. Sometimes a parody will illustrate the ridiculousness of something we've taken too seriously. Whilst not required on all counts, comedy's greatest benefit is in how is holds up a mirror to our lives, and that cannot be divorced from reality. There are certainly exceptions in terms of relatability being the punchline, but A Black Comedy doesn't fall under one of those categories.

When I combine this point with your final follow up about how you interpreted Nappy's racial identity, you run into a conundrum. Is Nappy a subversive fanon meta inclusion designed to make us rethink our dissociated attitude towards house elves? Or does humour have absolutely nothing to do with truth or values?

***** *1. Bad Epistemology*

In your review you mention the author's identity several times, even if only to speculate about it, so clearly you do consider it relevant in some way.

The way in which you consider the author's identity to be relevant is actually somewhat obvious: you cannot know if a person is punching up or down unless you know the author's identity.

*2. Isms*

Yes, I am wholesale wiping away the "validity of group oppression". A group is nothing more than a collection of individuals, and treating them as a group is nothing more than a generalisation.

Treating individuals as a group rather than as individuals is only done for pragmatic reasons e.g. when you have insufficient resources to treat each individual on their own merits. So for example, in affirmative action, treating any black applicant to a university as underprivileged is done because the university does not have the resources to investigate every individual's actual circumstances to determine whether they are in fact privileged or not.

But those pragmatic reasons do not mean that you have gained some kind of truth by treating individuals as a group. By moving from an individual-level analysis to a group-level analysis, you have lost information, not gained it.

If individual X shares a superficial characteristic with a group of oppressed individuals, but individual X is in fact not oppressed, then the group-level analysis is simply incorrect. That is the danger of generalisations.

A person either enjoys a privileged position in society or they don't. Whether a person is oppressed or not is a matter of fact.

They can't have their cake and eat it too. If a working class person becomes a billionaire, they can't turn around and act as if they are a member of an oppressed class. Beyonce's daughter doesn't get to look down from her ivory tower and declare that the colour of her skin makes her the member of an oppressed class.

The members of an oppressed class are only those individuals who are in fact oppressed.

As for the stuff about rewriting the meaning of racism to be based on historical power structures rather than being any position which ascribes characteristics to individuals on the basis of race - this is well-covered ground. Suffice it to say that it is simply the latest example of racism, this time dressed in the clothes of opposing racism.

To be clear, the point here is not a semantic one. There are meaningful ways in which one can speak about historical power structures and the classes of oppressed individuals within those power structures. There are meaningful ways in which one can speak about how those power structures are causally linked to today's inequalities.

The problem with redefining "racism" to be linked to historical power structures is that it results in ambiguities. When you have one word for two different things, you can create the impression that those different things are in fact the same. It would be simpler if two different words were used: say, "skin colourism" to describe treating individuals on the basis of their skin colour, and "historical victimism" to describe treating individuals on the basis of their membership of a historically oppressed class.

The problem is that when historical victimism leads to a person advocating a skin colourist approach to societal interactions, that skin colourism is disguised behind the fact that they've used the word "racism" to describe the position they oppose. And, of course, the same for sexism etc.

*3. Humour*

You've missed my point somewhat, here. My point is not that that comedians cannot refer to facts in their content. My point is that the truth is not really relevant to whether it is comedic or not.

A comedian who stands around declaring truths isn't really a comedian. The comedian's talent is /cleverness/. They have to describe the truth in a way that is novel and appeals in some way to the audience's sense of humour, whatever that may be. Crucially, the audience doesn't have to agree with the comedian, because what they are appreciating is the comedian's cleverness, not his ability to state true facts.

Even where the comedy is based around, say, stating shocking truths, the comedian's job is not to reveal truths that were previously unknown. They use known truths as the raw materials to show off their cleverness. Anyone can state a shocking truth. Only certain people have the ability to deliver that statement in a way that makes people laugh. And here's the funny thing: an individual without that talent could repeat the comedian's joke word for word and no one would laugh. Comedy is all about the delivery.

Probably my favourite comedian in the world is Bill Burr, whose views I mostly disagree with. If he was running for political office I would vote against him. But I appreciate his comedy because it's funny, even if I disagree with the content of 50% of what he says.

His views as stated in his comedy, at least. Because for all I know, he's just playing a character and in his private life he's the complete opposite. There are plenty of comedians who do that, after all. Because their actual identity doesn't matter to their comedy. What matters is the joke.

So, to take the house elf joke as an example, to appreciate the joke, you don't have to hold the view that house elf slavery is justifiable or that it isn't justifiable. The "truth" of the matter is irrelevant to the joke. All you need to get the joke is knowledge of the references implicitly made by it. When you come away from the joke, you are not supposed to be thinking "that's true!", you're meant to be thinking "that's funny!".

****** *1. Bad Epistemology*

My opinion differs from yours here in that yes I do believe that the person speaking can have relevance to what is being said. However, when you're talking about humour done in an anonymous space, it must stand on its own as you've said, since no one can know for sure who the author is. With nuance, punching down can be relative, but not in this context.

The content of the fic punches down at homosexuals and trans people for example, but not straight or cisgendered people. I assume that the author is likely to be straight and cisgendered because a person of that description is much more likely to punch down at homosexuals and trans people than someone belonging to either of those groups. I make assumptions about who the author is by the groups they punch down at and who they omit, but regardless of the identity of the author, the humour still punches down.

#+end_quote

Being absolutist is just as limiting for gaining information as being too generalist is. You lose information if you reject any kind of group participation in favour of only examining people on an individual basis. Information on society doesn't function on a person by person basis. Firstly that isn't pragmatic as you've said, but it also prevents us from seeing the forest for the trees. Taking a census for example loses all meaning if any kind of group assumption is invalid. We may as well do away with the whole field of statistics, since the hardline thinking you're going on says that if there's even one exception to a trend then the rest of the data is invalid.

​

#+begin_quote
  The problem with redefining "racism" to be linked to historical power structures is that it results in ambiguities.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure if you're accusing me of redefining racism to suit my purposes or if you're expressing that the definition has been changed, but the Oxford dictionary defines it as this:

#+begin_quote
  "Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."
#+end_quote

Ideas of superiority or inferiority almost invariably lead to race-based victimisation. The two are intrinsically linked, so it's not disingenuous to assert that racism implies oppression. The only instance I can think of where you could separate the two and call it "skin-colourism" might be the way certain Albino African kids get hunted down for body parts based on a superstition that those body parts are magical, but that situation is much more the exception than the rule.

How can you claim that there are meaningful ways of discussing the links between inequality and power structures if you also dismiss the idea of inequality in a group context?

​

*3. Humour*

Sure, truth is not a requisite for comedy, and comedians are not always going to be making comedy about their values or truths. I think your appreciation for comedians based on their execution rather than their content is valid, but I don't think that renders their content immune to criticism.

What is the aim of their jokes? Obviously to make people laugh, but what are they laughing at? For you, the way Nappy was written was a deliberately subversive joke aimed at fanfiction writers who don't make a clear connection between house elves and real world slavery.

But in order to know if that was the intent behind the joke you would have to be aware of the author's opinions about those fanfiction writers, since the author doesn't allude to that connection in any clear way, nor does he leave any disclaimers about it in the author's notes. If you believe that the author and authorial intent is irrelevant and content must be judged on its own merits, then a reading of Nappy as a racist stereotype is much more valid than a reading which requires information most readers will not have in order to verify.

As should be clear from the comment chain, whether the work is in fact morally objectionable is precisely the matter in dispute (and indeed whether /any/ humour can be morally objectionable).

Just because one person says something is morally objectionable, it doesn't make it so. Moral arguments must be justified like any other.

Your position (which I have assumed to be a form of trolling given the low effort nature of your posts) is patently circular. Comments like "Why don't you dislike this racist work?", "Why don't you dislike this morally objectionable work?" presuppose that the work is racist/morally objectionable.

If I am still mischaracterising you, then let me ask a simple yes or no question. Can a person reasonably dislike something if they find it personally offensive? Given your initial post in this thread, in which you immediately started attacking the epistemological foundations of the OP's opinions, I would guess your answer would be no. If I'm mistaken and the answer is yes, I don't see why you'd be so personally offended by someone stating their opinion.

I don't understand what your last paragraph has to do with my position, which you have either misunderstood or are mischaracterising. Regardless, you have accused me of arguing in bad faith, so I'm afraid there's nothing more to be gained from having this conversation.

Pretty much sums it up. If you're a fan of 80s/90s frathouse comedies or find the current climate of political correctness too sensitive, you will likely enjoy the fic, because it's engaging if you don't get distracted by the implicit views of the story. Otherwise you may find it too offensive to hold your interest.

I will say though, as a straight white male, I didn't realize how many objectionable things there were in the fic until this post laid them all out. Probably says a lot about the implict biases I hold or at least how easy it is for me to ignore attitudes that don't directly affect me :(

I don't fit into two of those categories, but I consider /A Black Comedy/ one of my favorite fics.

Tastes in comedy vary.

I typically don't enjoy sexist/sexual humor (Jim Jefferies springs to mind as an example that's not to my taste), but this fic takes its jokes so far beyond the edge of absurdity that (to me) it seems to swing back around the other side into making fun of itself and the existence of sexist stereotypes in general.

I read it as a satyrical parody of some of the most common stereotypes in male escapist fiction (and fanfiction). This interpretation fit for me due to a lot of small moments in the fic that OP chose to ignore/gloss over. For example, I thought it was great that in the final chapter Harry and Sirius end up with realistic negative consequences for their careless promiscuity. It's like the author was building the reader's assumption of Sirius and Harry as sex gods (a la male fantasy), but all the ridiculous morning-after scenes were actually just wind up to drive home the parody.

I will say this for OP, their post is an extremely thorough and concise list of things that might offend people who have things that offend them.

***** I'll certainly grant a few things here. I did not provide anywhere near as much detail as I could have in this review, largely because I thought the word count was already too long, and it's true that I did not want to skim over the parts that I found problematic. I did want to write as well about some of the jokes that I did find funny, and that some of the jokes early on in the piece made me initially enjoy it more than Seventh Horcrux. I probably also could have discussed the plot in more depth, the ways in which the author limited Harry in order to not make him a Gary Stu, or the very genuine attempts to develop a meaningful relationship between Harry and Lily.

I guess it goes without saying that I didn't think it was a satire of sexist stereotypes. I think there were elements of that, but largely it was more of a wink and carry on with the fantasy sort of thing. I found Anchorman to be more in the spirit of satiring sexist stereotypes. Goes to show how much a reading can vary. Thank you for your comments.

****** Oddly enough, I've never enjoyed Anchorman. Will Ferrel's particular brand of comedy just doesn't hit me in the funny bone.

Thank you for sparking an interesting discussion! I've enjoyed seeing people's different ideas on either side, and the civility throughout this thread has been a pleasant surprise.

****** I was missremembering; that scene is actually in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/30/A-Black-Comedy][penultimate chapter]]. Harry and Sirius realize they've both gotten the same (non life threatening) magical STD, and they are subjected to many jokes due to the infamy of spreading it to so many partners.
