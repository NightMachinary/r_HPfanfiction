It's a WIP without ships slash or otherwise. It's quite well written and there's no hamfisted bashing, just a criticism of the kind of corruption it would take to land a 5-6 year old in a prison with literal soul sucking monsters. Most likely on ffnet.

** Even if they go along with it out of pity for a young kid, there would still be dementors, locked in a cell, sub standard prison food, lack of kids his age, lack of chance to socialise - other than few guards who exist there, no chance of going outside, no school.

Unless it be a total crack fic - very very depressing to even think about.
