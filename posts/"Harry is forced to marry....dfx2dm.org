Voldemort but maybe s/he can find love with the maniac that killed his/her parents and countless others. <3"

Draco but maybe s/he can find love with the bigoted brat! <3"

Snape but maybe s/he can find love with the person who hates his/her father with an intensity of a 1000 suns. <3"

And other ridiculous pairings including those not related to Harry at all. Like Hermione and any bigoted character in the series.

But they always seem to work out for the best. "Oh we're married all my hate for you is suddenly draining away... take me now! Let's be together forever!"

Fanfiction is weird sometimes...


** Forced marriages are a really weird trope I really only see in HP fanfics. Dunno where tf it came from, but it's just a lazy way for incompetent writers to force two characters together.

In other fandoms, they don't use marriage contracts as the plot device to hook characters by taking away their agency, but that doesn't mean that forced relationships don't exist. The most common plot devices are alien sex pollen, a/b/o mating, or soul bonding.

Same old story, same minimal-effort premise, just a different surface aesthetic.

**** There was this one story I can't remember the name of that took the soul bond trope and turned it into a horrible curse by letting it be more realistic. Like how horrible it is for teenagers to know someone else hears your embarrassing thought all the time or that your friend of the opposite gender knows what your body feels like/looks like even tho you are not even remotely interested in that person. Quite interesting horror scenario yet sadly unfinished if I remember correct.

*** There is an old SSHG community called WIKTT (When I KIssed The Teacher). I don't know where it is (Tumblr? Somewhere else?) but either way, they came up with the MLC, or Marriage Law Challenge. A Marriage Law is instituted and muggleborns have to marry purebloods (this was before HBP and Snape's status as a halfblood was established). Lucius, in typical Ministry bribery fashion, "bids" on Hermione and Snape has to be the one saving her from Lucius. Eventually, fics started relaxing the rules of the challenge into Lucius not needing to be involved, to HG marrying anyone "improper", to anyone marrying anyone. And now we have the Marriage Law trope.

*** It comes from the real world, where arranged marriages were all too common in the past, especially between royalty and nobility (usually used as a way to cement alliances). I feel like it's worth noting that marrying for love is a (relatively) new concept.

** On the other hand, JKR made Hermione marry Ron as a form of wish-fulfillment, for reasons that had little to do with the story, but because her first marriage was unhappy, troubled, and lasted only a year.

** I remember a very interesting one. It was by lightofdaye, yeah the smut writer, about Harry having to marry Tonks after OotP, in order for Sirius' inheritance to go to him, the main issue was Kreacher and Grimmauld Place. It was quite funny, as you can imagine. Not in tone, no. But 20+ woman marrying a 15-year old has its own set of humour, like that Harry felt he was terrible at sex, Tonks doing it just as a request from Dumbledore, both of them living at No. 4 Privet Drive etc. etc.

Shame he deleted it and never finished the fic. But it was something different. There was no love at first sight, no marital bliss (on the contrary), and the whole mess was treated with the disdain and revulsion it deserved.

** the biggest problem with posts like this is how the op sounds like they never read any of the types of stories they are trying to criticize.

when draco is paired with harry or hermione, he has a redemption arc or he was never bigoted to begin with and was forced into the death eater stuff by his father.

when snape is paired with harry or hermione, he magically stops being a schoolyard bully and starts acting his age.

when voldemort is paired with harry or hermione... well yeah you have a point in this one actually, *usually* hary or hermione becomes evil in these ones instead of voldemort becoming good.

*** Eh, Harry goes dark in a lot of Harry x Draco/Snape as well. There's rarely a true redemption arc for either and more often than not the good guys are bashed with a dash of justification for mudblood/blood traitor.

Simply put, Draco and Snape don't really get better everyone else is just written a lot worse.

**** I've read 2 SSHP fics, plus one by accident (it was subtle enough that I only realized it in the last chapter). The former 2 genderbended Harry, all 3 fics involved time travel (2 to Marauder-era, one to First War). None of the fics have Harry go dark.

(The accidental one had me assume a platonic relationship until a sudden non-platonic kiss in the last chapter that threw me off completely, leading me to try to figure out if it was hinted anywhere before then, and only finding one reference to it that was easy to miss).

*** This. I dislike forced marriage trope greatly, but it's obvious the OP never reads fics with it or fics with these pairings in general and just uses it as an excuse to bash the ships they dislike.

Moral outrage and pearl-clutching about ships is silly, and doubly so when the person has no idea what they are talking about.

Ehhh I wouldn't say that. I've read a significant portion of the fics tagged with Voldemort on Ao3 and FFN, and in my experience it's more of an even split between the three major tropes: the love interest turning evil, Voldemort being 'redeemed' by the love interest, or an AU where Voldemort turns out to have been a 'good' person all along.

** Yeah, right?! If they get together "naturally" because Harry/Hermione learns about Voldemort's true objectives/Dumbledore's deception/how Draco is abused by his parents/forced to be a Death Eater/didn't know better or because the "bigoted character" changed after the war/because tragedy struck/..., so basically if the author puts any effort into making it at least somewhat relatable, then, well, cats like mice, I don't. But the marriage law/soul bond/veela tropes /tend/ to be just a low effort tool to make them a couple. Not always, but often.
