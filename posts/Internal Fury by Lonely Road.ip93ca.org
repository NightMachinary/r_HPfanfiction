I know this is a long shot but does anyone have a copy of Internal Fury by Lonely Road they could send me? I have been looking for literally years and have had no luck üòû


** Sorry to make a comment when I don't have the fic you're looking for, but a quick google search for "Internal Fury by Lonely Road" lead me to [[https://hp-ficsearch.livejournal.com/645505.html][this]], and I just wanted to ask if you have been searching for this fic for more than three years now, and if so what's so good about it that it's worth it?

*** Yeah I've been looking for a long time now lol I found a forum awhile back talking about this fanfic and it just sounded really good and exactly the type that I would like to read. So every now and then I'll post something new in hopes of eventually finding it. I haven't had any luck but maybe eventually I will üôÇ

** The author has an AN in the story that they still have up mentioning updating Internal Fury. That story was last updated in 2008. Assuming that the story wasn't deleted before 2012, the FFN site rip from that period should have it. Looking through the site rip for it, now, but it's going to take a bit.

*** [[/u/SRainey95]] Unfortunately, the fic must have been deleted before 2015. I had trouble acquiring the 2012 siterip. I'll try again.

***** I have an update. A sad update.

I was finally able to find an archived version of Lonely Road's FFN page.

  Yes, I have deleted Internal Fury. I am absolutely sick of the incessant nit picking and rude comments about the lack of consistant updates. In case some of you didn't notice leukemia is a terrible disease that takes up a lot of time and energy to battle. I have had some serious complications that have caused problems with my pregnancy. It is stressful when two innocent little lives are dependant on my health just so they can survive and putting up with people's insensitivity and rudness is so not worth the extra stress. I have far more important things to worry about than some silly fan fiction story that wasn't that good anyway. But to those people who where always kind and encouraging, I so appreciate it and I do apologize for not finishing what I had started. If you want to read good, quality stories that are far better than my own please read my friend Notwolf's trilogy: Beginnings of a Death Eater, I, Too, Shall Follow and Death Eater No More.

  Hugs! Chelsea

The fic was deleted in 2009, long before any of the earliest site rips were ever made, that I could find. Unfortunately, there is likely very little you could possibly do to retrieve this story.

Assuming that the author still uses their email from that time period (11 years ago), they have it posted on the archived version of their profile. I'll DM it to you, and wish you good luck. If they do happen to respond, I'd be interested in hearing how your search ends.

On a more positive note, their profile was last updated in 2015, so at the very least it seems as though they won their battle with leukemia.

****** Thank you for putting so much effort into the search! It's sad to hear about the leukemia but like you said, it's good new news that it sounds like they won that battle. I really appreciate your help ‚ò∫Ô∏è
