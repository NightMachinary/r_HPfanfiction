***** [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600098957]]

It is surprisingly well written for smut, each chapter is a different pairing. Noteworthy are 1 (Hannah Abbott) due to realism and 3+6 since they have celebrities (Gwenog Jones and Rita).

** linkffn(10025439) maybe?

They're all described as celebrities, so maybe it fits enough for what you're looking for. Pretty good read, too, so long as you like to read drama.

  A new show on the Wizarding Wireless Network launches 5 years after the final battle. It will place 10 'celebrities' in a house together for 2 months. Friendships and romances will blossom, but rivalries threaten to rip them apart. Who will win 'Listen-In' and the prize of a thousand galleons that comes with it? AU post-DH, Rated M for language, sexual and sensitive themes.
