Thought about this just now, and I love the idea of Arthur discovering something as simple as maybe a game of Pacman and spending hours discovering how it works.


** linkffn(Arthur Weasley's newest toy)

It's a crack oneshot, but [[/spoiler][his mind is certainly /blown/ by the thing in question]]. It also includes one of my favourite lines in fanfic, for the sheer improbablility and silliness: [[/spoiler]["Besides, who's ever heard of a 'Mercedes' sign in black and yellow? Pff, ridiculous."]]

On another note, I'll see if I can find some more serious fics that fit your criteria.

  ONESHOT Mr. Weasley just came home with the most brilliant muggle contraption he'd ever seen. How could he resist the temptation to tinker with it?

*** Its Arthur's attitude towards muggles, shown through the whole series that lends credence to this cracky one shot. Maybe not to this extent, but whenever I see Arthur bashing, based on him being clueless about muggle, I see that as accurate.
