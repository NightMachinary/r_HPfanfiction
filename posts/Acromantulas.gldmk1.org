Alright so I was reading a bit and came across how the Weasley twins made something of an anti acromantula. But then I rembered spider facts. So how strong would those buggers be relatuve to their size? I mean it would be a lot right? They're capable of dragging dunno pretty much anything short of giants


** I don't think it works to think of acromantula as strictly upsized spiders, because a lot of the things that make insects so crazy strong directly relates to their size. I think it makes a lot more sense to think of acromantula as being of a similar strength to another large animal, like a horse or a cow, or maybe closer to a sheep or a dog, depending on size. Magic could factor in to their relative power, but it just doesn't make sense for a spider to be just as agile and relatively powerful at 5 feet as it is at 3 inches.

*** Yea true, I just thought how disgustingly OP it would be if there were thousands of super spiders swarming anything and everything.
