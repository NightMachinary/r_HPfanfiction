On a mobile for the next couple days and need some stories. I'm looking for some good (hopefully finished) super Harry fics. I would like them to make sense ( no, get up one morning and now he's super) Give me some training or some kind of (believable) accident or raised by someone powerful. I prefer H/HR or H/G but am pretty open to different pairings within reason(no Harry/Snape or Voldemort or Draco) someone believable. Thanks in advance. And if someone wants to link to another post that would be helpful.


** Joe's Sword of the Hero trilogy is excellent. Shezza's Denarian trilogy is also up there. Both of these are probably some of the best Super!Harry you'll find.

Edit: Also, you MUST check out Joe's Wastelands of Time series.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]]. Harry uses a lot of dark magic and rapidly becomes incredibly powerful. Probably my favorite psychopath Harry fic. No real pairing, but Harry sleeps around.

*** Do you mind spoiling this one for me? Maybe in a PM. It seems interesting but the beginning is shaky and I'm not sure whether I want to invest in reading it.

*** Enjoying it so far. Some of the stunts pulled seemed too reckless to be gotten away with realistically, but on the whole I liked the efforts at explaining dark magic. Too many stories provide no further explanation than 'dark magic is addictive'.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3796738/1/Harry-Potter-Rogue][Harry Potter Rogue]] Its an HG story that seems to be on its way to super harry. It's got a lot of training in it so far(started reading it today), and he's beat Moody in a practice duel so it might be what you're looking for.

*** I'm a couple of chapters into this and I have to say it's enjoyable. The writing is good and the plot -- at least so far -- is believable. Have an upvote on me.

Quite funny too, but unfinished.

** Quite probably not what you're looking for, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][this]] is the superest Harry I know. A few caveats: Harry's a girl (and was born that way), Hermione and Ron are together, the central relationship is someone who hardly features in canon. (No Snape, no Malfoy, because you wanted to avoid this. I don't want to spoil more than I have to, but it isn't Voldemort, or a death eater or even a ministry stooge. It's someone you know, but someone you probably don't hate. And no, not Dean nor Seamus.).

*** A Long Journey Home is one of the best fics I've read. Although it's incomplete (updated 10/14/14), it's a long and satisfying read (130k+). Super!Harry is well-developed and definitely not two-dimensional. Her relationship is realistic, warming, and not at all too mushy. I wouldn't say her relationship is central to the plot, however.

Neither did I. What's your point?

***** Sorry, I misinterpreted 'the central relationship'. My bad; English is not my first language.
