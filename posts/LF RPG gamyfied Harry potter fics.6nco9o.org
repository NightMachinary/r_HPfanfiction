Looking for fics where Harry's life is a RPG type setting where he levels up and have to spend points on ability's and traits.

I read something like this once some years ago but at the time it was not complete and maybe abandoned. I think he got a "prompt" after going to bed each night to spend any points collected during the day.

Do anyone know of this fic or others like it?


** This is a personal guilty pleasure of mine, so I've got a few for you. None of them are completed, except the Hermione one.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game by Concept101) (the best written)

linkffn(Harry Potter the Videogame: Exploited) (very silly)

linkffn(Harry Potter: Game of the Year Edition)

linkffn(Harry Potter: The RPG by Britael) (one of my favorites, though I don't like some of the decisions close to the end)

linkffn(Harry Potter the Genius Gamer) (pretty terrible writing, but did I mention guilty pleasure?)

[[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1003]] has Hermione as a protagonist, and is completed, but beware, it gets really weird at the end.

  After his self-sacrifice Harry is faced with a choice, stay in limbo or play a RPG game about himself. Enough to say that stories about a character that actually chose to stay in limbo would not be a popular one... Video-game fic.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** It's about an OC and not Harry, but you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] - D&D crossover (but it explains the mechanics well enough, I don't play D&D and I understood everything), but sadly abandoned a long time ago. Writing quality falters a bit in some of the early chapters but gets a lot better. Lots of surreptitious knocking on the fourth wall.

** linkffn(11799646) It's a fem!Harry where she is continuously sent to different worlds after dying to help other heroes. The first one is a crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, the second a crossover with Fullmetal Alchemist and the third is a crossover with Inuyasha and is incomplete. I do like the concepts behind the fics, though at times I was kinda confused cos I had never read the manga. English is also not the author's first language, so there are grammatical and spelling errors littered throughout the story. If you're willing to put up with all that, the series is an interesting one.

*** I like KHR and wanted to like it since I think there is a lot of potential with crossovers with that and HP, but I couldn't get past all the grammatical errors. If it wasn't for those it seemed interesting, wish they had used a beta.
