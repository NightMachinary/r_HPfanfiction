I'm an idiot for Sirius and I want him alive, so technically I need to keep Pettigrew locked up or dead or whatever. But I don't have much experience in writing and even if it's for fun it's good to think about cool alternatives. Getting Barty Jr to free himself before year 4 is the easiest way, JK left no alternative for a side story and I don't see Voldemort doing anything alone for a very long time....

Does this path make history cheaper? I'm not talking about how he is going to find Voldemort, this deserves an alternative way out, BUT he needs to be free first.

Is this a very miraculous solution? +yes i don't have much creativity to think of something very outside of canon+ :D


** Doesn't sound implausible to me. I've read fics where Bertha Jorkins investigating at the Crouch home is the trigger for Junior escaping; or where other Death Eaters (e.g. the Carrow twins) go looking for Voldemort after hearing rumours about the events in Harry's first year.

** He did escape on his own in canon at the world cup. He was then stunned and his father recaptured him. Just have him dodge behind a tree at the right moment and he is away free.

** If it somewhat follows third year, have Pettigrew Captured, Sirius freed, and Snape gets slapped with a heavy fine for lying about Sirius confounding them.

Have another Death Eater overhear Snape muttering to himself. They can go looking.

ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR~ Have Crouch suffer a heart attack when he falls under massive scrutiny when Sirius is declared innocent, and Junior was going to be discovered. Junior can free himself then, since IIRC, Senior was regularly reapplying the imperius leading up to the events of the fourth book. It sounds like where Pettigrew went to when he escaped sounded like a known regrouping location for the Death Eaters and Voldemort.

** Didn't Crouch Jr escape on his own, though? I'm almost 100% sure that he escaped his father's imperius' hold and then he got to Voldemort and Pettigrew in a way we don't know.

*** No, Barty Jr said that Voldemort found out from Bertha Jorkins, and then went to the Crouch house to rescue him, putting Barty Sr under the Imperius in the process.

**** Actually Barty Jr started escaping it before. He says in Chapter 35 of GoF that he was having moments when he was starting to feel like himself again, one of those being the moment he steals Harry's wand at the World Cup and casts the dark mark.

** Are things going to be any different for Barty Senior in the leadup? One of my fics, I had the increased stress and scrutiny following the public reveal that Sirius hadn't had a trial weaken Senior's ability to maintain the Imperius, with it finally snapping while he was in the middle of a meeting with the DMLE that he couldn't beg out of and Junior gone with Winky by the time he got home. In another fic that I read, the stress caused by different events caused Senior to have a heart attack or stroke, which left him unable to keep up the curse.
