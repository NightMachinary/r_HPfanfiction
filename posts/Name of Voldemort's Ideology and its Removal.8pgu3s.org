Is there a clear-cut name, canon or otherwise, for the ideology Voldemort espoused? Pureblood Supremacy is the obvious one, but are there others?

What I'm really looking for is a term that can be the wizarding world equivalent of "denazification" in the Arithmancer-Verse--because that's exactly what they would need to go through after Voldemort's fall. That would be easiest if there was a simple name for the ideology they are tearing down, but "de-pureblood-ification" doesn't really send the right message. (Of course a term unrelated to the ideology like "reconstruction" could also work.)

**** Riddle was in a muggle orphanage during the rise of eugenics. He would most likely have read of the german fascination with it and over the years, turned it into a hypothesis of his own to use as part of his campaign. Imagine you're a pureblood. You're poor. But your family used to be rich. Powerful because of it. Then a charismatic wizard who says he's the heir of slytherin tells you how your magic is your right to rule, how he can help you regain your status, how magic is only yours due to your pureblood, he tells you everything you want to hear, while making you feel as if it's only natural for you to join him and his allies in a war to strike down those blood traitors who help others steal magic to give to muggles.

** I prefer "reform" for the process of cleaning up Wizarding Britain.

For the ideology, there's "Blood Purism"

*** Fair point, although I'm not sure how well the word applies to this particular situation. How much reform did canon magical Britain need before Fudge, under the militantly anti-Voldemort Bagnold government? Yes, there was corruption and plenty of human rights violations like Azkaban, but they were much less blood purism-related.

Talking about reestablishing toppled governments, "restoration" and "reconstruction" seem to be the terms that are used historically, so maybe something along those lines would be better.

**** Given how quickly Voldemort turned the country into Nazi Britain, supported by the Ministry, and given the fact that scum like Malfoy and Umbridge flourished, I think Wizarding Britain is in dire need of reforms. Even Pottermore mentions that Hermione spent a lot of time removing biased pro-pureblood laws years after Voldemort's defeat.

*** Good catch. I'm a little rusty with details like that. And "depuristification" would work a little better, but it's still pretty clunky for what I want it to do. I had actually thought of "demortification" myself, which I think sounds cool, but it's less obvious what it means.

**** I think "demortification" is pretty good, actually, but it seems like it's more about rooting out actual Death Eaters than blood-purism as such (since there /were/ blood-purists who didn't like Voldemort very much; just look at Draco once he's met the Dark Lord for real).

**** By the way, since I've got you, I wanted to ask you: how comes the Children of Aragog are working for Voldemort now? In canon, their involvement in the Battle of Hogwarts was a hopeless battle of fighting /everyone else at once/, and they actually had more of a grudge with the DEs than with the Hogwarts defenders when it got right down to it. Which makes sense; their worst enemy (the Basilisk) was Lord Voldemort's minion, and Voldemort attempted to murder Aragog outright in 1943. So while I'm willing to buy that Voldemort could have tricked the Acromantulas into fighting for him, I'd like a bit of /explanation/ for that, rather than have it dumped on us as carelessly as the Giants and Dementors (who /do/ belong there).

Note that this is only one question/quibble; I must say I /love/ your version of the Battle of Hogwarts so far.

***** Was it that way in canon? I reread most of the battle, and I thought the acromantulas just showed up with no explanation there. I assumed it was because Voldemort was recruiting all the dark creatures he could for his army.

Aragog is dead, and, like the werewolves, Voldemort can promise them what they want: freedom to leave the forest and hunt humans (regardless of whether he'd really give it to them), so I don't think it would be that hard to convince them.

****** I do believe the canon explanation is that the Death Eaters drove out the Acromantulas from their clearing --- it's in that very clearing that Harry faces Voldemort. So the Acromantulas were /very pissed off/ and attacked all the wizards they saw from then on, not caring very much whether those were Death Eaters or otherwise.

** Hermione should come up with the term “Blood Nazis”.

Then “Denazification” can also be used.

For Muggles and new Muggleborn students, they would understand its meaning without much explanation.

** Puritanism. Wait, wasn't there something about witches in Salem?

More seriously though, Voldemort would almost certainly try to use its title as a way of elevating himself /personally/ (he is a narcissist after all).

He makes a reference to "pruning a tree" of diseased branches during DH. He could possibly use that metaphor as something like "*Root*" or better yet "*The Foundation*" (thanks Danzo). It certainly fits with the pureblood references to their "roots" and being "founders" of the wizarding world, but it sounds more open for more neutral parties.

Alternatively, given his speech to Neville in DH about how only the "Noble House of Slytherin," he could potentially play it up as reforming the flaws of the other three founders and playing up the Heir of Slytherin card. Some possibilities include "*The Noble* *Reclamation*" and "*Slytherin Conquest*."

The key here is that Voldemort, despite his...interesting ideas about humanity, is still a talented, charismatic and intelligent leader. And he would know to play up certain aspects of their ideology, but do as much as he could to brand himself correctly. He /could/ use force, but people are far more useful when they serve willingly than petulantly.

*** And on that note, Shacklebolt and others in the new government would want to play up the more "liberal" message they wanted to send, of toleration toward outsiders and rejection of prejudice.

My suspicion is the would choose something both muggle and likely wizard-oriented. An example I can think of is that if Voldemort waged a "revolution," the new reformers waged a "*Renaissance*." This works too since the Renaissance occured prior to the SoS being passed, so wizards are likely more tied to it in history than any event in the last three centuries (except possibly the second world war a la Grindelwald).
