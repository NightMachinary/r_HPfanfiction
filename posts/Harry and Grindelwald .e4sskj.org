Hey guys !\\
A mad idea has entered my head and made me search for sofe fics where Harry has some iteraction with Gellert Grindelwald.\\
I've readed Grindelwald's heir but i don't know how to classify, i don't like or really dislike.\\
Defiance had a great potential to show interaction between those two, but it didn't.

So, send me the best fanfictions where Harry is related or iteracts with the ol Dark Lord.

-I really would like something without Dubledore bashing.

-No Slash pls.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

  Gilderoy Lockhart landed himself in St Mungo's after his 'Cornish Pixies' class. Where can a headmaster now find another Defence teacher, one who's knowledgeable beyond doubt, willing to face the curse on the position, and available to start in a few days? In Nurmengard, that's where.

** Genderbent isn't technically slash?? crawlersout by Sambomaster is pretty well written with an interesting take on Grindelwald. But something tells me that fem!Harry isn't your cup of tea. Got nothing else though.

** The Son of Grindelwald linkffn(13398928)

It's not done but it gets updates at a decent rate. There his no real bashing but, for obvious reasons, Dumbledore is one of many antagonist in that Story.\\
There is also no slash, it looks more like a Harry/Fleur fic.

As mentioned in the title and description this is a story were Harry is the son of Grindelwald, so he is related to him.
