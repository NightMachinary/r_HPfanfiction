Because I like a good time travel story, and there need to be more Hermione-centric stories. Especially ones where she gets to be awesome.

Stars Hermione from a timeline where Harry didn't come back and Voldemort was able to escape his defeat at Hogwarts. This leads to a grinding civil war that pretty much destroys magical Britain, and ends with the Statute of Secrecy failing in a very sudden and bad way (say, a mass slaughter of Muggles via a Fiendfyre attack in London, with no Ministry left to contain it or cover it up). Leading to Muggle governments waging a war of enslavement or extermination against the magical world. Then someone gets the idea of firing off the nukes, and most of the world burns. We could go with the old 2012 apocalypse theory, and have that be the year it finally goes completely to hell. One of the few survivors in this radioactive hellscape swarming with Dementors is a now 33 year-old Hermione Granger- in this timeline a hardened veteran of decades of war, and a master of pretty much every form of dangerous and powerful magic there is. In a last ploy to prevent the end of the world, she builds or finds a time turner and goes back in time with four goals- head off Voldemort's victory, topple the Ministry and replace it with an actually decent government, and either prevent the fall of the Statute of Secrecy or end it in a less catastrophic way. And find a way to destroy the Dementors utterly. I can see three possible routes from there:

1. Do what she's done for most of the last twenty years- form an insurgent group and wage war on both Voldemort and the Ministry.
2. Get a teaching post at Hogwarts, where she can keep a close eye on things, and on her younger self, Ron, and Harry in particular. Probably the Muggle Studies post, since we know it was vacant right before Harry started school (when Quirrell switched to DADA).
3. Try to become Minister.

Or some combination of the above. But yeah, in this story Hermione is basically a more dangerous female Dumbledore, who puts way less stock in the prophecy because she's lived through a timeline where it didn't amount to anything except a lot of pointless death (including her best friend and boyfriend).

As to why she doesn't just go back further and kill Voldemort as a baby or something- she chooses not to go back earlier than late 1980 because she can't bear the thought of butterflying Harry and Ron out of existence, and she's not sure what will happen if she butterflies /herself/ out of existence (probably nothing, if its an alternate timeline, but better safe than sorry).

To make her a bit more human and less overpowered, well, have her be someone who's spent decades fighting a brutal, hopeless war. Probable PTSD, basically no idea how to relate to people outside of commanding an insurgent group any more, and so fixated on avoiding the mistakes of her timeline that she sometimes doesn't notice the new mistakes that are being made, or the opportunities being past up, in this new altered timeline.


** Sounds pretty good.

But I like another twist: she didn't actually time travel, but jumped to a different universe/dimension that was behind hers by ~30 years. And things are somewhat different here, so her future knowledge could even be counterproductive.

To be honest with you, if the time traveler doesn't bother with that "keeping the timeline" bullshit, and exploit their future knowledge to the fullest extent, there will be actually little challenge. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), can serve as some kind of blue print. This Hermione of yours is however many times more powerful.

Therefore, I proposed the twist of *dimensional time travel* instead of a simple time travel.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

*** Actually, future knowledge doesn't go as far as you'd think. Because the more you change, the more the butterfly effect will render your knowledge of the original timeline obsolete. Stuff that happened in the past that's secret would remain valuable information, like the prophecy or the horcruxes that had already been made, but knowing that, say, Lucius gave Ginny the diary in 2nd. Year, or that Moody is actually Crouch Jr., wouldn't necessarily be worth anything, because the changes caused by the time traveler's presence might mean those events never happened. This is one of the nuances of time travel that is overlooked by authors (even professional ones) with frustrating frequency.

Future Hermione might even overlook this fact sometimes, because she's so fixated on preventing the timeline she remembers, that she doesn't always anticipate the changes in the timeline she's in.

Alt dimension could work too, though.

**** I'm sorry, but this is not how you use future knowledge. You don't *need to recreate* that freaking 'timeline'. No, you use what you know about the future to strike at your enemies's greatest vulnerabilities!

If this Hermione decides for 1991, then she knows:

- Voldemort's mean of immortality, what his Horcruxes are and where they are hidden
- The identity and location of *every* inner circle Death Eater
- Scabber is Wormtail, Sirius is innocent
- Barty Jr is hiding at his own home
- Quirrell is carrying Voldemort
- Rita Skeeter is a beetle Animagus
- Umbridge is a big threat

So, what can she do with these important knowledge? Someone as smart as Hermione is not going to sit passively there and let things repeat! No, she's going to actively using the information to her greatest advantage! If she's willing to work with Dumbledore, things are going to be even easier:

- Tell Dumbledore about the apocalypse if Voldemort is not defeated, scare him to the point where he agrees that *anything* is a go against Voldemort and his Death Eaters
- Get the Diadem Horcrux from the Room of Requirement
- Out Wormtail and exonerate Sirius, and have Wormtail kissed by dementors;
- Out Barty Jr, have him kissed too and his dad sent to Azkaban for life
- Stun Quirrell and hopefully Voldemort. If Voldemort's wraith escapes, she knows it's most likely in Albania
- Raid Malfoy Manor with Dumbledore and Moody in lead, they know where his secret stash is, they will have enough evidence this time to send Lucius to Azkaban for a very very long time. Most importantly, the Diary is now in their hands
- Assassinate Dolores Umbridge and frame the Death Eaters
- Blackmail Rita Skeeter (Hermione knows again) to raise public awareness against Death Eaters
- Rile up Augusta Longbottom, make a big push in Wizengamot to confiscate Crouch, Lestrange, and Malfoy assets. Get the Cup
- Let Sirius and Kreacher have a talk about Regulus, bring the Locket. Put all these Horcruxes in front of the Gaunt Shack, and burn everything down with Fiendfyre. She or Dumbledore should be able to control it
- Back at Hogwarts, kill the Basilisk with roosters, harvest its venom, sell its parts for gold
- Continue with media campaign against Death Eaters, Dumbledore, now fully in control of the Ministry, proposes reinvestigate all incarcerated Death Eaters at Azkaban, only this time with Veritaserum and Legilimency.
- Follow up on their leads and arrest all known Death Eaters, those guilty of even one murder will be pushed over the Veil. Confiscate their assets further to compensate their victims
- Meanwhile, ask Snape to seek out the wraith of Voldemort in Albania. Snape's Occlumency should make Voldemort think that he's on the run from Ministry's purge and he's the last one of his faithful. Once Voldemort is in that weak Homunculus body, a stunner in his back will finally see Voldemort captured
- Now in their custody, force Voldemort to tell all his secrets, then obliviate him fully and completely to his infancy, with the Elderwand. Even if his wraith should escape in some very unlikely fashion, he would only wander the mortal plane as a confused spirit forever! But for now, Voldemort would be petrified and locked behind a ward more powerful than Nurmengard
- Their last major task should be to remove Voldemort's soul fragment from Harry. It may work, or it may not. But since Harry is never a properly made Horcrux, it should be possible to get it out without killing him. If it works, execute Voldemort

You see, there's no need to repeat any of the canon stations. There's no need to let any of these scums carrying out their canon schemes. You go actively after them, mercilessly and ruthlessly.

Even if some should escape, this Hermione would hunt them down until the end of the Earth, while letting her counterpart and other children have the childhood they deserve!

***** You have essentially repeated my point, in a much more long-winded fashion, while acting as though it is yours.

Of course the original timeline won't repeat (not in a well-written story, anyway). You don't need to even brutally murder every bad guy to make that happen. The moment you start changing things, even if its just by being in the past, that will start causing other changes, and those changes will cause more changes, and very soon you'll have a very different timeline with very different problems. Which means that your future knowledge will become less and less useful as time goes on.

That doesn't mean, though, that the changes won't create new problems- ones your foreknowledge doesn't prepare you to deal with.

** linkao3(Strange Attractors) involves a time-traveling Hermione with war medic expertise, but she also has quite a bit of amnesia.
