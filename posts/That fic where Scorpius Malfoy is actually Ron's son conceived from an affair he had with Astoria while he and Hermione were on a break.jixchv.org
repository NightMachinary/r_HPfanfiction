** ...Ouch. That sounds disturbingly hilarious.

...Wouldn't the kid be ginger, though?

"Oh, don't worry about it, love," Astoria said, placing her hand on her husband's upper-arm. "My grandmother, bless her soul, was a red-head. It just pops up now and again. And my beloved sister has strawberry blonde hair, too!"

Draco nodded, but he internally suppressed his wince that his child, his bright star, looked like he could be straight out of a Weasley family photograph.

At least his sister-in-law's daughter didn't look like Potter, even if she had green eyes.

Wouldn't that be a funny thought, though?

Meanwhile, in Wales...

"Hmm?" Daphne looked up from her book. "Something wrong?"

"No... no, it's nothing," Harry said. "Just a strange itch in the middle of my back."

"Well then," Daphne practically purred, pushing her book aside, "we can't have that then, can we?"

Harry gulped but was smiling as she dragged him to the rug by his collar, the roaring fire illuminating the two lovers with its radiance.

Months later, Daphne and Theodore Nott announced the birth of their second child... a bouncing baby boy with startling green eyes, like his elder sister's.

"From my great grandfather."

**** i would love it if their children find the "fake"s being attractive, eg Lily Luna Potter wanting to date Nott Jr or James Sirius wanting to date his half sister.

***** Cue Harry and/or Ron sitting there with painfully fake smiles on their faces as they're introduced to their children's potential love interests, all the while screaming internally.

** ``` ROSE Don't worry, Scorp, my Dad cannot kill all boys who show interest in me.

SCORPIUS (with hollow voice) Only some of them.

RON Ah, glad to see you. (long pause) Err, I am so glad you like each other, but ... Hermione, could us please leave alone for a minute? ... we have something to talk about privately. ```

** I think I remember one where Rose was interested in Scorpius and he turned out to be Harry and Astoria's son due to an affair. Part of the story is telling Rose why she can't date Scorpius... It was a harmony plus story...
