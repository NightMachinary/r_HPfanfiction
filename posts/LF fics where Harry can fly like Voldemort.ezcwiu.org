Thanks.

  Voldemort's attempt at possessing Harry had a different outcome when Harry fought back with the "Power He Knows Not". This set a change in motion that shall affect both Wizards and Muggles. AU after fifth year: Featuring a darkish and manipulative Harry

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** I'm planning a story where Harry will have the ability to fly, but based on a completely different spell than Voldemort. So Voldemort is very maneuverable, while Harry's method has better speed and acceleration but is much harder to control and he often has difficulty landing without injuries. Basically Voldemort has broomstick enchantments on his bones while Harry has repulsion charms on his boots and gloves, flying like Iron Man but without an AI to help controlling it.
