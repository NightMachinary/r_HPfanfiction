To me, it seems odd that people would trust an abused, frequently-rebelling subset of the population to manage their money. Even if goblins didn't outright steal from them, I'd imagine it would be easy for them to inflict financial ruin on anyone who offended them. Hell, it's like no wizard has ever heard of malicious compliance.

But, as far as I'm aware, the rebellions are just treated as a footnote. Do we know anything about what the rebellions were about specifically?

Also, has anyone written a fic about them, or had a modern rebellion occur? I've seen so many Harry-rememberers-that-goblin's-name-and-now-he's-friends-with-all-goblin-kind fics, but never anything the other way around.


** There's a goblin rebellion in linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer) which ticks most of those boxes.

** The rebellions are usually understood to be about the Wand Ban, which the Goblins really, really resent, more than any of the other species it affects. As to why they're still trusted with the Wizarding World's money, I think that was part of the terms of the peace treaty. We have no reason to think the wizards won by enough of a curbstomp that they could just demand whatever they wanted.

*** But still, "We won, but we're going to allow you to be in charge of our money supply" still seems like a really huge consession. Like, that almost sounds like the demands of the /winning/ side that actively seeks to crush and contain the loosing side. And if goblins had won, I'd imagine the attitude towards goblins by wizards would be rather different. I can understand a slim victory by wizards, but I still feel that, when written by greedy politicians, that treaty must have gotten the wizard side something more than just "no wands for goblins."

Or maybe wizards are just dumb. That seems to be a running theme in the books...

**** Well, we don't see Goblins doing anything /else/ than banking (in Britain at least), so it could be that the treaty restricted them from owning any other kind of business. This would have some nice parallels to what happened with Jews in various places in the past.

As to why they'd leave banking to the Goblins, the answer is simple: wizards can't do maths. There's no math class at Hogwarts, just an Arithmancy elective that really isn't focused on economics. So they can't. If they tried to take care of their own economy it would collapse in two days.

**** I think goblins have unique magic that makes the goblin made coins impossible to fake through transfiguration or any other muggle or (wizard) magical means. Since the Wizarding World needs a currency that no wizard can just make more of they outsource it to the goblins.

***** And the moment people lose trust in a currency or can no longer reliably spend it to get the things they need, they will change to another currency. Wizards would definitely have to get creative with it, but I'm sure they could come up with /something./ What do wizards in Asia or Africa or the Americas use for money? I highly doubt that /everyone/ uses goblin gold/silver/bronze as money.
