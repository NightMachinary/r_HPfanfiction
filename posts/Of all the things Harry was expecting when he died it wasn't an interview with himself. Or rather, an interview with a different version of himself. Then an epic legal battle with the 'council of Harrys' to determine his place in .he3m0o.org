** Harry listened to his other selves argue about him. There were Slytherin-hims, Ravenclaw-hims, Hufflepuff-hims, unrepentant Death Eater hims, nerd-hims, jock-hims, and hims with harems.

He wasn't sure how much he liked them.

"This is ridiculous. I'm leaving."

"You can't leave," said one of the other hims. "There's literally nothing out there. There's only us."

"I'd rather die than be stuck with myself for all eternity," Harry said. He had, after all, willingly gone to his death.

So when he jumped off the citadel, he was a bit surprised to find himself listening to Voldemort gloating over his dead body.

/80 years later:/

Harry woke up in the citadel again.

"Oh, it's you," said a him. "We were wondering if you'd survived that. How'd the rest of your life go?"

Harry stared rather glumly at his hands, which were young once more. "My son stole a time turner because I ended up like Vernon, and then Cedric was a Death Eater."
