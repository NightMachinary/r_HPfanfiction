Since there are quite a few fanfics with people taking over various postings at Hogwarts, what are some of your favorite “<Character> is the new <Subject> Professor” fanfics? Obviously, one of the most common is seeing some crossover character filling in for DADA, but I've also seen History of Magic and Muggle Studies.

Crossovers are welcome, obviously, and the character in question should be the main character for the fanfic, but feel free to mention minor roles, if you like.


** /Anyone/ as History of Magic prof, please, somebody exorcise Binns. Those poor children.

I have a fondness for Regulus as Potions Master (or HoM!) and Harry as Defence prof, of course. Oh, or Remus getting his old job back post-War! Newt flitting in to give special Creatures classes would be lovely, maybe he comes by once a year to surprise the NEWT (ha) students.

  Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader.

** Batman teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts:

He's got experience taking down magic users and monsters without a wand. Anyone (who can cast spells) can learn defense spells. Learning how to defend yourself if you don't have a wand- now that's a rare skill.

He's paranoid enough to win even Moody's approval.

He'll teach non-lethal defenses only.

He's got experience turning orphaned children into child soldiers (not a good thing, obviously, but this is Hogwarts).

He's rich enough that he could fund Hogwarts indefinitely.

Can fill some other positions with Bat Family members or rogues/former rogues:

Muggle Studies/Librarian: Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle.

Herbology: Poison Ivy.

School Councilor (because they really need one): Harley Quinn.

Caretaker: Alfred.
