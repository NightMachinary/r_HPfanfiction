I always find the ‘Department of Mysteries is secretly an intelligence agency' line of thought interesting.

If this was the case, what do you think it would look like and what do you think its mission statement/imperative would be?

I sort of see it either (closer to canon ) as something falling somewhere between SHIELD's extremely dubious morality and creepiness (knowing about everything and everyone to a startling degree/morally bankrupt experiments/illegal secret jails) and the MI6's Britishness

Or

My preferred idea is that it has a branch that's pretty much solely concerned with keeping the statute of secrecy no matter what. I imagine that they're super up to date with the advances in the Muggle world and make sure the divide stays up. Maybe they even keep certain parties ignorant about how dangerous the muggles can be or something?

I just always find it really weird the discrepancies between Arthur's ‘fellytone' bullshit, and the fact that people literally use a phone to get into the guest entrance of the ministry, like isn't it odd that magicals are so shitty about knowing how to blend, but somehow the statute remains intact? I think there could be some gold in a department that sort of keeps that divide intact.

Like surely they would need people to shut down government missions to infiltrate the magical world, or experiment on magicals, or any number of other shit that muggles would get up to if there was actually a secret society of not only magical people but magical animals and plants as well. On top of all the international magical politics and the thousands of ways that spy craft and intelligence would be both easier and harder with magic.

So in my mind Arthur Weasley is totally an agent in this department, and is actually really so fucking good at his job, and basically a badass. He's just so approachable, and people just seem to want to tell him things. So many people in the ministry either love him and think they're best friends, or owe him favours, and absolutely everyone underestimates him.

I love the idea of his back shed filled with ‘Muggle artefacts' has that false wall/hidden weapons cache type deal going on, and I love the implications of either Molly being in on it, or Molly having no idea at all. There is also a Mr and Mrs smith situation ripe for the picking.

I love the implications of him being an agent who infiltrated the Order of the Phoenix, and Percy having been recruited and trained to be an inside man in the minister's office.

They're like ‘Snape calls himself a spy , that's hilarious'

Anyway this is all my personal head canon but I struggle to write proper spy shit, so I thought I'd share. Please credit me if you fold this into your work or use it as a bunny (my handle is gladheonsleeps on ao3 and ffnet)


** My headcanon has an entire branch of the Ministry dealing with 'Muggle Liason'. Most of the day-to-day work is handling money transfers and providing legal advice to magicals involved with the muggles world e.g. buying a house. However, they also have staff working with the police and intelligence services to steer them away from wasting their time chasing after magical stuff, and Inland Revenue, because whatever method the Ministry or the Goblins use to return pounds back into circulation would technically be money laundering.

** Well, to be honest, proper spycraft would actually be super boring compared to the Hollywood version. The idea is to gather intelligence and confirm its accuracy. The more sensitive the intelligence being gathered, the harder it is to gather and confirm it, with only the most dangerous things such as imminent invasion or nuclear weapons being given to terrorists prompting intervention by teams that specialise in Black Operations (mostly belonging to nations that don't bear any noticeable outward affiliation with the country that gathered the intelligence if you want the Intel pipeline to remain 'safe'). The James Bond stuff wouldn't be handled by the agencies directly, nor would a field agent be asked to go and put themselves on the line when they can hire a guy to do it for them and not blow the local spy network's cover to kingdom come in case of capture.

Arthur would be an example of just such a field agent, tasked with doing his job, taking notes on the side and /not engaging the enemy/. The Order of the Phoenix seems to operate in much the same way-gathering intelligence and only acting in the most critical of circumstances. Passing info to the DMLE would be both useful and risky enough without the whole 'engaging in direct combat' thing.

In the meantime, actual work at the DOM would go something like this:

"Got a new file from our muggle liaison office." The shadowy figure said in as bored a voice as his vocal scrambling charms allowed for.

"Pass it over." Analyst 15 said, grabbing the file and opening it. "Huh. A painting?" He asked as he pulled a photo of the object out.

"Something about it triggered the Brains." The figure said. "Can't see it myself."

"That's because you were looking at the painting and not the frame. See those twists in the age lines? Classic enchantment-induced physical distortion. Must be a pretty powerful one too. Where was this picture taken?" Analyst 15 asked.

"Stockbroker's private collection. Lives in a place called, uh, Sloth?"

"Slough. Hmmmm... Forward it to the Americans. Bet it's the MACUSA snooping around again."

"And if it's not..."

" Then our stockbroker has some explaining to do. He should be a muggle. What's he doing with an enchanted painting in his house? Who does he know? Where did he buy it? Why is a wizard spying on him? We need to know."

**** "Look, I specialise in taking apart 1000 plus year old enchantments using only my wand and my wits. I once had a muggleborn reporter tell me that I was disarming mines by solving math puzzles and using the results to figure out which wire to cut. It's really exciting in its own way to the tiny, tiny number of people who get it."

"Uh huh."

" Dad... His job once had him take note of the effects an Eastern European animation enchantment had on mould patterns around the casting area. He had to wait for the mould to grow and was tasked with preserving the area from any attempt at cleaning up until that happened. So he spent a solid six months watching mould grow in a room, memory charming any muggles that came near and taking pictures of mould when it started sprouting. That was his most exciting assignment before he was tasked with going undercover at the Muggle Liaison Committee."

"Oh Merlin."

"Trust me, 99 percent of all that classified stuff? Dead boring. I once read an account of a DOM operative chasing a Death Eater across central London in the sixties. It... It put me to sleep. The author spent ten pages hypothesising on whether the Death Eater was using tile patterns as a means of communication with his colleagues. The chase scene was a map with an itinerary, followed by five pages detailing the effect a cutting curse had on fabric upholstery used in muggle cars. It bored me to tears! But look, if you like doing things like gardening or collecting postage stamps, then that really is the job for you. Otherwise, stay away."

** The DOM is secretly a magical branch of the SCP foundation that is there to keep an eye on the Wizards and their anomalies.

** My headcanon for the Dom was always that they are these crazy scientists (but with magic) who enjoy breaking laws that were never meant to be broken, who enjoy creation abomination just for the sake of knowledge, who would willingly tear a hole into reality just because they can and want to know what would happen. I always thought that the Dom was a lot older than the MoM, that they are the sort of people you would go to if you want to know how to summon cathulu because they would find out just because it's something they didn't know before, and that they would also be the type of people who would then summon cathulu just for the sake of studying it

*** Oh definitely. I think that's canon and super valid. I can't believe and also can very much believe that they'd have a lab where they regularly punch holes in time-space or whatever else right under their government in the middle of London, lmao
