"Oh, what's the difference?"

/Voldemort's robes flutter in the wind, fog creeps up behind him, a green-glowing Dark Mark appears in the sky, and his eyes glow evil red/

"PRESENTATION!"


** A swarm of death eaters fly into the sky in the shape of Voldemort's head, rock music playing in the background.

**** Poor, poor Ginny. Though she would have previously considered Dumbledore as a love interest -following the same logic- so I suppose Voldemort is not that much worse all things considered.

***** Dumbledore : “So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school and Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was finally dead! And Another Perfect Wooden Board Double-door was born!”

Ginny : “Another Perfect Wooden Board Double-door?”

APWBD : “That way I can keep my initials,”

Voldemort : “Because of WHAT?”

Ginny : “Come again?”

APWBD : “I am finally free to get in touch with my true power... making quality furniture!”

****** Headcanon to your headcanon:

Albus makes beautiful furniture but every piece of wood he works with in the end turns into weirdly shaped wand

*Pushes Holly Bowfront Chest to the fight* I'll be... There... In a... Minute...

*waves Elder Ottoman furiously* nothing better in a bar fight

*lounges in Chestnut Chaise Longue in the middle of the fight, eating popcorn* ...Just give me a moment- Woooo, that was explosion!

****** Voldemort grew up in Azkaban, and his distinctive facial features made him an outcast. He glamours himself to look normal and goes by the totally normal name of, err... Tom. That's totally normal. Tom... Riddle. (“Ooh, a mystery”)
