I'm looking for well written AU stories, but that skip the tiny Harry stage of 1st-3rd year. I enjoy trying to piece together what happened then from how the characters are acting now. Exceptions will be made for truly excellent stuff. No slash, smut, or crack fics please.


** linkffn(An Unfound Door) ^{^{^{bot}}} ^{^{^{pls}}} Not that long of a story yet but does a great job of letting you find out the changes instead of just listing them out.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]]: Fudge tried to appease Voldemort after Year 4 by selling out Muggleborns, leading to a brutal civil war after Year 5. Muggleborn resistance groups, the Ministry, and Voldemort were all fighting each other. In the latest chapter, the war seemed to spread to other countries.

**** My story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron]["Patron"]] starts at year 4, and is a very obvious AU. Very different society.

All my stories are AUs, some more than others. If you like piecing together the background, then you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water]["Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water"]] - it is set after an alternate war against Voldemort, and how that happened is one half of the plot.
