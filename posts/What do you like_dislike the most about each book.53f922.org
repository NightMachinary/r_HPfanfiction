**** The major one is Hogwarts population vs house population vs UK wizarding population.

So 5 boys and 5 girls in each house/year means 40 kids in each year. Over 7 years that means total students at Hogwarts would be 280, with 40 leaving each year.

But a) JKR has kiiiiinda explained this by saying Harry's year group and the ones close would have a smaller intake than usual because people were trying to avoid having kids because hey, war!

Also bear in mind that the average wizard lives a lot longer than the average Muggle and, from what we have seen, remains comptia-mentis till a later age. And so a slowly ageing, capable population needs fewer young wizards to sustain itself. Add to that the fact that wizards are less likely to die in freak accidents, and have much more advanced healing resources.

And c) JKR herself said her maths isn't the best. So it's up to us to fill in the blanks - she'll make the magic happen, we'll deal with the logistics.

Gryffindor hadn't won the House Cup or Quidditch Cup since Charlie Weasley graduated. He graduated the year before Harry and Ron started so therefore Gryffindor should be in possession of both.

Maybe how Hermione needed a Time Turner to attend all five electives, even though there was no reason any of those classes should conflict? After all, students could select any combination of electives. There was never a rule about 'if you're taking Divination, you can't take Arithmancy'.

That's how they run their second schedule and it also might explain why some of them appear much older than they should given the long lifetimes of powerful wizards.

This makes the idea of handing a Turner to Hermione a bit more plausible, too.

** I would add more occasional mentions of what they had been studying in class. Here's the problem: the characters know a lot more about magic than the readers do, and the readers don't even know how much the characters know.

So we have fics where Harry is discovering the real workings of magic post-OotP, after he's already been at school for 5 years. Authors write that because we the reader have never had much of magic explained to us, but that doesn't mean the characters don't know it. Realistically, Harry is at a school where he spends the majority of his time learning about magic and gets pretty good grades. By the time 6th year comes around he must have a pretty good, comprehensive understanding of how magic works and be able to do most tasks with it.

For example, he should be able to transfigure most objects into most other objects, though perhaps not on first try. The exceptions being the NEWT curriculum, which seems to consist of human transfiguration, conjuration, animation. That still leaves a lot of things he /can/ do. And yet authors frequently write fics where Harry has to more or less learn magic from scratch despite being in 5th year or so.

The problem is that while Harry is studying magic and getting better at it, we the reader have no real sense of this happening. Just by dropping a few mentions here and there - detailed exposition is not required - we would have a much greater sense of this and perhaps the whole genre of "training over the summer" fics would never have existed.

The worst example of this is HBP, during which the only mentions of magic we have are to Harry struggling with it, especially non-verbal magic. The message this sends is that Harry has basically wasted the year in magical terms, made very little progression, and is barely competent.

And yet from the opening of DH we see Harry casting new, powerful spells we never had any idea he was learning. We see him successfully using non-verbal magic. We see him duel Death Eaters on fair terms and beating the vast majority of them on the basis of his own skill rather than luck. We see him perform relatively complex Charms work on the campsite. Clearly HBP /wasn't/ a wasted year. He must have learnt a lot of magic in that time, and was much more than barely competent.

But we never got a sense of that and spent the entirety of HBP in needless frustration with Harry not doing anything to prepare himself or take the war seriously because we didn't get told what he was doing.

** This might be unpopular, but Voldemort would stay dead or ideally not exist. The series wouldn't be about a prophecy or anything, but a character driven exploration of the magical world. HP has a great setting, and Voldemort is not an opponent who needed to fill as many books as he did. The absence of Voldemort is one of the reasons why the third book is my favorite.

I would write mostly about school, a bit about the world outside etc. I would expand on the subjects and classes, friendship, dorm life, and the adventures would be more Fred and George type rather than life threatening.

** I think you were asking for more of a book-by-book breakdown while most people broke it down for you by the series as a whole, so I will try to get you the former:

1) Philosopher's Stone- The major thing I dislike is the super neglect that Harry gets from the Dursley's. Either that shit should've been stomped out, Harry would've been removed, or it would've been more of a story. You see it on the periphery throughout the story with how Harry acts throughout the series (how close he gets to the Weasleys as a sub family, his constant self-doubt, his heartbreak with Sirius's death, a few other things), but the issue is never directly addressed.

Chamber of Secrets- Lockhart is almost too big of an idiot. Lucius Malfoy getting a slap on the wrist basically for putting a horcrux in the school. Hagrid getting hauled off to AZKABAN for zero evidence that he did anything.

Prisoner of Azkaban- It really is a fun story, but the introduction of a time turner means there are so many logical things that should have been done that weren't. The #1 thing is Dumbledore going back with Harry and Hermione to save Sirius/CAPTURE PETTIGREW. But I get that Pettigrew's escape is the setup for the Dark Lord's return. Another more realistic thing is to introduce Ron/Hermione's interests more at this point. I know it's hinted at some in the books but as I'll complain in the next one, there's no reason there interest should have been delayed.

Goblet of Fire- No EFFING WAY Hermione has any interest in Krum apart from him showing her interest, and even that I think she'd find more annoying than anything (not to mention back in book 2 how ridiculous her falling for Lockhart is. I can see at the beginning but after the first week or two of lessons Hermione should've hated him for lack of actual learning she was receiving).

Order of the Phoenix- I always have hated the death of Sirius (I love JK's original idea of killing Arthur. I know, I'm so sorry). So I guess if I change anything it's that Sirius friggin explains the two-way mirrors to Harry.

Half-Blood Prince- I actually really really love this book. It grew on me and it does such a great job of advancing the story. In this book I believe we get our first non-Harry chapters (all are from Harry's POV except I believe the first chapter of Philosopher's Stone which contains Baby Harry). I wish JK had maybe expanded on that a bit. The Other Minister and Spinner's End were great chapters and just shows that JK has a great ability to write about the Harry Potter Universe without Harry's perspective. As much as we all love Harry I think this is the appropriate point in the story to deviate more from him.

Deathly Hallows- Expanding on that, I'd love (and love seeing in fanfiction) a more comprehensive battle story. Show me what is going on, who is fighting who, how people died (I know, sadistic), etc. The Battle is more than Harry v. Voldemort. It's everyone who has stood by Harry and other who just want the good in the world to win v. Death Eaters and evil. Give me as many quality chapters on the battle as you can, from many different perspectives.

***** I don't think they are quite that capable of learning, though, what with them being ... well, who they are: Vernon is a bigot, Petunia is characterised by her envy for Lily, Dudley is ... an educational experiment of theirs gone wrong. Oh, they could be forced instead, yes, but that might or might not have negated the whole “blood protection” thing so heck knows if it's a possibility. It doesn't necessarily make sense depending on how you look at the whole issue, but that's what we have fanfiction for.

That said, my headcanon for the whole “abused and nobody reacts” thing is that the wizarding children have their files somewhere in the Ministry of Magic that are charmed so that whenever they interact with muggles and the muggles have to check something in their files the files provide them with information that would cause them to take as little interest in it as possible---and for bonus points there might also be stuff actually causing the muggles to remove information out of those files about it and then forget it afterwards, like a Confundus or something similar---so for example when a wizard is caught driving recklessly the files would cause the ticket to somehow disappear and nobody would remember, and for another example when a young wizard (like Harry) gets mistreated the files would lose paperwork added to them that could cause the kid to be put into the spotlight (there being a trial for their guardians due to mistreatment would undoubtedly do that). If that were the case then it could very well be that Harry did actually try to complain about his treatment to someone at school, who then relayed it further, and then because someone (the teacher, or whoever) was actually inquiring about the investigation the files returned not that nobody ever said anything (because that would be suspicious) but rather that the investigation (which hasn't happened) returned nothing worrisome; with such a turn of events that could lead to the person Harry went to thinking that he is a liar, which would be the seed upon which Petunia would build his reputation as a ruffian.

No kidding, if I was on my 4th teacher in as many years in any subject and the only one of the first three who didn't end up almost killing me (even if one of them was by accident) tried to wipe my memory, I would've been a lot more suspicious of the fourth one.

Hmm, there's a good idea for a fic; after the impostor Moody suggests that somebody put Harry's name in the goblet hoping to get him killed, Harry makes a crack about his luck with DADA professors and things spiral out of control from there.

** Scenes that I wouldn't change:

- PS - entering Diagon Alley

- CoS - Lockhart steals Ron's wand and is self-defeated

- PoA - Harry's Patronus to save Sirius

- GoF - Riddle's return in the graveyard, though I'd have him explain why he had to wait to get Harry then rather than capture him during a Hogsmeade visit

- OotP - the Dementor attack in Surrey

- HBP - the Cave, though Dumbeldore explaining some of his tricks would make him seem more like an educator/mentor

- DH - With Harry believed dead, Neville still defies Voldemort, proving that the Sorting Hat was right about him all along

Things I would tell JKR to change:

- Use the real-world calendar- 1st September isn't always Sunday. Or dump the use of weekdays as a reference- perhaps the wizarding world operates on moon cycles: "See you Sunday!" "What?" "She means second Gibbous descending."

- Hermione isn't given the Time Turner by professorial fiat- she solves a long-standing mystery that leads her to it; her use of it wouldn't be approved (though it wouldn't need to be since there is no reason any of the third year classes should conflict); she leverages it until the end of the year, when making a change to past events (Sirius' soul being stolen) causes it to break- or maybe that's how they change things- usually the turn back is only for observation, but by Turning back and breaking it, they are given a second chance. There is still a Time room at the DoM, but the Unspeakables obviously don't have the key to making a traveling device like the one Hermione found.

- Lily invented the Wolfsbane draught for Remus and published the formula anonymously at James' suggestion (and Sirius' protestations)- because Lily was awesome, and that would be evidence of it.

- The Goblet of Fire is the tournament trophy. It has unique divining properties valued by all three schools. Throughout the fourth book Harry has nightmares of the Cup, always feeling its presence threatening his future.

- The Order of the Phoenix is heard to implement several operations of mixed outcome; they're there when Voldemort opens up Azkaban and are involved with tracking recruited Death Eaters based upon Harry's memories of the graveyard.

- During Half-Blood Prince, Harry goes out of Hogwarts on day-trips with Order members, particularly Albus as he hunts for evidence of Riddle's method for immortality. Sometimes it's Harry's lonely upbringing which helps him identify with Riddle and find key clues; other times it just proves painfully educational

- Redo the Battle of Seven Potters to not use ridiculous tactics and instead display Harry's talent for improvisation during battle; I would have set up a reason why returning to Privet drive was necessary. I would have had Moody, Tonks and Lupin show up at his door a week early of a sudden and have them shuffle Harry and the Dursleys out, creating a running battle where Harry is pursued on a broom. Vernon protests too long and gets murdered despite Petunia urging him to go along, then the surviving two Dursleys get disapparated to a safe place. All sorts of hijinks could ensue as Harry tries to find a quiet place to get a breath and escape to safety, knowing that any spell or attempt at apparation would be detected.

- Hedwig would have died saving him from a killing curse as in the movie- because that's the right way to do it. Hedwig's death was the symbol of Harry's departure from childhood, but she deserved a better death than being treated like an action figure accessory.

- Similarly, the end battle is a bit too much of a cartoonish showdown with bad dialogue between Harry and Voldemort.

In the realm of overall changes, I would have made certain Ron was more than comedic relief- he should have been a paragon of loyalty as he demonstrated in the early books. It would make the turn in bok seven more of a surprise instead of 'Really? Again?' Also, he ought to make regular comments of 'Of course that's the way it works in magical society', particularly about things that aren't purely factual, like biases and tendencies and grooming habits. In particular, Ron should have been the cook during the last book, and his departure really a blow to Harry and Hermione's ability to endure the camping.

**** You have a story which centers around a cup... except there were two cups. I'm surprised her editor didn't keep asking her 'but why is the goblet separate from the trophy?' Assuming you merge the two and we're still putting the fix on Harry by making him compete, the cup has to have magical properties of divination, in being able to discern the best witch or wizard in a school solely on the basis of their handwriting.

From my perspective, making the Goblet a near-sapient thing not unlike Arthur's car or the Elder wand would give it some true suspense/gravitas.

I would even suggest that the Goblet is somehow needed along with Harry to enable Voldemort's reconstitution. So many different ways that the thematic value could have been amped up, but instead we have 'that stupid chalice of choosing' which is later ignored once used, coupled with 'the shiny thing that we'll fill with butterbeer and dump on Dumbledore when we win- HEY!

** While there are many changes that could have huge effects through butterflies there are some simple changes that I believe could be made without actually changing anything.

Have Harry live in the smaller bedroom from the start. The reason it wouldn't change anything is because Harry doesn't act like someone who lived in a cupboard his whole life and the Dursley's don't act like people who would keep a child in a cupboard. This would have probably reduced the amount of abused Harry we have since I assume most people just think that anyone horrible enough to do that would also beat the kids.

Don't just put Hagrid in Azkaban. The right to due process is older than the Statute of Secrecy, and while trials could have been "expedited" during the war, it makes no sense during the second book when Dumbledore is still supposed to have some power as the Chief Warlock. Just having him arrested and awaiting trial somewhere else should be enough to remove him.

There should be either some kind of restriction or tracking on Hermione's time turner. This wouldn't affect her normal use and Dumbledore could hide its use right at the end instead of the Ministry giving teenagers a whole year of unrestricted time shenanigans.

I was about to talk about the tournament prize being too small considering the amount of trouble just setting up must create but then looked at the values again and realized I should stop thinking about any of this.

**** i think its not as simple as that explanation. I'm sure that's what she said, but I doubt that motivation, although I'm sure its a great result or secondary factor.

Mainly, you can see the transition between novel styles from the 3rd and 4th book, when JKR and co. decided to stop the Baby-Sitter's Club-esque series synopsis intro (Harry's background, etc) that is (and was then) notorious in children's fiction series'. The decision to drop the cookie cutter intro came after 3 installations in the series, meaning they consciously retained it even after the success of book 2 because they were still going after the demographic that this type of introduction was used. It's clear that this decision was made based on the new plot/direction of JKR, the book's popularity --> wider and older target demo, and supported by an impending/completed movie deal based on fame metrics that would have solidified the estimated success of the book (by the publisher)

Another thing to consider is the state of children's fantasy at the time (the 90's) and how fellow genre books were written. It's clear that things like Harry's upbringing and the role certain institutions (e.g. Azkaban, as someone previously mentioned in regards to Hagrid getting sent there) play in the story are very black and white, made to look intimidating and have more of a symbolic role in the child's interpretation of whatever the book presented, which in this example are authority figures (Dursley's, Azkaban, etc).

The transition at the very least had a jerky shove forward, and from a meta standpoint looks to me like you have to separate HP in 1-3 and 4-7, deriving from genre customs, publisher-editor-author decisions, and demo-targeting.

So I guess to get to what Starfox5 is talking about, HP and its early writing sources and styles are highly contemporary, and sit outside the YA genre in its early years because YA sat outside fantasy (for the most part), with Jerry Spinelli books being the contrasting example that defining the YA genre at the time. So either HP stays a child's series, or transitioned into a YA series. JKR wanted to write PS that way (children's book way), and JKR would have to have been in an entirely different mindset to have started the series as a YA series. Unless I'm missing something, wizards and witches acting as they do in HBP was unimaginable in the genre [that HP occupies] when JKR was shopping her book in the mid-90s.

I get your sentiment, and I wholly feel it, but this is why I think that its a complaint that, for lack of better words, can't be fixed because it's only partially in JKR's control (as in, even if she imagined the future of YA and specifically YA-fantasy that she achieved in HBP (aka historically non-stereotypical wizard-witch behavior to the extent that its in HBP), she couldn't have achieved that and completed that when she started out).

** What I like most about the books, is the idea of a magical world. Sometimes, I think, what if there're truly a society out there who are keeping themselves secret?

It's a type of fascination like reading Robert Langdon's adventures & thinking if it were true!

** I think overall I would make Dumbledore a lot more active in the role of guardian and guide of Harry, to the point of Harry seeing him as some sort of grandfather and definitely as rolemodel. Instead of readying him for the slaughter (cynical, I know), Albus starts to draw the abilities and strengths out of Harry in a way suitable for a child. Following that Dumbledore would also take a more active role in ensuring that Harry has bearable summers at Privet Drive until he may leave for another house to enjoy the rest of his summer.

Also, I would make it Harry/Hermione because that was what I wanted to happen in the first place. That would also require for Harry and Hermione to find some sort of connection (that I as a first-time reader often assumed, as I heavily identified with Harry and subsequently projected a lot of my own values and wishes onto his character), which would again come from Harry's closeness to Dumbledore and the resulting interest in magic that is beyond curriculum. Harry and Hermione being closer would change the outcomes of several scenes and situations, most importantly the short relationship of Rons with Lavender and the days in the tent they spent alone with each other.

I'd also change the epilogue to something that doesn't feature a Harry that became an Auror. I'd much rather see a Harry that became a Healer, (one fic that is definitely still in the pipeline is the Harry & Neville Healer combo that sets out to heal Neville's parents) or maybe a professional Quidditch player. Also he wouldn't be calling any of his children "Severus". I mean what kind of message is that? "Hey son, you're named after a person that was basically responsible for the misery of my first 2 decades of life".

** I would make following changes:

1. The Prophecy is becoming a ridiculously overused cliche/plot device in fictions. Anything from LOTR to Star Wars to the Matrix to the Percy Jackson tried to play with a prophecy. It's getting sickening! Instead, I would have auror teams Potter-Longbottom getting something seriously critical from Voldemort, who then sworn above all else to destroy them. The something critical would later indeed lead to Voldemort's downfall.

2. The aftermath of CoS was too hushed up. You had a creature of Mass Destruction running loose in your ONLY school, and there had been zero follow-up investigations?

3. The Moody impersonation plot was ridiculous. A few security questions from Dumbledore could blow up the entire scheme, leading to Barty being kissed by dementor and his master to capture. You might say Barty could ask Moody, but it would be impossible to cover all venues of security questions and the risk would be just too high. Barty Jr would have it a lot easier to impersonate his dad, while still having direct access to the Goblet, being present at each event, and avoiding detection through Marauder's Map.

4. None of that Flight of 7 Potters non-sense. They all knew the date of move was from Dumbledore and Snape was comprised. So, the correct way to move was to take Harry immediately off the Hogwarts Express, and side-along him to a Fidelius location OUTSIDE Britain.

5. The Wedding should be held at bride's place. In addition, they knew the security situation in Britain was rapidly deteriorating, and it would totally irresponsible to subject bride's family to that risk. Delacours were supposed to be important in France, and they could afford even better protection at their place. If the Death Eaters dared to attack there, it would amount to an international incident and might bring in France as an ally into the war.

** Its a great world full of possibilities, else we wouldn't have so much Fanfiction. What I would change is the numbers on a lot of things as talked about in several other posts but also a better focus on some of the background characters.

As far as the reader is aware Harry has barely ever spoken to Ginny before book 6 when he basically decides he likes her, they finally get together for all of two weeks before they split. Somehow that was enough for him to miss her for a year and then the epilogue says get them back together. Fine I can understand I guess but please some more details on her character wouldn't be hard. There are often things that seem great or characters who when you stop and think don't make sense and I guess thats what I would explore.

** I would add more backstory for Lily because I find it improbable that no living character would know her, especially given she had barely graduated the high school her son attends ten years later when she died. Also that Harry wouldn't be the slightest bit curious about his mother, especially when he meets Slughorn who is always eager to talk about her.

More older people. Wizards are canonically long-lived, but the only old characters we come across are Dumbledore, Flamel and his wife, Voldemort, Neville's gran and Ron's great aunt Muriel. McGonagall in the original books had dark hair and was meant to be middle aged, not a much older woman as she is in the films.

In terms of book specifics I don't like really much about HBP at all; I think it could do with better editing. I think Lupin's characterization was clumsily handled at times. I think Harry's anger in HBP and OOTP was justified, but it wasn't made clear enough to readers why at times. Just one character understanding even a little would have helped to not make Harry, who's just been through a lot of trauma, seem cruel and crazy. On that point; a hot chocolate for Ginny after being possessed for the whole year, kidnapped and nearly killed has always seemed negligent. At least send her to the nurse!

** Make Harry more powerful, I understand a lot of people hate to see a Gary Sue MC and I understand that perfectly, but what makes people think that Harry needs to be a Gary Sue to be powerful? I never understood how Harry grew up living with Muggles, but when it came down to learning about magic, he barely paid enough attention to write a page with.

Describe 'Magic' in a better way, while JK crafted spells well and she made a variety of cool and useful ones that we never knew we wanted, she completely neglected to mention certain aspects of magic. 1) What does it feel like when you use magic? How do different magicks effect their users? and most importantly, where does it come from? 2) Wandless Magic? Why add something that useful into a series, but the MC doesn't attempt to learn it? Not only could it be very useful in tight spots, it could also allow insight into that relatively unknown branch of magic. Of course, I understand that not all of the magical theory etc... could make it into the books as JK had a show to run, but that doesn't excuse not making spin-offs about it or even using Pottermore to get that info across.

*** Or at least consistently powerful: Early on his Patronus can blast lots of dementors and he's so good at defence that NEWT students want to be taught by him when he has 4th year knowledge. Later he gets easily outduelled by Snape and caught by snatchers. Wtf?

**** IKR! The snatchers are people who didn't even get a full magical education (most of them being Hogwarts and Durmstrang drop outs) and they somehow manage to out duel Harry (who by 7th year knew more spells than most high-level death eaters or at least, non-lethal spells, I never understood why JK decided to into the whole "Harry is not a saint" thing before Deathly Hallows came out, if he wasn't willing to kill).

While HBP was probably my 2nd-3rd favourite book (depending on what day you ask me), it felt like one big "Oops, I forgot" by JKR. /Dumbledore grabs and puts on a ring that was most likely warded to the brim/. /Harry suddenly forgets every single piece of Occlumency he ever learned/. /Snape somehow manages to use Legillimency on Harry, despite Harry not looking him in his eyes/. /Harry forgets he can do non-verbal magic, and has done it multiple times before and after this point./

I sometimes think she used Deathly Hallows to correct her mistakes, "Oh, Oh! Look Dumbledore is human too! Definitely didn't learn anything in the past 150 years he has been alive after the duel with Grindelwald and Abeforth". "Dumbledore was gay", why did she feel the need to say so? It doesn't change anything and it doesn't make anything different. I always liked to think in my mind that he was asexual or just plain didn't think about that stuff (Too busy learning an ancient charm from 5000 years ago to get some).
