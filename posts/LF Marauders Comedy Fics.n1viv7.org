I have never read a marauders fic, mostly because I can't stand the tropes in most of them but atm I'm in the mood for a good marauders adventure/comedy story. My only request is that it's well-written. Thank you in advance!


** linkao3(Marauders Wagers by JanuaryGrey) is a good laugh üòä. Short oneshot.

Linkao3(Let it Choke by TheDivineComedian) is also quite funny. It's about Remus Lupin mostly so not Marauders but the author does write other Marauder stories, all of which are very well written so I suggest you check them out.

  Each of the Marauders supports a different team in the British and Irish Quidditch League, which leads to a series of increasingly ridiculous wagers on matches over the course of their years at Hogwarts.

  Remus Lupin certainly knew what he should do: Keep his distance. Reassure Susan that running from the Boggart was perfectly fine and understandable. Have her write ‚ÄúI will not skip Defence Against the Dark Arts‚Äù five hundred times and then send her on her way, ensuring that whatever issues she had would be dealt with in the proud tradition of the wizarding world: Through avoidance and denial.Except he knew where that path lead.And if he ever wanted to help the Boy Who Lived With Terrible Memories, he should probably start heading down a different one.

** Plenty of people here swear by ‚ÄúAll The Young Dudes‚Äù linkao3(10057010), but I haven't read it.

I am in the middle of ‚ÄúThe Three Sisters‚Äù by mumuinc (no Anton Chekhov involved) linkao3(29799375), and I am still not sure what to think (except it should be severely cut down in length, but that's problem of most fanfictions out there).

And I really like ‚ÄúFlowers by the Wayside‚Äù by TalaRae linkao3(23090008).

Both of the latter ones are The Work in Progress, but there is really a progress there, they are continuously published.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Aunt Petunia gasped her pain out against Holly's clammy neck even as she turned, her head lolling, to glare hatefully at Bellatrix. ‚ÄúYou will not take her. My sister---‚Äú‚Äú---is dead, little muggle,‚Äù said Bellatrix. ‚ÄúAs will you if you do not give us Potter.‚ÄùHolly's heart constricted for the space of half a heartbeat. Aunt Petunia did not want her. She'd gotten Uncle Vernon killed. She'd brought the war to their doorstep. She'd---‚ÄúOver my dead body, you stupid witch!‚Äù Aunt Petunia gasped, her arms convulsively twitching around Holly's shoulders, her nails digging into her skin. ‚ÄúYou've killed my sister, my husband... I---I won't let you kill my niece too!‚ÄùBellatrix laughed loudly, a loud maniacal cackle that seemed to fill Holly's world with fire and brimstone. ‚ÄúOn your head be it. Avada Kedavra!‚Äù

#+begin_quote
  After her husband is unfaithful and her cookie-cutter perfect world is turned on its head, Petunia Evans Dursley finds herself in her old hometown, full of regrets and feeling that her life has been without purpose. Before she can quietly take her own life, she is given an impossible offer by a long-dead figure from the magical world: return to the past, and rewrite her own history. Seeing it as a chance to make up for her biggest regret, Petunia accepts and finds herself in the middle of a Wizarding war she knew little about, protecting the younger sister she tried to forget by seeking help from the one person in the magical world she knows how to find.A what-if story beginning in the latter years of the first war against Voldemort, where an unlikely alliance turns into an even more unlikely romance, and the bonds that bloom from it will change the course of Wizarding history.
