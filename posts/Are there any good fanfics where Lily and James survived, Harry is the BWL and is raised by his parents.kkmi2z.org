It would be also cool if the Marauders are involved in his life, Sirius doesn't die and Harry is very powerful


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]] meets all your criteria except there are no BWLs in this fic. James and Lily got Voldemort that night with a nasty trap

** linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has most of that, except that there is no prophecy and no boy-who-lived. Tom Riddle went into politics instead of war, so less people died but non-Purebloods are officially banned from Hogwarts and from many types of employment.

But all the Marauders survived, as you say; Sirius even has a son. And Harry is indeed powerful, except that that's both blessing and curse; it draws more attention to her than she can really afford.

The author has done an excellent job of weaving canon elements into a really original story.

**** Enjoy! Book four has one chapter to go. NB The series is really long; book 1 is the shortest.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.
