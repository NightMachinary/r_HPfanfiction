Like maybe he wants to be immortal or rule the world or whatever I'm so fucking done with sifting through all the self-righteous bullshit in the Dark!Harry genre.


** I just want a Harry that hates muggleborns tbh.

I don't understand how so many people can write Dark!Harry fics where he absolutely despises Muggles and wants to eradicate/subjugate them, but since he's fine with Muggleborns they go "See he's not racist".

If Harry is raised by Voldemort and the Death Eaters, he's not gonna jump at the chance to befriend Hermione (who was pretty annoying in Book 1). And I've seen tons of justifications for this, ranging from "haha my dad is gonna hate it when he finds out I'm friends with a muggleborn" (forgetting his father is the Dark Lord who's entire movement is based around murdering muggleborns and who tortures even his most loyal if they piss him off). Then there's the classing "What Hermione is secretly Bellatrix's daughter?!" in which case she drops her muggle parents like hot potatoes and hooks up with her cool new pureblood family.

Then there's the classic "If muggleborns are inferior, why is Granger the smartest in our year? Clearly this one first year girl being good at schoolwork completely disproves every single Pureblood belief in Pureblood superiority.". This one pisses me off the most. One girl who can memorize her textbooks isn't gonna convince a kid raised by Death Eaters that all muggleborns are just hunkey dory. You know what will happen? The Death Eater kid will just convince himself that he's still right. Maybe Granger earns so many points because the staff are muggle lovers? Maybe she's only so good at classwork because she's so disgusting that even other Mudbloods won't talk to her.

It just triggers me so god damn much. I want to read a fic where Harry is the lowest scum in the world, but /every damn time/ I get close, the author will make him a demented fuck who throws crucio's at allies and terrifies Dementors and sacrifices muggle babies but /racism is a step too far/.

Give me my evil!Dark!Harry goddammit.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
