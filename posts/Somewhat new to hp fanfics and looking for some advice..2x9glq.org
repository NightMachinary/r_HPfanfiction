Hello everyone. I have read hp and the nightmares of futures past and hpmor and I'm waiting for new chapters. Are there any other preferably long hp fanfics where harry and/or other wizards are acting more rationaly than in canon and using magic in optimal ways? The protagonist doesnt have to b harry. Thank you in advance. Edit: One of my problems seems to be the shear amount of fanfics making it really hard to know where I should start.


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183][Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty]]/ (300k words, last updated 20 days ago): A munchkinny wizard from /Dungeons & Dragons/ is transported into the /Harry Potter/ universe.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10636246][Following the Phoenix]]/ (200k words, complete): This is a fanfiction of HPMoR itself, splitting off at Hermione's trial.

[[/r/rational]] is dedicated to stories of this sort in all fandoms.

If you're having trouble sifting through the zillions of stories, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][sorting by number of favorites]] is always a good idea.

**** IIRC, the point of divergence is that the galleon exchange doesn't happen and Hermione goes to Azkaban.

** There are a couple that are enjoyable but are pretty much Gary Stu stories (there's not much conflict). They were the fanfic i liked most right after HPNofP and HPMoR

Runemaster : Harry discovers runes and becomes God with some help by conveniently friendly goblins [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster]]

Core Threads : Harry IS God , (in the later chapters _ [[/spoiler][HARRY EATS SOULS FFS]] ) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads]]

** A great place to start would be to decide what you want to read about within fan fiction. For example- are you looking for specific pairings? Do you want to read something canon compliant or AU? Do you love a specific character and want to read a piece where they get more attention? Fanfiction.net has a great search engine that allows you to get really specific about your desires once you figure the out.

Here are a few I like:

After the End: Canon compliant, post DH. Complete.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End]]

Promises Unbroken (and it's sequels): AU. Sirius Black remains the Potter's secret keeper and all he feared comes to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Voldemort remains and Harry goes to Hogwarts. Complete.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1248431/1/Promises-Unbroken]]

Roundabout Destiny: AU. Hermione is cast back to the Marauder's era where she is Hermione Potter, James' twin sister. She retains Hermione Granger's memories and is determined to change her brother's life for the better. HG/SB pairing. Complete

Hope you find something you like. Happy reading!
