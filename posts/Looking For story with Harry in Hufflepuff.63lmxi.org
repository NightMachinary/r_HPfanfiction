I'm looking for a story that has Harry in Hufflepuff. I know for sure that the story included the Hufflepuff dorms being apartments, and Harry lives with Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, and Tonks. I seem to recall that one of the things that happens includes a concert/recital series at Hogwarts that starts up because one of the Hufflepuff girls is a very good singer. I can't remember if it's on ffnet or AO3.


** [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10086764/1][Harry Potter-Coming Out on Top]] also has a Hufflepuff Harry who was semi-adopted by Amelia Bones and grew up with Susan,Hannah and Nymphadora.

Edited for gross crimes against fanfiction everywhere.

**** The defendant pleads guilty on all charges and retracts his recommendations.

The defendant would also like the court to know his misdemeanours shall not happen again.

The defendant would further like to apologise for his poor taste in recommendations.

***** The defendant has been deemed guilty on all charges.

The defendant has, and I quote the chief justice, "got a hella dough and besides he said sorry"

The defendant has been sentenced to jack shit.

The court of HHR and Lunar Harmony would like to thank all attending and bid thee farewell as well as a personal recommendation of not getting caught in the process of jacking shit.

  Being raised only by his Aunt, Harry comes to Hogwarts not only knowing about the Wizarding World, but with a kind of training no one at the school is expecting. Chapter 30 up

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
