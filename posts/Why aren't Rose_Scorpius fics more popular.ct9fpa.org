**** I hate Cursed Child for a lot of reason, from Harry "it's ok to be a Slytherin" who can't handle Albus is Slytherin to Snape "I'm proud he carries my name", and let's not forget "Cedric become a Death Eater because he did bad in the tournament".

But concerning the Scorbus ship, as well as the Scorose one (it's always a good idea to make a ship sound like a disease), it kinda looked like a second chance for the failed ships of canon :\\
You people loved the Drary ship and are dissapointed Harry is with Ginny (and Draco with Astoria I guess)? Here's Draco Jr and Harry Jr (who both look like clone of their father) who always seem 2s away to snog each other.\\
And if you are more for the Draco/ Hermione ship (no idea how this one is called), here's Rose. As smart as her mother, also Gryffindor, and Scorpius just love her (as he always say when he is not busy explaining to Albus why he is the only reason he managed to go this far and he complete him or something like that).

***** Gee, it was a simple joke, you know? I'm not against Scorbus shippers or even it becoming official, I'm just joking about the fact that my OTP was pretty popular some years ago and it is not anymore thanks to CC. Do I need to repeat it was a JOKE?

Btw, I find it a little bit exhausting how people almost always believe shipping Scorpius and Rose means we also ship Dramione (Draco/Hermione). I've never shipped those two and I seriously doubt I'll ever do. In my personal case, I ship Scorose just because I think they have a lot of potential (as long as you ignore CC) to make a great love story with a Romeo and Juliet style. Yeah, I agree Scorpius having a crush on her doesn't make sense at all in CC. But I honestly don't care because I just pretend CC doesn't exist (for a long number of reasons, not just the shipping), and I never read fics where CC is canon. Same with writing, in fact.

********* I think I already explained myself in several comments through this thread. Now I'm curious as to why you seem to be so bothered at someone liking Scorose. I insist, if you're not into it, it's ok, so why it isn't ok to like it? Care to enlighten me?

********** To put it very blatantly, I quite liked the cursed child and as you may know, it did not handle the ship well, or Rose, as a matter of fact. Had it written Scorose properly, I would have considered the ship but it felt like such as cop out and... well.. I guess over the past few days I've come to the conclusion that CC Scorose and non CC Scorose are kind of different ships in itself. So I apologise for all my comments on this chat because I sort of mistook this thread for CC Scorose which is not what it is. I was wrong and I'm sorry. Scorose has grown into sub-divisions and I didn't get that at first, now I do. Hoping you had a very Harry Christmas, signed, Scorbus Trash. (I say that not passive aggressively)

*********** Lol happy harry christmas to you too! I'd just like to point out that we should all be respectful with other people's ships, even if we don't like them. I certainly dislike a lot too how Scorrose was portrayed in CC and I don't read CC canon fics, but if if someone else likes it, good for them! As long as we're not into something pretty weird than involves "unethical" stuff, like pedophilia or something, it's ok to like different ships.

** Partly its the fandom aging. Not that no young people read or watch it anyone but its not the same as it was when the series was ongoing the ones in the fandom who started as teens are now adults. So the ones who write fic may choose to write some more about the characters growing with them rather than the next generation.

Partly it might be a lack of interest in that generation. There is less known about them than there is about Harrys generation. If you arent using cursed child canon then you are essentially starting from scratch and making an entire cast. Even with basing it on cursed child its very limited content compared to the series.

And partly it might be because of Cursed child. The Rose/Scorpius dynamic people craved might not be possible the way these characters were done. Or perhaps you shipped something else more as a result of Cursed Child. Or perhaps because many disliked cursed child it made you want to avoid the new gen all together.

*** About the fandom aging, I dunno if it's just me, but I feel like the whole fandom in general is less active than before. I remember when all the FF forums were full of life and now most of them are dead as hell. However, I don't read FF that much (and when I do, I usually look for very specific types of stories), so I'd like to know if it's just my impression that there are less fics in general.

On your second point, you're pretty much right. Some people might see it as a good thing (I do, because then I feel those characters are a blank page and I can work with them as if they were my own characters), but I understand some others just wanna see the same ol' guys they already know. In fact, and just as a quick add up, I'd LOVE to see more fics about unkown characters, like some random wizard from another country or unimportant characters like Armando Dippet.

And yes, I'm convinced CC has something to do with all of this. Scorbus wasn't even half that popular before it was released and I've noticed less and less people use the old dynamics Scorpius/Rose used to have; you know, the "from enemies to lovers" or the "forbidden love" trope.

**** I do think the fandom less active but far from dead it has however moved. FF forums I don't think is where most of the fandom is anymore. They are on discord, twitter, tumblr, reddit etc. So it might also be you might not be going to the places they've moved to.

As much as I don't like Cursed Child I do appreciate for the new character characterization. Scorbus was a thing before as was Rose Scorpius. But it was basically Drarry and Dramione respectively in my experience. With some tweaking with them Scorbus could easily be a Drarry fic and Scorpius Rose could easily be Dramione for many of those past fics.

I still dont like cursed child and am not that attached to the characters. But when I see Scorbus for example I don't think why didn't you just do a AU Drarry story anymore.

But another aspect is people have been interesting on using the HP world as a sorta sandbox one. They want to expand on things outside hogwarts do more outside the school. And thats easier done in fic with a large cast of characters you already know than a much smaller cast you don't.

If you do things in school the appeal is often all the things the kids have to deal with outside school too. Harrys timeline and the Marauders timeline had those societal complications that the next gen just doesn't not compared to other eras. Domestic Hogwarts stuff where they get to relax is a thing. But its appealing as a fic because it lets these normally very stressed characters relax. With the next gen you don't know them well enough for that to be as appealing a concept.

And finally people just aren't that attached to the next gen characters. I wasnt estatic with the epilogue to start with and I didnt care about these characters beyond who they were related to. Cursed child did make a like Scorpius a bit tho it made me dislike ScorRose. But it didn't make me like him enough to want to read fic about him. If I expand on HP characters Id rather do it with characters from Harrys time.

** I am glad for it. The more writers focus on current gen instead of the next gen, the better. As shown by Cursed Child, the next gen sucks in 'canon'.

Scorpius/Rose also feels like a cop out for Draco/Hermione shippers and that makes it feel cheap for me. It's not about these two characters but Draco and Hermione. Scorpius essentially represents Draco's fan on version and Rose represnts Hermione's fan on version.

*** May I ask if there's a specific reason to say that? In all honest, I think there are bad fics everywhere. In fact, and I know this opinion might be a little controversial, there many more bad fics than good ones, regardless of the generation.

About your second point, I won't deny there are a significant bunch of people who see that pairing as a Dramione 2.0. But as I said in another thread here, there also are many other people who don't, myself included. In fact, I've never read a Dramione and I'm not interested in doing so neither (I just can't imagine those two being friends, let alone something else). As I said in the post too, I like Scorpius/Rose just because of its narrative potential. And no, it's not the "bad boy/good girl" trope, I hate those.

**** Don't get me wrong, I don't mind stories that focuses on lesser known characters or different pairings. If I'm not in the mood for them, it's pretty easy to ignore them using ffnet's excellent searching function.

That said I'm just not a fan of anything related to next gen. Cursed Child nailed the coffin shut with it's release though. I just find that since there isn't a Canon to base things upon, the fanon versions of these characters are more wish fullfillment, some disguised self insertion and general bad writing filled with cheesy premises. Not a fan of that. Not that there is anything wrong with that. Just not my thing. Another main reason is, the 19 years later epilogue in itself was one of my least favorite things in canon. It felt like wish fulfillment and those names were fucking horrible (give them some normal names you degenerate)

But yeah, I do have to give you one on the fact that Scorpius and Rose has good narrative potential. For me personally I just don't like the characters enough to get behind on that narrative. Same with Draco honestly. There is a good narrative potential there if a few things were tweaked, but I just don't care enough about Draco to be invested on the narrative.

I just said that I was glad because it would mean more stories focusing on characters I like. I am aware that it's asshole-ish behavior. But hey, we all have flaws. I don't have an issue with stories that are not my thing though. Well, as long as they don't advertise it as one thing and the content has another thing.

***** Yeah, I got you with the wish fullfillment and poor writing thing, and I also feel that happens a lot with the Marauders fics; you know, there always are these couple of mary sues who end up with both Sirius and Lupin and are usually besties with Lily, share a dorm with her or whatever. And I have to admit, even when Scorpius/Rose is my OTP, I dislike most of the third gen fics. Til' the present date, I've only found two fics (one in English and one in Spanish) about them that I actually like, and the one in Spanish doesn't even focus on the pairing. Which I find kinda sad because I think their potential is wasted, mainly thanks to the numerous Dramiones 2.0. (which, as I said, I don't like).

But what can I tell you? I'm also pretty picky and I don't think I've found more than ten fics that I really really love or take seriously, regardless of the generation. In fact, OoC's are soooo common in Harry's generation fics. Like Hermione having petty concerns, Ron being an absolute jerk, Harry sudenly being all that sensitive, Snape hiding a muscular and sexy body. You know, the typical shit. Which I guess is quite normal because most writers on FF are amateurs and teenagers, and writing a good story takes a lot of time, discipline, techniques, knowledge, talent, reading, and why not saying it? Maturity. And well, not everybody with all of that is willing to write FF instead of their own original stories.

Btw, I'm curious to ask you something, and not with the intention of changing your mind but just out of curiosity; if you ran into a well-written Scorpius and Rose story with maturity, good grammar and spelling, good plot, etc., would you like to read it or the fact of being a third gen fic would aready make you dislike it?

** I suspect they are not as popular nowadays due to the cursed child, to put it simply. They were expecting something that they didn't get: A complete clone of Draco and Hermione, which couldn't be further from the truth. It's safe to say they didn't get that, so they blatantly kept doing Dramione fics.
