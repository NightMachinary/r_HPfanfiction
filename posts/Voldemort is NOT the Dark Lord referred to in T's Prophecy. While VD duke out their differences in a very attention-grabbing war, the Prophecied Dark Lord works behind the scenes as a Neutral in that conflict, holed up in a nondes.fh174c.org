And the Prophecied one is not Harry Potter: Boy-Who-Lived. It's that accountant squib cousin of the Weasleys. Or Percy, if one changed his birthday to sometime past mid-September (Septem=7, literally), or mid-July (based off of the Gregorian calendar ordering), or someone else thought maybe a 2-month premature baby born at any time of the year could fit the bill (seven month embryo, born as the seventh month dies). Or, ya know: just a mostly-overlooked somebody in the background who winds up working in the True Dark Lord's circles, unlike the main OP HP cast.

** Heh. I am doing something very similar to this. One of the twists is that there are multiple "Chosen Ones" who throughout history were born under various permutations of the seventh month dying. One is born as the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar ends, etc. I love the idea of the two-month premature birth, though! Mind if I add that in?

*** It was brought up by [[/u/deatheguard][u/deatheguard]] in an earlier post of mine: /"As the Seventh Month Dies"/. I, personally, love the idea. IMO: publicly shared ideas on a prompt thread should be up for adoption, no-fuss. Inspiration is inspiration, from a common source or not. So long as our work remains ours and we don't copy+paste other people's published stuff, all ought be well.

TL;DR: Go right ahead!

** There's really no particular reason the prophecy had to refer to Harry or Neville. The seventh month dying happens, like, annually. The only stipulation is that the prophecy refers to a date in the future, but I don't recall any language which implies it's the immediately upcoming July.

Imagine a story where Voldemort kills Harry, thinks he's ensured his victory, and then next year the /real/ savior is born and no one even pays attention to it.

** I would like to see one where Dumbledore is possibly the Dark Lord without realizing it.The first four years go as cannon and maybe have someone (Sirius or anyone worried about Harry) that Dumbledore nearly killed Harry as many times that Voldemort did. Him being distant from Harry fifth year is him trying to come to terms that the prophecy could be about Harry and him. Take some cannon that marked as equal might not be a psychical scar.(cannon ideas that Harry is the next Dumbledore or being the party not other person to beat a Dark Lord in living memory) Have Dumbledore try to make sure the prophecy end well regardless and have him put on the ring by assuming Harry "handed" him the Diary that led him to search for the horcrouxs.

Basically the story is a manipulate Dumbledore who actually thought he was doing the right things or the best he could. He could be overwhelmed by his jobs to notice the finer details until someone points it out. He wanted Harry to have a place to escape to with a family that wouldn't be out to get his money or use him. He could have asked Molly just to keep a eye out for him knowing how Hagrid is. Using Hagrid could have been a scare tactic against the Dursleys because they might have dismissed Mconogill. He could be delaying telling people about the horcrouxs because he hasn't found a safe way to treat Harry and only has three s might work.

** This reminds me of the first time I finished the first HP book, I was absolutely certain that Dumbledore was going to turn out to be the bad guy ultimately, you know since he deliberately lured Voldemort to the school and all the stuff that happened. In fact I never really got over that impression until the last book came out. I vaguely was thinking that Voldemort was a pawn or some sort of fake.
