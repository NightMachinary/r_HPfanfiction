***** HPMoR is a fic written by someone who, by all appearances, didn't know what a crackfic was. So it combines some serious elements with a fair bit of crack, and the melange is jarring for a lot of people.

Neville approaching the Chaos Throne to discuss spying on first years with Dark Lord Harry is nothing but crack, for instance. But Professor Quirrell's speech while showing Harry the starscape is serious and moving.

#+end_quote

I've read the entire thing and I think it's pants on head crazy. Firstly, the whole Dementors are Death thing isn't canon and that wouldn't bug me if it weren't for the fact that the author refuses to acknowledge that and instead believes that his interpretation is correct. Secondly,

#+begin_quote
  "Patronus 2.0", since that requires the transhumanistic belief that Death can be defeated.
#+end_quote

This is the most pathetic way imaginable to big up your belief in transhumanism. Like we actively mock the whole golden patronus idea on a fairly regular basis, this is far worse. Like would you be up for reading a fic I wrote that said dementors are tools of the devil and the only way to beat them is to have a pure belief in Christ? No, probably not because no one likes having someone elses beliefs shoved on them in that way.

Thirdly, I think transhumanism is stupid.

********* Speak for yourself, but I quite like the idea of dementors being Death. It fits with a lot of the canon portrayal, and makes them into a better foe than if they just carried a /Fear/ aura and had a touch attack that effectively kills you. Even if it isn't canon, it's a neat idea that I hadn't seen before and quite enjoyed - and besides, in strict canon (i.e. the books) it's never explained just what they are anyway. Then again, I generally prefer AU stories anyway.

** In the Firebird trilogy... --- I guess you already know which scene I'm talking about if you've read the thing --- anyway, there is this part where Luna, who's a member of Harry's harem by that point, has to undergo some ill-famed ritual in order to restore her child-bearing abilities. Turns out that the ritual consists of old nasty hags continuously raping her with an oversized magical dildo until she almost bleeds to death.

Another one in the same story was when Luna, as the “1st wive”, invoked a kinda-ritualistic punishment on Hermione for /sleeping with Harry out of her turn/. I know that it hardly compares to the first one, but it was just so OoC for Luna's character that came as completely out of blue for me.

** Oh god- I was reading a fic which was taking a stab at reinventing the way magic works in HP --- using the same spells and such, but adding in magical abilities that passed through bloodlines (such as the Prewett bloodline having some chance to kick out twins whose power is amplified by the other) --- and it was pretty neat stuff. Not well‐told, necessarily, but at least interesting.

And then, out of nowhere, Harry and Ron and Hermione go outside during break and start playing Ultimate Frisbee; Harry throws a hammer into the end‐zone to win the game; they continue as if nothing odd had happened.

I, I was lost after reading that. As an Ultimate player myself, it was the first time I'd seen my sport in creative media, and it was so inappropriate, both in terms of the plot and the setting, that I didn't quite know how to deal with it.

Don't know where the other guy got the football and rugby bits from, since it runs continuously like soccer and there's basically no contact or tackles.

It just got recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee, so they're going to try to petition to get it in the 2022+ games (it probably won't happen).

** In linkffn(Patron by Starfox5), the author re-imagines an HP world with Muggleborn being far more rare and more powerless than in canon, with several knock-on effects. Overall, the story has some interesting elements and seems competently written.

However, the story introduces a weird "Year of Discovery" thing that amounts to sixth year at Hogwarts being accepted widely as a non-stop sex binge, with all the students in that year exploring sexuality in as many different combinations and fetishes as possible. References to said Year of Discovery are made (roughly) every other paragraph, which leads to a tedious read.

As far as I can tell, there's really no plot-related reason for it either. It's just there, a thing to be brought up over and over and...

****** I know what you mean. Funnily enough, when Starfox5 writes in what he believes is a close approximation of canon Potterverse, it comes off more OOC and bashy than what he writes in what he believes is a heavy AU like /Patron/.

******* Canon Potter is a mess with fridge horror moments like soul-sucking demons as prison guards and executions, plot devices that get used once and then forgotten, contrived coincidences, and lots of moments where characters do act ooc so the canon plot doesn't get derailed. Trying to take it seriously led to a number of problems with "Revolution" because canon doesn't make sense. JKR effectively wrecked central characters like Dumbledore and Ron, who act anything but the wise, benevolent powerful wizard or the brave kid willing to die for his friends, especially in the later books. Dumbledore leaving Harry with child abusers, never noticing anything? Never even trying to set things right? Never trying to do what's right instead of easy? Or, even worse, willingly "condemn him to 10 dark years"? That's stupid. The kid who sacrificed himself for his friends in book 1, and was willing to die for Harry in book 3, quitting a vital Mission because food is getting scarce? That's stupid too. I have since then given up on canon, and simply pick and choose what fits the characters I want. Surprisingly, or not so, characters tend to look a lot less ooc if they do not act like in canon. Still, past chapters 7 or so, "Revolution" completely drops the canon stupidity weighing it down.

****** Don't know about his interpretations, but /Patron/ is set in an entirely different world from /Revolution/- very AU compared to the "almost canon though Europe is super-racist" of the other one.

The "Year of Discovery" thing is pretty odd, though. Especially since the characters are in year 4, so it's not likely to be a thing that happens in the fic itself.

Also, Sirius is banging four Veelas to avoid dealing with his PTSD. So that's a (non-explicit) thing.

That's what I find so bizarre. It's PG but sex is talked about all the time and the Year of Discovery is mentioned once a chapter minimum.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

*** I actually really, really like that fic but yeah the Year of Discovery thing is just a really convoluted way to introduce people to compete with Hermione for Harry's love. Like it's not even smut cause there's no smut in the story even though people do talk about sex they're having a lot...it's certainly odd...

*** Ok, so I wasn't sure exactly how serious I should take the "Year of Discovery." It seemed to me like how in the U.S., people act like when you start attending college you'll get super drunk at parties all the time and have tons of sex - not that true for most people.

**** That's exactly what it is. 6th year is the time when students are allowed to have sex, so of course everyone below that year expects that it'll be as much sex as they want. Reality is (for most) quite different, even if the start of the year tends to be quite wild. It's also on teenagers' minds a lot since they do feel some pressure as the year approaches.

*** Keep in mind that each scene of "Patron" - as in all of my stories - is written from the POV of a character. In that, it is subjective, not objective. The "Year of Discovery" gets mentioned so often because teenagers tend to think and talk about sex a lot, and 6th year is when they are officially allowed to have sex. In reality? It's very much overhyped. It's a bit like Spring Break, where, if you hear some accounts, everyone is on one neverending sex and booze binge. It's even a plot point, when Hogwarts students discover that the Durmstrang and Beauxbaton students think they have mandatory orgies in Hogwarts. It's not there to introduce jealousy, it's there to illustrate that in this story, the muggles are the pruder people, and the wizards are the ones who go "eh, kids will be kids, so instead of forcing them to have unsafe sex in broom cupboards, we'll let them have safe sex, as much as they want, without paying for mistakes their entire lives". As indicated in the story, witches will be hitting on Harry anyway, sex or no sex, since they think he'll be picking a pureblood wife for appearance's sake and keep Hermione as his mistress, since that's how it's usually done. Since Harry wasn't raised that way, he won't, by the way. Hermione will also not suddenly discover that she actually likes being thought of as a second-class citizen beholden to Harry.

** Hermione going to church with her super-religious parents, demanding a big catholic church wedding, or praying for help with her...magic...because she's just that religious--multiple stupid fics I had trouble finishing. In a couple of cases, I didn't.

Religion in HP fanfics? Sure. Stupid, listless, shoved-in, Americanized, unexamined religion because the author is religious and just wants it in the story? Biggest possible black mark.

***** Not at all, intelligence has nothing to do with religious belief. Plenty of smart people are religious and plenty of dumb people are irreligious. But there's a lot of in-text context clues about Hermione's possible religious views. I don't remember exactly what it was, but IIRC there's a passage between her and Luna's father in DH where she claims it's ridiculous to believe in things without any physical evidence of them, which could apply to her wider view of spirituality.

** I recently read a fic (I'd link it but I can't remember which one it is) where Harry was /texting/ Kreacher. The fic was most certainly /not/ crack, and it pulled me out of immersion every time it was mentioned. What made it even odder was the fact that Kreacher had perfect spelling when texting, but Harry kept using annoying abbreviations!
