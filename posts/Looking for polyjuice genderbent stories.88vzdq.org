Looking for stories where one of the characters takes polyjuice and turns into the opposite gender. Would like a story where an original male character polyjuices into an original female character and impersonates them.

Thanks!

  Harry has a brilliant idea! He loves Ginny and knows her inside and out. But, he wants to REALLY know what it feels like to be her - just for a little while. Will Ginny consent to his little experiment?

*** I'm unsure if those were intriguing or disturbing. Hmm.

***** I just find the idea very disturbing. But like I said, intriguing at the same time.

****** I'd do it tbh. I wouldn't even turn into the opposite sex so it would probably be even weirder, but also a bit neat. I imagine it would be like hearing your own voice. You'd see yourself and go "...That's what I look like when I'm having an orgasm? I look like I'm having a seizure, what the fuck."

******* Yeah, it's like in those Soul Bond fics, where each exactly feels the other's feelings, the ping-pong effect is likely to exponentiate what they're feeling. It's like, I feel how you're feeling me, lol.
