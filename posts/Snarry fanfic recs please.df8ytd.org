I am looking for Snarry fics but only with Top Harry. I would prefer long, completed fics but I'll take whatever I can get. I was wondering if anyone knows more fics similar to The Domino Effect by JekylandHyde or The Voice Under All Silences by Pekeleke--basically a fic where Harry is obsessed or possessive over an oblivious/relunctant Snape and will do anything to be with him. I don't mind non con or mpreg(as long as its Snape) or time travel
