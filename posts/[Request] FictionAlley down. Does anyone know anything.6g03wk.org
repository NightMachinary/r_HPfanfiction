** It's down for me too.

[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/][This link]] appears to be a working mirror: I've managed to access one author's stories anyway.

I've no idea how up to date it is, or if everything is there.

*** The mirror seems to be working, but not for the restricted Fics. Trying to access Love Under Will by Aja. Getting to the site asking me if I'm over 17 but nothing happens after clicking "yes". :/
