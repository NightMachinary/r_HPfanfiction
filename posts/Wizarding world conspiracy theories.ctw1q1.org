What are theories you can see existing in the wizarding world based on the knowledge you are given and how much you know the public knows about that knowledge. So for example because Voldemort had dissappeared and Harry had the scar proving that he survived the killing curse someone in the general public could have predicted Harry getting a savior image before the public embraced the idea.

But the potential theory cant be confirmed to be true. Someone may have had a theory that Harry beating Voldemort was prophesized at some point. But that actually happened so that cant be included.

And it cant be a in canon theory like Nargals existing for example thats a theory that exists in Canon. Same goes for Sirius being the rockstar Stubby Boardman .


** I have three crazy conspiracy theories I've thought over the years:

1. Wizards and witches when children have the ability to perform magic even without the wand but after school they can't. I think that it's possible to learn wand-less magic and the reason they can't as adults it's because they forgot how to do it (like babies can swim but have to re-learn how to do it when are children) and becomes harder to do so (like learning a new language is easier as a child but harder if you're older) but not impossible. The government likes to keep the magical population ignorant about it because in this way they can decide who can perform magic and who can't by simply taking your wand away.

2. The magic tracker for underage Wizards and Witches is a system to also track their families. When in CoS Dobby performs magic Harry is given the blame, meaning that the tracking spell detects all magic performed near a child (another consequence is that underage w. and w. can perform magic without being persecuted as long as there's an adult close enough, because in this way the ministry will have to take for granted that it was the adult who did it).

3. The reason why Hogwarts has so many paintings is because it acts as a sort of CCTV system/spies for the headmaster.

** Tom Riddle never existed. The only people who actually talk about Tom Riddle are Dumbledore, the Diary Horcrux, and I think Slughorn.

Clearly it's all just a massive plot by Dumbledore to discredit Voldemort's entire movement by creating a false backstory for him as a half blood. The diary horcrux was in fact another of Dumbledore's clever ploys---after all, you really think it's like that a Basilisk roaming around only kills 1 person in over fifty years? Or that a twelve year old boy could KILL a fully grown Basilisk. No sir.

As for Slughorn, he was clearly implanted with a false memory.

I don't know if Voldemort ever mentions his past but if he does then clearly he was implanted with a false memory too.

**** Technically, a good half of what Luna say count as conspiracy theories :

- The Rotfang Conspiracy
- The Heliopath army hidden in the DoM
- Minister Fudge hate Goblins and eats them in pies

â€‹

Also : Lily Potter was not a mudblood, she was the daughter of a Squib and this is why she managed to take down the Dark Lord. (This theory can be used to justify why any no pureblood is talented in something, from Dumbledore to Hermione).

** Olivander only sells wands over the summer, the rest of the time he runs a muggle turkey farm to provide spare income, with a section for phoenixes at the back, how else does he get all the feathers? Due to the amount of magic used around the farm, the turkeys have been changed slightly and like Mr Weasley's flying car they have developed far more personality than normal turkeys. As such, they are the only Turkeys to have voted for Christmas.

*** You know what im pretty willing to just accept this one as canon also i feel like all wizards should just make side income in the muggle world. Can you imagine how easy it would be for them to make money in the muggle world?

** Credit goes to "Seventh Horcruxe" fic, but : "Muggleborn don't exist :

- The Muggleborns are the children of witches and wizards who modified Muggles memories to make them think they had a child and use them for free babysiting. (Seventh Horcruxe is a gold mine of conspiracy theories)

** The most obvious example would be anything centered around the *Department of Mysteries*. Seriously, a branch of government with a ambiguous title that employees are sworn to never talk about and that intruding has significant magical and institutional penalties? If an equivalent to this existed in the Muggle World, everything under the sun would be blamed/accused of them.

This is the stuff conspiracists would salivate over (among other things). Considering what's actually there though, the theories are probably justified.

** Muggleborns are needed to pad the population, so treating them badly will force them to prove their worthiness.
