*** The Dark Lady sounds like a cliche filled murderous mayhem and I think I'll love it. Thank you for posting a reply!

**** It absolutely is! Was the first thing I ever wrote after reading another cliche-filled fem!Harry/Riddle fic. Good times.

There are still around 20 chapters in the backburner too.

** The Black Queen series on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] is just like that, but it has major changes to the plot and some questionable ethics. If you like the exploration of the magic in HP, it's great, but warnings on subject matter definitely apply. The author is silently watches.

*** I remember reading the first book in the series about a year ago I think, and it was really good. I would have to read it again before going for the second book because I really don't remember it that much. Thanks for your recommendation!

** I remember reading one that went along the lines of Harry using a dark ritual to turn himself into a girl and taking the name of a dead pureblood girl. She goes back to Hogwarts as a first year and joins the dark Lord as a means to an end. It was pretty fucked up but I'm trying to find it again, if it helps the name she took was Regina Fawley.

*** Yeah, I remember reading that one. She got married to Draco but was kinda in a relationship with another girl and they made each other their horcuxes? Something like that, but I can't remember the title.

  Violet Lilith Potter grew up hated and abused, until one day she broke free of her binds, finding comfort in a certain sarcastic Dark Lord in her head. She gains many friends and family along the way, and though she may be Dark, she was not evil. Maybe.. Several pairings in later chapters. Dark, powerful, fem Harry! Major Dumbledore and Ron bashing. Minor Hermione bashing at first.
