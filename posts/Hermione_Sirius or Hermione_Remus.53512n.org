  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** I just double-checked my fic list, and can also recommend linkffn(The Last Marauder), linkffn(Divergence by abovetheserpentine), and linkffn(Misplaced Moony) for HG/RL.

For HG/SB, I've also started reading linkffn(Reason for Life).

I haven't finished The Last Marauder or Reason for Life, but I'll recommend them anyways!

Edit: it linked the wrong story for Divergence - let's try this again. ffnbot!refresh
