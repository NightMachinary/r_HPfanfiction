Draco makes a point that he might have been sent to Durmstrang except that Narcissa didn't want him that far away. Knowing Draco--as I do so well . . . /personally/, in fact (Just kidding.)--he's probably full of hot air.

But reflecting on that, and the NoLordVoldermort!AU idea below, I wonder why it seems that no Death Eater families send their kids to Durmstrang. After all, that's where you can learn actual Dark Arts.

Is it to protect their own hides now that LV is "gone"? Or is it "just too far to send our babies"? If that is the case, did Death Eaters send their kids to Durmstrang during the reign of Lord Voldemort, and then stop after his fall?

I wonder what that would do to the HP world, if it had happened...

So, what do you think? Why don't the DEs send their precious kids to Durmstrang? And why aren't Durmstrang students particularly intimidating? Krum is a pretty good wizard in GOF, but not superb. Then again, he seems to have a moral core and most likely would refrain from using nasty tricks . . .


** I think they just wanted their kids to make friends and connections in England. It's a patriotic thing I guess. While the education at Hogwarts is kind of crap, sending to Durmstrang would be like saying, 'Yeah, your school is better than ours.'

Also, it was run by Karkaroff. The more hardcore DEs wanted him dead, remember? They don't want their kids associated with a traitor.

** Just a thought- the English families might've preferred to have their children taught in English.

At the very least, sending them to a school that teaches the Dark Arts means that the kids might come back with different ideas about how to run the family... and how to make sure their ideas are heard.

** I'd guess that many families wanted to lay low when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named fell from power. Many families claimed that they were under the Imperious Curse, and therefore didn't know what they were doing, so sending them to Dumstrang may be suspicious.

Additionally, as the Malfoy family was one of the richer families, they may be one of the few that could afford the cost, and extra distance.

** People tend to end up living where they finish school, in general. So it's not just a question of having your kids far away while they're at school - it's also a question of whether they ever come back. Plus, presumably NEWTs are a national thing, so your kid would come back from school without the credentials necessary for lots of jobs in England.
