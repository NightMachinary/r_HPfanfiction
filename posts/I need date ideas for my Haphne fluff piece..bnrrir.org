It's a romcom story, and I based Daphne off of Eri Sawachika from School Rumble. I got the random idea of "anime romcom HP" and was too entertained by the possibilities. I haven't had many issues writing it but I'm sort of blocked up at the moment. I've got a movie date scene but the rest of the chapter is odd. So hit me with those fluff ideas. Please I'm desperate. :(


** Make Lockheart's books over the top dramatic/ridiculous and have dramatic readings interrupted by giggles.

Thrift store/magical equivalent shenanigans

Some of these things aren't applicable because requires technology/living together, but its something to look at:[[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ax3etm/what_are_some_fun_things_to_do_around_with_your/]]

People watch at [INSERT LOCATION HERE] and make up random stuff about the people walking by.

Edit: go out for meal/dessert. One tries the others food, likes it better than their own dish. Wants to trade. "NO! Get your own!" Food fight/shenanigans ensue

*** No it's still a wizard au. I've got like 7 chapters so far or something. It's just a story I wrote for fun so it's not super serious.

*** For the Haphne segment, starts when Harry goes to diagon alley before his first year. For the other protagonist, it starts before his fourth year. It alternates their stories and perspectives every other chapter.

Currently, I'm up to sixth year for Harry and Daphne.
