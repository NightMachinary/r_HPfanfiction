Ah yes, this here is a dragon. Beautiful, isn't he?

Let's take a closer look. This here, this lad, biggest beast I've seen since the basilisk. Of course that bit me, but I probably just startled em. And I was fine, anyway.

Just stay away from mantas, Harry.

** This is a good idea . I feel like this would work a lot better with Hagrid as the lead or something with Steve Irwin in the magical world . I quite like the docs that had Ramsey Gordon in the Magical world . So having a Steve Irwin would be exciting

** I've had an idea for quite a while where Harry is essentially a true blue aussie bogan. He'd just run around saying cunt, wearing flip flops and tank tops showing off his flabby arms. Would have to have long shoulder length hair and an ungroomed beard. I can imagine him cooking a few things on the barbie next to the Lake, with a can of VB in one hand listening to the cricket on the radio.

If you're going to make him an Aussie, you need to get the lingo right.
