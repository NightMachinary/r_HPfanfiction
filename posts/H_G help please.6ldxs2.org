H/G is unashamedly my favorite pairing and after scouring the internet I came across a few of hgfan111's stories which I had been dying to r ad. However the site I was reading one in (fictionhunt.com) seems to not be working or had been taken down. I am halfway through Away From The Sun and now I can't finish.

Anyone have another link to this story? As a side request I would love to read more of this authors works but have only found three: brighter than sunshine, learning to fly, away from the sun


** I think that author is also on SIYE.CO.UK, a specialised H/G site :)

***** Iirc, they got an actual book deal and deleted their old fan stuff so to look more professional, or whatever. Maybe something about avoiding legal problems?

You see it happen every so often.

*** You are my new hero...

EDIT: For real, as silly as it might sound, some of these fics are what got me through the weeks after my mother died.

**** I was going to make a pithy statement, or possibly use one of these two quotes "One must think like a hero to behave like a merely decent human being.' -May Sarton "The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference." -Henry Miller.

However, I know how that feels. I was in a very deep depression, and I read one fic several times over that just clicked with me and helped keep my mind off it. If it was deleted, I don't know what I would feel. So I'm very, very glad I was able to get you reunited with those stories, and I hope they help you as much as they did back then. I'm sorry for your loss, but am glad I can help you in even this tiny way.

***** Thank You... I remember very little of that first year after she died. One of the few things I know for certain though is that some of these stories made me smile for the first time after she died. It's really nice to read these again in a frame of mind where I can actually experience them on the their own merit and not simply as a means to escape.
