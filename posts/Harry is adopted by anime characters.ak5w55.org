Hi guys. I'm looking for some good stories where Harry is adopted by anime characters. Fanfics that focus on his interaction should with them are welcome (e.g Gamer95's Harry Adoption fanfics) , also I know about Lupine Horror, Arawn D Draven and Quatermass's fics, so try and avoid those when mentioning things

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

  Harry was feeling pretty good after his third year. True, it hasn't been going perfectly, but nothing ever does. Still, his godfather was free-ish and alive, and both their souls were where they belong. And then he got a visit from his mother's mother. There's no ownership by me involved with this.
