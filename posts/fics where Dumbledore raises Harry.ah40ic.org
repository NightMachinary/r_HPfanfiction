I was reading a fic awhile ago which had a throwaway joke re Harry's living situation that if no suitable alternatives could be found Dumbledore would've raised Harry himself and rot his teeth on sweets. I found myself surprisingly endeared by the idea and was wondering if there were any fics out there where something similar happens? as in for whatever reason (the Dursleys don't exist or Dumbledore realises they're unsuitable) Dumbledore ends up adopting little Harry and raising him himself. (Preferably without the whole ‘training him to be a skilled warrior at age 6' thing ppl do sometimes)

I'm quite surprised i've never seen a fic like this considering how much fun potential it could have, but I suppose Dumbledore is quite a contentious figure in the fandom.

Anyone know of any fics like this?


** I had a different mental image at this prompt:

​

It was a solemn gathering in the Godric's Hollow cemetery. Dumbledore raised his wand and spoke the first phrase. ‘Bone of the father, unknowingly given, you will renew your son!'

The surface of the grave cracked. A fine trickle of dust rose into the air, and fell softly into the cauldron. The diamond surface of the water broke and hissed; it sent sparks in all directions, and turned a vivid, poisonous-looking blue.

Dumbledore was grim as he levitated the next ingredient: Dobby's left kidney, preserved in ice. Its owner nodded, nervously tugging at his long ears. ‘Flesh of the servant, willingly given, you will revive your master.'

The potion turned a burning red.

‘Blood of the enemy, forcibly taken, you will resurrect your foe.'

Draco -- stunned and anaesthetised as he was -- did not wake up as Dumbledore made a careful incision on the crook of his arm, collecting blood in a vial, before healing the cut. He poured it out into the cauldron. The liquid within turned, instantly, a blinding white.

The cauldron was simmering, sending its diamond sparks in all directions, so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness. And then, suddenly, the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished. A surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead.

Dumbledore smiled sadly, as Harry rose out of the smoke. It should have never come to this, yet here they were.

** A very interesting premise, especially if Dumbledore is actually good and not the Machiavellian Dumbledore we usually see.

I'm eager to check out the fics that are posted here later.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1019740/1/HandMeDown-Clothes][HandMeDown Clothes]] linkffn(1019740) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12208439/1/Harry-s-New-Guardian][Harry's New Guardian]] linkffn(12208439) both meet your request, but honestly don't get your hopes up - the writing's pretty bad.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8653399][the part we choose to act on]] linkao3(8653399) has considerably better writing, but since it involves Dark!Harry I doubt it's what you're looking for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308786][no place like home]] linkao3(4308786) has Harry raised at Hogwarts, but Dumbledore isn't really that involved.

I'm sorry to not be of more help, but fics that 1) focus on Harry and Dumbledore and 2) don't have bashing are pretty thin on the ground, sadly.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  Harry is taken away from the Dursleys and raised by Albus Dumbledore. With Hogwarts as his home, Harry's life is different but he still manages to get into plenty of trouble. This story is AU.

** There's this one fic where Harry drinks a potion that de-ages him about 10 years (post GoF) and Snape ends up raising him (Voldemort was already dead, its a big AU, written before, I think, of OoTP) with Dumbledore retiring to become Harry's "Grandpa", spoiling him rotten as a grandpa usually does in a perfect world. There's obviously more to the story, but that's how it goes.

I don't remember the name, but I may have it archived somewhere in my pc, I could look it for you if you're interested in it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13186280/1/][The Phoenix Burns Brightest]] By: ErmengardeSecret

Dumbledore takes custody of a four-year-old Harry after the Dursleys are investigated by Social Services. He raises him in relative isolation, away from the dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together. Nothing has changed, except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they they mean to each other.
