I feel like I have a great idea for a Harry Potter fic, but I am terrified to actually post it anywhere. And I haven't even written it yet! Like this fear is making me not want to even write it.

Even my husband, who is an avid HP fanfic reader, says that a “fair few” people would probably hate the idea, but there would definitely be a random few that'd appreciate it.

Is there a lot of negative responses to HP fanfiction? I'm a sweet little cinnamon roll and don't know if I could handle like a ton of negativity.


** In my experience, its more likely that if people aren't into the idea they just won't read it or comment.

But don't fall into that trap of writing for other people-- you can never please everybody. Write for yourself, to create the content that YOU want to read, see the ideas that YOU like come into action.

And then please do share it because there's bound to be others who enjoy it whether they tell you so or not.

*** I can't upvote this enough. The fanfic I am working on for harry potter is being written for me. I KNOW I can't please everybody, nor do I care if I do or not. Some will like my fic when I post it, some won't. I could care less either way. I hope the OP just writes their story and posts it

**** Agreed, hands down. My only problem is that I can't even write for myself, because I keep second guessing myself. I've got a Harry and Dudley Buddy Cop idea, but the only scene I even have half a plan for is one where Dudley shoots either a vampire or a werewolf, and the two argue, Harry over how silver/blessed bullets are illegal in the magical world, while Dudley argues back that guns are rather illegal in Muggle Britain, if they're arguing semantics.

I've also got a Star Wars/Sailor Moon crossover idea (which is mostly an excuse to try my hand at what would effectively be somewhat original Sci-Fi as a young group of Force Sensitive girls from Alderaan go on a galactic road trip, with their final destination ending up becoming the Solar System as seen in Sailor Moon's ancient lore)

I've got ten fanfic ideas and two original fiction ideas that are bouncing about in my head, but while I understand the tropes and can point them out if asked, I can't for the life of me figure out how to WRITE using those tropes. And that is why I always, ALWAYS encourage those who have a story to write to do so, because no one should end up driving themselves up a wall like I do.

*** I absolutely agree with this! Please don't fall into the black hole of writing for other people! I've read some awesome fics that eventually just seem to turn into pandering for reviews and giving the reader too much power over something that should absolutely be yours. It's hard to be confident, but eventually all that's left to do is try, and I always want people to try. Otherwise how would we ever get new fanfiction that isn't a total rehashing of the same fics we've already read a hundred times, right?

And for what it's worth, I usually appreciate an original idea more than a popular idea, and I think a lot of people here would agree.

Make sure you've got a good beta to proof read, upload it in ffn and ao3 so it's easier to reach more readers, don't apologize to people who give negative feedback, and I think you'll be golden!

*** Exactly what I thought, I've rarely seen any negative comments on fanfics except if the chapter/story is really heavy/controversial.

I remember not long ago a chapter of a story that was really violent, basically involved savage infanticide and the writer kinda got gaslighted for it + the lack of trigger warnings. But except for that I've never came across negative comments.

Most readers are always respectful about the writer's work which is one of the best things about fanfics.

** I, too, am a sweet little cinnamon roll, so I just have all comments disabled on ao3. I don't think anything I'm writing is particularly provocative but simply don't want to deal with any negative responses that I might get because who really knows with the Internet. That way, the people who like the idea can still enjoy it, but none of the trolls can reach you even if they want to. You won't get any positive comments either, but if you're so nervous of the responses that you don't even want to write it, then I think it's worth it.

If you disable comments but still want feedback from someone in the fandom, then I'd be happy to give you responses if you send the link to me privately! I'm not into internet toxicity, so you can trust that I will protect your cinnamon roll-ness.

However I've gotten nothing but kind feedback on AO3, and you can disable comments there if you wind up having a problem.

And, you can always write the story first if it's something you enjoy and decide later if you want to post.

** I'd go into posting expecting to get negativity (if you get a response at all--the field is full of fics, and it can be difficult to get noticed). Compared to my other fandoms, HP has more trolls, haters (of the 'go kill yourself for this typo' type), and readers married to their own particular readings who may be vocal and rude if you don't conform to their interpretations.

Of course, there are lots of lovely readers, but overly harsh comments always seem to stick in our minds more than the polite ones.

In my experience, ao3 readers are more polite in their reactions, even if they don't like a story.

** If you're anxious about posting to ao3, you might try finding a group (Discord, FB, twitter, etc) for HP fic writers and share with them first? Having a smaller audience to try fic out on might help, and having support in case you get jerks might help.

Although, I have never understood people who leave mean comments/reviews. Don't get me wrong, I've thought "this is crap" and slammed the back button. But why would I complain or try to make someone feel bad for something they made because of their passion for a fandom? So I know it's easier said than done, but just remember that nobody has any right to be a jerk to you for something that is a labor of love.

And I completely agree. I would never write something rude or just flat out mean like I've seen others do. I do the same as you; if I don't like something, I just stop reading. It would take way too much time out of my life to write hateful comments. And I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of such responses and would never want to do that to someone else. I know how much work and dedication it takes to write fanfic, so for someone to hurt an author like that is so disheartening to see. Hence my own nervousness.

I've only had the one comment but it was positive and quite a few kudos. The beauty of pre-canon is that you can easily work things out the way you want and people generally don't get upset with that kind of content because as you say it's mostly head-canon for a disliked character.

I write lots and lots of Harry Potter fic. Why don't you join a fest and write that way? Then you are surrounded by others, all in a supportive community. I would say, join a discord too, and just have fun with it. Remember, your characters won't live, and do complete head canons that you hold so dear if you don't write them.

Have fun. It is the biggest of pleasures and changed my life for the better. There is nothing better that looking at your completed fics and knowing that you have added positively to the community 💜❤

Good luck!
