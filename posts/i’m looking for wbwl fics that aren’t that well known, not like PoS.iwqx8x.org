** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]] is probably my favorite WBWL story. But for less visible ones you could try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23149174/chapters/55401934][The Forsaken's Ascension]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]]. I'm also not entirely sure it counts, but I'll include [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1588111][Red Hair and Grass Blades]] which switches the roles of Neville and Harry.

Edit: removed Ink and Parchment | Blood and Bone as it is not a WBWL.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.

  On that faithful Halloween night Nick Potter was hailed 'Boy Who Lived' his twin Harry was ignored in favour of the favoured famous son. Harry is pushed aside, when it comes to it what will happen? will Harry fight for a world that didnt want him or care about him? will Dumbledore, the Potter's and world grovell at his feet praying he will save them? Snarry/slash. What happens when the world finds out he was the one to survive that faithful halloween night? oh so many years ago?
