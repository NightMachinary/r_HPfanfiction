  Hello! I wrote a thing!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132088/1/Beyond-The-Veil][Beyond the Veil]]

It's a Harry Potter and Mass Effect crossover, and has 93k (EDIT: 150k as of 6/13/17) words so far. I plan on finishing it, and have an ending mapped out, along with a nice journey on the way there. For those of you who are unaware, Mass Effect is a videogame trilogy in which humanity has extended into space, and has met and is interacting with a bunch of alien races. The protagonist experiences a vision from an ancient relic of a bygone race, and must prevent the complete annihilation of all sentient life in the galaxy by preparing everyone for interstellar invasion by a massive fleet of evil AI called the Reapers. Of course, I've introduced a Master-of-Death Harry into the universe. (He's not a god, let's get that straight. Nor is he spontaneously the one and only main character.) Fireworks ensue. Happy reading! (Or ignoring.) Either way, don't let the nargles get you down.

** I've seen this a few times and I just can't get into it. The first chapter is just a massive infodump and it's hard to get through since it's just not that interesting. I'd prefer for the story to just start in ME time and only reference the old stuff when it's relevant.

  Harry is bored. During his work as an unspeakable, he discovers something about the Veil of Death: It drops anyone who travels through it somewhere safe. Where? Nobody knows! But Harry's wanderlust is tingling, so, in search of adventure, Harry steps through the Veil. He winds up in Mass Effect. The Reapers won't know what hit them. Rated T for occasional language. MOD!Harry.

** I've read this one, it's alright once you get into the meat of the story, and slog through the massive info dump that is the first chapter.

I like how you characterized Harry, and wrote him into the different character backgrounds for Shepard. It was a very fun read, and I do look forward to more.

** The first chapter is one of the most humongous infodumps I have ever read. Clicked out as soon as I clicked in. I hope you find your readers, but I won't be one of them.

*** Thanks for your reply. (And I'm not just being facetious.) It really helps to figure out what I'm doing wrong -- Now that I know you (and probably many others) think ch1 is an infodump, I can go and fix it up.

*** Just out of curiosity, how does one make a self-insert in PA?

I mean, aren't they all machines?

How do you do a Harry Potter self-insert? Aren't they all bags of meat?

***** Positive, Commander.

But in all seriousness, I'd rather read about meat bags. I like the two meat bags that I have, and a well-done self insert that actually makes sense (a rarity, sure, but it does happen) can be enjoyable.

** It took me a couple rereads to get through the info dump, but after getting into the story I have been loving it. I would go as far to say it is my favorite Harry Potter fanfiction. Keep up the good work!
