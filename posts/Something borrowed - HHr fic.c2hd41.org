:END:
So I'm looking for a fix (it's a one shot probably) that focuses on Harry during Hermione's wedding. It focuses on an Olde English tradition of the bride having something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue, and a six pence on your shoe.

Harry offers a piece of his mother's jewelery (it's jewelery only I think). He is in love with her but for some reason is not with him.

Any clue?
