I'd like to start by saying that I haven't finished reading this fic, I'm 14 chapters in. I'm making this thread because this fic contains many plot elements I quite enjoy, such as exploration of the Wizarding World's political scene, Sirius being exonerated & actually being a badass and a well-intentioned but undeniably manipulative Dumbles.

However. There are several elements that so far have not really sat well. The very first is emotional Harry. I think this is probably because I've read so many fics, and indeed even in canon, Harry is certainly treated like a house elf - but never have I seen him so emotional at this point in the time line. For crying out loud, its the end of Year 3! He's just found out about two of his parents friends who are still alive and care about him. If it was the summer after Year 4 or 5, I could certainly understand this level of emotion.

Another is the Harry/Sirius dynamic. I LOVE Harry/Sirius fics, and to some level, I do enjoy seeing Sirius fulfil a guardian-like role to Harry. But Sirius to me has always been that badass uncle or older brother to Harry - my personal favourite is the dynamic in A Black Comedy. I don't particularly enjoy this father figure Sirius. Mainly because of all the damn emotion involved. Nonjon's Sirius and Harry would slap there analogues out of this AU.

Lastly, this may just me being a little pernickety, but regarding the proto-horcrux in Harry's scar. There's a reason why Albus Dumbledore, one of the foremost intellects of the last century, could not remove it. Think about it. There is a prophecy which explicitly states that either must die at the hand of the other. This is because of that proto horcrux. If anyone but Harry kills Voldemort, he can return, because he is anchored to the plane by the horcrux embedded in Harry. If the horcrux can in fact be removed from Harry, then the Prophecy is rendered meaningless and any random Dick, Larry or Ron can kill Voldie with a lucky shot.

I'm sure everyone has different opinions because hey, at the end of the day this is fanfiction after all. I just don't particular like reading about how Dumbledore couldn't remove the proto horcrux, but Mr OC in the Americas could. I don't mean to say that Dumbledore is omnipotent - rather could he may be just a little more aware of the world around him? There's a world-class healing spa in Chicago. Hmm, maybe Dumbledore, the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, might have heard about such a place.

I'm 14 chapters in, and I don't think I'm going to be able to continue reading this fic with its current trends. Can someone tell me if Harry decides to stops being so damn emotional and starts getting shit done

** He gets slightly less emotional in the next arc and then acts pretty much the same through the whole fic. But I have to warn you, it generally gets stupider further on. I'm not sure if it's now or soon that the author will mention scar tissue on a magical core. Not to the mention upcoming "Harry Potter - the most powerful magical fetus of his generation".

EDIT: Also prepare for more bashing.

*** It's frustrating because there's a lot to like in the story - I really like 'dangerously insane' Crouch, Lupin and the werewolves, and Pettigrew's pov. But the unborn Harry thing is one of the worst things I've ever read.

**** Sorry, but I can't see anything actually good in this one. Angry Harry and the Seven? There are some neat ideas here. Infamous Harry Crow has some too. But here? I'm not convinced by anything you mention. Especially by werewolves, those were terrible.

***** I suppose something just being different is enough to be a bit interesting to me. I didn't finish it myself, but mostly because of its extreme length, the issues you mentioned, and the pairing. I didn't hate it.

** I'm a pretty big fan of this story but I think most of that is because I don't mind or like the things you mention. Sirius does maintain a father figure role throughout the story. Harry does become less emotional and more "there's a prophecy I need to help get stuff done" as the story progresses but he never becomes some 14 year old cold hearted mercenary. Dumbledore does continue to make mistakes with regards to Harry and the prophecy throughout the story. Almost everyone in the story besides Dumbledore is always saying "I don't care that there's a prophecy we're going to kill this guy with minimal help from Harry" while Dumbledore continues to try to force the issue. If you really dislike the things you mentioned then yeah you probably won't like the story but I always found it to be a well written piece with a nice dose of fluffiness while also being serious when necessary.
