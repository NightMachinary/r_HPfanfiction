Hi. My name's redphoenix035. I have written a new HP fanfic. I'd like to link it here just in case some of you are interested in reading it. Here's the description:

Dark Lord Risen

linkffn(Dark Lord Risen by redphoenix035)

The Dark Lord won. Hogwarts Academy is filled with bright young witches and wizards who are eager to make their place in this dark world. Courtships, duels, battles, war, and intrigue. What could be better?

I will update every Friday.

** So I gave this the once-over...

1) What's with the stilted language? "You are penning mum a missive", "In the morrow, Brother", "In the morrow, Sister". First of all, 11 year olds don't speak like that. No one speaks like that. Idk why you're going for excessive formality, but it comes across as ridiculous.

2) The chapter is too short. 1300 words aren't enough to showcase anything, moreso for a first chapter. A good goal is 3 to 5 thousand words.

3) Figure our the beginning, middle and ending to your story. Then re-write the beginning to have a clear hook for what you want your story to be.

4) The "Courtships" thing being first on the list is a bit of a red flag. It sounds a bit like you're aiming to make this a Jane Austin novel in Harry Potter colors.

I don't say all this stuff to discourage you, but if you're aiming to write stuff, you have to be willing to re-write, a lot. You have to be your harshest critic. No one ever begun writing and came up with a 10/10 story on the first draft. So keep at it.
