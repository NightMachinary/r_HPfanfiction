Don't get me wrong, I love Hermione I just would like to see him befriend different people. Because it's like nine times out of ten he ends up friends with Hermione no matter what the plot is, which is kind of strange.

Any rating, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Can be as Canon as possible or as AU as possible or anywhere in between.

Would rather not have character bashing if possible unless it makes sense for the story.


** ...Canon? You know... with Ron Weasley?...
