i've always hated fanfics where harry tries to leave or does leave and then people or dumbledore force him or try to force him to stay and guilt trip him or kidnap him and all sorts of ooc things and dumb things. I'd be interested in a fanfiction where harry decides to leave Britain or the magical world or hogwarts and no one cares that much or really does anything. They explain that they thought he would want to fight the people and man who killed his parents and countless others and do what is right. But if he doesn't want to stay then he can just leave, he's not that important and life will go on and dumbledore and the ministry will deal with the death eaters and tom another way. Also if he doesn't want to go to hogwarts then he doesn't have to and they won't make a scene

i always thought a fanfic like that would be an awesome take that against the bashing fanfics and the overused cliches. That harry learns that they can and will go on without him and is actually shocked.

An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558): Harry, Hermione, Sirius, and the Grangers fled Britain after the Dementor attack, forcing major political changes and Dumbledore to step up his own game. Harry fixed his scar somewhere else, and the good guys won without Harry's further involvements.

  What if Harry had reacted more strongly to the Ministry's threat to expel him and snap his wand? What if he had fled the country rather than submit to the trial?

** Harry being shocked because Dumbledore wasn't some manipulative dick is itself bashing. The bigger issue here is that if Harry just leaves and everything resolves itself than what the hell are you expecting the fic to be about? Also the significant character issues you face with Harry running off.

*** Yeah, Harry being shocked by that would be Harry-bashing. That aside, I'd expect the fic to be about the good people of Magical Britain fighting Voldemort and his followers without prophecies, brother wands, and other contrivances; it sounds intriguing.

*** According to the very same Dumbledore, most prophecies simply fail. Heck, the prophecy doesn't even say that it's only Harry who can thwart Voldemort: it's imperative rather than descriptive, in that "Either /must/ die at the hand of the other", not "shall".

***** Mm-hmm. To elaborate, chapter 23 (Horcruxes) of Half-Blood Prince has Dumbledore explicitly point out that the Voldemort-Harry prophecy is only significant because Voldemort believes it's true, and that it'd have no power otherwise.

In the same scene, he lays out just why Harry's power of love is so important (it makes Harry basically incorruptible), and covers how Harry's desire for revenge (which isn't that heroic, really) is why he's the Chosen One.

**** Also, there is the fact that with how vague prophecies tend to be, that particular fragment of this one could have actually been referring to the night when he first fell.

Because let's play semantics for a moment: As “the other” follows a sentence where “he” is used to refer to the child of the prophecy, it could have meant that it refers to the other character, in this case Tom. With that, the prophecy would speak of a confrontation where one of them, be it Tom or be it the child of the prophecy, would die at Tom's hands, meaning that Tom's choices are what matters. Additionally, there is the fact that for as long as the child of the prophecy survived, Tom would not have lived as his fear of the prophecy speaking of one with the power to defeat him would have kept him from living fully, and for as long as Tom survived the child of the prophecy wouldn't be able to live either because what kind of life is it when you are in hiding and on a run from a monster.

So yeah, the only actual effect of the prophecy that we know of is that Tom took is seriously and did some stuff because of this. Anything else, heck knows, may have been a load of crock.

*** Dumbledore's care about the prophecy only extends so far as to assume that Tom will take it to be real and act on it. That's something he also tells Harry: be the prophecy genuine or a load of crock, Tom knows of it and cares and it is that choice of his that makes the prophecy matter. Heck, do remember that his attitude towards divination itself is not too positive a one, what with the fact that when he'd interviewed Trelawney he'd been considering eliminating divination as an elective with the only reason he'd interviewed her being that he'd been humouring her because of her family's reputation.

The representation of Dumbledore as someone who cares about the prophecy to the point of taking it as some kind of ultimate truth is just as misbegotten as the one that takes his motivation for everything to be “The Greater Good”. He /will/ act on the assumption that Tom will take the prophecy to be true and try to account for that, but that's preparing for a dark lord who has the motivation to annoy you rather than assuming that a prophecy has to be true.
