Help! I remember reading a Harry Potter/Game of Thrones Crossover but I can find it now! Basically Harry is the Master of Death and gets reborn into Westeros (he can still use magic, and he remembers his past life). He is reborn into the Peverell family, and is now named Hadrian Peverell. Hadrian's parents are Lilly and James Peverell (used to be Potter). Unfortanately, Lilly died giving birth to Hadrian, and James blamed Hadrian for that, so Hadrian was without parents. Fortunately for Hadrian, he met a servant of Death; a faceless man; when he was 7 (I think) So he was trained in how to use a sword by the faceless man. Now, because Lily died giving birth to Hadrian, James gambled away almost everything and accumulated a large debt. So James waited until Hadrian was older, and in exchange for paying off all the debt, he betrothed Hadrian to Rhaegar Targaryen. So Hadrian finds out, and is then sent to King's Landing, and as he's entering King's Landing he sees a lot of homeless people who need medical help, so he uses whatever herbs he has on him to heal them for free. That's all that I remember reading so if anyone knows what this story is called, can you please link it below? When I read it, it was written in english, so hopefully that plus all these other details helps. Thanks in advance.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death, Harry Potter, wakes one cold spring morning in Westeros. He has no idea why he's there - or how he'll get back. Harry always had bad luck, but a lot of persistence. He'll need it. Winter is Coming.
