Anyone have any good recommendations?

I only have a few points I'm looking for:

The story needs to be finished, and if its a series the series needs to be finished.

I would like it to be decently long, as I like to become immersed, so like 100+ words at least.

And that's about it. I liked some of the themes in searching for the power, like harry being super powerful, harry being the head of the black household, harry being able to have political power and wealth, but I am getting less and less picky looking for something to read. Oh, and I would prefer it to be somewhat adult oriented, doesn't need sex every scene, but at least some adult dialog or ideas. Also, sorry if I am being completely stupid in this, like I said, just started reading stuff like this, thanks for the help. If anyone could point me to a good site or something, that would be cool.

It's year 7 under the Carrows from Neville's POV and it's wonderful.

*** The third book in the series is not complete yet. DAYD is *more* than worth reading on its own, but the first in a trilogy.

Slaugh is the second book, and A Peccatis is the second (he started working on it again recently).

** Aside from the three big Jbern fics( The lie I've lived, Bungle+Turn, To Fight the Coming Darkness), My two recommendations are:

You MUST read the Methods of Rationality. Its in my personal top 3 works of fiction ever written, and easily the best fanfic ever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152930/1/Dagger-and-Rose]] One of the hidden gems of H/F(OTP!!!!), this fic takes inspiration from the Assasins Creed narrative. Expertly written, adult themes and an absolute blast to read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The_Skitterleap]]

Grindenwald won the war. Now europe is a Magical Nazi Dictatorship. Simply amazing, probably my favorite fic ever.

These are the two last ones I viewed. If you just started, I'd expect you should like to branch out from super!Harry stories like Harry Crow and the such, and venture into the true awesome that is out there :)

** Sometimes it's nice to be Internet Famous :)

The first fic /I/ ever read was 'The Hogs Head' by MyGinevra

The first fic I wrote on / beta'd for was 'Love Has No Age' by EasySurfing

I'm currently writing 'Hogwarts Shuffle' but its WIP (and...I seem to have taken a hiatus... sorry guys)

I recommend anything on FanFicAuthors.net really, Jaconais and Kinsfire were two that completely grabbed me when I first started, BobMin is great too though not as much citrus. Old Crow and DrT on fanfic.net or on ficwad.. Honestly if you go to the Harry Potter section on ficwad, go to the very first page and sort by 5's only, you can pretty much find every great fic I read for the first 2 years.

In case you didn't check my flair, I'm GinnyMyLove...

How on earth did you end up reading 'SFTP' as your first fanfic? Thats... a bit crazy! haha

*** First I just have to say that I quite enjoyed your book. The random clashes of high intensity were very well played. There were points when the adult scenes got a bit overbearing but the plot was greatly done for them. Also, I have read some of your posts and understand your feelings about the ending, but I have to agree the completely overpowered main troupe felt to be a great finish to it, and having a struggle would have ruined the plan of the book.

[edit] also I just wanted to say that the political power and harry having the black lordship and house was a huge draw for me, so well done on that point too.

And as to how I found it, I actually just went to [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/]] went to top most read stories, and out of the two that were completed yours seem to be the better, but I am quite glad I found it as it was a great read.

**** I'm always happy to run into fans on or offline. It still surprises me that SFTP could be a first fanfic for anybody, I didn't dive straight into megafics and I didn't stray into smutty fics until long after I poked around canon pairings.

I'm glad you enjoyed it though, one day I'll go back and clean it up, and possibly split the timeline and save a certain blonde in a new story...

** I've only started reading HP fanfiction recently, but my favorites, in no order, are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]] (complete): Harry starts seeing Tom Riddle's memories. It changes him. I really liked this one, finished it in about a week.

"H/Tracey. The diary left more than battle wounds. Voldemort's ingenuity planned for more than Harry initially assumed. The time has come when he must pierce the shades of grey that colour the Wizarding World. A fast-paced, psychological thriller."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] (complete, super long one shot): This one's about 40k words, 1 chapter. All things considered, it's pretty good. Writing's good and so is the premise.

"Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-Ending Road]] (WIP, 480k words): One of my absolute favorites. It's FemHarry/snape, but give it a chance. The fic is almost 500 k words and there's nothing between them, so it's not going to happen until Harriet is older. Snape and Harriet are both characterized very well. One of the best written Snapes I've come across.

"AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, starting in Chamber of Secrets and continuing through Deathly Hallows. Future Snape/Harriet."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] (WIP, 1.2 million words): First couple of chapters are alright (Harry fled to Germany when Voldemort took over, but he's back by chapter 1, just get past that part), but after that it gets really good, in my opinion. Voldemort is characterized especially well in this one; probably the best Voldemort I've read. Introduces some pretty novel ideas.

"Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry. MentorVoldemort. VII Ch.8 In which someone is dead, wounded, or kidnapped in every scene."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] (WIP, 130k words): Ginny dies first chapter and all the character's are affected. Harry becomes more ruthless and cunning, Ron becomes more serious, etc. Pretty good read.

"::Year 2 Divergence:: What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] (WIP, 56k words): Hermione centric. Pretty good writing overall. Updates are few and far between.

"AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince that was Promised]] (WIP, 100k words): Harry Potter/Game of Thrones crossover. Harry is born into the Baratheon family as the child of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. Harry is able to preform magic. Well written, interesting read, great characters. Highly recommended.

"He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived]] (WIP, 120k words): The magical world recognizes and sees Harry as, literally and anatomically, a girl, but he sees himself literally as a boy. Interesting concept and read.

"Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hollowed]] (WIP, 77k): Lily saves Harry in a dark way. Horror.

"The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] (WIP, 120k+ words): Harry's twin is the Boy who lived. Harry feels neglected. Embraces darker magic. Very good. The author hasn't put the rest of the story on fanfiction.net. The rest can be found on the Dark Lord Potter forums. There you can also find hundreds of rated and recommended Harry Potter Fanfiction. Be warned though. They hate Harry/Ginny and like their namesake, can tend toward a darker, edgier harry. Great forum overall though.

"Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]] (Complete, 250k words): To follow that, this is my favorite Harry/Ginny fanfiction, haha. Really good slice of life type of fic. Deals with the aftermath of the series. A 'book 8', if you will.

"The first year after the battle."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door][An Unfound Door]] (WIP, 38k words): Harry is in Ravenclaw and is very clever and smart, obviously. Short and probably abandoned, it's still pretty good. The author has published some of his own fiction if I recall correctly.

"War is coming to Hogwarts, and Harry Potter, fifth-year Ravenclaw, is beset on all sides by enemies unknown, unseen, and unfound..."

Also, WIP, as you might already know, means work in progress.

I've been reading HP fanfiction for about 2 years and this is what has stood out to me, hope it helps.
