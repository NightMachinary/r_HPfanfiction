*** It's not incest if it happens before you're related to them. True fact right there.

** Pretty positive that happens in the Amulet of Time series. Haven't read it in years, but I'm like 90% sure that happens near the end of the first book in the series. linkffn(the amulet of time)

**** Ah, my fault; forgot the bot was MIA at the moment. Keep in mind that this fanfic is from 2002, so be prepared for that. It has a few sequels that you'll be able to find on the author's page. I also can't vouch for the quality, as, again, I read it a long time ago, back when I first started reading FanFiction. I do remember it being better than a lot of others at the time tho

Linkffn(Basilisk born by Ebenchild)

Harry time travels to the past and is adopted by Merlin. This is basically alternating between the past and the present.

I think I remember that there were some small grammar and spelling issues maybe.
