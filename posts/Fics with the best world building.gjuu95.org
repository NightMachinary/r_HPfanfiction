Which fics in your opinion have the best world building?


** Alexandra Quick's world is incredible and doesn't get enough credit upon first glance. It's not the highlight of the story - the plot and characters dwarf the worldbuilding - but I feel like people look at it and assume it's set in a canon version of America, or just a Wizarding America that's not very different than Wizarding Britain.

Inverarity doesn't expand on Rowling's magic system at all - I think he's invented two or three spells in total over the course of the series - but the point is that everything is drawn from American values, American tradition. Blood status is important, but so is social class. Slavery is/was real. People from different backgrounds are treated differently and have different traditions. It's a wonderful change from the rather colorblind and pallid world of canon, and he does it super well.

*** I know this might be a very unpopular opinion, but I tried to get into the series multiple times. It just stands that if I was in the same year/cohort as Alexandra, I'd resort immediately to fisticuffs with her. She's annoying as shit.

#+end_quote

He adds a fair number of spells, including some non-Latin/Greek spells, which make the setting feel more alive and diverse.

But aside from incantations, he adds some entirely new magical concepts, like doggerel verse, witch's sight, alternate worlds, and powers, some of which are pretty big departures from JK Rowling's setting.

So I'd say there's a decent amount of magical world building.

**** Almost completely forgot about the doggerel verse since it's had such little use in recent books. But I'd argue a lot of the other stuff is rooted in traditional Native and European-American occultism rather than being a direct invention.

The way he brings all of this together is such a great way to worldbuild though. I love how the Confederation is so much simpler than the Ministry, yet its nature introduces a whole host of problems that you'd never think could be possible in a magical society.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** I can see where you're coming from. Harry just seems too mature for his age, but with the way time is flowing on Svaltrheim (spelling) and Harry's magic bringing him to his peak form, the accelerated growth maybe can justify his maturity. Also his somewhat different biology as a half-elf can also contribute to a different rate of growth of his maturity cause we don't really know what parts of his elvish biology he has gotten, apart from their superior battle awareness etc. Also we can still see some kid-harry-ness in the last few chapters, especially when dealing with Princess Whats-her-name.

A brief summary/take on the story - In the story thus far, the worlds used are from D&D, the 9 Realms from Norse Mythology and HP (An AU version of it, though.) Harry and Albus wind up in one of the 9 realms, that is also the Underdark (A la Drizzt, yes.) The story deals with how they got there, whether it was a deliberate choice, where they're going and how to get there and some interesting takes on both magic and weaponry, as well as a lovely twist on Canon Lore to be so much more ... impressive.

** I know it's way way /way/ off topic(as it doesn't involve Harry at all), but when I think of crowning examples of worldbuilding, the first fanfic that springs to mind is a crossover between /Naruto/ and /Mass Effect/, called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9628704/1/Misplaced][/Misplaced/ by Deus Swiftblade]]

Rather than just inserting Naruto into the /Mass Effect/ universe, it actually expands the /Naruto/ universe to encompass /Mass Effect's/, basically expanding on the history of a /Naruto/ version of Earth, complete with its own history and politics, conveyed by Codex Entries at the end of each chapter.

The fanfic is a bit of a doorstopper, though, being longer than the entire /Harry Potter/ series.

  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
