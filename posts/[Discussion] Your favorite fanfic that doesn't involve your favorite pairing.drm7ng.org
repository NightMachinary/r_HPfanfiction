** Favorite pairing(s): Harry/Fleur; James/Lily

So looking over my favorites it's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. Everything else minus a few Harry/Daphne is of the pairings above.

** Everything in the 'Boy with a scar' series.

Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498]]

For example: Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) Linkao3(baby birds and other adventures by dirgewithoutmusic)

Also, what I call the defense series such as

Linkao3(overemotional: in defense of cho chang by dirgewithoutmusic) Linkao3(naive: in defense of hannah abbott by dirgewithoutmusic)

Actually, anything by dirgewithoutmusic

** My favorite pairings are usually outside of the canon element, but I absolutely love the series of stories that begin with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6142629/1/Dudley-s-Memories][*Dudley's Memories*]] linkffn(6142629). It's Harry/Ginny, and the series itself ends up diving deep into untangling a lot of left-over angst from the novels. Highly recommend.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

** Not a huge fan of pairings in HP fanfiction, but Harry/Cedric is a guilty pleasure. I also don't hate Harmony. I can't fucking stand Voldemort with anyone though even if it's “young Tom Riddle so he's actually hot.” Linkao3(8132578) this fic however manages to take every trope I hate (dark lord Harry, crazy puppet master dumbledore, shipping Voldemort with anyone) and make it something I enjoy reading.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle

I would probably say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]]. Of all the fics that I read before I got super into Harmony, it is the one that sticks out in my mind. Regulus in it feels a bit gary-sueish but in a fantastic action hero type of way, the trial for Sirius is done in the most dramatic and fun way, and then there is a bunch of fun time turner shenanigans in it.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries.

Ships should change cannin previously for it to work. You cant expect anyone to believe after Harry almost kills Draco in HBP he has a raging boner over his blood on the floor.

Its unrealistic and frankly stupid. Love is amazing when written well.

****** Draco isnt a good person as a boy. A misguided boy who has had no real parenting ever. He was taught to be racist by his parents and he started to question is but JK didnt do anything for an arc of acceptance.

A spin off with Draco becoming a Rōnin is my dream, then him eventually becoming a Samuri by cutting his arm with the mark off and getting a robotic one.

And is there an Anne Frank/Nazi fic? For Scoence of course kind gentleman.

***** Well that certainly is an interesting viewpoint. I disagree but I respect your opinion.

1) The only time they would kiss or have sexual intercourse would be in an extreme case of catharsis, which is an release of pent up emotions. However this would be an extreme case and in cannon we can see (The whole series is from Harry's POV) that they clearly do not interact with each other.

2) Harry was stalking Draco bc he knew he was recruited to do a mission, by Voldemort therefore there isnt really an obsession over Draco himself, more of what he is doing. This is fither more evidently explained in the Half Blood Prince scene were Snap and Draco are talking in the closet area thingy and Harry eavsedops. He doesn't care for Draci more so WHAT he is doing.

However I agree that the homophobic members of this community should be banned. I may not be apart of the LGBTQ+ community but you guys dont deserve the hate due to a loud minority. And unfortunately in this subreddit there is a loud minority that are homophobic.

My ideal Drarry fic would be kinda were Draco uses Harry to try and kill Hermione and Ron, and when he succeeds Harry leaves him and becomes a Rōnin, seeking redemption for the crimes he has committed (Basocally killing Hermione and Ron, he is guilty like in cannon) and this foc would centre around his redemption and finding a place in this world.

Eventually the final battle would be to the death between Harry and Draco and Harry would realise the only way to redeem himself would be to kill Draco so he attempts to love him first, to turn him. But alas it doesn't work and when they fight Harry wins killing Draco.

This fic would ideally end with Harry burning Dracos body and ending up with someone else, preferably Geroge or Fred. Now I would write this but my time is stretched thin soooooo if anyone takes this idea I expect at least a nod in the fic.

****** Now my question is, say I don't want to read a story where the main character is either gay, bi, or a girl. This is because I want to be able to both relate to the story, and also be able to imagine it easier. Is this a reason why I should be banned?

******* No. But I'm saying being a dickhead and cussing them out aint going to help no one. Mate I'm straight, I got banned for a week by the mods for being "homophobic" cah I said some straight ppl find Lesbians hot. I understand and I truly believe what your saying.

When I first joined the community I avoided slash like a plague but I read one well written one and that's it.

But saying homophobic and sexist things like some people have in this community because a fic isnt centred towards their ideas isnt helpful.

I got a PM from someone calling me a nigger bc I'm black and I want more black focused fics that arent Blaise Zabini. And yh I'm black.

What I'm saying is some people are genuinely close minded fucks and I'm 16. I'm 16 the age were I call people Gay for dumb shit at school which I do of course but online shot is different.

Behind the screen some comments really do affect people and damn does Media blame stupid shit on unlinkable things.

Now I dont know weather you have made any homophobic comments so re reading my previous comment o was unclear on what I meant. Not liking slash Is fine, but making shitty comments is unnecessary and just retarded. Like why?

And I dont read fem fics, I just cant. I'm a Male so reading a fic were a Period is described zones me out and I back the fuck back.

So trustttt i do get ya!

And mans in yr 11 and I got more class the twenty somethings idots. Like no cap I will take your girl and give her this dic-

************ Honestly, you can look at Severus Tobias Snape in one of two ways; a blinded view, or a realistic view. If you look at it blindly, he's a hateful, and spiteful man who never got over his childhood. Realistically, he is a sadistic, and psychotic waste of sperm. I say this because he is a death eater, meaning he probably raped, killed, and tortured for fun before he 'switched' sides. Furthermore, if you recall correctly, he asked for Lily. Not an innocent little child, but Lily. Why? Because he 'loved' her. That's hippogryph dung. If he truly loved her, he would respect that at least she was happy with James. Instead, he assumes that since he 'loves' her, only he deserves her. Thus, I wouldn't be surprised if she lived, she would hate every breath she took.
