For those who don't know; the yuan-ti in D&D are a race of very evil snake-folk, who are trying to rebuild their ancient empire from long, long ago.

Since they don't have the numbers for a military takeover of the world, they instead hide in the proverbial shadows, inserting themselves into politically powerful positions using corruption, bribery, blackmail, even assassination, working in concert to make themselves the secret rulers of the world once more.

The 'purebloods', in yuan-ti society, are actually the lowest caste (but still above yuan-ti worshipping cultists); they look very close to human (whereas other yuan-ti look particularly snake-like), and often take on the tasks of infiltrating civilisation and twisting it to their needs.

So yeah, does anyone know fanfics where the 'purebloods' in Harry Potter are 'pureblood' yuan-ti?


** It doesn't fit your theory, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the natural 20) is a DnD crossover you might like.

*** Mm, I did read a bit of this one, though I've never really looked into a lot of the chapters in the middle. Pity it stopped updating.

*** It'd be funny if all of the purebloods (real purebloods, not just descendants-of-muggleborns-that-have-been-around-a-long-time) could speak Parseltongue, but they just don't advertise it.

...Actually, Volo's Guide to Monsters (for 5e D&D) mentions how if yuan-ti crossbreed, their children come out as whatever the less-snakey parent is (human>pureblood>malison>abomination), and they're very careful about maintaining their bloodlines because of that.

...Can you imagine a fic where Harry bursts into Grimmauld Place and goes, "Guys! Ron, Sirius, everyone! I saw Draco Malfoy turn into some half-snake thing!" and Sirius and the Weasleys look at each other and go "Crap. Who wants to break the news?"

And then it turns out that lots of 'pureblood' wizards aren't human at all, but snakefolk, and ones like the Weasleys and Sirius and Harry's father James belong to the group that actually cares about the wellbeing of non-yuan-ti humans...
