I'm looking for a fic where the horcrux in Harry's scar takes over Harry (like his personality changes).


** Not very well known but linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) qualifies.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) is a good take on the horcrux awakening in Harry's head. He doesn't exactly take over, but slowly influences, manipulates and also helps Harry resulting in Harry being quite different from canon.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?

*** Keep in mind this story isn't written by a native English speaker. I tried reading it, but it is very boring and repetitive. Features screaming Harry who never gets better and incompetent adults.
