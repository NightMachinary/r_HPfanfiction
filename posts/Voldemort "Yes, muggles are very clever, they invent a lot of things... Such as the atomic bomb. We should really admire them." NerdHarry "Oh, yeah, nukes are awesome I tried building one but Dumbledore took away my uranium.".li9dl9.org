***** Yep that was it. I imagined how he'd probably reply to someone unironically finding nukes to be pretty awesome.

Speaking of nukes and awesomeness, have you heard about Project Orion? It was an idea during the cold war to use nukes for spacecraft propulsion. Each ship would have a massive pusher plate with shock absorbers at the back. The drive would work by throwing nukes out the back and detonating them. Thanks to X ray ablation, the pusher plate would absorb the nuclear blast, recoil, and then return to position for the next bomb. Such a wild idea! Probably good that it was abandoned.

But using it in space is currently the most accessible way to get humans to other stars in a timescale comparable to a human lifetime.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

** Given how close Muggles were at destroying each other during the Cold War, why wouldn't Voldemort pull a Skynet and make Muggles finish each other off? He had experienced Muggle destructive powers first hand, and he definitely should know about nuclear weapons.

If he really wanted to imperius the American President and order him to fire all US nukes against their targets, I doubt those MACUSA Aurors could stop him. Then the Soviet counterattack would destroy the West, and the nuclear winter would wipe out 90% of Muggles within a few months. The whole world would be ready for his magical utopia. He and his minions could of course build well protected and self sufficient Wizarding enclaves deep underground, ride out the mayhem, and emerge as the total winner. If a single shield charm was able to protect them against nuclear blasts, like some wizard worshippers here postulate, then he would have even more incentives to induce such a scenario.

So, why didn't Voldemort do that? My theory is that nukes harm Wizards far more than Muggles. He had checked out Hiroshima and Nagasaki as soon as he heard the news. When he got there after a few days, he discovered that while 100000 out of 350000 Muggles had died at Hiroshima and 60000 out of 260000 Muggles had died at Nagasaki, the three Wizarding enclaves in the two cities had been completely killed off. Japanese Ministry of Magic was in utter panic, and decided to intervene in persuading the Emperor to surrender.

Later during the 1950s, Muggle powers conducted over 500 atmospheric nuclear tests, resulting in unprecedented level of radioactive fallout in human history. Coincidentally, squib births skyrocketed, and led to great panic and increased hostility against Muggleborns, whose numbers had actually grown because rapidly increasing Muggle population. These Muggleborns, many of them strongly influenced by equal rights thinking in the Muggle world, would no longer subject themselves to Pureblood dominance. In 1962, a Muggleborn named Nobby Leach was even elected to the British Minister of Magic. Voldemort, who originally wanted to wait out Dumbledore, decided that he could no longer put things off.

*** My personal guess is that he just couldn't gather an stable population while still keeping his power. Killing off a bunch of unprepared people going on their life's with surprise attacks and the DMLE compromised is one thing, actually managing to gather enough of them to make a population capable of keeping their numbers stable indefinitely and then actively ruling over then without killing enough people to desestabilize the population while people like Dumbledore and the order are running around as more than reasonable alternatives and his power base kept only in Britain is quite another beast even if we ignore that he would also have to seek people with the right skills to create a self-sufficient society , to say nothing of the absolute nightmare it would be to get the magical beasts which he would need to supply the population's needs (like dragons and unicorns), the plants used in potions they would very much need, enough brute material to make up necessary goodies like clothes and cauldrons /and/ the resources to supplement the whole population dietary needs.

On the bright side (without going too deep on details) what causes the radiation poisoning isn't the things hit by waves of radiation, it's the isotopes of radioactive material that floats in the air which irradiates the waves, technically you could just remove a layer of dirt from a place where a dirty nuclear bomb blew up right after the explosion and (provided that the isotopes on the air don't fall back again, which is what makes this impractical) you could plant normally in the area without side-effects (assuming that you are of course planting /away/ from the radiation emitted by the isotopes surrounding the area, the radiation can't contaminate the things in the area making them also radioactive, but they are very counterproductive for life in general, some places actually use radiation to kill life forms -bacteria's- on cans of food) and eat the food without fearing poisoning, this means that on the positive side magicals could vanish the isotopes to deal with the poisoning, on the negative the isotopes on a situation of a WWII would be too widespread for them to be able to vanish all of it and wind would just end bringing them back to decontaminated areas, plus the nuclear winter would still be very much a thing.

** Linkffn(How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Lord V)

Anytime I think about Voldemort and nuclear arms I think about this fic. It's likely going to be incomplete forever, however, having just reread it this year it certainly stands the test of time for me. I guess, warning, this writer really likes pairing Harry and Tom together, but the fic did end before getting that far.
