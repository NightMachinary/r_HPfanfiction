I've read few Dramione fics now and in each one of them Ron is either a cheater or a psycho rapist or both. They are 17 or 18 years old. Why can't I find one nice fic where they grow up to understand that what they had was pure but it's not what they want anymore and separate their paths a decent way wishing each other luck??? Why does every Dramione fics shows Ron as an asshole and Draco as a great knight in shining armour. I'd like to read some fics where Ron is good but it just didn't work out.


** It's never going to stop, because Ron's only purpose in those types of fics is as a foil and drama device, because the author doesn't know how to create conflict without him.

** I can't read dramione it breaks my sense of disbelief. Draco is a blood purist, why would he ever look to muggleborn Hermione as a love interest! To Hermione, Draco is bigoted, calls her mudblood, a bully and attempted murderer, why would she want to get involved with him? A relationship between these two makes no sense.

*** In canon, sure. But the point of fanfiction is to change things!

Canon Draco is a spoiled rich kid who idolizes his father and his ideology, and parrots what he's been taught. But at the same time, the tenants of that ideology are disproven fairly easily - and in the person of Hermione, at least in the idea that muggleborn are inferior (given her academic achievements).

It's possible to have the character evolve very differently than they did in canon - Hogwarts covers formative years, and I struggle to imagine that a 12 year old has their ideological view of the world fixed to a degree that there's 0 possibility of it ever changing. That'd be a pretty pessimistic and gloomy way of looking at people, IMO :(

**** I would argue that even 17 year old Draco, who realised he didn't want to be a murderer, found the murder of the muggle studies teacher difficult and tried to deny that the trio were his school mates, to his Death Eater family.

I think it's easy to forget sometimes how young they are and how difficult it would have been for someone like Draco to change their world view while living with a murderer (that loved him dearly). He was only 16 when Voldemort moved into his home and held meetings full of Death Eaters in there. Only 16 when he was told to murder one of the most powerful and knowledgeable wizards in the world, under threat of his parents being murdered.

Would it be easier to keep going through his life with the same beliefs? Absolutely.

Is it possible that he could change his mind? I think so. Especially when he now would need to align the memories of torture with his views of what those calling for blood supremacy actually meant by it. You can get PTSD by seeing things happen. Particularly given that the light side saved him. The fic would need to lay out a gradual change before the relationship started, but I do think it could happen.

Likewise, there would need to be some very strong character building on Hermione's part.

***** The reason I specify early on is that, at least during/after 6th year, he's already started to act as a Death Eater and done some pretty bad stuff. His canon (very slight) redemption arc does provide some sympathy, but not enough to lay the groundwork for a satisfying relationship with Hermione, I think.

If it's well written enough, it certainly can be done with almost any starting point - but I think it'd still need to go with a very charitable interpretation of his actions in years 5-7 to make it possible, which is still a change in my book.

** It might be because I've just watched La La Land and I happen to think the last 10 minutes of that movie are as close to perfect as an ending of a film gets, but even though I will ship Romione until the day I die, I would really like to read some stories post-canon, post-war where they simply grow apart but remain on good terms. Even if the characters don't end up together, they still shared something magical and wonderful and walked away to happiness and success on their own with warm feelings towards one another still.

I've only ever read one Dramione fic I liked and Ron was dead... I don't buy them as a romantic couple, but I LOVE stories where they are forced to work together or spend time with each other and spend the whole time winding each other up and taking sarcastic jabs at each other. They're my favourite!

** With Ron's general mistrust of Slytherins, and Draco in particular i can see why everyone does it.. Not to mention his outrage when Hermione went with Krum.. That seems like it would be a fraction of the shitstorm that would start if he caught her snogging Malfoy of all people..

**** Not disagreeing.. DraMione only really works 3 ways IMO: a more positive meeting prior to the sorting, a massive change of heart and absurd levels of forgiveness post-Voldemort or straight up total conversion AU..

***** I think you don't /need/ a more positive meeting prior to the sorting - the change though needs to come in during the first 3-4 years or so, and in a way that opens up Malfoy's eyes. It can certainly work (and Harry having a friendship with both Malfoy and Hermione is a very 'easy' vector to forcing them to interact and changing Malfoy's opinion), but it can also evolve from a bad initial relationship imo.

Canon Malfoy gets swept up into the only way that he knows/was raised - and by 5th-6th year, he's too far along to make it believable to switch suddenly (and has done some pretty iffy acts :/ ).

But the first few years, he's still a child, really. And even with people he's rivals with, I could see a realization creeping in that his upraising isn't exactly correct. Stuff like little tweaks earlier on (eg - being more jealous at Hermione's success in classes, which runs counter to the idea of purebloods being superior to muggleborn, or the basilisk paralyzing some of Draco's friends, showing that the Heir of Slytherin isn't /really/ that picky about who gets hurt as long as it gives him power). I think that we can take the initial reactions of the spoiled, bratty, blood-purist taught Malfoy and have the first few years change him slightly - to the point where, the first time that he's confronted with what his father's ideology /really/ means, it makes him balk.

That's my thinking, at least. I can see the appeal of a well done Dramione fic (similar to a well done Haphne one that doesn't have her as perfect from the start) - but to me, a lot of it would be in seeing the evolution of the character in a different way than canon, while still starting off with some enmity.

** As the (canon) romantic rival, Ron bashing is fairly prevalent within the fandom, but there is plenty of Dramione which either treats him more fairly or just doesn't dwell overlong on the character.

For that purpose, you may enjoy linkao3(16832419) Chosen, which treats every character involved as flawed and sympathetic. [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/perilous_circumstance/pseuds/perilous_circumstance/works?fandom_id=136512][perilous_circumstance]] also has several with the 'Ron Weasley is a good friend' tag.

  Draco Malfoy has a mission to complete, and no one can help him. Spending nights stuck on Prefect duty with Hermione Granger only adds to his problems. Doesn't it? Or is it possible that their unlikely relationship could alter the course of the Second Wizarding War -- if the Boy Who Made All the Wrong Choices can get this one thing right?Come for the medium-burn Dramione, stay for Magical lore and new twists on the canon we love (and love to change)COMPLETE!

It's a pretty new WIP. The writing is fantastic, the story is fresh, and Ron is----very very much like he is in the books. Hermione basically goes, sorry I think we missed our chance. And he's not pleased about it, but in a very canon Ron type of way.

Having said that, expecting good Ron in a Dramione fic is like trying to take out a lotus without getting mud on you. They're trying to make Draco and Hermione a couple. All the logic and canon characteristics goes out of the window at that.
