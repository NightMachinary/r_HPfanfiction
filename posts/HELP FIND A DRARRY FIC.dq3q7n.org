Ok so I've read this fic years ago and its haunting me ever since. I need to find it. It was so great.

So basically, it starts in summer, harry goes to muggle parties and tries drugs. When he comes to Hogwarts, hes made to live in the room of requirements because hes hated by everyone. He uses a glamour spell to cover his abuse (until snape eventually finds out) and draco is also made to live in the RoC with him. They end up bonding and there alot of alcohol , drug and disorders involved. HELP I'm desperate lol
