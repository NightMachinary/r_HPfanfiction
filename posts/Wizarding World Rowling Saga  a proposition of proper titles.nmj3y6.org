Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone should have been named Hermione Granger and the mystery of the third corridor.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets should have been named Hermione Granger mind against the mystery of the chamber of secrets.

Harry Potter and the Prisoners of Azkaban should have been Hermione Granger : between time travel and injustice.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix should have been named Hermione Granger and the anti-teaching conspiration.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows should have been named Hermione Granger a better leader that the hero.

Do you believe as I that Harry wasn't the true hero of this story but Hermione ?


** No.

Lol no. Also you forgot Gof and HBP, or as I would rename them:

- Hermione Granger get an older boyfriend
- Hermione Granger deals with jealousy

Because that's pretty much everything Hermione does in these books (what a protagonist).

**** It's easy to nitpick the scenes where one character shine :

- PS: Harry (and Hermione) only end up in the 3rd Floor Corridor because Ron accepted a duel with Draco on Harry's behalf. They also only pass McGonnagall protection because he sacrificed himself.
- CoS: Harry escape from the Dursley because Ron came to save him. And they only survived their trip to the forest because Ron had the idea to steal his father's car (which later saved them).
- PoA: Sirius escaped Azkaban (starting the plot) because he saw Ron (and his pet) in the newspaper.
- GoF: Ron is the one that Harry would miss the most, doesn't do much outside of that.
- OotP: take part in the DA, escape from the IS and then follow Harry to the DoM (plus the whole Quidditch subplot but who cares).
- HBP: He gets a girlfriend (yeah as usefull as Hermione in this one).
- DH: Save Harry's life, has the idea to return to the CoS when they lose the sword, and manage to somehow imitate Parseltongue.

Ron has also a lot of scenes, should we rename the books by "Ron Weasley and . . ." ?

​

Ron and Hermione are both important secondary character of the series (there is a reason why we talk about /The Trio/), but it's a fact that Harry is the protagonist.

- Ron and Hermione didn't fight Voldemort in PS, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't fight (and kill) a basilisk in CoS, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't protect Sirius against dementors in PoA, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't survive a duel with Voldemort or win the Triwizard Tournament in GoF, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't hear a Prophecy about them in OotP, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't spend a year studying Voldemort past in HBP, Harry did.
- Ron and Hermione didn't become Magical Jesus or kill Voldemort in DH, Harry did.

Ron and Hermione are part of the plot because Harry involve them. Harry is part of the plot because the plot exist around him. He is the protagonist.

***** Shouldn't the main protagonist be more knowledgeable of the events at play ? Because seriously if Hermione was chosen by Voldemort, Harry doesn't have anything to do in the story. Even the everyday hero should have something distinctive that only could do, but on this case he can not do anything without the brains of the Trio.

Yes, if Hermione had the fame of the Boy Who Lived, was a Parselmouth, had a mental connection with Voldemort, a Prophecy that tie them and have to survive several plot against her, then Harry would not have anything to do with the story.

Basically, "If Hermione took all the characteristics of Harry, then Harry wouldn't have anything to do in the story". That's like saying "If Harry was an annoying know-it-all that lived in the library, Hermione wouldn't have anything to do in the story.

​

And concerning Harry's quality, I would argue that his quality to love is his distinction (wouldn't bet on Hermione, or even Ron for that matter to pull the whole coming back from the Dead thing) but whatever. Did Harry won at the end? If the answer is yes, then he had all the quality he needed. And while Hermione plays the important role of being a glorified encyclopedia, in the end it's Harry that get shit done. That's why he is the Protagonist, and she isn't.

******** It's not our place to discuss this kind of things. In the story, Harry won so whatever quality he had were the right one. And I'll even add that, considering that more than 500 millions copy of the Harry Potter books were sold (ignoring the various movies, game and Spin off like Fantastic Beast), whatever decisions Rownling took when writing her serie were clearly the right ones.

********* If I was in Harry shoes, I do not think I would claim the victory as mine as I could not have made it without Hermione. And it is on this personal opinion that I think I will call the exit.

******** Have you ever read or watched anything but bad fanfiction? The vast majority of stories have multiple important characters with different skills, personalities, abilities, resources, and so on. If one character is solving every problem on their own, you've probably got a Mary Sue.

****** Alternatively, if Harry and Ron don't go to the bathroom or Hermione's a Ravenclaw, Hermione has nothing to do with the story.

Furthermore:

Harry realized why Hagrid had a dragon egg, found Nicolas Flamel's name, and confronted Voldemort. Harry connected Myrtle to the Chamber, found the Chamber, and faced TMR. Harry who performed the Patronus, (something Hermione canonically cannot do in front of dementors). Harry faced Voldemort in the graveyard alone. Harry had to teach the DA and did the decision making in the DoM. Harry paid attention to Malfoy. Harry found the remaining Horcruxes (Hermione didn't find any).

To suggest Harry (and Ron) couldn't do anything without Hermione, suggests you should re-read the books again.

** Yes. Harry & Ron wouldn't have made it past the devil's snare without Hermione. Plus, after Voldy chose Harry as his equal, Harry was always going to have to confront him. Hermione, however, was fighting (and constantly proving) for her place in a society that looked down on her. That doesn't mean that Harry and Ron weren't heroes though. Ron could have easily stayed out of trouble: pureblood, non important, etc. But he chose to fight for what he believed was right. And Harry took the heavy weight of being the one to destroy Voldy just as a child.
