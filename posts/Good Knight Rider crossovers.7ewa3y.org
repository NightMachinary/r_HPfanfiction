In the middle of the night I woke up pondering, if such a beautiful thing could exist. No Team Night Rider and not the thing that doesn´t exist from 2008.

*** A Harry Potter/Knight Rider crossover of course, if I read your "huh?" right.

**** Sorry, read this right before going to bed and it didn't make sense to me cause I was too tired to add the fact that I was on HPfanfiction to the title.

** Do you mean the original series from 1982 or the 2017 reboot? I remember running across a tangential crossover with the former several years back...

*** The reboot planned by James Gunn is not out yet, I think they just recently started production, there was something called Knight Rider heroes, but I don´t have a single clue what happened to the project or if it was just an elaborate hoax. I mean the original series from 1982.
