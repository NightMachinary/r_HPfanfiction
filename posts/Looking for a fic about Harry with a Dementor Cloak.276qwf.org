As the title asks, i once read fic in which from memory Neville was the 'chosen one' and Harry was the backup/secret weapon. Harry was in Azkaban and left with a Dementor cloak which he wears every where. Sadly i lost the link to the damn thing and can't find it again even with my super google skills. Anyone on the subreddit happen to have read it? Any help appreciated.


** I know that one. It took me some time to find it, since apparently I haven't added it to my favorites for some reason. (Not sure why, I remember enjoying it a lot.)

**** Gotta be the law of fanfiction. I'm still sad that The Santi's HP & The Boy Who Lived was abandoned =/.

***** I started reading Control anyway. Knowing that an abrupt end is coming just makes this worse.

*** Thank you so much, yep enjoyed just as much the second time around.

I guess the next question is are there any Fics similar to this?
