For the stories, if you have any recommendations, preferably gen, but I don't mind any pairings, as long as most of the story isn't focused on the romance. No...explicit material though, please.

As for the second part, I would like to write a story centered on Draco someday, I find him to be a very interesting character. So are there any tips or things to keep in mind while writing him?

Mainly, I'm struggling with the difference between Draco before and after trying to kill Dumbledore. It seems that there is a shift in his personality?

Thanks in advance for any replies.


** To me, canon Draco is someone who has no concept whatsoever of consequences. He's never had to deal with them in his life. His every whim at home is catered to by his parents spoiling the ever loving shit out of him, and at school his father's political power makes almost everyone treat him with kid gloves.

I honestly do not think that Draco UNDERSTANDS the concept of what he's saying when he calls for the extermination of muggle borns. He doesn't understand consequences, so the whole... 'These are human beings and I want them to die' doesn't... exactly compute that way in his head. He's parroting his daddy's words because doing so makes his daddy proud of him. He's been essentially raised to think there are no consequences to his actions or words, and that saying these things makes his parents happy.

Now, the Dumbledore thing might have been the first time he A: Saw that his father was NOT in control, because this was Voldemort's order and it was specifically given because Voldemort believed that Draco would fail and be killed. For the first time, not only were there direct and probably fatal consequences, but his Daddy's power meant /nothing/. It was a slap in the face, made worse by the fact that Draco believed he had no one he could confide in, nobody to help. His father, the most powerful person in his life, was pathetically helpless next to Voldemort's orders.

So not only does Draco suddenly have to kill the single most powerful wizard in the world, but he was expected to die trying, and his daddy couldn't do a thing to stop him. He simultaneously had to deal with consequences AND a loss of faith in the single most important person who shaped his entire life.

Honestly, it COULD have been a fascinating character arc if done properly. But it wasn't done properly at all.

*** That is the best explanation of Draco I've seen before. That makes a lot of sense...the "no concept of consequences" thing I've never seen brought up before, but that explains a lot. Most people seem to say he was bullied or something or other, but that seemed slightly off because in the books it looked like he was pampered beyond what normal people get.

I'm a bit sad JKR didn't delve into his character more, but from what I've seen in interviews she kind of hates him, more or less. What would you have liked to see in a properly done character arc for Draco?

And thanks for the explanation, that helped a lot!

**** So, if you wanted a Draco centric work, keep everything prior to the order the same. There's no need to change that because he doesn't change until then.

Tell everything before the order in flashback, with a better understanding of what he now realizes.

Then the skies the limit. I've read stories where there's in insight into how his life changed but they didn't flesh it out fully and focused on others.

He can't turn to any house mate (possibly flesh Daphne out better as make her an ally) so he feels trapped. He's shown to be a respectable wizard power wise, so find some student he can inadvertently confide in, and explore that option.

***** Do you have any fics you would recommend reading? I've read a few, but it seems they differ wildly in how Draco acts; sometimes he is shown as a stoic, hard faced person who continues to mock others in an effort to appear strong or in control of himself, while others show him in tears or full of terror, a very broken person I suppose. I've had a hard time figuring out where to draw the lines, the books hardly show anything of him, besides the manor scenes, the bathroom scene, Dumbledore scene, and Draco's confrontation with Harry in the Room of Requirement. And in those scenes, he seemed to be more likely to wear his heart on his sleeve: in the manor, he was clearly terrified; the bathroom, he lashed out very quickly once he noticed Harry; Dumbledore, he tried to put on false bravado but his wand hand shook very badly and as Harry noted, seemed bizarrely reassured by Dumbledore's praise of him; Room of Requirement, he was almost like his old self except that he openly cared about Crabbe, Goyle, and to a certain extent, Harry, along with screaming his head off during the broom escape.

From this it seems as if Draco is somewhat of a coward, that he doesn't have such a calm personality as some people write him as. But at the same time he's also very adamant to save face, and tries to appear tough. It's a very shaky line I think, and I haven't seen anyone write him with both characteristics yet---although to be fair I haven't read that many fics.

Edit: I forgot the scene where he was begging the Death Eater to spare him, and trying to convince the man that he was on their side.

****** Honestly how people write Draco is totally all over the place. It really depends on what aspect of his personality authors really want to focus on. He is a very complex character (like most of JKR's creations). Personally, it sounds like you have a good grasp of the character as it is.

He's stoic in fics because that's how Malfoys act in public. Just like Lucius, Draco tries to show a cool facade to the public. The tears and terror are what lurks below that mask and what appears when he's alone (Myrtle's bathroom, for example). Draco is a coward, in general. He spent his school years hiding behind his goons. Also it appears that Draco spent a lot of time trying to live up to his father's standards and failing, whether it's coming in behind a Muggleborn in academics or failing to catch the Snitch against Harry. I think even though he tries very hard to appear confident and unflappable (Malfoy Mask), he is actually quite insecure inside.

During his Death Eater time, he realized that his father is not infallible. High and mighty Lucius Malfoy was brought to his knees and humiliated by the Dark Lord. I'm sure that in and of itself shook Draco to the core and made him question some things in his life. He was terrified practically his whole time as a Death Eater. He could talk the Death Eater talk but could not walk the walk.

I do not believe he is evil. He is definitely misguided by his upbringing. There's a huge amount of potential for redemption on Draco's part should an author choose to go that route.

As far as a fic, to me, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] has been my favorite Draco by far. But unfortunately, it is a romance (Dramione) and there is explicit material so it doesn't completely fit your criteria. I had to mention it though because the author wrote a fantastic Draco.

That's a very insightful explanation, especially the part about how he has constantly failed to live up to his father's standards, and that his faith in his father was severely shaken at his father's downfall.

Well, I'll take a look at that fic in any case, thanks! Does the author label chapters containing the explicit material or is it just scattered throughout?

******** There are author notes at the beginning of some chapters warning of explicit material but I'm not sure if the author was diligent with the warnings or not. I hope you enjoy it. :)

****** Sadly I don't. Like I said, the other docs were not focused on him and middling in quality at best.

Mine were more suggestions for your own writing.

** Based on the way he was written in HBP and DH, I think of Draco as a very spoiled kid who was so sheltered by his parents' money and arrogance that he didn't understand much about the realities of life at all. He learned a little bit through the first five books as the Gryffindors dealt him the occasional lesson in humility, but he could always retreat back to the Slytherin common room where he probably heard nothing that he didn't already believe.

Then his father was arrested in the Department of Mysteries and everything changed. The Ministry probably came down hard on his family and the Dark Lord was furious with Lucius for losing the prophecy. When Voldemort marked Draco and ordered him to kill Dumbledore, it wasn't an expression of confidence in the boy, it was a punishment for Lucius. Voldemort never expected Draco to succeed, he expected him to either die trying to carry out his orders or he expected him to fail and then die as a punishment.

Draco had to grow up really fast in order to survive. He put aside most of his childish taunting and bullying of the Gryffindors in HBP so he could focus on his mission. I imagine that he was barely at Hogwarts during the school year of DH. As a marked Death Eater, he was probably going on more suicide missions for Voldemort.

If you're interested, I wrote a story about Draco between the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the night that he receives his Dark Mark:

You may not find this one as interesting, being that it's a romantic story, but here's another one about Draco's recovery after the war:

** I found the characterization of Draco in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5533537/1/Four-o-clock-in-the-morning][Vera Rozalsky's Four-o-clock in the Morning]] story to be interesting. The story isn't only focused on Draco but he plays a big role, and it explores both the psychological fallout from the events of the later Potter books as well as the fallout that comes with his being disillusioned about the certanties he was raised with, discovering some skeletons in the malfoy family closet, etc.
