** I suppose it wouldn't be too different from what would happen to a normal person. If the look is indirect, the Horcrux creator would be petrified until the treatment arrives; if the look is direct, the creator's body would die but he or she would live on as a spirit, until either resurrection or the destruction of the Horcrux.

** They would die, and their wraith form would be petrified. Not irreversible, but it'd essentially be a sealed evil in a can: only a moron would unpetrify the wraith.

Which means they'll be unpetrified within a week, knowing the Wizarding World and their view on common sense. Why did Peter decide it was a good idea to head to Voldemort's wraith, knowing his nature and the fact that he wasn't exactly loyal in first place, again?

Hope for glory. I mean, being the one that brought the glorious fallen leader back from the dead... fits into why Peter went with the Marauders in the first place.

** They would die and become a shade until someone performed the resurrection ritual for them.

** Probably the exact same thing than what would happen when a person without an Horcrux looks into the eyes of a basilisk : death. Except that, rather than "going into the light", this person would be stuck into a wraith like form just like Voldemort did.

** Hell, why don't you just give them an indirect look, petrify them, and keep them that way forever?
