** Have you read [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][A Year Like None Other]] by aspeninthesunlight? It's a Snape-adopts-Harry story (trilogy, really) and it is long and complex and ridiculously well thought-out and generally amazing. Snape's characterisation as a sympathetic and many-faceted man is very well written.

** I won't deny my eyes lit up when I saw this request. I can't speak to recent Drarry fics, but I went through the last few Snarry-A-Thon masterlists and pulled links to the stories I particularly liked. There are some new authors in the fandom and they're writing brilliant stuff.

I've never posted to Reddit before, so I'm hoping I haven't mangled the code too much.

** I know this post is nearly a month old but I was searching for Drarry recs tonight and discovered it. I'm bookmarking your list and I thought I would share my favorites. I should note that I'm sort of a softie for a good romance. I really enjoy when a writer expands on the canon universe and creates something new. No creature fics here but hopefully you'll find something you like.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2777316/1/Let-s-Pretend-the-War-Is-Over][Let's Pretend the War is Over]] - Probably my favorite. Absolutely heartbreaking and incredibly well executed.

[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600097164][This Worship of an Extinct Fire]] - This one is amazing and goes way beyond the original canon series.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5601&chapter=1&font=&size=][Starts with a Spin]] - Sex in every chapter and very entertaining.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/rhysenn/IP.html][Irresistible Poison]] - Not as polished as the others, but Draco's pain over Harry is palpable and worth reading.

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=11729][What You Do With Your Life, A.H.K.B.C.B. (After the Hero Kills the Batshit Crazy Bastard)]] - Strong!Harry with lots of very funny moments.

[[http://www.ocht.hdhols.com/for_fireflavored.html][Here's the Pencil, Make it Work]] - Effeminate!Draco, which is not usually my preference, but I found the characterizations strong and enjoyed the story.

[[http://trickster.org/res/transfig.html][Transfigurations]]Another one where Draco is more effeminate than I prefer, but the story is very well crafted and compelling.

[[http://rickey-a.dreamwidth.org/205541.html][And an Owl Named Romeo]] - Lovely romance.

[[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=16875][Breaking All the Rules]] - Post-Hogwarts, and the gang's gotten into swinging.

Lastly, I hope it's not poor manners to link to my own fics. I exclusively write Drarries and I've gotten positive feedback. My profile on fanfiction.net is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Evivacissimovoce][vivacissimovoce]]. My favorites of my own are:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036800/1/P-T-Muggle-Adventures][P&T Muggle Adventures]] - Post-Hogwarts, Harry and Dean start a travel agency

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8979551/1/Beyond-the-Mirror-s-Edge][Beyond the Mirror's Edge]] - Harry has been zapped out of existence and Draco has to solve the mystery of his disappearance

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9291354/1/Seeker-Chaser-Keeper][Seeker, Chaser, Keeper]] - Harry and Draco go out for a pro Quidditch team

and

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9401460/1/Bringing-up-Weasley][Bringing up Weasley]] - Whoops, Ron's a baby. Who's going to take care of him until he grows up? Almost crackfic but not quite.

** I don't read a lot of slash, but [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]] and its sequel [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/Foundations][Foundations]] were what convinced me that Drarry could be done well.

**** I prefer AU and no graphic but I'm okay with anything that isn't all like "I hate you" first chapter and "I love you so much" with no build up at all. I don't care if it is a one line build up just have a build up people!

Sorry about my rant...

Thanks, and I'm prepared!
