1.  Take care of your body. Eat right, work out. Run laps around Scottish lakes. Maybe consider a martial art.
2.  Take your studies seriously. Read ahead. The syllabus is only a starting point, you can find other texts.
3.  Treasure the moments you have with family and friends.
4.  Beware the lies and manipulations of old white men.
5.  Be courteous to financial professionals, but never fully trust them.
6.  Money spent on quality luggage is a good investment.\\
7.  People will judge you by how you dress. That sucks, but that's just how it is.
8.  Having friends in different social circles is beneficial, even if in junior high they sat at different tables.
9.  Try to talk out problems rather than resulting to violence. May even work on enormous scaly monsters and dragons.
10. Meditation can help clear your mind (and helps your blood pressure).

** Also, a few lessons that you /won't/ learn from re-do fics:

1. The world does not revolve around you
2. People won't treat you better just because you're a nice guy; they usually want something
3. No one devotes their time and energy solely to someone else's success- we are all in this for ourselves
4. Confronting a bully with the truth will not stop them from hurting you
5. Money that sits unused has little value
6. Skills, like friendships, require regular maintenance or they atrophy

**** Your gym example is a good one. And it's not so much the instructions being incomplete but the fact that the trainee has neither the experience nor the perspective to understand them correctly. The book instructions can be as clear and complete as they want, if you have never lain on a weight bench to press weights you will not position your limbs correctly, you will not grip correctly and you will not be able to judge how much weight is too little and how much weight is too much, how many repetitions at this particular weight are beneficial and how many are just wasted effort.

Not sure about this one. Most re-do fics have Harry going on murderous rampages and ranting at everyone around him.

That said: yes, re-do fic protagonists do have an unhealthy manner of holding the reader to high standards of behaviour which they then cannot achieve IRL. Most of the arguments to try hard at studying magic also apply to study IRL, albeit with less instant gratification. But no one can study like the machine that is indy!Harry.

**** Buying nice luggage always seems unnecessarily extravagant until you actually /need/ it. Then it's wonderful.

I always hated how over-powered trunks were in HP fic. Then I watched Fantastic Beasts. JFC, looks like I was on the losing side of that argument. Why was Harry so bothered by going back to the Dursleys? Get yourself a trunk or a tent, kid. Ignore everyone else for 2 months. Head back to Hogwarts. Canon Harry */is/* kind of dumb.
