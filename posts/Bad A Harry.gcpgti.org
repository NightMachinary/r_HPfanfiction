I love stories where Harry is ruthless with his enemies but it always seems that he ends up superpowered. I would love to see a fix where he learned some hand to hand combat due to his interactions with Harry hunting and in his first altercation with Malfoy disarms him and then snaps his wand. When he is brought before Dumbledore and Snape, Snape pulls his wand and Harry repeats the process. For some reason the idea of Harry just snapping people's wands left and right makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. I feel like this idea would be most at home in a crack fic but would love to see someone better at writing than me take a stab at it.


** If I'm remembering correctly, there's plenty of wand-snapping in linkffn(Almost a Squib by BajaB), but I don't think it's 100% in line with the ruthless harry you're looking for.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
