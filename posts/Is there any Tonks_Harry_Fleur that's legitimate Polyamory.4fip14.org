So...yeah. Exactly what the title's saying. I don't want harem. I don't want a story where Tonks and Fleur both want Harry and just decide to share, I want legitimate polyamory, where everybody in the trio loves everybody else. I admit that Tonks/trans!Harry or fem!Harry/Fleur is my OT3, but I accept that if I want that I'll have to write it myself.


** Linkffn(three sheets by chilord) has a lot of plot for a Honkeur story.

  Sirius and Remus catch Harry prior to his fifth year at Hogwarts to give him The Talk. He might not need it as much as they think. AU Rated MA for a reason, though not too graphic

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
