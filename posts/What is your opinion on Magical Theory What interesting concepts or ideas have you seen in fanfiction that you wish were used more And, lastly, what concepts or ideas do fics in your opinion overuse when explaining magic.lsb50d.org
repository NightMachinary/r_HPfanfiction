** I love magical theory, its my favorite aspect of the fandom.

​

I like the idea that wand based magic was invented by the Romans, and that it is the dominant form of magic in countries that were controlled by Rome. Worldwide, countries that were effected more by European Imperialism see stronger use of wand magic over their own magical cultures.

​

I also like the idea that magic is at its most basic is and artform that's all about willpower, intent, and symbolism rather than hard rules. Poetry not Mathematics. There are rules that define what is a limerick and what is a haiku, but there aren't formulas that can be used to make good poetry. There are wand movements and incantations for spells, but the quality of the spell comes from the intent, willpower, and creativity of the caster.

​

Last one for this post, I like the magical theory/analogy that says casting spells is like ____ artform. Pottery for example. When you set out to make a piece of pottery as a beginner, many things are required to succeed, written instructions, verbal guidance, tools, an example of the finished product, etc. Each of these is comparable to things like a wand, wand movement, incantation, etc.

An experienced potter can make many different things without instructions, verbal or otherwise, and can customize and modify things on the fly. Just like an experienced wizard can cast spells with a generic wave of their wand and no incantation. That being said, there is a difference between what you can make with a pottery wheel and a full set of tools than what you can make with just clay and your hands. So wandless magic is possible, but more limited in what it can accomplish.

** Tbh, I've always found the idea of a "magical core" to be overused, and also kind of confusing; if you ran a long way and got tired - you wouldn't say "my stamina core is spent" you'd say "I'm exhausted" or something to that effect.

*** Actually, when there's a visible indicator, it's pretty normal to say, "I ran out of health/MP/stamina/hearts." Even outside video games, it's normal to say that a phone "ran out of charge".

So if magical cores are readily observable, I think "my magical core is almost empty" would be a normal thing to say.

**** I definitely agree with the fact that people use analogies like that to describe how they feel, I think the part that throws me is the term "core" it always confused me how there isn't really a thing such as a "stamina core" or "health core" but a magical one seems to exist.

***** Well, mundane bodily functions are generally centred in an organ - the heart is the core of your circulation, the brain is the core of your nervous system, etc. It would perhaps be reasonable to come up with a specific name for the equivalent magical nexus - I think chakra has such terms? - but in the absence of a standard widely-accepted name, I don't have a problem with just using a descriptive term.

**** That does help me make some sense of it, I just feel like describing it as a core is bit of a step further than simply "I ran out of energy".

****** In that case, even as a figure of speech - I find it to be a bit too overused and, as you can probably tell from my earlier comments, unclear in fanfics I've read. Thanks for the help though! (Although with how often it's used and the phrasing that tends to surround it I might struggle to not think of it as a literal core).

** I'm quite fond of Numerology and Calculation based Magic, though I might be biased as my favourite Anime is Nanoha, and I'd like to see that kind of Magic as what Arithmancy is, rather than "stuff Muggles can do and using numbers to predict things" that it is in canon, or Spellcrafting that it is in fanon.

** I love the concept that magic is sentient, for example in Dobby's Deceit. The idea that magic is alive and not just a form of reality warping opens up doors to bring in spirits, gods etc. that deal with magic (or even magic as a deity). I also like the idea of Intent shaping magic more than wand movements or words. I think one fic I read stated that the wand movements and the words help your unconscious mind shape the magic through intent, or something like that. As far as overused idea's that annoy me, I can't think of any off the top of my head. Ideas involving magic and how it works don't really bother me.

*** I agree with you on this. Even if it's not /truly/ sentient, my headcanon is that it at least knows what the caster wants from it. Like the patronus charm. The patronus can go chase dementors off, stay by the caster, or just frolic. It's the same charm, but what it does can vary depending on what the caster needs.

** The Pureblood Pretense has magical affinities; some people's magic is naturally "dark" - fast and direct - while others' is "light", more precise and graceful. Some people's magic is more wild, other people's may be more orderly and quiescent.

The differences between pure-blood and muggle-born are really about wildness, but have been tangled up in politics, originally because Purebloods felt threatened by people whose magic wasn't completely controlled and obedient, but later just because of ingrained prejudice.

** I love it. I recently read a few good fics in which it played a part and I can't get enough when it's well written. For example in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402147][Death of Today]] (Harry Potter/Lord Voldemort Soo good. Dark Harry, great worldbuilding, the only real drawback is that Harry is called Izar in this but it all makes sense and you get quickly used to it. Highly rec if you like Death Eater Harry and Slashfics) we get a Ravenclaw Harry who later works as an Unspeakable. Harry invents spells wich are pretty cool and later tries to make fake Horcruxes for plot-reasons. I really liked those aspects, the spell creating and the pseudo science even though it wasn't the main plot. Also magical sensitivity is a part of it which was integrated pretty well - wardbreaking and stuff.

What I also find really cool is in some fanfics the science behind portraits is discussed, sometimes there are people introduced who can see souls and are thus the only ones able to paint magical portraits.

I also recently read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440][Unfogging the Future]] which is a Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle fic which was absolutely brilliant. I didn't expect it to work as well as it did, which while it doesn't delve as much into magical theory, really paints a cool picture of seers and had pretty cool worldbuilding in that department and I wish there were similar fics out there.

Overall tropes which are commonly used are Soulbonds, magical sensitivity, magical core lore --> dark cores, light cores etc. Overall any topuc can be written brilliantly or messed up and since most people like to interpret stuff differently we don't often get an exact replica of something.

Personally I really like it when people expand on something we've got in canon. For example the art of Potion making, Time travel, Cursebreaking, invention of spells, Divination, Runes (for example used to tie wards down or to get brooms to fly or something.) Arithmathy etc. What I actually find pretty funny is that with Runes most people in fanfic have universally agreed on the fact that they are used to make spells last longer or that they are used to make wards. Also wardstones are a thing in fanfic i think.

Also another comcept I read about and really liked was that house elves come into being when a magical building gains enough sentience amd leftover magic after years if use. I think in the same fic I read about how expansion charms don't hold forever, for example they have to be stitched into bags or if you want to expand a building you have go almost coax a room to grow overtime and that every house-owner does it in their own risk which is why old manors hold so much menaning to the families.

In another fic I read magical theory was a subject taught in Hogwarts and it was really more a hypothetical subject. People were discussing How squibs came into being and what might be a reason for Muggleborns to pop up.

Overall I love it when magical theory is part of a fanfic if it is part of the worldbuilding. It doesn't even have to be a main part.

** One of my favorites is Harry Potter and the Weasley Seer, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Weasley seer), where, like above, magic is based on intent and belief. The ability to warp reality by waving a stick around is kind of silly, but no more so than any other method.

A different understanding (about artifacts this time, so feel free to skip) is that the Deathly Hallows all make death kinda happen. The wand whispers into the mind, encouraging the user into violence.

The stone encourages suicide by drawing up facsimiles of the people the user calls for (seriously, James and Lily /encouraging/ Harry to waste the life they died for, for backwards-ass, abusive as fuck, magic England? Nah, homie)

And the cloak, while seemingly the most useful, brings about death around the owner. "Greeting Death like an friend" implies a familiarity. I guess the monkey paw twist is that while /you/ may be able to hide/be shielded from death for a while, but the people around you aren't.
