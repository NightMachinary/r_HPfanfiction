It would've been dark if, when Snape was dying, Harry said ‚Äúnow you're really the half-blood prince‚Äù, because he only had half his blood left


** Just in the brink of time Ron manages to throw a reducto at Fenrir, and even in the mess of spells flooding the Great Hall, the explosion that turns the werewolf to pieces still turns plenty of faces.

"Howl did you like that?!" shouts Ron.

"Oh, what's the big deal, Hermione? He had no issues killing our own people. He knew this could happen to him when he bloody joined Voldemort! He was aware wolf!"

** My favourite Harry Potter joke remains a meme from no later than 2013:

you have found Tom Riddle's calculator; this will be much harder to stab [written on the screen of a graphic calculator]

Or possibly the toilet graffiti from school: "the chamber of secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir beware". I swear, basically the only memorable toilet graffiti I've seen.
