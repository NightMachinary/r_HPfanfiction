This is possibly the least important question ever asked here - and that's saying something - but how do you all think the word "Erised" as in the Mirror of Erised is pronounced?

These days I tend to use FF.net's audio feature on the mobile app to listen to stories and it always comes out with something that sounds like "arise" plus a "d". I've always thought it was "eri" plus "said".

Actually reversing the word would suggest something closer to "ire" plus "sid".

And yes I have been drinking. Thanks for asking.

** I listened to the audiobooks approximately 300x as a kid, so I pronounce it how Jim Dale did: [eɹəsɛd], which I would transcribe without using IPA as air-uh-said

Edit: someone want to explain what's wrong with Jim Dale?

*** Apparently there's a rivalry between Stephen Fry and Jim Dale, the two people who have done the audio books for the Harry Potter series.

Stephen Fry did the UK version.

Jim Dale did the USA version.

***** Jim Dale is the narrator in the US audiobook versions of the HP books, which are not only widely beloved and critically acclaimed but also probably the best-selling audiobooks of all time.

There is also a Stephen Fry version, only available in the UK.

Most reasonable people think both versions are delightful. Notable difference is that Fry reads the book like a grandfatherly storyteller, while Dale reads the book like an actor (with distinctive voices for each character).

******** It's totally subjective, and I realize I'm in the minority here, most people love him. His female voices were just gratingly high-pitched to me, and I found the intonation really weird, totally different from how I "read" it in my head, to the point that I felt it changed the meaning. Especially with Hermione. I actually started with tOotP, so I don't think I ever stuck with it long enough to hear his McGonagall, but I hear he's pretty good at that one.

** "Eros," as in erotic love, and "sed" as in the unix stream editor. The Mirror of Erised is a stream editor, processing one's deepest feelings of erotic love.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

Because it's sticky.
