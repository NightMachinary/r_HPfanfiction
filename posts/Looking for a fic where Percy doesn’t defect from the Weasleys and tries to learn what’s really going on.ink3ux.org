:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I was reading it but accidentally cleared all the tabs on Chrome a while back.

I think it was on AO3 and had the word “Assistant” in the title, but I'm not entirely sure on the second part.

It's before or during OoTP. Chapter 1 has Percy going to the Burrow to tell his parents he got promoted. Arthur and Molly are suspicious but Percy confesses that he really needs this promotion as a pick me up after what happened in GoF. They reluctantly accept that Percy needs this and Percy concedes that he'll be careful, so no Arthur/Percy row or Percy leaving (he does leave but it's on good terms).

Some chapters later he meets up with the Golden Trio to discuss the Dark Lord's return. Some more chapters later Percy meets up with Amelia Bones to discuss an investigation into Harry's story.

Main characters that I think are tagged are: Percy, Arthur, Amelia (?).

EDIT: I found it!

It's called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23215195/chapters/55577569][The Assistant]] by MsAngelAdorer on AO3 and FFN. It's incomplete and I don't think the author is going to finish it, which is disappointing since I thought the fic had a lot of potential. I also got the tags wrong, it had: Percy Weasley, Oliver Wood, Penelope Clearwater, and Cornelius Fudge tagged. Just to name a few.

*** Actually, I would be interested in the result even if the author of this question finds it.

**** It was a while back and I think it was an incognito tab.
