I'm open to any pairing (slash included) that is beautifully developed, with these being my preferred ones: Harry/Draco, Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Neville/anyone, Lily/James, Lily/Snape, Remus/Tonks, Remus/Sirius, Andromeda/Ted (yes, I've read 'A Keen Observer').

I'd rather not read Harry/Hermione, Snape/Hermione and Snape/Harry but if there's a fic that's just so great you think even someone who dislikes the ship would love it, feel free to rec.

I'd love if the fic leaned towards humour rather than angst as its secondary genre. Also if there's a plot other than the romance (e.g. wizarding world politics, dark forces, etc.), I really enjoy that too.

** You could take a peep at children of the shadows fics. They're rl/sb with bits of LExJP too. Momentum is well known.

But she's a great story teller. Fore warning though, some of the stories are very AU. But she mentions it in the descriptions.

** "Before the Fawn" and "The Life and Times" are fanFREAKINGtastic Lily/James fics that keep you on the edge of your seat. They make you cry and laugh, and so angry because they aren't completed yet. Blast! But I recommend them if you like epic 5 million word+ stories.
