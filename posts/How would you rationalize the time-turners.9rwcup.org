As in explain how a thirteen year old muggle-born could get one, purely for academic basis where there is actual chance a lot of people knows it's existence? Then they just doesn't even talk about such a thing for 2 more books other than the explanation that they were all destroyed.

Where are the older students who know about time-turners? Was Tom Riddle a genius prodigy given a similar option? Or does he not know that there exists locket like devices which literally bend space time to make things happen? Why aren't there enough stories where the villain gets to use all the time travel shit?

​

What about other countries? Do Americans have time-turners? If so, have anybody tried to smuggle one inside a country where smuggling a baby dragon by three eleven year old's is possible?


** This is one of the reasons I don't use time turners in my story. But now that I think about it, I think there's an explanation.

Consider JKR's statement that Hermione had the /only/ time turner ever brought into Hogwarts. And yet, other students besides Hermione have successfully taken 12 classes before--Percy for sure. Also consider that the core class teachers all have to teach 12 classes. They can't be using time turners. People would definitely notice that.

And finally, Hermione doesn't just have class conflicts. She has /specific/ conflicts. Divination, Arithmancy, and Muggle Studies are all at the same time. If there is only one section of each of those classes, /no one/ would be able to take them together, even if they aren't taking all the classes. If there is more than one section, it's possible that Hermione can't switch sections because she's taking so many classes, and any combination creates conflicts.

I think the solution is that it's not normal to need a time turner to take all the classes. There was a specific scheduling conflict that year that made it impossible for Hermione to do without one. And we have a good candidate: Remus. Exactly when werewolves transform is inconsistent in canon, but he wouldn't want any classes at night because he'd miss even more teaching time, and it would be more noticeable. And in Scotland in December, sunrise is at 9 am, and sunset is at 3:30 pm.

So Remus's classes are all pushed to the middle of the day, and since Defence is a required class, the electives get pushed to the edges, where they overlap just enough that Hermione can't make all of them fit in a normal schedule.

As for villains using them, well I would reject JKR's statement that time turners can change history and go with the implied explanation in Book 3 that they create a closed time loop, so they aren't as useful as they sound.

This is one I'm just going to ignore. I don't normally do this but I love the idea that the Wizarding World is routinely so crazy as to issue time-machines to kids too much.

That's two different types of Time-Turners, though. The standardized Time-Turners issued by the Unspeakables are engineered to create only time loops as a "safety procedure"; it's experimental, wild, more dangerous time-travel that can change the past.

They are limited to 5 hours because the Department of Mysteries has decided that's the maximum amount without a significant risk to Time etc.

Dumbledore and Hermione both warn against what can happen when using a Time Turner which implies that they both at least believe that the past (if only the last 5 hours of it) can be changed.

***** No, I merely think that the safety only goes so far and that you have to show some goodwill for the closed time loop to work. So that if you deliberately go out and meet yourself in the past, it won't so much change the past as cause a paradox, with the ensuing temporal backlash having possibly drastic consequences for all involved.

****** Let's assume for a moment that the original timeline is indeed completely fixed (i.e. it can't be changed, whatever you do when traveling back in time already happened exactly like that). When you travel back in time, you have to conform exactly to what already happened. If that is the case then whatever you do is already predestined, you literally cannot "deliberately go out and meet yourself in the past", therefore you can't cause a paradox. If you /can/ cause a paradox then you need freedom to do things differently, at which point there is only one "original" timeline but infinitely many possibilities for what you do and the probability that what you do conforms to the one original timeline is zero. Assuming that when you travel back, you either exactly conform to the original timeline or you cause a paradox, then all time travel will always cause a paradox.

I can see only one way the time travel description in Canon works: When you travel back in time and change things so they are differently from before traveling back, reality is rewritten to include these changes and your memories get changed accordingly. This is how Harry remembers seeing himself cast the Patronus even though at that point in his personal timeline that event had not happened yet.

There is also the time travel description from HPMOR (yes, I know) which if I recall correctly makes it so that changes due to time travel happen the moment the time traveler commits to traveling back and doing these changes. For example, in HPMOR Harry is locked in a room and commits to later traveling back and causing his own rescue and then promptly gets rescued. Afterwards he has to actually go through with his commitment or he would probably cause a paradox. While I like this time travel definition, it does not work for Canon since the Patronus was cast before Harry committed to his time travel.

Per /Pottermore/ and statements and /Cursed Child/ and probably more things I'm forgetting, it is absolutely possible to change the timeline with magic, it's just dangerous and unpredictable, hence why Time-Turner are /artificially/ meant to make self-consistent time loops.

******** Time-Turners are /not/ artificially meant to make self-consistent time loops. They merely "stabilize" a hour-reversal charm and limit it to 5 hours.

From Pottermore ([[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner]]):

#+begin_quote
  Even the use of the very limited amount of Time-Turners at the Ministry's disposal is hedged around with hundreds of laws. While not as potentially dangerous as skipping five centuries, the re-use of a single hour can still have dramatic consequences and the Ministry of Magic seeks the strictest guarantees if it permits the use of these rare and powerful objects.
#+end_quote

To ensure self-consistent time loops the Time-Turners would have to enforce a strictly unchangeable timeline, denying the free will of the time traveler, which would make all those "hundreds of laws" quite useless. No point in telling people not to do certain things while time traveling when they have no control anyways.

​

Also, causal loops suck.

********* It's not directly stated that the way they "stabilized" the Charm is through forcing time loops, but I'm arguing that it's the most reasonable extrapolation from the facts that:

- we're told that Time-Turners "stabilize" the Hour-Reversal Charm somehow;
- other, non-Unspeakable-"stabilized" forms of time travel like the Eloise Mintumble experiment and Nott's Time-Turner from /Cursed Child/ don't have time loops but instead cause wild changes to the timeline;
- Time-Turners cause time loops.

That a bunch of additional rules are needed /on top of/ the time-loop-causing is simply a testament to how dangerous and complex time-travel is in the /Harry Potter/ universe.

They cause such wild changes because they go back more than 5 hours. The Unspeakables consider 5 hours the maximum amount of time to go back without risking serious damage to yourself or time.

​

I assume that with "time loop" you mean that whatever you do when traveling back in time with a time turner is exactly that which already happened before traveling back, enforced through the magic of the time turner. If that is not what you mean then please elaborate on what exactly you mean, otherwise please re-read my previous comment.

They are still super useful though: They give you huge amounts of time to figure something out. They allow you to go somewhere and witness events that you just discovered after the fact. The potential for spying is enormous. Aurors should definitely use them to solve crimes.

** Firstly, I see them as a relatively new invention, that has barely seen any testing outside the DoM when Hermione got hold of one. My theory is that Hermione was "beta-testing" it, and her use was somewhat similar to how they expected it to be used in the ministry: increasing employee availability during busier times of day without having to hire people who'd sit around doing nothing most of the time. Hermione was picked because she was the only one who signed up for all classes that year, and Dumbledore, who's got friends in the DoM, got wind of it.

I suppose it's easy to ignore Percy's OWL results as early installment weirdness, but I expect that he didn't attend all the classes he ended up taking the OWL exam for.

#+end_quote

Tom Riddle may have been a prodigy, but he certainly wouldn't have taken Muggle Studies, and I highly doubt that he took Divination, or he would have been more sensible about the Prophecy. Remember, the Time-Turner was only needed because Hermione had decided to take /all/ the electives.

#+begin_quote

Well, it's believed by many that Barty Jr. had one, and possibly Percy as well.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Messing with time is /dangerous/ --- there's a reason only an /extremely/ trustworthy student like Hermione got the option. It was seriously putting the timeline in jeopardy to abuse it to save Harry and Sirius, and actually trying to change the past nearly caused a time-crash when Unspeakables experimented on it.

Hence, it is /extremely ill-advised/ to use Time-Turners for combat. Especially since it might entice your enemies to obtain their own Time-Turners and fight back.

Paradoxes and other faulty time-manipulation can erase people from existence (it's called being "unborn"), and thus would be one of the few threats to Voldemort's existence while his Horcruxes were intact (Dementors being the other). I think he'd steer well clear of time-travel, and, in the event of managing to conquer Wizarding Britain, he probably would have destroyed all Time-Turners. +Except one to use as a Horcrux.+

#+begin_quote
  What about other countries? Do Americans have time-turners?
#+end_quote

Probably not, since the British Unspeakables developed them. But they developed them using a variation of the existing, more dangerous Hour-Reversal Charm, so foreign wizards might still be able to time-travel that way, or build their own, more or less different time-machines.

And regarding Voldemort using one. We know he can go for convoluted plans, right? Being stacked up against the odds? The entire plot of fourth book.

** Time Turners are dangerous, but not dangerous enough to not entrust them to trustworthy students like Hermione. Because a timeturner doesn't "re-do" anything. Its mere existence creates timeloops which makes it seem to 3D creatures like humans, as if things happen twice when they are the ones looping time. To bystanders it only happens once. Timelooping is also not a deletion of time, its just a step back for the universe in order to make the step twice. So you can't timeturn your birth away, for example.

I also believe that timeturners are used more often than we see in the HP universe. Ministry personell, Heads of Departments, Aurors and down to students the faculty of Hogwarts deems capable of managing the workload of /every/ selective *plus* them having scheduling issues (which may actually have happened for the first time with Hermione, who knows?).

But the catch is that timeturners aren't very helpful with critical situations. For a first, of course, there is the time limitation (I'm ignoring the Cursed Child bullshit here, obviously). Second, I always imagine Destiny and Fate to be real forces in the HP universe. Like Love or Hate have weight in this universe, some things are just meant to be and no matter how often you timeturn to change it, /you won't/. For example, I have written a small snippet in the past in which Dumbledore tries to timeturn back to prevent the Potters from dying. Him being incapable of saving them, no matter what he did, had him confirm that this was indeed the "marking of his equal" the prophecy talked about. It was a fixture in time, unchangeable by timeloops.

On the other side I also had my fun with them in the past. For example, I stated that the universe had some sort of "Occams Razor" for time being fooled around with. Once a bystander was incapable of denying seeing 2 Hermiones, for example, the universe would just decide that there are now 2 Hermiones to save itself from temporal collapse in the rare case a timeloop is broken. I still have a little story-start lying on my harddrive in which Hermione time-clones herself.

** Having a time turner for academic purposes may be a special privilege the Ministry gives for one specific reason: the user is going back a very short time, and isn't altering the past/present in any way, merely adding to their own experience. Hermione isn't going back to change anything, just to learn more, basically adding an hour or so to her day each day. Time turners seem to function like a magical version of free periods or extra credit lessons for the academically gifted students, and the fact that the Ministry is the one giving them out, I suspect they function like government/military scholarships, with the expectation that the student will repay the Ministry help by working with them after graduation.

As to whether Tom had access to one as a student, if they existed back then, I'd say yeah, but would he really be stupid enough to alter reality too much? He was interested in living forever, which a time tuner can't help with except help him research or access forbidden materials, and really how much could he do with Dumbledore keeping a close eye on him. It would be useful for him later in life, but again, the sheer amount of planning involved in going back in time and altering enough to help him rise to power would be a waste when he could do it without the time turner and less potential problems.

** To be completely honest, it's entirely plausible that students are granted Time Turners more often than we realize. They may not even restrict them as much as we assume.

Imagine it - people like Hermione are granted Time Turners for what we imagine are very trivial reasons ("I just /have/ to take all these courses at my school for teenagers!"). There's nothing irresponsible about that desire at all, but you'd imagine it would be /very/ irresponsible to grant that desire with a fucking 4th-dimension altering device, no?

Maybe not.

After all, they can give it to whoever they want, really. It doesn't actually change the timeline, and people who fuck around with it get "unborn".
