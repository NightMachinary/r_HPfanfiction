This doesn't have to be a crossover but I was just recently re watched sucked squad and had a thought.

Due to the rise of crime and opponents of the ministry. Delores umbridge comes up with an unorthodox plan.

She goes to Azkaban and recruits death eaters and Sirius black to combat this threat.

If they succeed and are useful they would either get their sentences reduced or they would be moved to another part of the prison where the dementors visit less frequently.

Has anyone seen something like this?


** I want this. Bellatrix is Harley Quinn. Sirius is Deadshot, because he just wants to see Harry. Maybe Shacklebolt or Moody or someother Aurors are charged to go with them. Some modified Marauder's map thing is used to track and observe the squad.

*** This is Katana. She's got my back. I would advise not getting killed by her. Her sword traps the souls of its victims.

*** Moody would be great as a leader, because he has a literal eye in the back of his head and is known for being famously suspicious of Death Eaters. Maybe send another Auror like Shacklebolt with him to ensure he doesn't murder them the instant they leave Azkaban.

Maybe also modified wands that don't let them target Moody/the other aurors or some kind of restraint? Otherwise giving them wands would make it way too easy for them to escape or overpower their guards. Ooh, maybe a poison they need regular antidotes to?

**** At the end of a mission Moody is about to be done in by one of the DEs and Sirius saves him and gets him to safety, maybe even putting himself at risk because Moody lost the days dose to the DE and Sirius can die if the Auror don't find them
