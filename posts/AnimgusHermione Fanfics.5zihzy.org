  "What we need," Dumbledore said slowly, "is more time." He looked at his watch, "three turns should do it, Miss Granger. Good luck." Only Lady Luck wasn't on time. Time went back, but not to when it should have. "Well, we came from the future, but apparently it wasn't two hours ago as we first thought and if that really is Remus Lupin, I'd wager we went back twenty years..." AU

** In linkffn(The Problem with Purity by Phoenix.Writing), Hermione is a magical animal animagus, and it is a major part of the story.

I am reading it now, as it was recommended in a response to my own, unrelated, "looking for" request; so far, no petting has been detected, sorry.

The story is very decently written, but there is bit much /deus ex machina/, and a bit much romance angst.
