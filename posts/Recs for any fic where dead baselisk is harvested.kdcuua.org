:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for suggestions for any fic where the dead basilisk is being harvested - eg. skin, teeth, poison, meat. Either by Harry (and friends) by himself, or Harry getting someone (eg. goblins, Charlie, Snape) to do it. Obviously, this is a popular troope, but which would you recommend?


** I feel like this is every other fic. Throw a rock and you'd probably find one. Off the top of my head, linkffn(Delenda Est) has that, and I only really remember it because I just reread it recently. Sorry I can't give more specific names

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
