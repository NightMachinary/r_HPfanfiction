Sick of not being hired by anyone because of not being pureblood or not having a parent to arrange the job or whatever, Mugglebors rebel and start their own society. They start to boycott pureblood owned shops and products, choosing to start their own businesses instead. Anyonw know some fics with this premise? Preferably little to no mugglewank, but I'll take what I can get.


** I think I vaguely remember one where they hire rocket scientists from NASA, give them magical devices that create mass and energy out of nothing, develop spaceships and build their own society on a spinning space cylinder far far away

Describes your scenario, but is told from the point of view of the purebloods...

** There's this fic: linkffn(6523209) but it's sadly incomplete. Here's my (spoiler-free) review:

#+begin_quote
  You'll like this if you enjoy slightly cracky fics, really good worldbuilding, Muggles/Squibs not being complete tools or enemies, strong Harry/Hermione FRIENDSHIP, good trio dynamics all around, underground Muggleborn culture, Death Eaters defecting, and having a Harry that can think for himself.

  Fair warning, it paints Snape and the other DEs in a slightly sympathetic light, real-world plugins (Eminem and /Harry Potter/ meta), and somewhat unrealistic character interactions. There's also a bit of Muggle(born/raised) focus.

  Overall, I liked it. Just over 60k words and 19 chapters. Unfortunately, it's abandoned (last update was in 2014) but it's a refreshing change of pace.

  The Death Eaters have come for Harry Potter but this slightly crazy Gryffindor has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.

** Did you just request a story where the characters act in a way that shows common sense and a basic understanding of history and human civil liberties? I don't know man, it sounds fun, but based on most of the stuff I have seen it might be to hard for a fanfic writer. However, I like the idea. I think a good title for something based on this would be, The Muggleborn Revolution. I would also like to see them use technology more prominently since they all will know how useful it is.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196963/1/][/The Uprising/ by Captain Cranium]] is set several years after DH. It Harry returning to England after a long time, to learn that Hermione and other muggleborns have basically moved out and created a colony of their own in some magical area, and the wizarding government wants him to help deal with them.

It's well written and complete, but I think that I eventually lost interest and ever finished it. The author went out of his way to keep mentioning how powerful and special and important Harry was, which grated---I suspect that this is one of those stories that would work better if you "deleted" the lead character.
