I always see Hermione/Tom Riddle or Fem!Harry/Tom, but rarely see Harry with a Fem Tom Riddle, so I'm looking for one.

Hell you could even take this a a prompt. Just want to read some Harry/Fem!Riddle


** T3T's Thunderstorm is likely the best serious one that I am aware of. It is complete too: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7186430/1/Thunderstorm]]

** I have wondered this exact question. I am generally not a fan of the first 2 but I have always been intrigued by Harry and a female dark character. Whether its Riddle, Bellatrix, or even a main character made dark (dark luna for example is a ball).

But there are so few Fem!Riddle stories it seems, and even fewer with a Harry pairing.

*** Maybe because many writers see power and dominance as masculine. Voldemort is a very dominant character who controls even the upper crust of wizard culture aka stereotypical Dominant types. So how can one who is dominant be dominated and emasculated by Harry, who is seen by a number of the fandom as Effeminate

Same reason Draco/Harry is popular but Harry topping Draco is Rare in that
