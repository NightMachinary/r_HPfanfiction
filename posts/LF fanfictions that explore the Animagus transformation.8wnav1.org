Preferably a version other than canon's.


** I had this idea once where the animagus transformation involved creating a perfect model/replica of the thing you wanted to transform into, inside and outside and everything. You'd have to mould perfect replicas of organs and such out of clay, especially the brain so you don't turn into a vegetable when you transform.\\
The reason magical animagi don't occur is simply because crafting a phoenix statue or dragon statue or whatever that accurately reflects the creature's magical capabilities, without using enchantments that interfere with the animagus form-taking spell, is impossible, or at least, not possible yet.

** Vox Corporis, which was recently taken down from FF.net, fit this, as does linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent).

** linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

This fic heavily explores transfiguration in general, but I'm also pretty sure Harry becomes an animagus at some point(or at least does a lot of animal transformations on himself).

*** If my memory is right, Harry never becomes an animagus, but he does extensively transfigure himself. Either way, the fic has focus on transfiguration, which may be sort of what OP is looking for.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** Vox corporis I really enjoy this not a fan where fanon has it to where you get to choose your animagus form just doesn't make sense to me

** I've got my own take on the animagus transformation in "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief", where it has both advantages and disadvantages. Different way to achieve it - more akin to spirit quests than moonlight potion leaf eating - and mental effects as well.
