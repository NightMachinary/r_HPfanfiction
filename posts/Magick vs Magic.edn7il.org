How did people come to the decision that the best way to make magic ancient or powerful was to add a 'k' to the end of it.

  *What Is Magick?*

  Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) founded the religion of Thelema. He was largely associated with modern occultism and influenced other religious founders such as Wicca's Gerald Gardner and Scientology's L. Ron Hubbard. 

  Crowley started using the word "magick" and gave several reasons why. The most often mentioned reason is to differentiate what he was doing from stage magic. However, such usage is unnecessary. Academics discuss magic in ancient cultures all the time, and no one thinks they are talking about the Celts pulling rabbits out of hats.

  But Crowley gave several other reasons why he used the term "magick," and these reasons are often ignored. The central reason was that he considered magick to be anything that moves a person close to fulfilling their ultimate destiny, which he called one's True Will.

  By this definition, magick doesn't have to be metaphysical. Any action, mundane or magical that helps fulfill one's True Will is magick. Casting a spell to get someone's attention is most certainly not magick.

  *Reasons for the Extra “K”*

  Crowley didn't choose this spelling randomly. He expanded a five letter word to a six letter word, which has numerical significance. Hexagrams, which are six-sided shapes, are prominent in his writings as well. “K” is the eleventh letter of the alphabet, which also had significance to Crowley.

  There are older texts which reference "magick" in place of "magic." However, that was before spelling was standardized. In such documents, you'll likely see all sorts of words spelled differently than we spell them today.

  Spellings that get even further away from "magic" include those like "majick," "majik," and "magik." However, there's no specific reason why some people use these spellings.
