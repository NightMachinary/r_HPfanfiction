I've been looking for a while now but I can't find anything good


** Try the Death Gate trilogy by KevinVoight :

**** You can also try reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2016209/1/Lady-Darkness][Lady Darkness]] which is a Tom/Ginny fic. Not the best fic ever, but well written Dark!Ginny is rare.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1277839/1/Seeking-Ginny][Seeking Ginny]] For years Ginny Weasley has tried to stop her feelings for Harry Potter. She's even uprooted her life. But what happens when it's time to come face to face with him again? COMPLETE

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2916556/1/Crossing-into-Chaos][Crossing into Chaos]] In a world where Voldemort was never defeated, only pureblood, money and power matter. All that Ginny Weasley wanted was to survive in this pretentious world, but she ends up crossing a line and catapulting herself into Draco Malfoy's chaotic world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1975791/1/In-The-House-of-the-Quick-and-the-Hungry][In The House of the Quick and the Hungry]] The finer aspects of Ginny Weasley's life, all entwined, in their own way, within the story of how she wound up with Harry Potter.

And my all time favorite Ginny fanfiction is called Backfire, and it's by brainchild. But it's been deleted, as the author is pursuing original fiction. If you message her on fanfiction.net she'll send it (and any other of her stories you request) to you. If you like any of the above fics, I'd message her! It's a fantastic story, as is the prequel. (prequel being Lily POV, but just as good.)

** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3728284/1/][In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter]]. It's basically the HP series from Ginny's perspective. It's pretty good.
