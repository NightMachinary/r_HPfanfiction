** With magic available, and a smart muggleborn around - i.e. Hermione - they should be able to easily overcome any beasts, magical or not, by using both magic and muggle knowledge. Unless you give those beasts sapience animals simply are no match for humans with decent tools - and a wand more than qualifies for that.

**** It depends on the challenge you want. If big dinosaurs are around, then there's enough food for them, so one of the bigger challenges is already easier.

If direct damage spells do not work, transfiguration should work better. Poisonous bait, traps, conjured or transfigured expendable animals, lots of things work against stuff resistant to Cutting Curses. If you've got Hermione around, Science and Magic working together should solve a number of problems.

"Island of Fire" has a bunch of students strand on a mostly bare rock in the middle of the Atlantic. No dinosaurs, but the setting has dragons. [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]]

I think this would /heavily/ depend on the age of the protagonist. A Post PS Harry Potter would be woefully unprepared for the dangers of a /Swiss Family Robinson/ style adventure.

**** That's true. I assumed they'd be older. I'm not that interested in reading about kids adventures.

  Running away from the Dursleys at a young age was a turning point of his destiny. Now he lives alone in the wilderness of a land long forgotten by the passage of time. And this is the story of his discovery in the lost world beneath. Slow updates, sorry.

** There are already plenty of magical dinosaurs in Harry Potter though, and a basilisk is not one of them, such as the phoenix, jobberknoll, fwooper, augery and diricawl. I'm not sure if the hippogriffs or griffins should be included, as these creatures are only half dinosaurs.

Now a basilisk is a bit confusing. For one thing it's clearly a snake but a basilisk hatches from a chicken egg, which makes it a dinosaur but it's a toad that has to brood on the chicken egg in order for the basilisk to hatch. Toads are amphibian... there is a voice in my head currently shouting: "IT'S MAGIC YOU IDIOT".

I don't think some magical creatures such as basilisks or manticores are "natural" but simply created by wizards and trying to apply evolution to these creatures is just too damn confusing. So I believe there never was a proto-Basilisk. What I'm also trying to say here is, is not to make the oh-so common mistake of thinking that snakes (or other lizards) are closely related to or are basically dinosaurs, they're not.

** Nitpick: a basilisk is not a dinosaur. It's not a catch-all for "big prehistoric creature". They're not even prehistoric.

** First off, thank you for reading. And believe you me, I cut the base building out for good reason.

There are a few Jurrasic Park crossovers. I can't remember ever reading something that crosses HP with, say, 10.000BC.

The core problem with this is that the moment you stop being preachy about the Avada Kedavra a normal wizard roflstomps anything thats alive with ease. Its just that strong a spell. One hit, one death.

The only thing that could possibly be a danger to an adult wizard, and even then just in numbers and with sufficient tactical thinking, would be something immune to the Avada Kedavra. Depending on what kind of rule you introduce for that, you'd create animals that have a natural immunity against... death(?), having their soul destroyed, ripped from them,... .

As cool as the HP magic is, its just hopelessly overpowered.

** linkffn(raptor by sakurademonalchemist) Is the first one that comes to mind for me. It's not a stranded in time or stuck on Ilsa Nublar, but its a good fic with lots of dinosaurs.

  Hagrid wins a dragon egg...only what is inside is no dragon. Harry is the first to make eye contact with the creature inside...and ends up with a most unusual familiar. Watch out Hogwarts...things are about to get prehistoric!
