  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

*** Can vouch for this one. This is one of the only Dumbledore/Weasley bashing fics that have actually kept my interest all the way through. It also has a few relatively rare pairings that are done surprisingly well; my jaw pretty much hit the floor when Rita Skeeter and Ms Zabini were revealed to be in a relationship, but it makes sense in context and is used in interesting ways.
