** Have you read Through the Veil Strangely? It's by the same author as Inquisitor Carrow.

** There's not all that much in this space, and Inquisitor Carrow is most of it. From what I've seen, even the shorter fics tend to be heavily on the side of grimdark for their tone (even more so than a lot of actual Black Library novels).

And I'm not sure I've ever seen a Warhammer Fantasy crossover with HP at all.

I have a couple of ideas in this area myself, plot ideas that I have planned out, but I have too much on my plate at the moment, so I'm not scheduled to get around to writing them until next year.

** If I'm not mistaken, the right category for this post is "request," not "recommendation"
