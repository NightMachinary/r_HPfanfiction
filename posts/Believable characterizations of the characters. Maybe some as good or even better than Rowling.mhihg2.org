Am fine with het/slash/femslash. Asexual/Bisexual, etc. Doesn't have to focus on pairings.

No Bashing. What I count as bashing: Things that don't happen, being brought up to tear characters down. For instance, Ron cheating on Hermione, or using Harry for his fame/fortune, is bashing to me. Dumbledore using Harry for his fame/fortune and blocking his magic would be bashing to me. But pointing out that Ron left in Goblet of Fire or during the Horcrux Hunt, that's not bashing to me. Pointing out that Dumbledore knew that Harry was a Horcrux and Harry getting mad at him, is not bashing for me, etc.


** they've been recced 100 times but it's for good reason so IM SORRY, MODS, FOR ONCE AGAIN RECCING linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) and linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down).

ATYD is the Remus origin story. But you really see Remu's grow and go through his teenage years, he struggles with who he is, what he believes in ,where he fits in. It's just fantastic, truly excellent characterisation of all the characters. Even Marlene and Mary are so perfect.

TSS is an adventure story with Harry ending up in 1978. Every other character is non-canon/minor canon and this story does a FANTASTIC job of fleshing them out and making them really unique individuals that still stick with me. I still think "What would Pel do?" before I do anything slightly illegal. Even Harry I think is developed much better than canon. At least, he handles his worries better. I adore it. Excellent characters, you'll cry trust me.

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

** Linkffn(The changeling)

Best characterization I've seen of Ginny.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent)

Best oc in fanfic, and she is a great freaking mentor.

And of course, Linkffn(prince of the dark Kingdom) Great what-if characterisation.

**** ^ This. She had a ton of characters and not enough space to develop them all. For example, some day I'd really like to read a canon compliant Remus x Tonks romance fic that shows how they got together, all his angsty angsty-ness, etc to the point where they reconcile and he accepts that his family needs him. It would be okay with me if it deviated from canon to have a happier ending than them dying in the battle of Hogwarts though.

** As good or better than Rowling?

Look people, we can criticize Rowling all day long here, but in the end she's a professional writer who has written one the the most popular fantasy novels of all time and the characters that'll be remembered for generations to come.

No fanfic comes even close to that, and they never will.

** Linkffn(Green Eyed Monster by Sphinxs-legend)

Best characterization i've seen. The characters are so real, and in many ways I prefer it to the original. This fic is super long and feels like it's own book series. However, it makes the characters so real and brings so much life to the slytherin side of things.
