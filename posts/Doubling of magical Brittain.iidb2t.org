When Harry and the co enter department of mysteries they trigger one of a kind enchantment that can only be triggered by the same person doing the exact same thing in vicinety of it. And so Harry and Nevile are brought into a covergence.

In Nevile's (other boy-who-lived) Lilly Evans is alive and she rased both Other Nevile and O-Harry. O-Harry is like a brother to O-Nevile and Lilly Evans is known as blood Lilly for her swift vengence of her husbanda death. 5 years after she has an afair with Sirius witch produces a 2nd child for Sirius Cassiopea Black.

And ao two highly different world converge into one continuety because both O-Neville and Og-Harry are carying Voldemort's soul pieces.

How will these wildly different realities coexist, now that there're two Voldemorts, two Dubledores and two wildly different boy-who-lived.
