  The battle against the basilisk opened the path to a destiny Harry would never have expected. But, to his immense relief, his family steps up to support him along the way. Even if it was family that others considered to be legend.

  Hadrian Merlin Pendragon, King of Avalon and of all Britain has returned to the land of the living. His mission is to stop Voldemort before he comes into power, educate the ignorant, and bring peace to magical Britain. The worlds of fate and destiny collide when the four horsemen are on the rise. Death hasn't always been the enemy, but, death isn't necessarily just a friend either.
