*** I really think this fic was probably a very decent Gaiman-esque novel in the making, or at least a very good late-80s mid-90s fantasy series.

Shame it suffered from a lack of editor and a not finished sequel.

The concepts introduced in that story are phenomenal and the pacing is quite good, very good in fact.

If it was more polished, it would probably be one of the best HP fanfictions. Up there with the best ones. Alas it wasn't. Still smashing, though.

Also a working link:

  Harry was born cursed, but didn't know until he fell through a portal to another world. There people have wings and hate him for his curse, but it gives him power: power to change this new world as well as his own. AU after 5th year.

** The Lone Traveler series by dunuelos has Harry (eventually) ascend to godhood, although IMO the overall quality isn't all that fantastic. Hits a lot of cliches and does a lot of telling instead of showing.

  Kino is the god of Free Will. But he used to be a human named Harry Potter. Offered up the chance to do things over, Kino finds himself smack dab in the middle of the Triwizard Tournament! Again! So he does what anyone would do in his situation, come up with the most insane methods of winning each task!

** How about a literal one?

It's exactly in line with DxD mythology, but still can be fun despite that.

  What if the Deathly Hallows were always meant for Harry? What if Harry was the reincarnation of the God of the Bible? What if getting the Deathly Hallows reawakened his powers as God? What will a God do now it has lived life from the perspective of a human, will this lead to good things or bad?
