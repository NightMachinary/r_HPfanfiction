It would had been better to just polyjuice Harry as someone else, making everyone a decoy and furthering confusion , with much less drama .

Really there could have been a thousand and one different ways to smuggle Harry out from that home, to say nothing about the dubious protection and Harry's need to go there in first place , because Dumbledore wanted it , seemed like one side have completely abandoned their mind and follow someone who have lost his balls (Dumbledore) while he was alive.

** Better plan than Cannon:

Step one- Acquire a friendly, loyal house elf and an expanded trunk.

Step two- Place VIP and all valuable items into said trunk.

Step three- House elf moves trunk

Step four (optional)- evacuate muggle neighborhood

Step five (optional)- slip false intelligence to Death Eater saying that the Order will move HP in force.

Step six (optional)- Acquire and arm mundane and or magical explosives inside Number 4

Step seven (optional)- when Death Eaters attack house after wards fall, wait for them to get inside, then set off explosives, thereby depleting at least some of Voldemort's army

*** Oops haven't seen that , my bad

I was just thinking of a prank that Harry could have pulled in Hogwarts by polyjuicing as one of the twin and meet them in hallway walking toward the great hall acting as scary synced triplet horror style , pranking everyone.

Or maybe where at every turn they meet another person polyjuice as one of the twin till they reached great hall where everyone student to teacher is polyjuiced as them .

Than I realised something similar had been done with seven Harry and ...

***** No need: At the end of HBP, Harry can apparate for himself.

And yes, if you needed to actually move him, that would have been the most straight-forward plan. He packs his stuff, and apparates away. Then Thicknesse wags his finger for breaking his laws and apparating without license in an angry Prophet column, because he has no clue where Harry is, and one week later no one cares, because Voldemort is running the show and Harry is wanted for being Undesirable No 1, not for apparating without license.

 

Of course, that wasn't the point here. The point was to start the book off with a bang, to have a narrow escape and a fight. And that's fair enough, but then you gotta change the world so that this works, and it /can/ work -- say, for instance, the blood charm doesn't fail in a binary way, but gradually, and Voldemort, partly having Harry's blood, suddenly can break through. There's a fight in Privet Drive, the whole Order is there, and Harry narrowly can escape after breaking the Anti-Apparition jinx put on him.

You can come up with any number of ways that start at Privet Drive, end at the Burrow, and have a fight in-between. Just ... not this one.

***** Would have been instantly tracked. Voldemort at this time had already control over the Departement of Magical Transportation. It had to have be non magical (or at least non trackable ones which means brooms, flying animals or simply sit on the back seat hidden under the invisibility cloak when the Dursleys leave)

****** While that may be the case (though I doubt that they can actually track destinations, they never could before and after), it's at least not the reason stated in the scene. The reason given there is that it's an "imprisonable offence", which is, of course, all kinds of lul, given that not one week later, Harry's /very existence/ is an imprisonable offence. You might've thought they could simply ignore that. And anyway, I never understood why they didn't talk with Scrimgeour; he is, after all, still the Minister at that time.

But like I said elsewhere, it's basically pointless to debate this and all the shortcomings, the scene is fundamentally broken and can't be repaired. That's really all there is to it.

  “We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.”

... and that helps you how? o.O I don't get it. Harry apparates away, the Death Eaters know he apparated away, and then what happens?

I don't /think/ it's possible to track Apparition, since they don't do that at any point in the series, and notably, Yaxley doesn't say this here either, but then what is the point? They know what happened. Good for them. Now what?

I think it could be possible if the apparating person is still a minor. That's one of the main reason they wait for Harry to be 17 - so that his magic can't be tracked anymore.

** The simplest solution would have been for the Order to stay put in their respective hiding places, then have Harry call for Kreacher or Dobby to move him. The Ministry might have accounted for things like Floo travel, portkeys and apparation (somehow), but house elf travel was never mentioned. Both elves had been to #4 before, and it would have been easy enough to get one of them to take Harry to one of the safe houses or directly to #12 or the Burrow.

It would have been a lot less "exciting" that way, but it also would have gotten Harry to his destination safely and kept anyone else from getting hurt or killed in the process. The way it was done in canon only served to raise the dramatic stakes, to deprive Harry of whatever innocence he had left at that point, and to make sure that Snape could stay embedded in Voldemort's camp despite the fact that killing Dumbledore should have cemented his place already. There was no practical reason for a group of 14 people to fly out into the night when there were still safer options available for moving Harry and when they knew that there was a good chance of an ambush at some point on their trip.

** This topic has been debated many times, but just for you, here are my thoughts: the plan is acknowledged on page that it's not flawless but it's the best they could come up with. They were not able to use magical means of transportation, the Death Eaters were surveilling the area and, if they didn't do their due diligence and checked who lives in Number 4, Privet Drive, they deserve to be outsmarted by a seventeen year old kid, but if they did... polyjuicing into someone else would have not worked. The invisibility cloak was not bulletproof. If Dumbledore could do it, then I'm sure Voldemort could also figure out if someone was hiding under an invisibility cloak.

Yes, and that's precisely the problem. They have all the creativity of a dead piece of wood.

Here's just one exemplary question: If you want to move Harry because the target house is "safe", which is because it is protected by spells someone cast to /make/ it "safe", then why didn't you cast those spells on Privet Drive in the first place to achieve the same level of protection /there/ and spare yourself the transportation nonsense?

  Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He's made it an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or Apparate in or out.

(DH)

Says nothing about magic restriction. And anyway, obviously you'd protect the home /well/ in advance, just like the other houses. At the latest during HBP. It's not like the blood protection expiring is a sudden revelation that comes out of nowhere.

****** This is where I just need to accept that JKR is very much an amature in writing -- the relationships/characterization is slapdash with little development, and the lack of skill leads to massive plot holes requiring 'magic' to explain away.

Even with 'generic magic/ arbitrary sentence about Pious that is completely out of the context of the story' to cheat the situation/plots to work, it is frequently done poorly (illogically and 'plank of wood' like).

Plots should be developed out of the scene and environment generated in the story to naturally employ the authors powers to make a conflict happen. JKR gives a couple sentences/pages to convince the reader that we have suddenly appeared in an entirely new conflict for the next chapter or two with completely new rules of engagement.

Edit: Also want to point out that these weaknesses make HP universengood for fanfiction. There is a frame of characters/events with little connection and development giving authors easy room to add their own story to the events.

******* Well, I'm not going /that/ far either. I think the majority of the books works well enough, and there are some quite clever plots, that also are well-developed and working across multiple books.

But this thing, the 7 Potters, is just simply the worst and most tortured plotting in the entire series, and it is this in an exceptional (and exceptionally bad) sense.

And the worst issue is, it's /unecessary/. You could have achieved all the required goals -- a flight, a fight, Harry ending up at the Burrow -- without resorting to this nonsense. There's just better ways to write the same outcome, and that's what actually annoys me.

******** Fair point, I probably have a rather extreme impression of it. Last time I read cannon it was sandwiched by Isaac Assimov and Randolph Lalonde, both of whom are known for high quality plots and characters that mesh together well, that is to say the crisis generate naturally from authors choice of designing the universe.

I guess the egregiousness of this scene in particular is probably why it's so rarely seen in fanfiction? I think I've seen it /maybe/ once or twice. Certainly one of the more rare canon occurances that appear in fanfiction.

So I guess that might be a reason; -- but to be fair, I haven't really read many DH FF altogether.
