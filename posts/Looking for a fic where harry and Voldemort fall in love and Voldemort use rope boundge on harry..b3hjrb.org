  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

*** What are these obvious reasons? I'm honestly a bit confused and curious of what they could be.

**** Because he's around 60 years older than Harry. He killed Harry's parents. He has attempted to kill Harry on numerous occasions. He's a bigoted, fascist wannabee dictator. He thinks several of Harry's friends do not deserve to live (muggleborn). He's a serial killer. He's quite insane.

I mean, come on. HP/LV is, without the proper changes to history, a pretty fucked-up combination.

Again and Again handles it well, though.

***** The age difference is irrelevant as long as Harry is mature enough to consent which usually happens around 17 or 18 anyways. In reality, I would take issue, but this is fanfiction where the ten year old can be perfectly capable of consenting. The issue of children being unable to consent has nothing to do with their physical age. That's why very mentally ill people that are 45 can't consent even though they're old enough to by most laws. It's about the mental faculties being enough. In the real world, physical age and mental development are usually hand in hand, but in fiction it becomes more of a matter of preference.

And all those reasons listed are definitely valid though. Most authors just hand wave it all away which is also a valid way to go about it, but I'd be interested in a story that seeks to... Have Voldemort go through a redemption arc. That would be great even if it wasn't HP/LV
