Then this leads up to harry finding new friends (preferably with neville in it), then he realizes that he's better off without his old friends. No slash. The longer the fic the better. Thanks!


** Remember that Hermione actually stood by Harry in the book (and also to some degree in the movie - eg. playing post-owl).

  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!
