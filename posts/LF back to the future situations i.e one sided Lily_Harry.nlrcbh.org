I mean Harry goes back in time to the marauders era and Lily has a crush on Harry


** IIRC I had a plot bunny years ago where Harry displaces James -- All Harry wants to do is get back to the present, but "James" suddenly acting completely different and all actually /attracts/ Lily to Harry.

Naturally this squicks him out, but the more he tries to essentially run away from her, the more she hunts after him, much to everyone's amusement.

If there are any stories like this, I'd be eternally grateful if someone linked them. :D

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.
