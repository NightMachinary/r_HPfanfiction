***** Been awhile since I last read it, but isn't harry like 40 or something, and has romantic feelings towards children? I might be wrong, but that's what I remember from back in the day.

****** He has a romantic feeling, or remnants of the same toward ginny , who is the same person he fell in love with all those years ago. If he acts on them before she's sixteen (age of consent in many places) I would think that should maybe be a problem but I don't have a problem with him having those pretty natural feelings

******* If I remember correctly, he didn't so much subsume his past self as become an amalgam of the two. So in that context, its not so pedophilic.
