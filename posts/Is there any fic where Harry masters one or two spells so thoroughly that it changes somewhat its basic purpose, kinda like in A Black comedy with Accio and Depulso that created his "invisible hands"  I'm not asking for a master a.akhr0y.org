#+TITLE: Is there any fic where Harry masters one or two spells so thoroughly that it changes somewhat its basic purpose, kinda like in A Black comedy with Accio and Depulso that created his "invisible hands" ? I'm not asking for a master at one subject like in The Art of Self-fashioning, just 1 or 2 spells.

** That description applies to canon Harry and Expelliarmus, lol.

Harry (raised by Lockhart) has Oblivate. linkffn(6635363)

There was one where Harry mastered Diffindo from Year 1 and killed Death Eaters at the World Cup by Year 4, but I can't remember the name.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

No it doesn't? Harry just uses the spell a lot, he doesn't modify it.

*** If I had magic I'd use Pulmenti Pulmonem, atleast on death eaters. It's Latin for Lung soup. Best o' luck living without your lungs. Or Pulmenti Cor, Heart soup. They'll be just as dead as the killing curse but I won't get in trouble for an unforgivable.
