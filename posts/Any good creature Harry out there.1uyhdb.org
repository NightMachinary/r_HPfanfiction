** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5475405/1/DragonKin][DragonKin]] is okay.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5621051/1/Outcast-s-Alley][Outcast's Alley]] is one I liked but the sequel isn't finished and probably won't be.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix][Tear of the Phoenix]] is a subtle creature story and its sequel is still being finished, but will be finished.

** I very much enjoyed The Mad Mad Reviewer's (long) one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7284194/9/The-Terrible-Ideas-Bin][Monsterous]]. Its not really a complete story, unfortunately. But I recommend it none the less.

** whydoyouneedtoknow's Spell of Sealing. It is sort of connected to her Dangerverse series... at least some of the characters appear to be.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9772943/1/The-Spell-of-Sealing]]

Kind of hard to explain. Remus does a spell that turns he and a young Harry into wolves, and they live in the forbidden forest.
