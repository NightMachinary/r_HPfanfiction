** Summer of Change is complete.

What you are asking for is a sequel, and most authors would at least ask for permission from the original author.

Personally I'm not certain you could improve on that story, a sequel would answer too many questions I'm not prepared to find out the answer for. Never ask a question you do not already know the answer to, or do not wish to know the answer to.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][HP and the Summer of Change]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/708471/lorddwar][Lorddwar]] is a classic fanfiction, the pillar of the Harry & Tonks 'ship. It kicked off a number of rebellious-Harry tropes which are seen nowadays as lazy writing, but which were used effectively at the time.

The story was finished in 2006 and the last time the author updated was 2010, applying a few edits. He has always maintained that he has no concrete plans for a sequel (to take Harry through his return to Hogwarts and show how this AU solves its Voldemort problem), but that /he also has no intention of permitting others to try/.

A bit selfish but there you have it. As one of the few authors to declare 'mine' and have written well enough to be worth honoring the claim, the fandom has chosen this fic as the precedent for how denying story adoption should be handled. At the same time, it's on most people's 'Wish they'd post more' lists.
