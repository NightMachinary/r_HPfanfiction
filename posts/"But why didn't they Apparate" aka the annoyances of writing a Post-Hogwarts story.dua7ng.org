Almost every adult in HP can Apparate. Most locations outside Hogwarts aren't protected against it. So every time there's a conflict - a duel, a chase, an ambush - it's an option. Cornered in a back alley by Dark wizards? /Pop/. Fleeing werewolves across the Forbidden Forest? /Pop/. Chasing a criminal? /Pop/, they get away.

And if they don't, you have to offer an explanation. Maybe someone cast an Anti-Apparition Jinx, or maybe the person lost their wand. But that happening every time is annoying and repetitive.

Am I overthinking this? Would you just write a scene as normal, and leave it up to the reader to decide why either party in a conflict wouldn't instantly Apparate at the first sign of danger?


** You need focus or else you risk splinching. If you're distracted, say by mortal danger then you might struggle. It might be strongly advised to not apparate under stress. Situations you want to apparate out of are often high stress. Someone like Harry might be able to pull it off anyway due to the large amount of time spent in life or death situations. For everyone else you could splinch. Take Hermione in the 'there's no wood' situation from first year. She's better by the end of the series but most witches and wizards wouldn't be. Make splinching really dangerous and a real threat and not wanting to apparate can be a real issue. Add it that you need to pick a location, if you are in a group then would you all know where to go or would you end up scattered?

** Oddly, I'm reminded of pre-modern warfare

Before the advent of gas vehicles and modern long range weaponry, field battles almost never had to happen. It took less time to just leave than it took to set up to attack an enemy force. Most battles were sieges where the opposing force couldn't just up and leave.

But field battles did happen. Sometimes it was thanks to ambushes, but mostly it was because both sides figured they could come out ahead in the battle.

And so it would be with wizards. Either it's a siege where one party is defending an objective they must defend, or it's a battle they both think they can win and they're both too busy fighing to muster the concentration to leave without successfully disengaging first, or it's an ambush.

But there's also an in-universe implied releasing. During the whole stupid 7 potters thing, why didn't they just apparate or portkey out? Why bother physically traversing the distance anyway?

Unless we assume everyone had an idiot ball, there must be a reason. Maybe apparation and portkeys are able to be traced and/or intercepted?

Because the Order was stupid, there is no other explanation. The Ministry made up laws aimed at creating such a scenario and the Order took the bait. The trace got, once again, reworked so that it detected magic around Harry (which didn't matter when Dumbledore or the Order were casting spells around Harry in books 5 and 6).

There were many alternatives, even if you wanted to respect those laws. For example, Harry simply walking out under the invisibility cloak to the nearest train station and taking the train somewhere where Tonks (best stealth ability) was waiting for him and apparate him to Grimmauld or another place under the Fidelius (so the trace they are worried about is not an issue). Or outright ignore the Ministry laws and write them off as lost cause.

And there's nothing stopping Harry from taking polyjuice to look like one of the neighbours and simply walk out. Hell, Hermione is old enough to learn driving, so they could even car jack one of the neighbours cars while under polyjuice and Apparate from a Sainsbury parking lot or a service station.

Book 2 Dobby gets Harry in trouble by casting near him at privet drive, book 4 mr Weasley casts a bunch of magic while picking him up, no warning (could be a “detected a wizard adult/ministry worker” thing, TBF). Book 5, Order members are guarding Harry daily, no letters or warnings, but can't apparate him out. Book 6, Dumbledore magically intimidates the Dursley's and apparates Harry out, no warnings. But book 7, NOW the trace picks up on apparating again? It feels really contrived, and even if the trace would pick up on apparating why not pop him to a random location and then fly from there, or pop straight into a Fidelius, or 1000 other reasonable things.

And I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just vanish the guns.

*** It's easier to use familiar characters as the base rather than building entirely original characters (and even worlds). Say “Harry Potter” and everyone can conjure a general picture in their head. Say “Random Original” and the author has to be able to give a base physical description and general personality or the audience doesn't know who that a character is. Weak (or new) authors usually can't pull that off, so they mutilate existing characters.

To be fair though, in some cases when the author completely restructures how the world works, using familiar characters helps the audience get a grip on the story. But that's familiar characters in an unfamiliar world. When the characters /and/ the world have been fundamentally altered for no discernible reason - that's the crutch of a weak author.

** This is an issue in canon itself. There are many times in the original books where if you took the time to think about it, you would wonder "but why didn't they _____".

Yet folks still love the story. Readers can overlook such things if the story is good and characters interesting.

That said, as another person pointed out, with regards to Apparition specifically, I don't think people value its danger enough. Apparition not only requires focus in the process itself, but knowledge of where you are going. It is glossed over by many but the reality is that it is not simple and in fact in HP lore you see many OTHER methods of transportation used RATHER than apparition, suggesting that while some choose to use it somewhat consistently, many don't and choose to play it safe. So as a writer, you really shouldnt have to overstress it if your overall story is solid.

Edit: I'd get rid of Apparition altogether if I could, it just introduces unnecessary complications. Portkeys can do whenever you need instant transportation for story reasons, and since they require preparation and are illegal to create by non-Ministry personnel, it's believable that one wouldn't be able to create one during a heated confrontation.

Which, I'm guessing, is exactly why that didn't happen--Rowling wanted to pile as much negative influence on them as possible to get her desired result, that being to make them stressed and unable to think clearly.

She's not the only one to have done that either.

***** If they had a way to freeze the food, then I think that would work, but I imagine multiplying food does not make it fresher, so it would still have the original foods' expiration date, and therefore would still go bad within days/weeks, depending on the food, still requiring frequent (and possibly dangerous) trips without their Invisibility Cloak. Having said that, non-perishable and freezing the food solves part of this problem. (although eating snack bars, dry cereal, and canned stuff long term doesn't sound too fun on my stomach, but probably hungry teenagers wouldn't mind it so much).

But I also highly suspect they did not actually have too much trouble with food over the long run. Of course it was worse and more complicated than what they were used to, but that's to be expected. We know they entered towns when they could to scout and stuff, and while we only see Harry do it once unsuccessfully, it is implied that this is something they do regularly, and that Harry's lack of success is what is notable this time. So I think it's fairly plausible and natural to believe they (probably Ron, let's face it) purchased some of their food over the course of almost a year on the run.

And just getting a sense of how much three people eat, especially growing teenagers, is daunting. After moving out on my own, it was hard for me to understand how much food I ate in a week, I'd get it wrong every shopping trip for a while, and my fridge was always emptier than I would think it should be. And then when I moved in with my husband, it took us months to get a knack for how much food two people ate, how much it would cost, etc. Hermione's sense doesn't necessarily means she can easily feed three people for months and know how much money to pack at the beginning of their trip, how to store it for long-term use, and how to make it into something tasty. It would be a learning curve regardless of magic, and I'm not surprised they had trouble planning proper meals. Ted and Dirk Cresswell had a better time, I think, but they're adults who are used to acquiring their own food, and used to the spells needed to make it worth eating.

  My usual go to is during Deathly Hallows, the argument over lack of food. You can multiply food you already have, so why did muggle born and normally raised Hermione not think "hey, let's get some non-perishable food from an Asda in a muggle town and just multiply it for dinner"
#+end_quote

Because they had plenty of food? Their conversation about not being able to magic up food was in the context of having fish and mushrooms.

Their problem wasn't lack of food, it was that they didn't know how to make it into something nice to eat.

And presumably the reason they didn't go buy food was because they were in hiding and thought that if they entered a Muggle area the Ministry would know. We have a very small knowledge of the Ministry's tracking abilities in canon, but they seem to be extensive - it may well be that the Ministry would be all over them the moment they entered any urban area.

****** If the ministry could track them the moment they entered any urban area then that should have been mentioned in the book as a reason for staying in the woods. You can argue any plothole away with "perhaps XYZ and just nobody mentioned it". That doesn't make it any less of a plothole.

Regarding the food, you can buy meals in cans that you just need to heat up. They aren't what they are uses from Hogwarts or Molly's cooking but they are /fine/. Definitely leagues above what they had.

And you'd think that Hermione, who seemed to be prepared for so much and packed everything she thought she might possibly need in her bag, would have had the foresight to also pack some non-perishable food because she /knew/ that she can't create food with magic and it is completely unreasonable to think that you can just live off the land /if you never learned how to do that/.

I tend to think the word plothole is overrused to describe things that /could/ be explained, and while in theory I'm okay when words change meaning, I still feel it's useful to differentiate between "can plausibly be explained" and "cannot plausibly be explained" when discussing writing, and "plothole" seems to be shifting from meaning just one of those things, to now meaning both of those things, and it's causing a bit of confusion in these sorts of conversations.

  Q: It seems that the wizards and witches at Hogwarts are able to conjure up many things, such as food for the feasts, chairs and sleeping bags. . .if this is so, why does the wizarding world need money ? What are the limitations on the material objects you can conjure up ? It seems unnecessary that the Weasleys would be in such need of money. . . (Jan Campbell)

  A: Very good question (well done, Jan!!). There is legislation about what you can conjure and what you can't. Something that you conjure out of thin air will not last. This is a rule I set down for myself early on. I love these logical questions!

Not many fans remember that even humble Floo was not invented (discovered, ...) in the first book, so Dumbledore flew to London on a broom (which otherwise doesn't make any sense outside of bashing!Dumbledore ideas). Apparation was created in HBP (completely uselessly, Dumbledore & Harry could visit Slughorn by Floo as well), and then it was misused in DH, but if Apparation never existed (or was usable only by some exceptional wizards or using some weird magical artefact or something) there would be a way less plotholes in JKR novels and in numerous fanfiction stories.
