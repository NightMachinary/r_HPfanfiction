Personally I love Harry/Lavender as a unusual pairing. I love the idea of the dynamic, Harry the hero, Lavender the kind loving woman (even Ditzy Blond Lavender could work). I see it working a few ways Harry relies on Lav for a escape from the craziness of his life because Lavender isn't anywhere near it, she isn't like Hermione or Ginny who Normalize his adventures due to their part in them. Lavender would feel like a separate part of that while still supporting him. Lavender seems like someone who has lots of love and affection to, who is starved of affection? Harry who would take her aggressive care with a smile, although he would probably put his foot down on "Harry-warry" or "Har-Bear" or any really bad baby name Lavender would try.

So what are your's? What Pairings do you wish there were more there of and how would it work as a relationship?


** Harry/Pansy - Lots of playground squabbles that lead up to a 'I don't hate you' kind of confession. Probably lots of snark and mutual crabbiness follows. Drama about sides maybe, but maybe not too if both are independent minded.

Harry/Narcissa - Saves Narcissa from Voldemort HQ, maybe offers her protection via hidden property. Might lead to a bit of inadvertent Stockholm Syndrome, and then 'I've never had the option for anyone but Lucius' follows. Might be some element of 'gonna shag Draco's mum, ha!' in it for Harry.

Harry/Gabrielle - Most likely takes place post-Hogwarts for Harry, but the method is fairly obvious: Gabby finally gets her hands on her white knight.

*** I do love Harry/Pansy as well, I can see it being built on the bickering and snarkiness of the two, until the walls come down and Pansy just wants to feel protected by the big damn Gryffindor hero that is Harry Potter and Harry handing the reigns of most of his life over to the cunning mildy manipulative Pansy. A very Symbiotic relationship perhaps even more than we usually see in Fanfiction

Harry/Narcissa could be fun, especially if they are just "using" each other whether to get back at people or make a point or just stress relief. Then it becomes the norm and then it's a foregone conclusion that they are together.

Harry/Gabby actually isn't my usual cup of tea actually I prefer him usually with Fleur. I think it's because I like the mix of the dirty T shirt and jeans Clad hero in Harry crossed with a beautiful yet high maintenance girlfriend as you can see with my enjoyment of Harry/Fleur, Harry/Pansy and Harry/Lavender. I feel that Gabby would be a bit too accommodating. I love a bit of heat that isn't solely sexual between my love interest (although the spill over into the carnal is exactly what I look for)

Fleur I can see bullying her SO into a monthly or weekly dinner at a nice restaurant of her liking, of going to the networking events that Harry hates in the Books. the Balls and Parties, the very things Fleur would flourish in.

I love this. Unfortunately it's also extremely rare. Most Harry/Gabby fics are harem or involve veela bonds that just involve Fleur for good measure. She's always kinda the little sister of Harry's hot girlfriend.

Really the only decent one i've read was Hope by Jeconais and that was a little too Mary Sueish for me.

Although there was one fic that i can't remember the name of that involved Harry traveling the world as a problem solver and then meeting Gabby on some kind of science ship in the arctic. I don't think it was finished but i recall it being pretty good.

*** I too am a big fan of Harry/Pansy, but feel like ultimately it shouldn't go anywhere. Fundamentally, Harry and Pansy are not compatible in any serious romantic or even human sense. You can see a relationship developing between their adult selves based on mutual attraction... but sooner or later their relationship should stop being love-hate and just become hate. Essentially, horniness would blind them to all the many good reasons they detest each other but great sex can only keep a "relationship" going for so long.

Life changes people and priorities shift over time, and it's not unthinkable for priorities to align in two people that once had wildly separate ways of life.

** Harry/Gabi D not my favourite pairing but I don't think there is enough. I think the the epilogue is too clean. With the mess that follows the war and the extra attention it would bring I struggle to see Harry not becoming extremely jaded. Maybe he'd leave and go travelling, maybe he'd allow others to dictate his actions for a while but I don't engage with the happily ever after tone that I personally get from the epilogue. Gabi fits into this as she was abroad the whole time. She doesn't have the same memories as everyone else, she didn't watch him slay the boggey man in the middle of Hogwarts. She's a breath of fresh air to a tired and fed up Harry. Some who brings a little light to a man beginning to drown in shades of grey. The expectation that Harry will solve the problems of the wizarding world flip flop throughout canon with the idea of him being a dark lord. I see no reason for this to stop so someone without a track record of doing this might be refreshing.

Dudley/Pansy. Dudley getting away from his parents and trying to find out who he is as a person without their strong views shaping his own. Realising that his cousin was a much better person than his parents would ever admit leads to some soul searching. Pansy has just watched everything she knows get turned upside down. Dumbledore, Potter and Voldemort are all halfbloods. She has watched pureblood superiority crumble. Maybe, just maybe her family was wrong. Where does that leave her, Pansy ventures out into the muggle world to learn how the other half live. Trying to escape her past. People haven't forgotten she tried to sell out Potter. Now I've read a story similar but I really want to imagine the scene where Dudley brings Pansy to a family reunion of some kind and only then does she learn about Dudley's connection to Harry. Personally I want Harry to be paired with Daphne Greengrass in this situation so we see Malfoy as Harry's unwilling brother in law and therefore sharing Christmas with Dudley and Pansy.

** Ginny and Victor Crum. While at the Triwizard Tournament, Ginny organizes a game of pick up quidditch, and Victor asks to join. Ginny is adamant that she play against him, even if he's better. Despite knowing full well that Victor is a better player (and much older) Ginny plays her heart out as a seeker, but in the end Victor still wins. He's impressed by her spirit, but she's still a kid as far as he's concerned.

However, Ginny keeps doing some damn impressive stuff, like organizing the DA and helping to take down Voldemort. Years later, when Victor sees Ginny playing quidditch for England, he invites her out to drinks. They strike up a deal to push each other to be better players, and occasionally they even play against each other. From their friendship, they eventually get together and life is good. Oh, and Harry ended up with take your pick.

Orrrrrr....things could end up positively freaking nuts because Harry was born with red hair and I really want to find a way to make every Triwizard Tournament champion a Weasley just to drive Minnie McGee up a freaking tree.

***** Because the Death Eaters are literally magical Nazis (with muggleborns acting as jews). They had concentration camps and Nürnberg laws. No way one of them and Harry would work (or Hermione for that matter). Snape and Draco were members who agree with the ideology from early on. They are just racially motivated terrorists who have some regrets because Voldemort does what he promised, similar how people were surprised by the Holocaust despite Mein Kampf and then things got messy (surprise, genocide is not a clean thing). They used racial slur during their school time and do not oppose Voldemort's ideology. Snape may have some regrets but still joined them in the first place. There's no redemption for terrorism.

Ron, while not necessarily a bad person, is not a good friend for Harry, much less a partner. Between jealousy, inferiority issues and his lacking emotional range I just don't see that working.

Neville is pretty much the only guy left. All others are just blank spaces with a name tag but from our canon knowledge they don't have any qualities that Harry would need in a partner. Hermione is undeniably number one in this aspect, with Luna and Neville being better than the other characters. Neville at least is loyal and can relate to Harry's hardships like their parents fate and abuse at the hands of their relatives.

** Ginny/Bellatrix- fierce, passionate, lethal. I imagine this would be a short term or inconstant relationship. I could see Bellatrix taking Ginny as a pet or mentee in a situation where Ginny was recruited to the Death Eaters (possibly if Riddle's possession twisted her making that possible) and Ginny turning the tables on her eventually.

Tonks/Hermione: Tonks is confident, cheerful, funny, laid back, courageous, and not particularly insecure. If Hermione's quirks fascinated Tonks and drew her in, I could see them having a long, stable relationship with their biggest fights about whether Hermione is inadvertently being condescending to Tonks about her area of expertise and whether Tonks' career is advancing as much as Hermione thinks it should. Plus, as a halfblood, Tonks wouldn't be totally clueless in the muggle world or around Hermione's parents.

Harry/Bill: in the epilogue that should have happened, Harry is the DADA teacher because he genuinely enjoys it, is tired of fighting criminals, and also because thematically it's a powerful statement that A) Voldemort's curse is broken and B) Harry achieved the job that Voldemort was never able to because he made better choices than Tom Riddle did. In this ending, cursebreaker Bill would be a great collaborator for Harry, showing his Hogwarts classes applied DADA knowledge and bringing Harry to dangerous (but fun) places to battle evil for nothing more important than magical artifacts. Harry canonically thinks Bill is handsome and cool, and after Harry physically fills out a bit (possibly during his post-Hogwarts exploration of various fields in DADA fields) Bill might be interested in his little brother's speccy but buff friend with a good head on his shoulders and nerves of steel. Bill's character is a bit unfilled, but he's confident and chill with Molly in the face of her disapproval and comes off as a strong character. Plus, then Harry gets to be a Weasley! ;)

** Hermione / Bellatrix - How would that work? Well... Either you make Hermione a massive masochist or you take the route of the less known character and give Bellatrix some sort of reason to be as she is. But it really never works without massive allowances. Basically, Bellatrix / Hermione works if the reader lets it work. If you don't want it to work, it won't.

Sirius / Bellatrix - The most dysfunctional relationship in the HP fan-universe. Frankly, I like the idea of it. Its greatly fucked up beyond all measure and I love it for it. "Making it work" is again a thing of perspective. Those two would be constantly at each others throat, and /like it/ that way. If anyone wants to read my take on it, here goes: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12066162/5/Braindump-Ideas-un-edited-unfiltered-and-available-for-anyone-to-use][My Idea Dump Fic Chp. 5]]

Beyond that I don't really have a lot of preferences. I like Harry/Tonks a lot too, but not enough to ignore a fic's problems. The aforementioned two are the only ones I will ignore a lot bullshittery in a fic for.

** Harry/Bellatrix is a rare pairing, and normally requires some real shenanigans to pull off, especially if it's after the DoM battle.

But what if the insane bitch we all know is a lie? The Dark Mark might have unknown side effects after all, like maybe rarely causing something similar to dissociative identity disorder in those that take it. Or maybe it does it to everyone that has it? I mean, I can see that pretty easy. Charismatic Voldemort preying on the hidden fears and concerns others have, convincing them to take the Mark, and then the Mark twists them slowly into cruel caricatures of who Voldemort thinks everyone is deep inside(intent and belief matter in magic).

If a method of removing the Mark was discovered, and Harry got to meet the real Bellatrix instead of the psychotic fanatic personality construct that got forced on her, who knows what might happened between two people who have a common enemy?

*** I had this idea of a Samurai!Bellatrix of a sort, who values her honor more than even her life, and who would never betray her word whatever the price. So Bellatrix would have married Rodolphus Lestrange out of genuine love. Then, Voldemort would have accepted to spare Rodolphus' life in exchange for Bellatrix's loyalty and obedience.

Led by her honor, she would do anything to serve her new master to the best of her abilities, becoming the monster we know (or perhaps slightly less of a monster).

When Voldemort kills Rodolphus in a fit of rage, breaking his word, Bellatrix turns against him immediately, and begin to wage her own war on Voldemort and cie, not trying to reach out for Dumbledore and the order at all.

She could then meet Harry and gang due to circumstances. It would be hilarious to have Bellatrix crashing through the Department of Mysteries, and saving the day at the end of book 5, perhaps even directly saving Neville's life in the process, which would be absolutely horrible for Neville.

Edit: Actually, my first idea was that Bellatrix would've been tricked by Voldemort and Rodolphus (a fervent supporter of the Dark Lord), that she knew it but still rolled with it because she gave her word. Revelations would happen just prior to her dying. But I find the idea of Bellatrix wreaking havoc in all factions just by switching side (sort of, as she wouldn't join the order) to be potentially fun.

I imagine that if she turned against Voldemort, she'd seek to ally or swear herself to his enemy: Harry. Dumbledore is an obstacle, sure, but Voldemort sees Harry as his enemy due to the prophecy, not Dumbledore.

In regards to Neville and Samurai!Bella... Perhaps she was present that night but not involved in the torture. She's a fighter, not a sadist. He might be able to forgive her in that case.

That's a possibility. It would make sense. With the Dark Lord gone, there's no reason to go out of her way to torture people. Her only obligation would be to stay loyal to Voldemort and keep searching him.

Also, when I say Samurai!Bella, I'm talking about values and such. Not actual katana wielding. It's not clear in my first comment I think. I wouldn't want to be misunderstood.

Bella would also have to be a very powerful and skilled witch for Voldemort to go out of his way to forcibly recruit her.

****** Oh, I wasn't imagining any kind of katana. Any swords, really. But if she did use one, it's be something like a rapier, I think. A very precise pokey kind of sword.

And yeah, Bellatrix in this kind of story would be just shy of Voldemort and Dumbledore in combat ability, but lack their breadth of knowledge in Dark Arts and esoterica, respectively. Definitely worth the effort in recruiting.

******* Actually, I wasn't thinking of any sword at all. More of an attitude or moral code (not necessarily the Bushido but something that would look a bit like that). She's got magic, why bother with a sword?

I'd like to see Sirius' face when Bellatrix arrives into the death room mid-battle and throws Dolohov or Rookwood through the veil, instead of attacking his group ;).

There would also be the gap in experience. Bellatrix' a lot younger than Voldemort let alone Dumbledore. And she just spent years in Azkaban. But she would definitely be at the bottom of tier 1 at the least in terms of power and skill.

Edit 2: Apparently I missed that part.

I don't think a rapier is the best choice for a woman. If you're physically weaker than you opponents (and women generally are, at least when it comes to the upper body), you'll want a lighter weapon. Best choice would be a 2-handed sword. Since you use it with both hands, you have to provide less strength from each arm. Which would give you a greater maneuverability and more speed.\\
A rapier isn't a light sword. It's a long and thin sword that's made to poke rather than slice, but it's as heavy as any one-handed long sword.

** Harry/Pansy because oposites attract, very hot sex and perhaps eventually love, it can only happen as they're both adults though, In Hogwarts years it seems unlikely, specially if she's seen as Malfoy's.

Before I knew that Dumbledore was gay and his love for Grindewald, I shipped him with Minerva, but as an unrequited love from her or we're profesionals and don't date colleagues sort of thing.

Bellatrix loves good old Voldie, but he only uses her to satisfy certain needs...

Severus/Narcissa needs more fics. Perhaps it would only be an fling that's only physical (they both care about Lucius and they feel guilty about it). I wouldn't be suprised if Lucius cheated her and she fucked with someone else to revenge.

** The pairing I'm a fan of is Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley. I said this in response to a post some weeks back and another user accused the relationship of pedophilia, so I'll reiterate: this pairing can work when Hermione comes of age.

When you think about it, Hermione always has had a love of magical creatures (i.e. S.P.E.W.) while Charlie loves his dragons so much that he finds more comfort in them rather than in women (canon). Yet, if the two ever met and discussed their mutual affection for magical creatures, what more is there to say of them?

Most stories involving Charlie and Hermione are a marriage bond (which doesn't really make any sense to have them paired together), or the two having a one-night stand (which also doesn't seem to be of Hermione's character). Very little stories, unfortunately, actually bring Charlie and Hermione together in a logical sense, either because most authors don't care to put in the time and effort to do so, or they picture Charlie as a Christian Grey cutout, while using Hermione as their own vessel for sexual fantasies to ignite.

It's a shame really, as I think Charlie/Hermione has a ton of potential. But alas, it's not very popular and seems to be decreasing in popularity every day that ticks by. I've read a ton of stories dealing with the pairing and 99% of them are all garbage.

** My OTP M/F is Harry/Luna. Although there aren't that many longer, complete fics with this pairing, I feel like it's not too rare. So, my OTP M/M pairing is Harry/Blaise. He's basically an OC since all we know is he's a Slytherin, black, has an Italian last name, from a neutral family, proud, and has a mom who is purported to kill all her husbands.

I like Blaise/Harry because it puts Harry with a Slytherin, yet a neutral one, so we know he's not a Death Eater. Yet he's proud, so there would still be issues to work through as a couple. And as a minority in the house of purebloods, I feel like he would have an interesting take on blood purity. So, you could have some of the drama of Drarry without the history of bullying, hatred, and racism to get over. Sadly, I haven't seen an author tackle the pairing quite how I'd like yet.
