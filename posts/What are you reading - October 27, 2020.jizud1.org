** I've been reading /Family Values/ by Ishtar, a Harry Potter / Addams Family crossover. I'm at the point where they arrive at Hogwarts, which is about halfway into the story.

So far, it's boring as heck. Most of the story was Dumbledore trying to retrieve Harry from the Addams' guardianship and getting checked at every turn. There's too little of Harry's daily life with the Addams and their creepy shenanigans, which to me would be the main appeal of this crossover. Also Britain is depicted as incredibly backwards in terms of magical education and werewolf rights compared to the glorious US.

It's a fic of its time I guess.

** I'm writing one called 'Cinnamon and Firewood - Fred Weasley'. It's about a girl who's part of the golden trio and she was adopted when she was younger by a muggle family. She finds out that she is Regulus Black's daughter and goes on to fulfil her destiny of hunting the Horcruxes. Her love interests are Cedric Diggory and Fred Weasley. It's still being written but there are about 20k words and 12 parts as of the 30th of October.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

Really like this one! Can't help but wonder just how long it's going to get, what with it being already as long as the entire series already at the start of Year 4...

linkffn(New Blood)

This one is also rather good. Loving the twist that just came out, whereHermione gets the Philosipher's Stone, then forgets about it. That's just so cool.

And, as always, [[https://hpmor.com][hpmor.com]]

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721/chapters/34243049]])

I'm rereading the Black Sheep Dog Series again. It's beautifully written, mostly because of absolutely superb characterizations. Walburga isn't just a raving hateful woman, but deep inside she still loves her son Sirius. Orion, Narcissa, Lucretia and later Andromeda and especially Bellatrix shine as well. Their relationships are complicated and dysfunctional, but sometimes almost affectionate which makes it so real. The tidbits about life in a family that sees itself as wizarding aristocracy are also really interesting. It's the typical victorian value inspired pureblood culture but very detailed and well done. Not in a cringy "Well met, milady" way. Oh, and one of the main characters is a female oc that romances Sirius and while this initially almost put me off, I'm so glad I ignored my reluctance. She is not some half assed self insert and fits quite nicely into the story.

*** Thanks for this. I binged it in the last three days. It truly is a wonderful character study and, yeah, Walburga is absolutely adorable (which is something I never thought I'd say about her).

My only two small complaints are that the author kind of white-washes the elder Blacks - both in regards to dark magic (they were supposed to be steeped in it, in canon) and also towards the incest (I just don't see Sirius being cool with the fact that his parents are second cousins).

Also - and this is my true gripe - the pacing is glacial. After half a million words something like a week and a half passes in the story. Which means that a year will have passed in the story around 2045, after 17.5 million words.

But seriously go read this. It's amazing.

If you're finding everything miserable, though (which I didn't), then feel free to read something else.

I am finally reading linkffn(Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum by Mister Cynical). It's a fic I've seen recommended in this sub a number of times but I avoided it because the title sounded pretentious. My idiot self thought that it was probably some dark, edgy fic featuring Bellatrix and the Death Eaters. Am I so glad to be proven wrong!

Now, I can become a bit stuck on canon and pervasive fanon interpretations of characters so I admittedly had to get over my initial disbelief that Hermione was game for some rule breaking and that she tolerated Luna right away. Once I got over that, I really started to enjoy this fic. It explores the Trio plus Luna's attempts to plan and be proactive about their adventures. These events lead to comedic interactions with their Hogwarts professors as they become more and more paranoid about what the Quartet could be up to. Moody approves.

** linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel) I just finished it and actually quite enjoyed it. Hermione sends her memories back to her 2 year old self after the war, since too many people were lost and she wants to change it. So basically a 2 year old Hermione needs to find a way to get herself taken seriously in 1981 so she can make sure Harry's parents don't die (along with other people she has the knowledge on how to save)

** This week, I read some stories of *joe6991* from ffn. I really liked his (I guess?) style. It's kinda dark, not like dark magic but more like dark thoughts, dark psychology. Also, a little bit insane. I feel like he portrays character's psychology very well. At least, that's what I thought.

For example, in Wastelands of Time, you can feel Harry's sanity slipping by and you can understand why. In Hero Trilogy, you feel like Harry really carries all world's burden on his shoulders.

To sum up, I loved *joe6991*'s style, his character build and also world build. Wastelands of Time says goodbye to canon and hugs AU like an old, missed friend.

Please correct me if I made a mistake, english is my second language.

** Just got finished reading "Castaways" by corvusdraconis. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12363314/1/Castaways]] They're one of my fav authors but this story was a little disappointing. They used many, many of the same plot points as their other stories. So while I was reading it, it kept reminding me of other very similar stories they've written, so it lost almost all it's freshness. If you've never read any stories by this author, however, I think you'll really like it. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars if you've never read their other stories. Recommended.

** Linkao3(Obscura Nox Animae)

I really liked the premise of this one but I just dont like the fic. It's a lily survives fic. A super old spell ripped her soul out of her body and shoved her into the nearest animal so she spends years inhabiting animals and following the canon characters around.

My first gripe is that canon doesn't change. That is my biggest pet peeve in any fandom. What's the point of adding another character if they don't do anything to change the plot? I stopped around chapter 45 (there's 92 chapters) and everything's the same through the first half of Deathly Hallows at this point

Also, the author did the same thing with Sirius's character that Game of Thrones did with Tyrion's character. Remember how they made him an idiot so Sansa would seem smarter? This character made Sirius a total perv so that Snape would seem more desirable, I guess.

AND SPOILER (I'm on mobile and don't know the html to black it out) when lily finally gets her body in chapter 45, (45!!!) she doesn't fucking go to Harry. She just stays with Snape. There's some excuse about how she doesn't want to worry him or make things more difficult or give Voldemort something else to hurt him with which are the worst excuses ever. I'm not a mother. I don't want to be a mother. But I'm preeeeetttty sure that if lily was willing to die for her son she would absolutely go hunt him down as soon as she was able.

Besides, the whole beginning confused me. Apparently the animal spell has to be cast at the same time as the killing curse, so how did Voldemort happen to cast two spells at once?

  The entire Wizarding world believes Lily Potter was murdered by Voldemort on that fateful night in 1981, including the man who would've given his immortal soul to save her. But there's another side to Lily's sacrifice, ancient charms and hidden truths that may have the power to change everything.

linkffn(11517506)

I'ts pretty great. The writing is a bit weird at the beginning but improves drastically a third of the way in, and is then mostly error-free. The plot and characterization is awesome, and it's pretty cool that the author is actively writing it. Fem!Harry with interesting Canon rehashes and a subtly different magical system and world.
