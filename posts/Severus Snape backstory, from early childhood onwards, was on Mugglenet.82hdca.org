EDIT: Unfortunately, still not solved. Adding details as I remember them, and the differences while reading A Difference in the Family.

The spell that shows the ceiling in the slytherin dorms was done by Snape to mess with his dorm mates, and it involved hooking his wand around a thread of something, and pulling.

Malfoy was a prefect with his own room that he ended up having to share with Snape because he tormented his own dorm mates too much.

The raven/crows name was ink, or inky?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Searching for a fic I'm dying to read again, it started with a young Snape living in poverty with Tobias and Eileen, Tobias didn't like magic and Severus was hungry to study it, he had a pet crow that his dad either killed or made him kill? and it really deeply affected him. In slytherin there was implied abuse by Lucius, who was a prefect at the time of Snape being a first year, and he had to share a room with him. Snape got his own room by inventing the spell that's on the ceiling of the Great Hall, but in the slytherin dorms it's the underside of the lake.

Is this ringing a bell for anyone? It was an incredibly long fic, and the author had many other really good fics. Mugglenet Fanfiction is down right now or I'd try to search it :[

*** After getting to chapter 18 in this fic, I've realized they are not the same, mostly missing the two gigantic details in my original post, about the ceiling spell and sharing a room with Malfoy. It's an amazing read, and honestly, REALLY eerily similar to the other fic, but is 100% not the one I'm looking for. Thank you though, I am enjoying it a lot.
