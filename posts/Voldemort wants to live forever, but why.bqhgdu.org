We know that Grindelwald wanted to break the Statute of Secrecy because he wanted to separate the wizarding world from the Muggle world and treat Muggles as second class citizens. Voldemort wanted to live forever and had a hyperfocus on blood purity (although very hypocrite but being a Slytherin heir probably made up for that in his mind), but why exactly did he want to live forever? What was the reasoning behind wanting to live until eternity, without focussing on ruling anything outside of the UK?


** Voldemort was terrifed of death

Living forever is a great way to avoid death

I think he never wanted power, but honestly once he had the power he had no intention of ruling

I think voldemort would just spend his immortaility pushing his knowledge of magic

*** This. Though I do think he liked power, though less out of any coherent political goal and more in the way a dragon wants gold. Shiny. Want more. Want it all. Not to use, just to have. If I were trying to find a coherent emotional reason for this, I'd say the powerlessness of being an indigent orphan left him determined to never be powerless again.

And I never get the impression he really cared that much about blood purity so much as saw it an easy prejudice to exploit to expedite his path to power.

He's not the most nuanced villain ever.

*** Agreed. iirc his fear of death partially came from his mother dying in childbirth.

His name also works well with this. Depending on how you translate "vol", Voldemort either means "theft from death" or "flight from death".

**** I did a whole explanation a while back on this topic: translating "vol de mort" as "flight from death" is... Just nope. It's more "flight of death", like he has seen "The birds" and want everyone to think about his coming as you would think about a flight of crows after seing the movie.

***** An interesting point, although "de" can be translated as either "of" or "from", among several other possible translations. Personally, I think translating "de" to "from" is more poetic because you get "theft from death" in the sense that he's stealing his life by using horcruxes, or "flight from death" in the sense that he's using horcruxes to flee his inevitable end.

****** It is not the translation word for word that is incorrect, it is the grammatical form. "Death" as a quasi entity is "la mort" in french, not just "mort"; and "to fly from" or to "to flee from" is not translated as "voler de", but by "fuir" or "fuir en volant".\\
Well, nothing say JKR is better at french than fanfic authors, so her intention may have been for his name to be "flee from death", but honestly, I'd rather have my interpretation when it comes to the nom-de-guerre of a dark wizard that conquered a country after terrifying it (on and off) for decades.

You know you can still be afraid of death even if you believe in an afterlife. Considering that Wizards have multiple religions they probably dont know the details beyond its existence. For all he knows he could be doomed to hell(or some equivalent) for being a wizard or not worshiping the right god, or maybe just everyone ends up in Hell, or be destined to loose all his memories and be reborn or maybe the afterlife is full of Dementors who feast on the souls of the dead. My point is that uncertainty about the details of the afterlife could be much more frightening than believing that you just stop existing.

*** That's my theory too. I like this AU fic's backstory for him: linkao3(Diablerie by Oceanbreeze7). It shows that Tom got PTSD and became obsessed with not dying after being stuck in London during the WW2 bombings.

**** It's a great story but as you said, an AU. Tom was at Hogwarts for the time of the Blitz, in fact he was asking to stay there over the summer because of the Blitz and probably framed Hagrid because of it, otherwise the school would have gotten shut down and he would indeed have been sent back to London, probably to find that his orphanage had been evacuated to the countryside without him, because that's what they were doing with the kids at that time.

That doesn't mean he wasn't still stressed as hell by it, maybe even to the point of PTSD. The Blitz stopped in May, but I doubt the Germans made an official announcement that they were quitting, so I'm sure everyone was on edge and dreading the next bombardment. Tom may even have returned that summer to find his orphanage bombed to hell and no idea where the caretakers were. He still could have coped just fine, though, he found a way to murder his father and grandparents so he could obviously use magic without it being a problem. Tom being trapped in the post-apocalyptic hellhole shown in Diablerie was a result of the Ministry locking down the area and his being unable to leave or use magic if I remember correctly.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

*** Cool that you wrote a fic about it! And true, wanting to live forever never made much sense to me, as it takes away any reason or desire for wanting to progress and achieve things in life. As Freddy Mercury sang "who wants to live forever? Who waits forever anyway?" If enternal life is the ultimate goal, then what can come after that could exceed it?

** My own personal headcanon Is that its partly cuz of the horcruxes.

He started off being afraid to die. He grew up during WW2 in Britain. He lived in a orphanage in London he was born in 1926 meaning he was in school when London was fire bombed. You see him actively trying to avoid being sent home during the summer hollidays because Hogwarts was his home.

But consider that this is the middle of WW2 and while he created his first Horcrux a couple years after the blitz, but London was still being bombed. Germany wouldn't surrender till after he graduated not for another couple years.

And he was going back to that orphanage and there was still a good chance he'd died there. Surrounded by all those muggles who he hated and who hated him. Of course he'd want a way to survive and live through that bombing should it happen.

But what started out as survival and fear of dying turned into an obsession with immortality that lasted past the war. I think in part fueled by the horcruxes. Which is not to say he had no interest or no culpability or wouldnt be a bad person without the horcruxes. But i do think they made him worse.
