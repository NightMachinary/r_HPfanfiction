*On Voldemort:*

1. Are the hairstyles used by Tom Riddle in the [[https://i.imgur.com/K2KQ7SY.jpg][CoS]] or [[https://i.imgur.com/zZ0iUhT.jpg][HBP]] films accurate to the time period? I've tried Googling 1940s hair styles, but most of the pictures I find are either kids or adults, not teenagers.

2. What kind of shoes do you think post-resurrection Voldemort would wear? (If any? He's barefoot in the GoF film, but he has just been reborn. I don't think we get any shots of his feet in OotP, HBP, or DH.)

3. Where do you think Voldemort lives and/or holds meetings with Death Eaters post-resurrection? Do you think they actually have a base of operations (Ã  la Grimmauld Place for the Order) or does he just temporarily commandeer various Death Eater homes for the duration of a meeting (such as the beginning of DH) or summon them to any random location he picks?

*On Apparating:*

In GoF, Arthur says that people who get splinched are stuck in place until they can be put back together. We see something like this when Susan Bones does it for the first time in lessons in HBP, but we also see Ron get hurt but not stuck in place during DH. At what point is it determined whether you're stuck or not?

Assuming it's a matter of two different types of splinching (full amputation vs. partial displacement), how much do you have to lose to get stuck in place? Ron failed his test because he left behind half an eyebrow; are we to assume those hairs were floating in midair where he'd left from (which might be assumed if he was stuck in place), or did they succumb to gravity (which might be assumed if he's not stuck)?

For reference, I'm trying to come up with a noticeable splinching injury, but not one that sticks the wizard in place or causes as much damage as Ron suffered in DH. I'm thinking maybe losing some fingernails?


** Voldemort is seen barefoot walking past all the dead bodies at Malfoy Manor - I think that's his groove, man. Also supports the theory that his body can't feel much.

*** Oh yeah. Been a while since I watched DH; not my favourite film. I do like the idea, mostly because I just can't imagine any sort of shoes that would suit him. (though [[/u/AutumnSouls]] and [[/u/viol8er]]'s suggestions are perfectly good ideas of course, if not ideal for stalking across muddy battlefields)

** 1. The CoS is. I've seen pictures my grandparents gave me of that time era and I've seen that kind of hairstyle. No clue about the other one.

2. Hopefully high heels.

On Apparating: I imagine you need the missing parts near you. Susan Bones was put together easily because her leg was feet away. Ron's missing skin remained at Grimmauld Place.

** Lucite Platform boots with shrunken muggles in the heels being tortured by his every step. Voldemort is a serious fashion plate.

** 1. They were generally realistic, although maybe a little less stringently styled. (Hair products of the era didn't allowed for much of a tousled look.) Hairstyles for men were generally static for the first half of the 1900s, with little change from one decade to the next, and teenage boys generally followed the same fashion trends. Even when extreme looks (like pompadours, postwar) got fashionable, not every guy would be wearing them. Male youths of the 1940s also seemed to keep their hair a little longer than men did, and didn't really wear hats until around college age.

2. I don't recall anything from the books, but using movie canon here couldn't hurt -- barefoot Voldemort is pretty creepy.

3. I like to imagine Voldemort having his various vassals having the honor of hosting him, an act which, like royalty of the past, would be more of a curse since it would bankrupt his hosts, or at least put them at extreme disadvantages.

As far as Apparition goes, it's been a while since I've re-read /GoF/, but I always had the impression that the students were stuck in place when they splinched during lessons because of safeguards in place. That's probably just my own headcanon justifications, though.

Magic called and it says hello. Charms to keep your hair exactly straight were presumably well within the skill of Riddle, not to mention Sleekeazy.
