[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806][The Princeps]] trilogy is probably the best time travel fanfiction I've read by far. Uses the Harry time travels and teaches DADA trope. A bit Dumbledore critical, but he gets a redemption and has good intentions. It has great writing and I love how different the characters' mindsets are. There's no romance, that's a bonus. I enjoy Time and Harry's relationship with each other. It's always a bonus when Regulus Black is a main character!


** Yesss. I absolutely love this. I don't read time Travel in this fandom because it almost always ends up in OP Harry, Bashing, Tommary or all of those. This takes the whole Slytherin Redemption to a whole new, better level.

Don't be discouraged by the Slytherin redemption part.

  Harry has worked for years as an Unspeakable to identify the best point where he might go back in time to change the impact of Voldemort's war. Now he knows: he will have to return to his parents' Hogwarts years and encourage the Slytherins to stand on their own instead of following a leader. He knows how to assume the post of Defense professor and how to reach the Slytherins. And from there, well, surely nothing can go too wrong.
