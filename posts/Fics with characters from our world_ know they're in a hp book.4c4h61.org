** Probably the only decent one linkffn(A Curse of Truth)

I'd love to find more, but self insertion fics are pretty much an active minefield.

At their core they are basically time travel/alternate dimension fics but instead of Harry or some other character changing things, it's an OC, which I find interesting and full of potential.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
