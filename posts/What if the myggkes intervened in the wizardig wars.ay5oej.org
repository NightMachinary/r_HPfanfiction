Just imagine the battle of Hogwarts but with tanks bursting in and fighter jets flying over head and heavy artillery tearing shit down as snipers silently take people out.

** What if muggles intervened in wizarding wars?

The you are certainly correct. They would clean sweep the death eaters with ease. Though the secret would be revealed and it would be too difficult for wizards to mass obliviate muggles. The tensions between them rise and it results in another Muggle-Wizarding war. This time they will completely exterminate the wizard kind. Though some wizard prisoners would be dissected in labs later to investigate the magical genes. So this is going to become a human experimentation fic.

*** How do you imagine that muggles would exterminate wizards? They'd never even see wizards if wizards didn't want to allow it.

**** It's not like wizards are aware of radar or GPS satellite maps right? Besides it is mentioned in books that queen and muggle prime minister know about magical world. Which means all top level leaders of world probably knew about them, yet they respect the statue of secrecy else it would be chaos. Now do you think that they will stay idle if wizarding world threatens to overtake muggle world?

But it is opposite for wizarding ministries. They are isolated and insular. They shun anything muggle. They don't know anything about muggle technology or their lethality as they underestimate them. In a war, information and communication are one of the most valuable things and wizards severely lack in that department. What is the fastest way they can communicate when they are outside? Owls? Lel.

And please don't mention patronus messages. Majority of ministry employees don't even know how to cast decent shield charms.

Don't forget, wizards had to go hiding in the first place because muggles were exterminating them in witch hunts in the first place. If 16th century muggles with torches and pitchforks can do that, then imagine what an organised, well armed muggle forces with nuclear weapons could do.
