However bad he actually was in the canon, any amount of bashing people do, for him being a git and secretly saving Harry for his love and guilt towards Lily, I for one always break down whenever he is portrayed even a little bit more caring for Harry.

After Black and Remus, he had the biggest reasons and potential to help Harry through everything in Hogwarts and with Dark lord. Hell he could be above Remus, for god fucking knows, he never asked about the boy at all. Severus might even have been in loop for where Harry was put, knowing about Petunia.

But the important thing is that he cared for Lily so much so that he was ready to become a double spy, walk in front of Dark lord at the age of 21 with his secrets, take every whim of the old goat to save Harry after her death.

Just with these, every time a fic makes him care just a little about Harry, even secretly, for as small a time as his ocllumency lessons makes me tear up at a potential godfather figure right there ready to sacrifice his life for Harry.

I know cannon Snape was also good secretly but never showed as his character demands. But making him care really open these dams.


** In cannon Snape is cruel and vindictive to an 11 then 12 and so on year old because the DEAD father that the child NEVER MET bullied him as a kid and married the woman he was obsessed with. He is a creepy bully who did as much as he could to hurt Harry growing up for the sins of his father.

TLDR; A real fucking outstanding guy /s

What double spy? For all the good Snape did he might as well have been a spy for the Voldemort only. He was useless in cannon as a spy. His care for Lily was not love but a creepy obsession.

He did nothing to save Harry after Lily's death. Snape does because Voldemort lost use for him not because he tried to save Harry.

Snape did nothing to help Harry. Book 3 has the biggest and clearest example of why Snape never cared for Harry.

You call Dumbledore an old goat but you romanticize Snape.

Cannon Snape did not care about Harry. Books 1 - 6 are evidence of that. Cannon Snape was a vindictive bully who took his anger of James Potter out on his son. Rowling's retconning of Snape's character in DH doesn't magically make a him a potential god father figure for Harry.

Yes, if you take the selective information about Snape's past with a first year Harry, Snape can be made into a good character. But after cannon third year, nothing could make Snape a potential good character.

*** It makes more sense if you look at him less as a character and more as a walking/talking plot twist. Is motivations and actions, is abilities and character shown, none of them have to make sense as an whole. It is just important the he works as a plot twist another time. And to cover this up, he has a thick layer of edginess cover him up

He also cares about Lily SO MUCH, that he is willing to sell out Harry and James to save her. What a guy

** I personally think that, although he was secretly on the right side of the war, he wasn't good. At all. He was an awful, petty, cruel person who lived his life feeling sorry for himself.

And whatever he felt for Lily wasn't love. As you pointed out in canon he treated Harry horribly. If he truly loved her he would have been better.

But that is what is great about fanfiction. What could have happened can be realized.

** Snape was a true Slytherin. He planned to always be on the winning side. As much as i appreciate it I truely couldn't bring myself to care about him. So whenever a fic portrays him as a father figure to Harry or something like this I just want to smack the writer in the head and give them a piece of mind

*** I enjoy reading Snape as a father figure to Harry when the writer manages to justify it within the plot. For example, something happens during book one that changes Snape's attitude towards Harry, or Snape manages to get his head out of his ass at some point and starts treating Harry like the child he is rather than a reincarnation of his father.

I take issue with it only if Snape's previous behavior is never addressed, or worse, explained away or justified, and Harry ends up being the one who has to change.

**** when you are able to justify it to my satisfaction then i would agree with anything but they just present it like snape is good to harry for a day and harry looks to snape like a father figure bcoz he finds out he was friends with his mother. I mean wtf man that git bullied you for what like all the time you knew each other and now he is your father figure in just a day . I'm done with it then

** Book!Snape is a bad person who hates the other, ever worse person and wants to screw him over for killing the girl he "loved". His whole objective was killing Voldemort out of revenge.

He asked Voldemort to spare Lily, no care for Harry or James, he only "cared" for Harry out of some guilt trip Dumbledore used on him.

He routinely scared children, he threatened to have Neville's toad killed out of cruelty and all that stuff.

Movie!Snape has more arguments for being a secretly good person(shielded the Trio from Lupin, protected the students and later killed the Carrows).

Boom!Snape was just a villain whose goals aligned with the hero`s.

He truthfully became a Death Eater, he really called people mudbloods, he really fought a good part of the war on Voldemort`s side, he only betrayed him when Voldemort killed Lily.

*** I think we have to give him a pass on "truthfully became a Death Eater" when it's so abundantly clear that he genuinely turned his back on that philosophy. If he'd still believed it, he could have presented Voldemort with Dumbledore's and Harry's heads on a platter and been granted anything he wanted.

His obsession with Lily was clearly not healthy. However, that makes him mentally ill, rather than Evil.

Beyond that - yeah, he was pretty awful to people. How much of that was nature, and how much nurture, is hard to say. Still, he had impressive skills and even impressive virtues - patience, fortitude, loyalty - to go with his large character flaws. Judging the whole picture is beyond me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3417954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enemy-Within]] read this. It has the best Snape characterization I've read, it is true to his character but it gives a different perspective.
