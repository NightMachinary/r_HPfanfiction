Personally, I've always thought, without a doubt, Hermione and Ron would be James godparents. They're Harry's best friends and I doubt Ginny would object, given that Ron is her brother and Hermione her sister-in-law.

As for Lily and Albus, I've never been 100% certain about who they might have picked. Especially for godmothers. Luna seems a likely candidate for one, given that Lily's middle name is Luna, but for the other? I just don't know.

For godfathers, I think it's not too unlikely that either one, or both Albus and Lily, have a Weasley brother for a godfather. But I've never ruled out the possibility of Neville being one their godfathers either, since Harry and him were fairly good friends.

Have any of you wondered about this? If so, who do you think the most likely godparents are for James, Albus, and Lily?


** Why couldn't Ron and Hermione be god parents to all 3 kids?

*** They could be, honestly. Though, I think that would be rather unusual. Myself and my brother have different godfathers and godmothers, as do the cousins on both sides my family who are siblings to one another.

When it's come up in passing with friends, (two of whom were siblings) they also all had different godparents from their siblings.

**** Huh. Didn't know that was common. I guess I always thought that the kid should have the same god parents. My wife and I are godparents to two kids.

***** That's interesting to know. Perhaps it depends on the family? Or maybe the religion or something?

What I do know about my family personally is that my parents picked their friends for my godparents, and their siblings for my brother. I think in our family, they were just honorary titles more than any indication who they wanted to take us in should they die.

***** I think it's split up tip divide the burden if the parents do die. Imaging suddenly having 3 more kids to support who all just suffered a huge loss.

****** Seems to me that splitting up the family after a huge loss would be like throwing fuel on the fire.

**** The only of my friends that have godparents have the same ones as their siblings so I think it depends on the family.
