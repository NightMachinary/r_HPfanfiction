So, Harry and Hermione travel back and time and pose as a married couple and mingle with the older generation; Except, James and Sirius had a falling out over Remus.

Harry is later given the Peverell lordship at the Wizengamot.

That's all I remember, unfortunately.

Thanks in advance!


** This one came to mind, it's dimension travel + time travel and have the things you mentioned.
