  Starts out the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione meet the Goddess of Love, and she offers to let them go back in time. Strictly Harry and Hermione. Minor - well maybe major Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore Bashing. Soul Bond - Time Travel
#+end_quote

Very few summaries make me rage like this one does. How the fuck does this have over 10k followers is beyond me.

If H/Hr can only be achieved through Weasley bashing, then it's a BS story.

** Thrown into the Void as a bodiless fëa, Sauron hadn't expected to get out there any time soon. No wonder thus that suddenly crashing stark naked into a different world came as a bit of a surprise... Will he cope with the wizarding world, Hogwarts, and the messy Weasley family, or are we in for disaster? Either way, it's gonna be a rough ride...

"Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW."

***** Nope actual story. Voldemort runs the world and Harry was sent to azkaban after Ginny died in the chamber, because Dumbledore. He of course is sent through the veil after ten years for reasons and is then given a second chance to somehow outwit Dumbledore even though he's been locked in jail since age 12, but it's ok despite the dementors he learned how to manipulate his connection with Voldemort in order to learn everything he needs. Not joking that's all in chapter one.

Oh! Also he's gonna use his future knowledge to collect a bunch of hot witches to help him fight both Voldemort and Dumbledore...

** First, the summary of a story by everyone's favourite author, robst:

#+begin_quote
  Not for Weasley fans, dark beginning and rating is for safety. A Re-do with payback on the menu H/Hr Complete
#+end_quote

It wouldn't be a bad summaries thread without mentioning H^{30}:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter eventually eats a sandwich and discusses life with a famous author.
#+end_quote

Downright /weird/:

#+begin_quote
  A one-night stand with the Sorting Hat leaves Harry lusting for more. How will a heartbroken Ron cope with Harry's new infatuation? Rated M for sex scenes with hats. Entirely non-canon and unrealistic.

** - What if "all the bad guys were secretly good because the actors who portrayed them were really sexy so I'm going to write them all to be super secret spies and Hermione will have to choose between Severus/Lucius/Draco/blahblahblah yadda yadda yadda" type summaries (I summarized a few for you there).
- Anything claiming to be a decent soul bond story, with Harry/Gabby as the main pairing. Toss in Fleur for extra gross-out points.
- Story has 100k+ words. Story is marked complete. Get to the end of the summary which is starting to sound....ABANDONED. /sob/
- Anything with "The Ice Princess of Slytherin" in the summary.

** There was one that had not a single instance of capitalization or punctuation in the entirety of the title or summary. I should have saved it, and if I find it again I will.

As to actual summaries and their content... well, there's a lot that are trying to emulate My Immortal. At some point we crossed the line between crack imitating bad fics to just bad fics and we need to go back to making good fics. There are too many idea threads and too many identical fics for there to be a new word vomit fic every week.
