** I bookmark the chapter I'm on, and in the title of the bookmark, I add "- Ch #" just so I can quickly see where I left off. Not a great method as I tend to remove the bookmark once I'm done, and I forget what I've read or which story had which plot, details, etc. I know some people have some really great google sheets or documents to keep track of what they've read, what it was about, how much they liked it, etc. I'm sure you could make a similar case for stories you're currently reading.

** I don't read more than a maximum of two at once. I download everything I read and put it on my tablet, so that remembers the last page I was on. The only time I don't read on tablet is if (a) it's really short, in which case I don't need to mark of where I was in it; or (b) I'm converting a PDF; that requires format fixing so I read it as a document on PC and I just put a note at the top saying what chapter/page I was on.

** I don't read much FF nowdays (I always go like 1 year on, 2 years off on fanfic), but when I did this was my whole system:

I mainly find new fics by forum recs (inc. this subreddit) and favorites of authors I like.

If a fic catches my attention (interesting premise/targets one of my weaknesses/has generated a lot noise) I give it a try. Like 75% of stories get the axe here, since my standards are pretty high (and kinda weirdly specific) after so many years. If I can't get through the first chapter but I want to give the story another chance, I skim a couple chapters way down the line. This either leads to the axe or my future reading bookmark folder. And after the story gets into the folder:

If it's long (>60-100k) and complete it gets converted to EPUB, then goes to my kindle and calibre library.

If it's long and in progress, it too goes to the kindle, but also to my favorites list.

If it's short (<30-40k) I usually just read it on the computer in one go. Again if in progress, I add to favorites.

At any case, after those steps the link gets deleted from my bookmarks, since it tended to get bogged down a lot (at some point I had like 600+ links in there).

So basically my favorites list track the stories, but I only read on ff.net and ao3 anyway. I used to follow a small amound of LJ writers but they're not active anymore (GreenGecko come back!)

** Generally, if I really like a fic I'll read it to the end without getting distracted by other stories. If it's in progress, I'll favourite it and I regularly check my favourites list for updates. If I get halfway through and get distracted then I either remember or I forget it and therefore it probably wasn't worth continuing anyway.

** Fics that have less than 30k words, I don't download them, read them directly from the website. Updates too, using the favourites. I usually read the first chapter of a fic with 30k+ words to see if I'll enjoy the author's flow, grammar, quality overall. If the its bad, but the premise is still good, I download to EPUB and read on my PC till I get sleepy, then I transfer the EPUB to my cell. Everything about tracking what I've read, where I am and what the fic is about, is done either by memory or by the history of my folder, since its sorted by date.

** I use a bit of a mix. When I started Reading in 2013, I just used chrome bookmarks to keep track of fics, but without the summaries it was just a long list of names. In 2014 I switched to just keeping text documents of each fic like on an ipad note or something. Then When university started I kind of fell behind on reading for like a year. Then I found [[/r/hpfanfiction]] iirc, it was amazing and gave recommendations for things based on similarities more often than not. Since a majority of them were recommending ffn i used their website and eventually switched to the app to keep track and read everything on android. I have an ao3 account which I originally made back when i had irl friends who wrote nightvale fanfic. Nowadays i use baconreader to find a fic (or firefox on desktop) and then read in ffn or ao3 app or on firefox reader view.
