I have a bit of a problem. I don't know where to post my fan fictions. I have them up at fanfiction.net and mugglenet faction, but they just seem to get lost in the crowd. Where, in your opinion, is the best place to post fan fics and do you have any tips on getting your fic known to people?


** There are ways to keep your fanfics on ff.net from getting lost in the crowd too.

Review other people's stories because they will probably click on your name to see who you are. Join some forums, like HP Fanfiction Challenges.

All of the other suggestions are good though. I like mugglenet fanfiction and sugarquill as well.

**** I'm still working on that, but it seems to be a good way to get readers. I've tried review tag games, and it isn't always very successful at getting people to read your stories--especially multi-chapter ones--all the way through.

It always fascinates me how some people seem to write something--even something with lots of problems (as I do too) and suddenly get a HUGE reader-base, even if it's their first appearance in the fandom.

How do they do that?!

** There are so many good suggestions here for getting your story more exposure. I recommend joining livejournal and contributing to some of the HP communities there. You can post chapters of your own work and encourage others. As far as good places to post, I like [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/][Archive of Our Own]] because it's non-moderated, and [[http://www.thepetulantpoetess.com/][The Petulant Poetess]] because it's so supportive to writers.

*** A lot of the HP communities I've found on livejournal seem to be almost dead. Do you have suggestions for ones that are still quite active?

Thank you for the referral to the Petulant Poetess. I'm on AO3 now, but it is good to know about a moderated site, too.

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com]] has several good stories and a dedicated following of people who actually review. But it has only been around a few years and is still quite small.

Funny enough, an oldy but a goody is [[http://www.ficcwad.com]] but the site hasn't been updated in dogyears. We were worried at one point that it was going to lose its dns but got renewed at the last minute. I think the admins have gotten more active again, but I haven't posted anything to it in years, or read anything on it in months.

In all honesty, ff.net is probably your best bet, but you are correct that it gets lost amongst all the crap. I swear browsing for anything to read on the sight nowadays is H/Snape, H/Vold, Hr/Snape, Hr/Draco, Hr/Remus...

Not sure if only crappy fanfic authors left, or everyone is just trying to be original because the main pairings have all been done to death. I understand that some people are into slash, but every slash fic I've ever tried to read had absolutely zero background. They end up being a 6th year fic where Harry is suddenly gay for Draco/Snape/Voldemort with no reason and no background. I'm sorry but I just don't see Harry as gay, ever, and since i'm not looking for a gay superhero/role model, probably because I'm 99% straight, I just can't get into it. And neither can the majority of FF readers.

I know, I'm a homophobic douche because I don't want to read about Harry/Snape buttsects, bring on the downvotes.

*** Nothing wrong with not wanting to read gay pairings. It's only homophobic if you start claiming its wrong purely because it's gay (rather than age difference issues/Snape being a dick/Harry being underage in many of those fics/whatever other problem there happens to be) and if you start telling people they can't write/read it. As long as you don't do that, you're entitled to like and dislike whatever you want.

*** I don't write or read fan fic sthat have ANYTHING to do with romance or pairings. I write fics that excited us when we were reading the series at the start. I cant stand pairings or anything in Fan fiction.

**** And yet, last time I checked the first three pages of HP fic on ffn there wasn't a single fic without pairings listed.

And I haven't tried not writing romance/smut... I write good romance/smut so that's what I stick to. Maybe I'll try writing a kids story.../shrug/

***** Ffnet doesn't make it clear whether your listed characters are a pairing or just the two main characters, unfortunately . . .

****** I agree, which is why an author needs to know they have to spell that out in the description.

I still say they need a slash filter, because some awful authors will not mention it at all until it happens because they know people don't want to read it. I feel like those people are both afraid they will have no readers, and are sneaky bastards who want to ambush people with it so they HAVE to read it. As if the surprise slash will suddenly make people like it.

There are slash fic that are really done well, but most have zero buildup or background. They take what is essentially the straightest male characters and suddenly, out of nowhere, Harry and Draco/Snape/Voldemort figure out that they only hated each other because of repressed sexual tension.

I don't believe it works for R/Hr and I don't believe it when it happens to Harry. You have to be writing an epic fic, with lots of background changes or at least a cursory explanation using psychology (ie Harry was abused and associates all women with his aunt Petunia, so he finds himself only attracted to boys. Or maybe he seeks the approval of abusive males because of his relationship with Vernon). But that would mean there is a mental illness involved rather than gay being "normal".

I am not coming down on either side, but I think the instance of those who are gay by choice, or gay due to upbringing/circumstance is much higher than those who are born gay. That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with it. But if you want a straight character to suddenly be gay you need to explain how/why. /rant

** I'm partial to harrypotterfanfiction.com, but they have pretty stringent rules. No NC17, no teacher/student pairings, etc. If you're thinking of posting there, be sure to read up on the rules first.

** I like [[http://hpfandom.net/][hpfandom.net.]] It's not very big, so you won't have a huge pool of people accessing the site, but on the other hand, fewer posts give you a better chance of regular visitors seeing yours. Philo posted The Apple Tree there, and that has to be one of the most successful fanfics in the fandom.
