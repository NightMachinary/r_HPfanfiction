Stories where Sirius was sorted into Slytherin? Or perhaps Remus was sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin? Or Severus was sorted into Gryffindor or Ravenclaw? Ect Extra. Any rating is fine. Would like it to be completed, but if not a lot of chapters would be fine.

  There are some things ungoverned by fate. If Sirius Black had gone the path of every Black before him, if he had been in Slytherin, he would have been a very different boy. It would have been a very different war.

** linkffn(Stages of Hope) has Sirius sorted into Slytherin and best buds with Snape, but it's all in the past by the time the story starts and you don't see any of their school years. Not sure if that's what you're looking for.

*** Mhm, not exactly what I'm looking for. (I want to see them in their Hogwarts years). But even so thank you! I will still likely read it at some point because it does look interesting. If anyone knows any more let me know!

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
