I was at [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] to check for new Harry Potter stories and noticed a discrepancy. From the main page, when I click on Books under the Fanfiction heading, next to Harry Potter it shows 821K stories. When I click on Harry Potter it drops to 621K, though this is due to a ratings filter being applied. So if I click on Filters and change the ratings to All, it jumps to 779K. So where did the extra 42k stories go?


** Some websites don't properly update information when they delete stories. It could be that the discrepency is due to deleted stories (there was a big NC-17 purge a long time ago).

Moreover, this count can be inconsistent in different places, since most code has inconsistencies.

For instance, some places might count how many stories were ever created (a fairly quick thing to do); whereas, other places might actually do a search and then filter out deleted stories (much more expensive to do).

*** It is possible it is still showing the count from the old NC-17 stories that were purged.

** Non-related but when I started reading fanfiction back in 2003-2004 it was somthing like 35k stories. I just did a double take when I saw your numbers XD. Man how far we have come.

** Possibly deleted/removed stories are still counted in the total?

*** Languages is not set so defaults to all, and on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]], as the movies are based on the books, there is no separate Movies category for Harry Potter stories.

**** u/iamjmph01:
#+begin_quote
  Movies category for Harry Potter stories
#+end_quote

not relevant to your question, but you can filter between just books or just movies, the World option has both, default is set to all. I've never used it so i don't know how accurate it is...

*** Crossovers are their own Fanfiction category, showing 48,427 stories. Following the same as I did with the main category and setting ratings to all, the number of available crossover stories is the same at 48.4K..

** I'm pretty sure unless you filter to specifically allow ALL fics no matter the rating then it'll only show up to Teen rating.

*** It does, which is why I set the ratings filter to All rather than just Teen.

*** Crossovers are a separate category, and there are 159K rated M stories. way more to account for the 42K discrepancy.
