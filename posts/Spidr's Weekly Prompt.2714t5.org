So this subreddit could use more prompts (and more writing!), so each week I'll give a prompt, and y'all will proceed to write a fic for it. I'll choose the best every Saturday.

The winner of last week's: [[/u/NaughtyGaymer]]

Their fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10375464/1/Green-Looks-Beautiful-On-The-Unwilling]]

This week's prompt: *A flower on every grave, and a grave for every soldier..*
