Like, Harry winds up in Earthland from Fairy Tail, or The PJO Universe, or wherever when he's young, is raised up there with a good childhood, and eventually finds Hogwarts calling him home for school and shows up as a teenager when he was supposed to be eleven.


** I wish I knew any like this, sounds like it'd be an interesting premise. Though a part of me thinks it'd be funny if Harry comes back aged 31ish, and freaking everyone out thinking he's James Potter back from the dead.

** linkffn(8400788) Harry goes missing in the summer after his first year and comes back after being raised and fighting in wahammer 40k universe. I don't know much 40k store/lore stuff but this fic and its follow ups are hilarious .

*** Considerably seconded, this time with the benefit of being a 40k nerd from back in the Rogue Trader days. The melding of 40k and Potterverse is *chef's kiss*. Also, /hilarious/ in ways it's difficult to give examples of without dropping spoilers, but some of the best bits come when Cunning Slytherins of British Wizarding Politics think they've got a chance against a Harry that spent literal centuries keeping his feet in the internal politics of the Ordo Malleus...

**** Thirded. Bonus points for the sequels having some of the best OCs I've ever read in fanfiction.

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  Upon that fateful Halloween Night, Lily & James Potter didn't actually die. They faked their death to protect their baby boy. Harry ends up in not only a different country, but in a slightly different universe. He grows up as Akira Kurusu. And now, The Phantom Thieves have been summoned to Hogwarts...
