He has it all: no parents, is a friend to all living things, a non human sidekick and a wonderful singing voice, how would this change the series?

I'm thinking of how things might change if Harry can use the animals around Hogwarts to learn information, spy on people and get help, how Ms Norris would love to follow Harry around, he gains a basilisk sidekick in book two. What else might change?
