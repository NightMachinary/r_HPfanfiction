** Harry being an Horcruxe does not make him immortal, just like being an Horcruxe does not make an item very resilient. It's the Wizard who has the responsability to prepare a suitable receptacle for his soul by protecting an item with magic.

Outside of that, I can hardly see such a deal being accepted by both side :

- As Dumbledore said in OotP, even if Harry should not care about the Prophecy, it is not in his nature to let other people suffer. We are talking about someone who went into a Fiendfyre to save the life of people who had just tried to kill him. No matter how he is treated, Harry would never turn his back on Britain, in not for the current wizard or his best friends, just to respect the sacrifice of his parents and save future generations.
- Voldemort would have more reasons to accept the deal, since unlike Harry he does want immortality. But I'm pretty sure that Voldemort is too parano√Ød to let his potential demise free (he attacked the Potter to kill a baby just because he would be "the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord), he would want Harry sealed under the darkest dungeon, both to protect his Horcruxe and himself. Also, there is the whole "Harry managed to escape me several time, sometimes in front of witnesses) that could force his hand to act.

That being said, I remember a trilogy where Harry and Voldemort did make a similar deal, though I can't seem to remember the name (it was decades in the future where most of the canon characters, outside of them, are either dead or very old).

*** I'm not sure the horcrux does make him immortal, but the object horcruxes are very resilient - the diary and locked resist damage, except for highly destructive substances like basilisk venom or fiendfyre which is notoriously difficult to control.

**** In DH, Hermione, who has read the book, explains that the 1st chapter about making an Horcruxe focus on the importance to create a suitable receptacle for the soul. The diary and the locket are not resistant to damages because they are Horcruxe, but because Voldemort enchanted them to be nearly indestructible before putting part of his soul inside.

Since Harry is a living being who never received any of these enchantments, his body is no different from any other wizard his age (outside of the whole "blood burns enemies thing).

  1724. All Harry wanted to do was to cross the Atlantic and start his apprenticeship under one of the most renowned physicians. Tom Riddle is convinced everything floating in the seven seas belongs to him. That includes ship-wrecked, green-eyed youths. Especially if they tell him to fuck off.
