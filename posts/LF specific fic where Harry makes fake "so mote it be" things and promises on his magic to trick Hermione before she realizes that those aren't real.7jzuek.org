It wasn't a serious fic, that was played off like a joke. Like, Harry would swear on his magic not to break the rules or something, and immediately did so after she goes away.


** It happens in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12350003/1/Weeb][Weeb]] so that might be what you're looking for. One of the funniest fics I've ever read.\\

  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.
