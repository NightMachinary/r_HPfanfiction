** I have a head cannon that Arthur fucks with the kids constantly. He mispronounces muggle words and asks stuff like what the purpose of a rubber duck is just to get a laugh.

The guy enchanted a flying car, he's not an idiot. He and Molly just laugh behind the kids back that they believe he doesn't know what electricity is.

** I saw this in another headcanon thread and liked it.

Bill and Charlie are well-adjusted, but the twins and Ron have a fairly toxic relationship, because their dad became less involved in the childrearing when he got that job in the ministry. Percy was the awkward middle child in this scenario. Who had Arthur around much more when he was younger and then saw and remembered the transition to Dad being out at work a lot more, internalising from that that a job could be more important than family (not helped by Bill and then Charlie graduating and leaving almost immediately because of their jobs).

They have talent and passion for their niche interest but have no interest in any specific form of status power or recognition. Just the ability to pursue their interests nor do they seem to value ambition. They value wit and creativity and bravery and talent.

** I personally like the idea that Molly is overwhelming and smotheringly risk averse as a mother. That's why her 2 oldest son's ran off into seemingly rather dangerous jobs that took them overseas as soon as they finished school. And probably in part what influenced Percy in feeling able to turn against his family.

Similarly, I think the twins probably bullied Percy mercilessly and his parents never really protected him from it. And he probably didn't get the praise or attention he deserved from his parents either. He came after Bill who was smart, successful, and seemingly effortlessly cool. And after Charlie who maybe didn't get the high grades, but was very popular and successful in his own way. Percy was the bookish, introvert who could have flourished with parents who gave him protection from his siblings and who pushed him to step past his boundaries. Instead he got overlooked because the nothing he did was better than what Bill or Charlie had already done, and the twins then took up all his parents attention. He was probably an 'easy' child for his parents, able to be left alone with a book and never causing any problems. But the result was a lot of lingering resentment towards his siblings and parents that ended in him turning against them.

#+end_quote

She isn't averse to risk, she's a mother trying to keep her naive, reckless, foolhardy children from getting killed in war, like her two brothers. That makes her smart, not smothering. It's what any parent ought to do - protect their children from the ugly side of life as much as possible.

Children aged 14 through 17 are not cut out for life and death conflict, generally speaking.

Lol. Percy was an ungrateful power hungry little shit. Harry saved his little sister's life only a couple of years ago, and he had no trouble believing the otherwise unbelievable tale then. He turned to Fudge for the sole reason of rising ranks within the Ministry.

"Bullied". What a joke. It's called ribbing, and siblings do it to each other all the time - it is natural.

Also, Fred and George are not the "24x7 bully pranksters extraordinaire" like the majority of this sub seem to think. They're certainly unruly and get into their fair share of trouble, but they're just like anyone else. All that make them stand out is the fact that they're excellent in product design. The number of "pranks" they do over the course of 5-6 years can be counted on one hand.

And the Weasley parents did a rather good job raising their other children - there aren't any signs of favoritism or partiality at all, and they all grew up into well rounded individuals.

**** I'm always surprised that people take Bill and Charlie taking jobs abroad as some kind of sign that something went wrong parenting wise - plenty of people go on gap years or take jobs abroad after studying. My sister moved to Paris straight after school, and it certainly wasn't out of a desperation to get away. If you have raised a child independent and confident enough to move to a different country I take that as a very good sign indeed.

***** Bill and Charlie's jobs are also very specialized. They're not office jobs like Percy's, which allowed him to live at home (even if he most likely wound up sleeping in the office).

If you want to work as a Curse Breaker, then there's not a lot of places left to break curses.

And however many dragon sanctuaries there are, it's likely they send you wherever there's an opening, like Romania.

** Charlie is the brother Ron looked up to the most. But by around HBP he started idolizing Bill more.

Before Hogwarts the family was devided in to pairs. Bill/Charlie, Percy/books, Forge, Ginny/Ron. And they had an unbreakable bond. After the war, Ron and Ginny went back to these days and strengthened their bond. Ginny also wanted to keep an eye on Harry without him knowing and Ron vice versa. Harry and Hermione had the same pact.

After Ginny's first year, the brothers made a pact to look after Ginny even more so.

Ron is the son Arthur is most similar to and most proud of. And Ron is much more closer to his father than his mom. He tells his dad about the issues he faces and etc. He has that distant relationship with his mom. Molly realizes this too late and is saddened by it.

The brothers and the sister gets together once a month to hang out with George and meanwhile the wives and Harry gets together to hang out with other. Harry hates this and wants to get in the red head club, but Ginny is having none of it. Wesley's gets drunk quite a lot (despite being heavy drinkers) and their significant others have to take care of them afterwards. Emotions run high during this period.

Everyone actually hated living with Gred. But they loved them as well. Ron resented the twins for the way they treated him. And the twins didn't show much love for Ron either. But after the war, Ron took a page out of Hermione's book and looked for a way to bring back Fred. He hates himself for thinking Fred died thinking Ron hated him. He goes looking for the stone. It falls to George to stop Ron and they clear up their feelings. And both gets drunk. After this they both realises how much they miss Fred and George offeres Ron to be a partner. Ron takes it up.

After a huge argument between the brothers and when emotions are running high, they remove their watches and wands calmly and have an old fashioned brawl in the backyard to vent up their feelings. Molly turns a blind eye to this. Their significant others don't know about these.

The twins and Ron has always resented Molly a bit due to her favoritism of Ginny. They obviously loved Ginny and Molly, but families are complicated. They don't have that issue with Arthur. Arthur treats everyone equally and keeps the balance in the family when needed.

** Mrs Weasley was desperately trying to get a job throughout the series, but she had to drop out mid way through her seventh year because she was pregnant with Bill, and then they had a swift wedding. As a result, she has no NEWTs and no work experience - at one point, Arthur's work was enough to sustain a large family (as salaries in the UK used to be), but as times changed after Voldemorts first downfall they increasingly struggled to make ends meet as Arthur got constantly overlooked for promotion. Molly did try, but in a small economy at her age with no qualifications or experience? She ended up making a small amount of pocket money by making clothes.

*** I don't know. I think more 11 years olds fit in Gryffindor than in Slytherin or Hufflepuff. I genuinely think the Sorting Hat must look at potential traits rather than current traits. 11 year olds aren't cunning, and they're rarely ambitious in anything than quite broad/general terms. 11 year olds are rarely hard working without an adult motivating it. Hell, some 11 year olds are Ravenclaw worthy, but not that many. Certainly not enough to fill a class each year at Hogwarts.

** - Though they would never admit it in public, Ron and Ginny are each other's favorite sibling.

- If George wasn't there to keep him on course, Fred would have been far more aggressive and mean-spirited.

- Percy gave Oliver Wood advice on how to handle the Twins.

- Even though Percy got in less trouble, George is actually the "momma's boy."

- Bill gave Ron his collection of "Mad Muggle" comics.

- Charlie was the one who suggested keeping chickens. He also made friends with all the garden gnomes and tried to teach the ghoul how to talk.

- Because she had nobody else to play with during the events of /Sorcerer's Stone,/ Ginny reignited the friendship with the ghoul and taught him to play Exploding Snap.

- Molly encouraged Ginny to break into the broom cupboard and fly her brothers' brooms.

- Every year, the entire Weasley clan has a castle-building contest out of their Chocolate frog card collection

- Whenever one sibling got sick, Molly would have them all stay in the same bedroom to make sure they would all catch the illness in relatively quick succession
