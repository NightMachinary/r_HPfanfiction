Are there any good stories that focus on Bill/Fleur? I was reading a story where Harry and Ginny end up in Middle-earth and for some reason I was thinking that it would be better if it was Bill/Fleur instead. I don't think I have read any with them as the main characters.


** A Boon for Bill is centered around Bill/Fleur and Harry/Hermione. The plot can be summarized with:

Potion Queen Molly is being ridiculously prude and annoys the shit out of Harry and Hermione as they are starting a relationship. Bill and Fleur help them and need Harrys help to get engaged due to Veela life debts being in the way.

It belongs mainly into the humour genre and despite being marked as inclomplete (with around 200k words) can be seen as complete because it provides closure to the main plot.

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.

*** Thank you for the recommendation. I don't really care for Harry/Hermione or Molly bashing though.

** If you're willing to read some adult material and are okay with them sharing the spotlight with Percy and Audrey, there's linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC). I am not a big fan of Bill or Fleur but I enjoyed their chapters far more than the others.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
