Recently, there was a great thread discussing Sirius' character in fandom vs cannon. Check it out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/anvuxx/fanon_sirius_vs_canon_sirius/?st=JRX123ZL&sh=31a880a3][here]]. However, there were very few story recommendations. Anyone have any great ones that spring to mind?


** linkao3(In the Black by izzythehutt). linkao3(Black Mask by izzythehutt).

These 2 fics are some of the best portrayals of young post-Hogwarts Sirius and his family that I've seen.

Also, linkao3(Escape Artist by izzythehutt). A rather unique fic that features his relationship to McGonagall through the years (platonic of course). It's unfortunately on a quasi-hiatus since the author is focusing on finishing Black Mask, but they've said that they plan on finishing and it's a great read either way.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809115][renascentia series]] on ao3 is fantastic as well, although the main series is best described as Regulus-centric, but still heavily featuring Sirius---I would definitely give it a shot either way because it's a great take on post-Azkaban Sirius. The things he thinks, says and does in that fic feels like a natural extension of canon. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/989298][renascentia side stories]] have some really fantastic Sirius-centric fics too, focusing more on teenage/young adult Sirius.

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

  Christmas 1979---danger, secrets, lies and their shared history looms large over the Blacks' first Yuletide season as a reunited family. While life as a fugitive proves bleaker (and more boring) than Regulus could have imagined, a botched espionage mission at Malfoy Manor draws Sirius deeper into the Black family web---and his cousin Narcissa's social set.Meanwhile, Walburga hatches a daring scheme to restore her wild firstborn's damaged reputation in the family---finding him a suitable bride---while Orion grapples with the past, and the high price his two sons have paid for his inaction.[Regulus Black Lives/Black Family Witness Protection AU.

** For Hogwarts years, Against the Moon is probably my favorite wee Sirius. It's Remus POV but Sirius is practically everywhere. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon]] (no Wolfstar; unfinished)

For what it's worth, I see Black Vengeance rec'd all the time in response to these types of threads and it's just personally not a favorite of mine. He seems ooc and very cringy to me throughout, even if it's AU.

Finally, authors Lady Altair, the Divine Comedian and Lady Bracknell (all FFN) write good one shots or short/medium fics where Sirius is the main character or heavily featured. Generally light R/S, but usually not an important component, so if it's something you're okay with to a degree then they characterize him well. In particular, Blackpool by the Divine Comedian is probably my favorite fic.

The Truth in Potions [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12559768/chapters/28604220]] is Great, it's Sirius/Remus, but delves into his character and is a great read.

Black Pride by AlexHazza [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16186133/chapters/37823456]] I'm not sure where she's going with the OC but it's very different and original.
