** Harry/Tonks. The age difference makes it iffy, but can obviously be adjusted so they're closer in age, or they can just wait to actually do anything until Harry's of age, then the difference doesn't matter. Son of Potter, Daughter of Black has Harry/Melania aged up like a year and a half-two years due to time shenanigans, and I don't think the author was planning on having them get together properly for another year (so post 5th year, which would make Harry close to 17).

** Passageways has a very interesting dynamic between Harry and Bellatrix (from the early 70s). She was pretty horrified by what she had become in Harry's timeline and it is a tale of two lonely people.

The story has its moments, but the later chapters have a focus on an OP bloodline for Harry which stops me from saying that it's a great fic.

Generally I'm not opposed to a Bellatrix option for either Harry or Hermione, BUT ONLY IF Bellatrix defects before the DoM. Thirteen years of being tortured in Azkaban is enough to repay one's debt to society, and Bellatrix could be a very valuable asset for Harry's side since she's one of the few truly dangerous people in the series. Of course, if you go with reformed Bellatrix rather than time travel, it would take a few years of fighting besides Harry (and/or Hermione) for her to be trusted. And tearing through Death Eater ranks is the best way to atone for previous crimes.

However, for some reason, the people who write that pairing seem to love the angst which results from the troubled past if she killed Sirius and tortured Hermione. That's something I don't understand, nor do I want to. If either of those happened, there's way too much water under the bridge.

  Harry is fully prepared to face the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. Unfortunately, he never gets a chance. Tamelyn Riddle realises that killing one student and draining the soul of another would leave too much evidence of her return. Luckily, there's another horcrux right in her reach that she can use to hitch a ride. A slowburn Harry/fem!Riddle fic.

** I once read a Bellatrix/Remus (in French tho) that was just magnificent. But my fav remains Drago/Rose. I seriously love what authors do with the age difference, with the legendary Potter's foe VS Hermione's daugther carrying the weight of her name etc. Most of the fics I read were well-written and terrifically sexy, but I understand that the age gap might repel people.

** Harry/pansy if done right. set after the war is good. Can angle it as her being a dumb kid and essentially having been indoctrinated by her parents for they way she acted towards those her parents thought where beneath them. the incident in the great hall being chocked up to fear for her own life... I mean wouldn't you do something similar like trying to handover someone that you don't know, and haven't had any positive experiences of over the course of the couple of years you've known them. Too the current government that currently surrounded you/ was about to send as many of their forces as necessary to kill that person no matter who got in the way.

** The canon ones, Harry/Ginny in particular because there's a lot of space to create scenes of them, even before they get together, whilst sticking to canon. I find that their relationship interesting to follow from GoF timeframe on. I also find that Ginny gets a bit of a bum deal in a lot of works so it's nice to see it go how she wants.

Outside of canon I'd say Harry/Lavender. I find her character particularly interesting in fanfiction, especially if the author makes her survive the Battle of Hogwarts, and I feel pairing her with Harry is a way of expressing her character growth.
