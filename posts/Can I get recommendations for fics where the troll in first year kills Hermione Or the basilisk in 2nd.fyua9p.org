I can't believe I just wrote the above sentence. I mean I love Hermione. But sometimes I just want to know the consequences of her dying in First year. Or being so badly injured that she can't continue on at Hogwarts.

There are of course a couple of fics I've read where for the purposes of the story it wasn't really an issue, /Blindness/ by Starcat where her injuries lead to her leaving Hogwarts and attending the same muggle private school as Harry. Or /Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday/ by Bobsaqqara in which in an parallel Universe Harry died as a baby and subsequently Hermione (and somehow also Ron) was killed by the troll in first year, but we never see the aftermath or consequences for Hogwarts itself because the Ministry 5 from another dimension arrive years after the incident.

So while fics like those technically qualify and I wouldn't necessarily be averse to reading them, I'm really looking for stories in which Hermione dies or leaves Hogwarts as a result of the troll or the basilisk and we continue to see the aftermath at Hogwarts.


** Linkffn(Something like your family)

Hermione dies. Harry destroys the magical world in return.
