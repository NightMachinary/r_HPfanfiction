Some classic and sad drarry to recommend? I resentfully read the beautiful world and am looking for other stories that will make me as sad as this one did.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/14935][Scholomance by Astolat on AO3]] is exactly that. Classic, sad, HP/DM, interesting ideas about magic and a totally different plot involving the war against Voldemort than what is in the canon. The parts of the series aren't very long individually, but together they make a powerful story.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/473335][Twist of Fate]] is perfect for your request. In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Draco has to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This fic is the perfect example of a story that could only work in the HP universe - it is so woven into the fabric of canon. Canon knowledge just enriches this - it almost feels like it could be head cannon (EWE).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/852061][Kiss The Joy Until the Sun Rise]] is also a really heartbreaking and beautiful fic. You have to be signed in to AO3 to read it though.
