** Pissed of at his family, pissed of at everything really. Ron at 10 years old was considering going to Drumstang just to make everyone as pissed of as he is. But that will take another year. So for now he desided it was time to sneak out to the muggle world. His mum always gets mad when his dad messes with muggle stuff. So this seems like a great idea.

Ron found a black square box just laying around on a bench. The words "acdc" where written on it. But he really couldnt tell what it was or how it worked. So he decided to ask an old man that was walking by. The old man explained that if was a portable cassete player. "Like one of your modern cd players but older", he said. The man explained what to do to get the thing to play music. And thats how Ron got to know muggle rock music. He liked it.

I think that's enough to say they were common in the early 90s, but maybe not ubiquitous. I learned to drive in a '98 car without a CD player.

** The first step, Ron decided, was to grow his hair long. Like his eldest brother had. Mum /hated/ that.

He wasn't sure about the next step, until he discovered elastics and coils. After Fred and George paintbombed him with balls and wads of paint that exploded into paint, he bought some the next shopping trip. When - according to routine - they were playing Quidditch one time, he set his trap, and waited. It was only one day before they'd go to Hogwarts for the very first time and stay there for ages; they'd be careless but they had been merciless with him.

​

Soon enough, when they came back and went in their bedroom to change, Ron snuck up the attic and peered - ignoring the ghoul - down. Just when he was well and comfortable, the door opened and the twins came in. While chatting about their last game, they took their shirts off... and Ron pulled the lever. All at once, there were several '/twangs'/, as coils and elastic bits moved in tandem to launch dark green and silver paint. Ron watched with glee as several landed in their hair (exploding and splattering paint all over), faces and chest (where he saw just /how/ sticky it was), before he ran like hell.

To get away from that situation, he decided to go for the nearest muggle town. He knew where he could turn wizarding currency into muggle, and it alway seemed a lot more in that. As it turned out, it was enough for a very very old gramophone, and a leather jacket he LOVED, and that was all his money gone. No candy, but a lot of records that came with the gramophone, and his very own, utterly fantastic jacket. Records with names like Metallica, and ac/dc, and nirvana, and soundtrack of old zovies or whatever his dad called them this week. He hoped he'd sneak in unnoticed, but just in case, he hid the jacket.

He couldn't help the slight apprehension as he approached the Burrow. It looked dark and foreboding, not welcoming as always. But he was a really bad boy, he decided, so he'd walk in there and show them. He'd tell all of them he'd done it! That he had outpranked the Twins! That'd teach them they had a new Prankster King!

** Ron swung open the carriage door and waltzed inside, his ripped jeans and leather jacket swaying in the breeze like his long, ginger locks in a braid with a black scrunchie. He sat down on the opposite chair, not daring to ask permission from the boy sitting in front of him, for Ron was a *bad boy* and *bad boy*s don't ask permission from anyone. Especially not their mothers!!!

"Sup," he said in a manner that hammered home just how much he DID NOT GIVE A FUCK!!!!!!!! "I'm Roland Weasley, but you can call me the Radicator. I'm a *bad boy*, you know. A really *bad boy*. I don't give a fuck."

He lowered his sunglasses and flashed the boy with what a piercing stare that he had practised thousands of times in the mirror.

"You must be a first-timer. That's pretty cool. You'd be cooler with a leather jacket, though. I got this one out of a dump; couldn't afford a real one. My parents couldn't spare the money, what with all my siblings and all, but ya'know, that's the way it is. I try not to get bogged down with life, gotta be cool with it. Life hits me, I hit it back in the fucking jaw. That's what *bad boy*s /do/."

The stranger blinked, shifting in his seat, glancing around him as if waiting for something else to abruptly appear.

"Okay," he replied, still reeling from Ron's sudden arrival. "So, are you-"

"I've got a pet rat," Ron interjected quickly. "Technically not allowed at Hogwarts but not that I care. It was my brother's rat but he's part of the family, ya'know. I gotta protect him. He's old, lost a finger. Been through hard times, like me I suppose. There were nights where I almost went hungry, ya'know, but we pulled through."

The raven-haired child stared at the boy in front of him akin to how he would a magazine in a dentist's waiting room.

"Uh-huh?" he murmured.

"Yeah," Ron continued, lazily waving his hand the way his older brother used to when he brought girls home. He then proceeded to nod morosely. "I'm a survivor, ya'know. You don't get these for being a good boy."

He scrunched up the arm of his leather revealing an inky scrawl of "BAD BOY" on his forearm. There were small lighting marks radiating off from the letters that reminded Harry of a drunk man trying to draw the ACDC logo.

"I know what you're probably thinking," Ron smirked.

"That you look like a twat?"

It was almost humorous in the way Ron's chest visibly deflated and the calm, confident look was swept from his face.

"Um, what?" he replied dimly. The boy sighed.

"I mean, your jacket is at least three sizes too big for you," he noted, "your tattoo is smudging and you're wearing a scrunchy."

Ron awkwardly readjusted himself, sinking into his far-too-big leather jacket.

"I thought scrunchies were cool."

"They're really not," the boy smirked, trying to contain the laughter that was creeping up his throat. Ron sputtered, his brow creasing in confusion.

"But my brothers said-"

Then he froze and then he sighed, realising his fatal error. His face fell into his hands and he groaned like a lame animal.

"I'm guessing they put you up to this?" the boy asked. Ron nodded from behind his hands. "Please tell you didn't introduce yourself to anyone as 'the Radicator'."

"Shut up!" Ron moaned. The stranger burst into laughter, wrapping his arms around his sides as he dissolved into hysterics. Ron was glad that he had his face hidden, as it was soon blushing the colour of his hair.

"Hey," the stranger reassured after his giggles had finally died down, "I appreciate the effort at least." Ron peeked out from between his fingers as the boy reached out his hand. "I'm Harry. Harry Potter."

Ron's eyes widened, staring up at Harry's forehead, and his beetroot-coloured face drained to a pure white.

"Oh, no," he groaned as if he were physically ill. "Oh, NOOOO!"

"What's wrong?" Harry asked.

"Oh, bloody hell. I made a fool of myself in front of Harry Potter on the first day!" He jumped up, taking both of Harry's arms in a vice-like grip. "Please, no one else can know! My brothers will never let me live this down if they find out-"

"It's alright," Harry smiled, freeing the fabric of his sleeves from Ron's grip. "It wasn't that bad, anyway. See, look. My clothes are too big for me as well. Not that it's a stylistic choice, mind..." Harry shrugged. "Don't worry, you're secret's safe with me."

Just then, the pair heard the sound of the compartment doors sliding open.

"Excuse me, has anyone seen a toa-" The bushy-haired girl at the door froze in place, staring at Ron's hair. "Oh my god!" She gasped, pointing at Ron's hair. Her mouth was wide open, caught between a scream and a bellow of laughter. "Is that a scrunchy?!"

Harry immediately burst into laughter once again, to which Ron chose to escape by planting his face straight back into his palms. He may not be able to see the two clearly muggle-raised students pointing and laughing at his lack of common sense, but he could still hear it as clear as day. And something else was becoming blatantly clear to him, too.

Never ask Fred and George for advice /ever again/.
