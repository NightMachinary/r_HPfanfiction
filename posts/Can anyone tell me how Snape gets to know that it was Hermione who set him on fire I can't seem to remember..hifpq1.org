** I sure as he'll hope so. As far as Canon goes no. There is no acknowledgement from Snape that he knows. A variety of people could have told him though.

Personally I like to imagine he's sitting in his house drinking a tea and reading the prophet at the end of 5th year and he just looks up and goes... It wS Hermione Fucking Granger wasn't it. Fucking kids.

*** But he doesn't do it casually (in canon), and in canon he never learnt about it.
