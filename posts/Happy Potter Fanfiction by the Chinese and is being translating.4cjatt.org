** Also known as, "A Chinese Harry Potter Fanfiction is Being Translated!"

But more seriously, according to the linked thread, this is a pretty popular fic on Qidian. I'm actually fairly intrigued, though I'll wait for a few more chapters to come out.

** It's a time-travel self-insert fic, it looks like. Because of course it is. TIL even moving to China wouldn't be enough to escape these.

More seriously, I'll probably keep following this for the novelty of another perspective. So even though I don't really expect to enjoy it, I can still see that it has value.

**** I studied it all four years of high school, and I went to China for three weeks last summer (which gave me a /lot/ of practice), so I guess I'm conversationally semi-fluent. 你也會說中文嗎？

***** 会一点

That's one reason I like *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), so much. The author is a fan of 36 Stratagems and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and he used them quite a bit. [[/spoiler][For example, Harry's assassination of Draco Malfoy was a beautiful application of 美人计 and 反间计; Ginny Weasley was an expert in 借刀杀人.]]

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

****** Ohhh I see what you mean. TBH though, it seems like a very "political" fic, and I'm not entirely into those.
