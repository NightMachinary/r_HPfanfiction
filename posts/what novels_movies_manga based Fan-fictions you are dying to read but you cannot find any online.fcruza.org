** About 10 years ago, I was reading Anne Rice vampire novels and looked for fanfics. This was before I knew she was crazy about them. I eventually lost interest in her books and even more so when I discovered why there aren't any. Aside from that, there aren't works that I can't find fanfics for. But of course, the selection isn't the same as HP fanfics.

** Replay by Ken Grimwood and The First 15 Lives of Harry August by Claire North. They are both time loop fiction, and though they have cult followings, they are not terribly well known.

** Honestly, I always figured they would be more Isaac Asimov based fanfiction. Can't really identify a good reason why not, there just isn't any.
