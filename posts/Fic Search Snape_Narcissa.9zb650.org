I don't remember much and not all of this may be concrete but here goes:

Takes place between 5th and 7th year sometime

Snape is not good looking

Snape is abrasive and not emotionally kind. He retains much of his canon personality.

That's all I can really remember so whatever you can would be appreciated. Thanks.
