I am not looking just for the harem fics but a way to search for words when they are strung together like that would be nice.


** [[https://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]] just add +Harem on summary

or on tags

*** I'll try, would it work even out of the HP fandom?

*** Ok, am I doing anything wrong here? I tried +harem in the story, set the minimum word count to 10k and excluded Hermione and barely 128 fics came up. That seems like a really small number.

**** You are doing nothing wrong, probably. I don't know how the algorithm works but It doesn't find everything. It is not perfect but helps to filter stories.

***** Yeah it doesn't seem to do what I wanted in the end, stuff like HarryxHarem, OCxHarem, Harryharem and etc don't show up, it doesn't search for words that are strung together unless I manually input them and that isn't much better than the normal search.

** Use my app and add Harem in +Words. Note that it searches in 60k+ only though

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7w063m/promotion_ive_written_an_app_that_makes_finding/]]

Although you are probably doing something wrong, because scryer's word search should work as well.

*** Though, it seems like my app displays similar results. Probably much less harems than you thought in HP :) Although mine does find stuff like HarryxHarem. Still just one page of ~100 results above 60k

**** Honestly I wanted to search for a more site-wide search and this reddit is the only active fanfic forum I know of.

*** I don't know what I'm doing wrong honestly, you can only fuck up so much when it's about writing a word. I don't know if you people understand what I wanted though. I wanted something that found the word "harem" for example even if its like "asdwqrasxHAREMasdasf". If they already do that then I don't get what I could possibly be doing wrong.
