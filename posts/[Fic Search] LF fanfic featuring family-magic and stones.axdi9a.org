LF fanfic found on AO3, featured a Harry/Draco pairing in which Draco has stunted magic as a result of his family's (hearthstone? runestone?) magic stone being corrupted to power Lord Voldemort. Harry's occupation has something to do with repairing these stones and it ends with a distinctly happy ending? The author definitely noted it was a slight fusion, but I can't remember with what.


** I think I read this recently? Maybe something really familiar and there's a nest from Nagini under the floor in Malfoy Manor?
