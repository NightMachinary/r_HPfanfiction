1)No extensive descriptions. I find myself getting bored when there are whole paragraphs just describing what something looks like etc.

2)No Ron bashing. I would actually prefer it if Ron isn't even in the story at all, as long as there is no bashing.

3)No OOC Snape. I would prefer him the way he is in canon.

Could anyone help me?

*** This cracked me upðŸ˜‚ The subtle but very real seriousness and character depth shown by Harry & Luna was the best. Took the concept of a crazy Harry mask and wove is so nicely that it was obvious that it was a mask yet at most times easily forgettable. Loved this fic.

Very limited Weasley Smart/powerful for a 13 year old Going for a more realism. Actions have consequence, tens being teens. Also going through an overhaul of the current chapters that will be posted with the next one

  I am not what you think and life isn't always sweet to me. But I know, I will always carry that single magical moment with me, even when I'm broken. [A love story of a broken prodigy and a beaten down flower.]

**** My personal favorite is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). Harry's magical power combines his older and younger selves, so his spells are unusually strong. However, most of the story is actually about him rebuilding his relationships with everyone he lost in the future.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
