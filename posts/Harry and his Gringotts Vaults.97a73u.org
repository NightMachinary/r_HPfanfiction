I know that the idea of trust vaults vs family vaults comes from fannon, and I'm pretty sold on the idea that these two types of vaults should exist. I think that the money system of the HP universe is an important part of world building, so I'm curious to see what others think.

I'm wondering the following things:

a) How much money is it reasonable to say Harry has in his trust vault?

b) How much money is it reasonable to say is in the Potter family vault?

c) What other things might be included in the Potter family vault?

d) Is it reasonable to assume that the Potter family still owns property?

e) How much money do you think Harry inherited from Sirius?

f) Would the Black family have had lots of properties?

h) How much would Hogwarts tuition be?

i) What are ways to justify Harry not knowing about family vaults and properties? (I know of plenty of Dumbledore!bashing-type scenarios, are there less sinister situations that are plausible?)

j) What is the process like for getting your inheritance? Do you have to be a certain age? Are there special processes for folks like Harry, last of their lines?

k) Would the Dursleys have been receiving money for Harry's upkeep from either Dumbledore or Gringotts (presumably as designated by the Potters' last will and testaments)

l) How much spending money is the average Hogwarts student likely to have?

Assumptions I'm making:

- Ancient/Noble/old pureblood families like the Blacks and Potters likely have a ton of money and at least several properties.

- Heirs of such families are generally aware of their inheritances.

Some thoughts

- Maybe there's nothing left of the Potter family vaults/properties because they sold them for funding for the Order. (I don't think I really buy this explanation though, as the Order doesn't seem to use any money. Everyone seems to be a volunteer and even if they needed to buy a location for the original headquarters, that doesn't seem like a 'use all a wealthy family's wealth'-expense).

- Maybe various properties/monies were given away/spent as part of various marriages over the years.

What do others think about the topic? Any theories you abide by?


** So, from a purely fanon perspective, there are a few things to consider. Obviously, JKR sucks at numbers and loves to pander to fans and retcon things she's forgotten about, etc.

A) Enough to where it's not something that Harry needs to worry about. Or rather, enough to where the reader doesn't need to keep a running tally. Putting an actual number is a fool's errand, and it'll never be right.

B) I personally don't see the need for a second vault. If his first vault already has as much as he needs, does he need two vaults with as much as he needs?

C) This is an interesting discussion. On one hand, we see the Malfoys keeping all of their dark heirlooms hidden in their own manorr. On the other, we see the Lestranges hoarding a bunch of treasure in Gringotts. Part of me is curious as to what if there's another Goblin war. I feel like there's probably a line that separates something from being a vault and being a self-serve storage facility.

D) Probably. James's Parents had to have lived somewhere before they died. Sirius even lived with them for a bit. So there is likely that property, as well as the one in Godric's Hallow.

E) My headcanon is that most of the money was squandered, and a large portion of the remaining was spent on Harry's Firebolt. Or is that canon?

F) Probably. I don't think Bellatrix/Narcissa/Andromeda grew up at grimmauld place, so that's another location. And then there's got to be others for Arcturus and all the other grandparents. There's a lot of them. As for businesses and such, we can only speculate.

H) In canon, it's free. But that does open up a whole load of other questions, doesn't it? How do the teachers and other staff get paid? If the Ministry pays for it, where does their money come from? Solely from taxes? Taxes from whom? Surely not muggleborn families, and I don't picture someone like the Malfoys paying taxes. How do they generate any significant amount of money to pay all the workers the Ministry has considering how cheap everything is? And, if the Ministry is paying for all the students to go to Hogwarts, how can anyone complain about them "interfering at Hogwarts" when they're footing the bill for every last one of them? Personally, I prefer there to be a tuition cost. It's an easier, simpler explanation that doesn't take much to work.

I) Harry doesn't receive any mail at all, until his Hogwarts letter. Not a single piece of fan mail, gift, or advertisement. Kind of strange.

J) Probably just have to file claim and prove your identity, if there's something extant for some reason. If there's only one vault Harry already likely has everything already, even if he's not aware of it.

K) I doubt it. Maybe if there was some actual paperwork filled out, but I feel like that scene wasn't written with indepth analysis in mind.

I) Probably not much. Newspaper isn't that much, and it seem like there's no wizarding equivalents of vending machines in the castle. So that leaves sporadic owl orders, christmas shopping, and Hogsmede trips. Like, we see Ron make it through the year, and he barely has any money at all.

Your assumptions: What does being an old/noble/whatever house really mean? I don't think it really means anything. After all, it can take twenty generations to build up wealth, but it can be spent in one. If you just have these guys doing nothing but sitting in manors all day while funding war efforts, with no money coming in, the money won't last. And, if they do have money coming in, from where? How are people like the Malfoy's millionaires when there's just not that much money to go around. What is the value of money to a wizard anyways? There's a lot of questions that don't really have good answers.

** A few very important things:

- There are no such things as inherently wealthy Ancient and Noble Families. The Blacks are basically the only ones who claimed to be "noble", though the modern Malfoy may think along the same lines. The rest aren't particularly wealthy, just... wealthy, and there are as many rich half-bloods and Muggle-borns as rich pure-bloods, it's just that the pure-bloods use it for bribing more often.

- There is no "main" Potter vault separate from the "trust vault". Harry's vault /is/ the Potter vault. And it contains insane amounts of money. In Muggle terms, I would say that Harry would probably be a millionaire... but not a multimillionaire. From then, the figure in Galleons depends on what exchange rate you're using; the canon one is about five pounds to a Galleon, but some headcanons place it as high as fifty pounds to a Galleon. You make the conversions.

- There /is/ no Hogwarts tuition. You have to buy your robes and books and /that's it/. Rowling has explicitly said that the Ministry pays for Hogwarts. How else do you suppose destitute Tom Riddle & Co. would have managed it?

- An easy answer for i) is that Dumbledore expected Petunia to have known through Lily and to tell Harry as a matter of common decency. Dumbledore knew the Dursleys were /unpleasant/, but refused to believe that they would be quite as abusive as they turned out to be, and was as flabbergasted as Hagrid when he learned they hadn't even told him magic was real --- though it would not have surprised him for them to keep his Boy-Who-Lived status quiet, and he thought /that/ was rather a good thing.

- Harry being placed with the Dursleys was a decision Dumbledore was forced to make, which suggests, to me that, that if there /was/ a last will and testament that named a guardian for Harry, it named Sirius as first possibility, and Peter if unavailable. One being convicted and the other dead (as far as anyone knows). So no, I don't think the Dursleys received any money. Possibly Dumbledore wrote to them that he would help them financially if needed, but, naturally, the bigots refused to get any wizard money, even if it was only to embezzle it.

Concerning l), I would say, not much for the first few years. I expect many don't /have/ spending money. /Where/ would they spend it, except for the Hogwarts Express? Of course, this changes past Third-Year with the Hogsmeade Weekends, and there I suspect they'd get the same varied lot as regular Muggle kids do.

Concerning f): I'm going to say... not really. They might at one time, but they probably sold them all, or nearly so, over the years to get more money to bribe their way out of court cases and, later, support Voldemort financially.

Why? Is there a "please deposit all your money upon entering" booth by the Leaky Cauldron? Muggle-borns are as likely to be born to a wealthy family as wizards, you know. I'd be surprised if the Grangers were anything short of upper-middle-class, being both dentists, for example. Hermione is no Draco but I imagine she may very well be as rich as, say, Pansy.

Far from all wizards are rich, far from all Muggles are poor.

***** No property, no heirlooms, no knowledge of how the world works. The 11 years where they are unaware of magic will hurt them later in life, it is folly to suggest that this does not make a difference in future successes. Can you imagine not going to kindergarten until age 11? How much a disadvantage you would be at? This has financial implications.

We also have another thing to consider: the implication that muggleborns may not have equal employment opportunities, further widening the gap financially. Arthur Weasley, a man completely unqualified for his position is a Department Head. It certainly isn't because of his ability, but more than likely his blood.

Just as there is racial inequality when it comes to wealth, blood purity would have the same issues.

He's quite qualified for his position, thank you very much. He isn't there to understand how Muggle objects work, he's there to make sure Dark Wizards don't curse them for giggles, and he's proven to be quite knowledgeable about the ins and outs of enchanting Muggle objects (/cough/ Ford Anglia /cough/). And besides, the people who would discriminate against Muggle-borns would be equally reticent to see a blatantly Muggle-friendly "blood traitor" like Weasley take the job.

Okay, so all that's about Muggle-borns. I'm not entirely convinced, but it /is/ a fair argument. However, what would disadvantage half-bloods, of any type, in relation to pure-bloods? Before you bring up the employment issue again, while there may be /some/ occasional discrimination in the Ministry, a Ministry career is far from one's only option (it's only about a third of the population by most estimates), and besides, it can't be any more blatant than racist discrimination in /Muggle/ British government. Blood-purism may have many closet adherents before the Second War but it's still very much "politically incorrect" in the Wizarding World.

Note, as [[/u/Taure]] has pointed out somewhere, how Lucius takes care not to say anything against Muggle-borns in front of Minister Fudge, not because Fudge would really disagree (he's a bit of a blood-purist himself, we later learn), but because it's not proper to say so in public and would kill Lucius's public image as a philanthropist.

******* I don't think starting magical education until 11 is a huge disadvantage. I think getting a thorough Muggle education for 11 years is a huge advantage. It's not like magical children are being taught spells at home or else we'd see Ron be able to do something as simple as float a feather on his very first try. All they know is that it's real and they see their parents do it every day.

Now, what we don't know is how magical children acquire written language, math and reasoning skills. Are they homeschooled? Do they go to the village school? Private tutors? Magical family educational co-op? So you have a Muggleborn who's gone to school, learned to read, write an essay, do math and think critically put into a school where there can quite reasonably be several children who've never heard of an essay and might not even be able to spell "cat". I'd say Advantage Muggleborn right there. In addition to learning things, being in a school prepares you /to/ learn and to learn effectively and I don't feel like non-muggleborns are really prepared for that very well.

The books have shown us that children raised in the magical environment do not have any sort of leg up on magic than their non-magically raised counterparts.

******* Another important thing to remember that due to the small size of the Wizarding World, who you know is almost as important as what you know. Nepotism abounds in this environment, political and social connections are something a muggleborn would not have.

Arthur Weasley may be qualified for a pureblood but compared to a muggleborn? Someone who has lived as a muggle, who knows what a toaster, refrigerator, and lawn mower both do and how to use them would be far more qualified. Blood has at least some impact upon his obtaining this position.

It depends on a case by case basis for halfbloods. Those like Harry who are muggle raised would be at a large disadvantage. In the end how you are raised (wizard/muggle) will have the biggest impact on your future success and financial opportunities.

AW is head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts division, not the Use of Muggle devices. He doesn't need to know what a lawn mower's primary use. He does know, however, that a lawn mower that can fire is clearly something to be confiscated and removed from the public. And like, [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]] said, he's very good at enchanting, as we see from the car that can fly. I'd say he's nearly as skilled as Sirius is at enchanting, with the added advantage that AW didn't spend a decade in Azkaban which he no doubt used to further his skills.

****** The muggleborn are still going to school and getting an education. Most of the stuff you learn in early grades isn't important in terms of the specific content, what's important is the structure and the use of a school as an agent of socialization, forcing you to interact with peers and learn social norms. Muggleborns may struggle to write with quills and lack the background in terms of parables about magic, but they still would know how to read, write, and generally interact with peers.

It all depends on the exchange rate from Pound to Galleon. If we stick by the 5 to 1 in canon, then some Muggleborns could be a lot richer than Purebloods:

- In GOF, 1000 Galleons were considered big money in Wizarding world. The Twins were able to own a shop in Magical Britain's prime shopping district. But in 1990s Muggle London, 5000 Pounds might get you 3 months rent in an upscale location. Nowadays, it's probably worth one month rent.
- Hermione Granger's house was [[https://mashable.com/2016/09/26/hermione-granger-house-for-sale-harry-potter/#I68W71hjGmqn][sold for 2.4 million Pound in 2016]], or 480000 Galleons. Her parents were only dentists and upper middle class.
- Muggleborns from truly rich Muggle families (corporate executives, hereditary nobilities, successful entrepreneurs) could easily out snob rich Purebloods, if they were allowed free Pound to Galleon exchanges.

Therefore, if I were to design my own world, I would have Goblins charge an exorbitant bid and ask spread when it came to Pound/Galleon exchange rates:

- For anyone exchanging Galleons into Pounds, the rate would be indeed 5.
- For anyone exchanging Pounds into Galleons, the rate would be 5 up to a certain (small) amount, the rate for anything above that amount would be the prevailing Pound price for 1 Oz of Gold. In the 1990s, that would be 200. Today, it's about 1000.

**** I think it should be noted that most of the Muggleborns (for whom its discussed) seem to come from well-off families. Hermione's parents' are dentists, which means anything from a middle class income to pretty rich, and her own intelligence makes it likely that her environment growing up (nurture) encouraged studying and other traits that are simply easier for rich students. Justin mentions being on the books for Eton at one point, which means he would have been going to a posh, expensive, public boarding school. Muggles are even more likely to have generational wealth- we see businesses and real estate in the wizarding world (that are presumably funded by patrons), but it's not really clear that Gringotts has "investments" per se, so common muggle intergenerational investment vehicles (stocks) don't exist.

The one concession for wizards is that they're still in a post-scarcity society. Theoretically, no wizard should ever be desperately in need of food+shelter due to what they can create through magic, yet somehow seedy places and wizards still exist, and the Weasley's monetary circumstances are mentioned a couple times.

There is NO canon confirmation of the Potter family vault. However, this is still a reasonable assumption IMO. If it were up to me, I would have make it ten times the size of Harry's trust vault.

Yes, but their buildings should be destroyed during the War. If Harry came out as the victor of the War, it would be reasonable to assume that he would make Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers to pay full compensation for his losses and punitive damages. Other families, who had suffered greatly through the War such as the Boneses, Longbottoms, and Weasleys, should ALL be entitled to similar claims. Death Eater children, who had willingly tortured fellow students at Hogwarts, had to pay BOTH monetary compensations to their victims and serve criminal punishments.

  e) How much money do you think Harry inherited from Sirius?
#+end_quote

You could assume that the Blacks had a lot more than the Potters. By my previous assumption of Potters having about 900k Galleons, giving the Blacks anywhere from 2M to 4M sounds fine to me.

On the other hand, the Blacks might have squandered their fortune and ended with up with only a few hundred Galleons in their vault, like in "A Black Comedy".

That's... not really a lot, per the canon exchange rate. And I'm willing to admit info from the movies, very willing even, but on such stuff they didn't /plan it/ --- the writers didn't decide Harry had G84,000, it's the decoration department that built the Vault set a certain good-looking size, then said "fill this up with piles of as many fake gold coins as you need". So I'd say that while whoever did that analysis gets points for trying, it's kind of a fool's errand, and as we see comes down with silly numbers to prove it.

This is dangerous, both France and England made unreasonable demands of Germany after WWI, forming the conditions for Hitler's rise to power and WWII.

Yes they did. Lucius did it only once it profited him and probably never had a /moral/ redemption, but IIRC he did end up helping the Ministry, fighting the last few renegade Death Eaters post-war. As for Draco, it's clear from /Cursed Child/ and interviews that Rowling clearly thinks he outgrew the savage blood-purism of the Death Eaters for which he had never really been cut out, and, as a grown-up, was a pretty decent bloke.

The Malfoys, for right or ill, also had Harry's support due to Narcissa's part in saving him and his general forgiving nature. The same could not be said of other Death Eaters, whether high- or low-ranking.

Cursed Child is toilet paper, what he may become is irrelevant. Draco is essentially a Nazi and whether or not he is redeemable does not excuse his actions nor should it allow him to escape justice for his crimes.

If Harry refuses to execute Peter Pettigrew for betraying his parents or Lucius Malfoy for crimes against his then future wife; he is not the kind of man to demand compensation or pursue the crimes of others. He is the kind of man who wants to rebuild society and put the past behind him.

I profoundly disagree. There was no mentioning in canon at all about this matter.

Later, he would absolutely see the importance in crippling Death Eater faction economically, when people next to him pointed out how much evil those Nazis could cause with their gold.

I think Harry and Hermione could actually be a moderating force on the bloodlust of their friends and families. But Harry was already crucioing Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall (who was fine with this BTW), so I doubt his mercy would extend very far. Hermione, being brutally tortured by Bellatrix, should also be out for blood if her action against Rita Skeeter was any guide. Ginny would thoroughly beat up Zach Smith for simply annoying her, so what do you think she would do to those who tortured her and murdered her friends?

*********** The big winners of the first Wizarding War did nothing to the remaining Death Eaters. They returned to Wizarding Society without even a slap on the wrist. If this truly was to happen in Wizarding Britain /then why didn't it happen after the first War?/

This leads us to one of two conclusions:

1. They wanted to punish them but did not have the power/authority to do so.
2. They were content to allow them to return to society after Voldemort's demise to a child

If #1 is true, which is in my opinion the more likely scenario, then nothing would change as I have said before they have no power to do so.

The DA does not rule Britain, nor does it have the power to sentence criminals, that as I have said before lies with the governing body of Wizarding Britain. /They have no power to do these things even if they want to./ Public opinion means little to those in power.

And yet Harry never once kills anyone, even though he would be justified in doing so. Hermione and Harry combine for a total of zero deaths. Zero. /If they are not willing to kill in a time of war why would you think they would in a time of peace?/

Furthermore, you seem to buy the theory that Voldemort remnants still managed to hang onto power miraculously, after the Dark Lord himself, the Death Eater army, and Ministry's own security force all got destroyed at Hogwarts. You still seem to think that a government fallen twice within ten months should have authority.

************ There are two possible explanations for that, though.

A. The remaining Death Eaters were actually exonerated for their crimes. Lucius was lying about it, but he successfully managed to claim that he was under the Imperius curse. This is a magical world in which mind control is possible and people don't have a way to defend against it, so it's not just Nuremberg "I was just following orders," it's people claiming that they literally didn't have a choice because of magic. You can't blame someone for something they did that was completely out of their control.

B. It again comes down to a matter of scale. The first war lasted throughout the 70s until 1981, with roots as far back as the 40s. That's a long war, affecting a small population, but still causing a great deal of fear and presumably a lot of damage. From Harry's perspective, we don't get the full story, but it's perfectly possible that the remaining families were fined and that the money allowed for the reconstruction of Magical Britain after the war.

On the topic of the DA, Cursed Child basically shows us Harry and Hermione in major positions of power in the aftermath of the second war. It's never explicitly stated, but is implied that they were able to seize power after the fact and essentially put Order members and DA members into key positions of influence in the aftermath.

** There are many holes in JK worldbuilding, things she should have thought but did not, but does not extract from the story and I think fandom does answer some questions quite naturally and logically, so it does not bother me much.

This being said, the wizarding world is /small/, so their economy is also small, especially if compared to non magical. Old, pure blood families could be actually /quite rich/ if you consider:

1)valuable metals as gold and silver are used by both magical and non magicals;

2)old families tend to be conservative in her dealings and nobles are expected NOT to squander what they have inherited, but if possible, to add to their families fortunes;

3) old and large families usually have Estates large enough to house Cottages and other dwellings for ther excess of heirs and land, usually, is an expensive commodity.

4) magical artifacts and family heirlrooms must have quite a value, right?

So, I assume families like Malfoys and Blacks were indeed /multimillionaires/ and had always been; the problem is, non magical economy has expanded and diversified to such a degree in the last cenetury that made this kind of wealth obsolete. Therefore, there is simple no way you can compare a Malfoy with a Jeff Bezos in terms of wealth alone and I guess it is not even this point.

Grimmauld Place is clearly the Blacks /urban/ residence; they are indeed Ancient and most Noble, so they should have land. Period. We know that the Malfoys are noble because they build a Manor in land given to them by King William, meaning they were landowners during a time where only nobles have this privelege.

The Potters, were are told, wree rich, and became even richer when they invented Sleakeasy; it is stated that Harry indeed has a vaut filled with gold and the family has lived in Godrick´s Hollow for centuries. I assume they are not nobles in the sense the Malfoys and Blacks are, but are rather respected members of the wizarding society. James father was a talented businessman, but he sold the sleakeasy and retired; then I assume there was indeed lots of gold in their vaults, but I also suspect that James, not being the "C.E.O" type of guy and because they were living at war, he might have willingly used some of his gold to help the cause.

Frankly, I cannot see Dumbledore being practical enough to offer the Dursleys some gold to help support Harry. I believe it is part of their ressentment and a reason why Harry was forced to be their servant and use hand me downs. The truth is- and I am not bashing- Dumbledore wanted Harry to survive and be protected by the blood wards. He was wearing many hats and I do not thik for a second he would have the common sense to have worked an extra official agreement with the Durleys. He could have, for instance, Hagrid dopping by a couple of timer per year to deliver the Dursleys some mone and see Harry´s living conditions, which again is fucking common sense in such cases, but he opted to have the cat lady just making sure that Harry was alive.

So, all in all, I do not think that Dumbledore is on purpose keeping the Potter´s wealth from Harry, or, as some fanfic suggest, stealing from Harry; I think Dumbledore considered his job "done" by providing Harry with a secure home and leaving the Potter´s vaults flled with gold.

Another reason for that is James and Lily´s will: rich families make wills. /Period/. Add that the war climate and the fact that Harry had no magical obvious next of kin and the will is not only a possibility, but a given. It could very well be that Dumbledore had Harry dropped at the Durleys and ignored the Potter´s will for securiyt reasons, and that he simply dd not offer gold from the Potter´s vaults not to draw attention to the fact that he was disrespecting the will. With Sirius and the Longbottons unable to care for Harry, Dumbledore indeed had many reasons to consider Petunia the best option, but she was defonetely not the only option.

So, yes, everything point out to the fact that Dumbledore simply did not think much about the repercutions of having Harry with Petunia ( Harry growing up not knowing about wizards; Durleys being forced not only to be guardians to Harry but also to support hem; not to mention, Petunia and Vernon being absolutely scared about anything magical and having been told they had no other choise than to be saddled with Harry) and assumed too much ( that Petunia would come to care for Harry solely based on their close relation and that the Dursleys would guide Harry into the more practical side of things, like how to deal with money, for example).

In conclusion, Potters are wealthy, but possibly not noble as Malfoys; Dumbledore merely did not care about such details as a loving and caring environment and the costs of raising a child when he decided to have Harry at the Durleys, and , finally, the vaults were still filled with gold by the time Harry could have the gold, but the boy had already been raised as a pauper, so it made not much difference.

  How much money is it reasonable to say Harry has in his trust vault?
#+end_quote

Money is power. You need to pick how you want power arranged in your fic. You need to decide how you want each type of power to impact the main conflict. You can write a story in which Harry's main focus is attacking the logistics and supply side of Voldemort's operations. In that case, money would be a big part of the story, and while you'd need to give Harry a lot, you'd have to make sure it isn't enough to trivialize the conflict.

Unless you're going for a cash-based roflstomp.

  How much would Hogwarts tuition be?
#+end_quote

According to Rowling interviews, it's free. In canon, it's just not mentioned, so you can set it to whatever makes sense. Hogwarts is implied to be the best school in the UK, not the only one, but there are still slacker students, and all seven Weasley kids got in. That's a bit weird if there are skill-based requirements. But if it's just money, then you could say that Arthur Weasley has a good salary as a Ministry department head, and he and Molly chose to spend it all on their kids' education.

#+begin_quote
  What other things might be included in the Potter family vault?

Presumably adulthood is a prerequisite. That would be a sensible way to arrange it. Or slowly increasing access over time, starting at adulthood. Or starting at an age later than adulthood.

Cue a story arc on how Harry uses shenanigans to gain early access. It would take skill to make that work in a story.

** The Potter universe makes from a financiel and economic standpoint no sense at all. Same goes for the size of the population.

My personal opinion is to make the whole inheritance story work we first have to assume that Wizarding Brittian has a devide between the upper and lower class. Like the one the real UK had up until the WWI. This means some families are actually incredibly rich while others are just barely getting by. Malfoy vs Weasley. Base your story on the economic situation of the 1800s UK otherwise it makes no sense at all and it fits nicely in the narrative of classism thatis in HP.

Note that the canon exchange rate is 5 pounds to a Gallon. That is ridiculous that would put a wand (the most important magical object) at the price of a dvd box. It also begs the question why Ron was stuck with an old wand? No the price of a Wand should be more like a months salary to make sense.

a. The awnser is NOT THAT MUCH. A classic rich family keeps the money in the Estate while a small stipened is given out to family members. If harries vault is a "trust vault" it just covers tutition school supplies and spending money for all seven years plus some extra.

Important note! Some fics have the vault automaticallly refill from the Potter vault each year. This makes no sense if its a trust vault a trust if for LIMITED spending refilling endlessly does not serve that purpsoe. This only would work if the vault contains money for 1 years expenses each year.

b. a lot more but not that much more but no crazy amount all. (see D)

c. Some objects like the vault they visit in book 7.

d. Yes assuming its a class based society like the UK was the should have rather large immovable properties that provide a stable passive income. NOT owning half of Diagon alley and the Blacks owning the whole of knokturn alley. That creates a ridiculour powerdynamic that ruins every fic. No but magical products need to come from somewhere magical plants and animals need to live somewhere out of muggle eyes..... It would only be logical if that would be on wizard owned lands.

e. The blacks seem like a family in decline. So it can go eitherway

f. Same like last question

h. Canon says the ministery pays. It seems far more logical to have that be a private school. Paid for by a rather large tuition. Otherwise why would it be that prestigous?

i. Harry is an uninterested little shit. Thats canon! Why people didn't tell him? You don't talk about money the older your money the less you talk about it.

j. No. You get your inheretence immediatly when your parents die. But mostly underage children dont get the right to spend unlimited money. There is a trustee and executionor of the will to take care of that. Why they dont contact harry at 11? Because a child has no bussiness with the estate until he turns of age. Harry has in this scenario a trustvault. Trusts exist to keep people away from the family estate.

k. Most likely a small stipened and ofcourse child support from the goverment.

L. Some but not much. The first two years have no chance to spend any. Third year and up enough to go to hogsmeade.

I would expect more school and a higher population to make any of the HP universe work in any realistic sense. The small Hogwarts student body and the fact that there is only 1 wizarding school makes it easy to write but it makes no sense.
