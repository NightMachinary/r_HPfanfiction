It could be a romance, adventure, action, comedy, anything!

Just finished a reread of the series and I feel SO empty now that I've finished it. Let me know what your favorite post-Hogwarts fanfics are!

Ideally, anything that follows canon would be preferred but if it's well written then I'm open to other stories


** Cauterize is a really good postwar oneshot. Slide's Stygian Trilogy is more next-gen than postwar but it's amazing.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** Linkffn(Annals of Arithmancy) is the only post-war fic that I like because it's a continuation of a Hogwarts years story and the characterisations aren't completely butchered or 180 by the author for wobbly plot reasons because by now the characters are the authors in that he knows them better than anyone else because he shaped them since first-year.

** Here are two of my favorites, both post-Hogwarts.

The first one is called Wait and Hope. It's Draco/Hermione, which I know some people have issues with, but Draco is very much reformed in this fic and is estranged from his family. Hermione has lost several years of memories and wakes up from a brief coma unaware that she's been married to Draco for years. Her most recent memories are from before she even got to know Draco post-Hogwarts so she is shocked and horrified to wake up married to him. Draco is madly in love with her (they had a great marriage) and is terrified that she will give up on the marriage before getting to know him again. There are some hilarious interactions between Hermione and her Slytherin friends that she had gotten to know through Draco during their marriage. The whole fic is full of funny moments even with the dramatic subject matter and it's really well-written.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22818646/chapters/54531817]]

The second one is called Away Childish Things, Harry/Draco, also featuring a reformed Draco, and a lot harder to explain. A potions accident de-ages Harry back into his 10 year old mind and body and Draco has to take care of him until he can create a potion to put Harry back to normal. Any additional info would be too spoilery but it's also a fantastic story.

Edit: Since you posted this on both fanfiction subs I decided to comment on both of them, but let me know if this bugs you and if so I will delete one of them.
