i dont know why, but i really dislike harry in slytherin. canon harry isn't shown to be sly or cunning, he isnt ambitious or resourceful either. he is a leader, i admit that. most fanfics with harry in slytherin that ive read change his character drastically, or changes snape's character, or draco's character. anyways, Change My Mind About Harry Being In Slytherin Challenge!

(drarry is fine as long as its a very slow burn, because i honestly cant see it happening otherwise)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] linkffn(4745329) and the Serpensortia trilogy, starting with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4913998][Quiet Like a Fight]] linkao3(4913998), are the only Slytherin!Harry fics I've really liked. (On the Way to Greatness is sadly abandoned.)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220][This series]] is fantastic. I don't like Harry in Slytherin fics and I don't like reading fics with Snape as a good guy in them (bc I find it hard to excuse his actions in the books). But this series makes everything very believable due to Harry's childhood circumstances so I found it extremely enjoyable and has also made me more open to reading these kinds of fics. It's quite long, but I suggest giving it a try and see how you like it.

Here's the first fic in the series (I hope the bot works): linkao3(11047995)

** I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On The Way To Greatness]] because I feel it is the most realistic Slytherin!Harry fic and it stays true to Harry's character. Harry increasingly becomes more cunning but the change in his character is written in a way that makes sense. Snape and Malfoy are also like their canon selves.

** I recently reread the first couple of books, and Harry seems plenty cunning and resourceful to me.

He frees Dobby by thinking on the spot about the whole sock & diary thing, he manages to convince Vernon Dursley that signing his Hogsmeade permission slip is in his best interest, basically by blackmailing him and saying he won't support the Dursleys' story that he's at St. Brutus School for Criminal in front of Marge... otherwise. (He messed it up later on, but still...), he uses Sirius Black to put pressure on the Dursleys so that they allow him to go to the World Cup... I'm sure there are lots of other examples too.\\
As for my favourite Harry in Slytherin fanfic, it's already been mentioned - On the Way to Greatness. The later books are really great.
