I want a story, a good one, where Harry finds himself alive in the Marauders Era. I don't particular mind slash or anything so long he doesn't pair up with James or Lily. But if the story doesn't have any pairing, that would be most preferable.

I'd prefer if Harry was student as opposed to being a professor, and I don't mind if he died and was reborn as someone else in that era so long the key personality stays intact.

No God!Like, Harem, or any other type of overpowered things. Just no, not my type of story at all. I would actually prefer if Harry doesn't go evil or pro good, strictly on the neutral grey(?) side.

Aside from these, I don't think I have any more requests I'd like in the story. Thanks :)


** Linkao3(35902410) is a great story in which Harry goes back in time after being kissed by a dementor in OOTP and ends up working with Aberforth. He's not exactly gray, but he does not work with Albus/Order of the Pheonix.
