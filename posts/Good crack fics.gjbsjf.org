Already read Seventh Horcrux, Black Comedy, and a few others.


** There's The Wendell that Wasn't. It's a short story and it's hilarious. linkffn(4396574)

I also remember this story as quite funny, though I read it more than 5 years ago (and my teenage humor wasn't what I'd call refined). There are 2 follow-up stories. linkffn(2533891)

If you happen to speak French I have some funny ones too! (More than in English actually)

I hope I linked everything correctly!

** It's dead, unfortunately, but worth a read: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][/Switch/ by corvidae9]]. It's on the lower end of the crack scale, with most of the characters behaving as you might expect them to given the circumstances. The circumstances being the Weasley twins playing a prank on Hogwarts by drugging the Sorting Hat. Everyone gets sorted randomly.

Another fun was is the "Nude Quidditch Game" which is the definition of a crack-fic.

One that I've read several times, and is still being actively updated is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12355543/1/][/One Punch Wizard/ by MrWriterWriter]], which is actually a crossover between /One Punch Man/ and /Harry Potter/. Maybe I just have a terrible sense of humor but I found it quite funny.

  When the Dursleys die in a car crash, Dumbledore is left with a quandary as to where to place the Boy-Who-Lived. That is, until he remembers another relative of Lily's: a cousin in Japan. Rated M just be safe.

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate')Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people.(cracky humor with a hint of seriousness and plot, my specialty)

  Oneshot from Ron's POV. Ron tries to explain to the twins just how Harry made the Ministry of Magic make a new classification for magical creatures, and why the puffskeins were now considered the scariest magical creature of all time. No pairings.
