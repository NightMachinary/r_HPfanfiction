Preferably with romance, ones like

Linkffn(The Anti-Heroine)

And things along those lines.


** This one doesn't have any romance, but linkao3(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) was a great read.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** Ooh, here's a whole bunch.

First, Colubrina has several fics that fit, but these two stand out, I think.

Linkffn(10654712) -- Lady of the Lake: follows Hermione and Draco as they complete a political takeover of Wizarding Britain.

Linkffn(11027125) -- The Green Girl: sorts Hermione into Slytherin first year, follows her all through Hogwarts.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section

Linkffn(10187107) -- The Dark Lady Rises is the first of a trilogy of stories by cleotheo that focus on Hermione's rise to power as Voldemort's daughter.

Linkffn(6708027) -- Master of Puppets is the first of three very short stories of a very dark and power hungry Hermione had ascends to the control of Magical Britain. You can find the others on the author's profile, the longest is like 4k words long.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** linkao3(And She Shall Reign... by BeastOfTheSea) is a decent one-shot. Has some issues, but also this amazing line: It was so blindingly obvious, in retrospect, that it stunned her that she had not seen it immediately after the final demise of Voldemort. What had Dumbledore left them? Ronald had been given an indulgence to save him from his own misguided behavior, Harry had been given a relic to encourage his martyrdom, and she - she had been given Dumbledore's own youthful inspiration. Clearly, he had meant her to succeed where he had failed.

linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) is abandoned, unfortunately, but it's a start.

  When she was young and naive, she thought that nothing could justify slavery and the end of liberation justified any means.

  Like all children, however, she grew up, and put aside childish naivete; she came to realize that slavery was not such a bad thing - that slaves did not desire freedom, but a kind master.

** these ones are all short fics as the best dark hermione fic imo (ACA) has already been recced. they're all TMR/HG tho if that's not your thing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7296376/chapters/16571095][temporal parapatetics]] (all time favourite)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6620155][pocket change]]

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2325644][salt & brine]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11221036/1/][when she drowned]] (bit bashy but ok)

also [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/][six pomegranate seeds]]. i'm not totally sure where it's going as i'm only half way through it so far but it's an interesting concept and well written so it might be worth a read.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle
