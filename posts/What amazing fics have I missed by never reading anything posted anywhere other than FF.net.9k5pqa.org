And past first year the consequences of her presence are taken more seriously. The characterizations of all the characters in the main cast (including people like Neville) are very strong, very emotional. It's a good mix of fun and drama.

You explained the setting and the main character, but what I'm curious about is "what is it about"? Like, is it a canon-rehash/fix-it or are there new villains & plotlines, if yes, what are those (mild spoilers are fine)?!

I'm asking because I've read quite enough stories where a new character explains to Harry how he should fight a troll or how to bring a rooster into the Chamber of Secrets, it's kinda tiring.

** Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473]])

*The Dogfather*

It's a beautiful thing where Harry gets lost to the muggle adoption system, gets adopted by two lovely parents and then his godfather shows up along with Remus and we have a perfect, if a little odd, family. Updated earlier this year, I do believe it's still on going. No telling where the plot will go yet, there's only 3 chapters (all though each are about 10k words)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]])

*The meaning of mistletoe*

The first instalment in a four part series called The Secret Language of Plants in which Snape sees the sorry state of the Dursleys treatment of Harry and promptly snatches him up in the spur of a moment. But it evolves into so much more than that.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12576408/chapters/28645596]])

*A Storm Across Time*

I feel like it should have ended already and that it's being dragged out. I don't love everything about this but I came across it because Regulus is in it and I love people's takes on him.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9112156]])

*Aposematism*

Not /technically/ Harry Potter but this is my favourite depiction of Newt. Part of an ongoing series called "Signalling Theory: Blue Coat". Newt wears blue as a warning, much like animals do with their colouring.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

*Face Death in the Hope*

Harry is back in time and saves Regulus! And it all kinda spirals from there. Still in progress and updated recently. The marauders are present.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5910550]])

*I know I will be dead long before you read this*

Technically not a fic but what LullabyKnell drew before thinking up face death in the hope. It kickstarted my sad feelings for Regulus and my love for his inclusion in fics.

At least I think they're all unique to AO3 anyways. When I looked for the Dogfather on ffn there were quite a few but they didn't look like it. Correct me if I'm wrong.

There's more but I don't bookmark completed fics that often and a lot of the good ones are complete.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  'It's not just Death Eaters that kill Muds. After the Second World War, the Muggle civil rights movements got started. Black rights, and feminism, and gay rights. We -- wizards -- we never had the sixties, because we just kept replaying the war, over and over again: Grindelwald in the forties, then Voldemort in the seventies, then Voldemort again in the nineties. I just hope this time it's really finished, and we can sort out our own fucking house.'Hermione is back at school after a summer in the Muggle world, and everything is changing. But getting closer to Harry doesn't get her any closer to the war - until she's unexpectedly enrolled in the Order of the Phoenix, and meets Hestia Jones, the founder of Mud Pride.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Surprisingly great H/G romance in a non-magical AU, written by the same author of “The Changeling”.

Esama has written two nice series on AO3:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818][Wizard in SPACE]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire]]

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forever Knight]], is a very smutty, but still good H/Hr fic.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]] is an Epilogue compliant H/Hr story without Ron/Ginny bashing or any cheating.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]] is the finished sequel of “Shadow Walks”, very good dimensional travel.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128465][Ginny Duty]] is a Harry raises by Sirius and met Ginny after Hogwarts fic.

****** I'm not positive of the origin, but here's one explication I liked about why from a myrosecolouredgirl on tumblr:

#+begin_quote
  Tbh because there's no good reason not to. All the blood status in the hp universe is a metaphor for racism but you know what's boring? Metaphors for racism that only involve white people. Harry is often described as “dark” and like if James Potter's family was desi and Lily Evans's was white, that would enhance Harry's feelings of otherness while growing up with the Dursleys because lbr Vernon was probs a flaming racist. “Potter” could easily be an anglicized version of a south Asian last name like Potdar or Potluri, and you could make an argument for a pure blood family like the Potters engaging in and profiting from cultural exchange through the British colonization of India so there was an opportunity to establish generational wealth there. Also on the night he died, James was making pretty-colored lights for Harry. That was October 31st. In 1981, Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, started on October 27th. It lasts five days.
#+end_quote

This Desi Harry Potter blog also has some cool art and people's thoughts on how canon never contradicts the idea of Harry potentially being Indian. Some fun food for thought whether you follow the headcanon or not.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezor with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
