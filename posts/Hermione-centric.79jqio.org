A couple of months ago, I read this great Hermione centric fanfiction where she somehow woke up in another universe (still as Hermione), but like everything was opposite of the original universe. I think it was dramione and there were mentions of hansy as well. Dumbeldore was in power, but he was some kind of evil dictator and lily Evans was alive and she had killed her husband and his parents and she was dumbledores right hand man. All the pure bloods from the old families were mostly house wizards and house witches...etc. Does anyone know what this is? I honestly just can't remember or find the title


** Actually just found it, it's called reverse by lady moonglow in case you were wondering
