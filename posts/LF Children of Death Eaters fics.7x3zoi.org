Want to read some good fics that deal with the children of DEs attending Hogwarts and how students react and such.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7900250/1/Raindrops-on-Roses][Raindrops on Roses]] by Miss Saigon is an excellent next gen fic. It has actually one of my most favorite one in that category. The story deals how Scorpius and Draco have opposing views and how it had affect their relationship.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4910668/1/The-Inquisitor-s-Son][The Inquisitor's Son]] by jinxdoll made me cry a waterfall of tears. This fic, however, deals with Scorpius discovering that theirs more to Draco then meets the eye especially involving Draco's background as a Death Eater in his past life.
