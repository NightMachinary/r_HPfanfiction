I'm looking for storys that take place in the Hogwarts years.


** Ron looked at Harry increasingly worried, "Hermione wanted me to talk to you. I know you like to save every one mate, but, enough is enough! You have to stop adopting people! At this pace Hogwarts will have a fifth house only for all these bloody Potters!"

***** Draco says to his son, "There are Purebloods who are like us, the top of the society, next there are Half-bloods who are good for being our minions, poor ones who have to live with their mudblood or worse their muggle relations and next we have mudbloods who are good for nothing but be servants to us, the final are Scar-heads marked after their founder who if you see make sure to run the other way .. they are crazy and worse, their craziness is contagious."

As for the Request, sorry never came across a story with this in.

** Now you made me want to see a fic where Harry forcibly blood-adopts Snape into the Potter family, given how much of a fan Snape seems to be of Potters.

** Shameless self-promotion, but: link ffn(13677583)

Elune's Pebble is a cross-over where a helps out a bunch of 'people' that fled their world. In the fic Harry uses a blood oath he twists into a magical adoption. 'House Potter' gets much, much, bigger within two weeks.

  There's change afoot at Hogwarts! Thanks to Elune, Azeroth's moon goddess, Harry Potter has been gifted with a great boon and responsibility. The ripples from Elune's gift have already grown large, and they've just started. Come see the adventures of the Potter Dragonflight, no Warcraft lore knowledge needed! Features many dragons, a HP/HG ? Ship, and Cursed!Dumbledore
