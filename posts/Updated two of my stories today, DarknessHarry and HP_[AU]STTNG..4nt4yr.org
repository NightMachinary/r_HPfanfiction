#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter is rescued from a planet he spent centuries on alone, he's happy to find his kind still exist on their new world but he exiles himself amongst the muggles of the Federation, hunting for something. Then when his one friend amongst them is murdered, Harry contacts the one group that knows of his abilities and offers his help. For a price.

***** Thanks! If you haven't taken a look at it, my HP/STTNG story is fairly ridiculously popular(I didn't think anyone would take notice but they did!). I average at least one new follow or fave a day, I think.

** I just read that Star Trek one- I liked it. You did a decent job with a bunch of names I recognized, though it seems they were just re-used names and not taken characters? Whatever, either way, I guess. You seem to take a zig-zaggin' ass route to wherever the hell the story is going, and there's a whole bunch of stuff that is world-building but I doubt is even remotely relevant. I dunno. I'll probably keep readin' when I see it updated. There's a lot could be done better, but you got some clever lines and ideas, so good on you for givin' me somethin' at least half-decent to read. hi5!

*** Except for two things I can think of at the moment, I think everything I mention is relevant to later events. Yeah, I am worldbuilding at the moment. I had thought to have Harry just appear in the middle of the war and have flashbacks to building the fleet but that felt lazy on my part. I wanted to build the world and the fleet then the war happens, reorienting his plans for his peoples' "star trek."
