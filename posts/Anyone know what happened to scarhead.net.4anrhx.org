I just realized I can't load the site anymore. Anyone know what happened to it?

What about blacklupin.org and thequidditchpitch.org?

I feel like all the smaller fanfic sites are disappearing and it's incredibly sad.


** TQP is dead. some was saved to AO3 but i have no idea how to find it. Other individuals downloaded a portion of it. I imagine the other two died as well.
