** I vaguely remember a one shot where the last student off the train disappeared every year and nobody ever thought twice about it. It was some kind of Scottish Fairy Tithe that let the rest of them keep doing magic.

I wish I could remember the name of it.

** The Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs has some pretty fucked up magic stuff going on. I can't link it because from what I remember there's some underage stuff happening, but the way magic was described was super interesting in that fic.

** There's Silently Watches' /Black Queen/ series which is dark as fuck in more or less all aspects you could think of. I won't link it because there's some screwed up shit in there. Grammar is good though (in fact it's quite well written despite the demented stuff going on). Lots of Voodoo rituals and human sacrifices and things that could as easily kill the caster as the sacrifice.

Also worth noting is Ebenbild's /Basilisk-born/ which is all the way at the other end of the grammar scale from the Black Queen series (Ebenbild's first language is very clearly *not* English and it unfortunately shows, they need a good beta to go over the whole thing desperately) but the story telling is just as good. The magic system used there has a focus on ritual which can quite easily go wrong and kill somebody, but which isn't quite as sinister as the Voodoo in the Black Queen.

Edit: Typo fixed, thank you [[/u/VenditatioDelendaEst][u/VenditatioDelendaEst]] for pointing that out. It's been some time since I read one of his fics.

*** That's "Silently Watch/es/", not Watching.

That series has a really interesting "sympathetic magic" system, where a mage can cast spells remotely by using a piece of the target or an exact scale model of it.

*** Black Queen is my favourite fic(s) ever I think, it's great even though it tries hard to make you stop reading every once in a while by bringing in some seriously dark stuff, but if you're a person not phased easily, go for it.

*** That Second Chance at Life story is one that persistently sticks in my brain. Lots of small snippets are just memorable. Think I got into the sequel when they went back into like Aztec/Inca times or third story before moving on but I'm considering giving it another go.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge) I'm not sure if this one fits your need but it focuses a lot on Occlumency and Runes. There is a whole arc where Harry accidentally summons Lethifolds and they rampages London so I'd say it is pretty dark.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** I can't remember the title, but there is a Ravenclaw!Harry story in which James Potter lived (Lily died) and Sirius is in a coma, leaving Harry obsessed with healing his godfather. There is faerie magic in it, and Harry is dealing (and consuming) magical drugs while his Auror father is trying to catch the dealer. Sorry I can't remember exactly which story it is, but its on [[https://FF.net][FF.net]]. I liked the darkness of the magic in the story.
