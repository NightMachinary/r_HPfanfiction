Is anyone aware of any (hopefully LF) set in Azkaban with a group of prisoners could be death eaters could be falsley accused or otherwise, who plan an elbaorate break out? much like any prison break movie or tv series ever...Eg. Digging hidden tunnels, filing prison bars, having wands smuggled in and hidden for the day of the big break ect. I'd like a fic that showed as much of the daily life in Azkaban and maybe fleshed out the inner workings of the place a little if possible...anyone know any fics like this?


** Would love to see that done properly. Of course, a lot of the tropes wouldn't apply; for one thing, there's not much point in digging tunnels when Azkaban's a perpetually stormy island in the middle of nowhere.

One thing is for certain, such a story would /definitely/ have to have someone knock out a Dementor somehow, steal its robes, and then pretend to be a Dementor in the HP counterpart to the "steal the guards' uniforms" routine.

Also, cut the files. The inmates' allies on the outside would smuggle /the wands/ inside the cakes. (The Dementors, of course, allow shipments of cake; cakes make the prisoners momentarily happy, and thus it gives /them/ a meal.)

*** yes its hard to apply some muggle prison tropes to wizards for sure... as for the tunnel thing it would be about getting into the prison yard or some other key area rather than off the island itself...maybe they plan tunnel to the yard where the wands are hidden or something along those lines...tbh we need a better writer than me to come up with the finer details haha

Hmm...well, they dug the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, and that has a ton of water in the way...

And if you were good with an undetectable expansion charm and transmutation, you could probably transfigure away quite a bit of rock and make good time, and with bubblehead charms you wouldn't need to worry too much about air quality...

So maybe tunnelling /out/ of Azkaban is questionable, but tunnelling /in/?

** Check out linkffn(Elizium for the Sleepless Souls). It doesn't exactly match all of your requirements but it's a good read with a great mystery and a fast moving plot!

** Bring Me A Boat is an amazing AU where Remus never gave up on Sirius, and breaks him out of Azkaban. Doesn't really use any muggle tropes, but it's a great fic.

  Post-DH, Pre-Epilogue. The Wizarding world is slowly recovering, and Hogwarts is re-opened. Harry Potter struggles to become a good DADA teacher, but it's hard when a large portion of his mind is commandeered by four familiar Marauders. Slash and het.

  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.
