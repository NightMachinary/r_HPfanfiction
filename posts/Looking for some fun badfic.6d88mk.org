I like having my friend read bad fanfic to me while I do other stuff, so I'm looking for some fun bad fic. Not the 1 million word long Partially Kissed Hero or the other reprehensible fics that always get cited in worst fic threads.

I like ridiculous, clumsily written, ooc, totally bonkers or just silly stuff. Mary Sues, I'll take em. Crossovers, sure. Harry goes Goth? Yes please I really wanna find more of this that isn't My Immortal. Stuff that's FUN to read. I've mainly been finding stuff by going into the earliest entries of ffnet for Harry Potter and looking for stuff that seems like it's up my alley. Here are a few of the ones I've found to give you an idea of what I like.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/259320/2/][Harry Potter and the Secret of Lord Voldemort]] The Trio meet an American transfer student, immediately trust her and make her part of their posse. Turns out she's Voldemort's sister. Props for the Mary Sue actually ending up being important.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2928733/1/][The Real Me]] Harry is an angry young man who finds acceptance in a secret club of goth students including Draco malfoy. Lots of delicious early 2000s nu metal lyrics.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/324958/1/][Nothing Better Than a Twin]] The Trio stand helplessly by while two gorgeous twins get into a lot of hair pulling girl drama with every side female character.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4140538/1/][Power Lord]] Harry is transported to Pok√©mon world, where he becomes the most powerful trainer ever. Dumbledore begs him to come back and help with Voldemort and Harry is a real dick about it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/42785/1/][Wizard World Tournament]] Basically the Triwizard Tournament again. A truly useless Gary Stu, Malfoy as hated Hogwarts champion, and a really head scratching ending.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/414083/1/Snap][Snap]] Needlessly gorey murder mystery fic.

Anyone have stuff like this? If not, maybe you'll enjoy what I've dug up from the depths of ffnet.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9970406/1/Inheritance][Inheritance]] by megamatt09 is so bad that it actually becomes funny.

*** Wow, not sure I can even power through this. What's interesting is that it doesn't really feel like it was written by a fan. It's so critical of everyone and everything in the books and goes about "fixing" it in a really gross way.

** On AO3, Inky Black Locks [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10963371/chapters/24406305]] is phenomenal. I didn't know it was deliberately written to be bad, and I was laughing out loud. It's wonderfully terrible, in every respect.
