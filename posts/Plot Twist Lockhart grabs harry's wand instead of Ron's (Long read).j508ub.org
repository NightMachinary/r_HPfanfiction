After using the memory charm on Harry and Ron, Lockhart heads up the pipe taking the basilisk skin with him to the teachers common room. Ofcourse taking Harry and Ron with him. Assuming he knew enough magic to take them both up the pipe, they end up in the teachers common room where Lockhart boasts about killing the basilisk and how he was too late to save Ginny at which point ron and harry tragically lost their minds at the sight of her mangled body. The teachers are aghast at the sight of the two poor children,witless and babbling about. Snape being the quickest of them knew something was wrong and as dumbledore had returned that night, he made his way straight to the headmaster.

Dumbledore upon hearing Snape's account knew something was amiss and Snape witnessed the headmaster for the first time, afraid. Dumbledore made his way to the common room as fast as possible, whilst sending fawkes on a detour to the chamber of secrets.

Upon questioning lockhart the teachers saw that palpable aura of cold fury emanating from dumbledore, He knew lockhart had lied and had destroyed Ron & Harry's memories for personal gain. As he was finishing his questioning, there was a flash of light and a single phoenix feather appeared, not a good sign. Something was terribly wrong.

Dumbledore moved swiftly, putting harry and ron in an enchanted sleep and binding lockhart to await justice, he made his way to the chamber of secrets.

He knew that the basilisk was very much alive and someone very powerful was controlling it.Fawkes's warning was sufficient enough. Ofcourse dumbledore had figured out who it was, but the how still eluded him.

At this point, Riddle had finished consuming Ginny's body and the part of voldemorts soul that was in the diary had manifested into a living, breathing human.

With only one purpose in mind, Harry Potter. (Ginny is now dead and voldemort is very much alive, the 16 year old voldemort, that is. I would be correct in assuming I think that voldemorts memories would be limited to whatever ginny has shared with him and uptil the point where this horcrux was created)

Dumbledore makes his way forward having studied parseltongue enough to say the word "open" he makes his way past the first entrance and he sees ginny on the floor emicated and shriveled with the diary on her chest and the spitting image of tom riddle standing over her.

"Dumbledore" breathed Riddle, turning around

"You are surprised to see me Tom?" said dumbledore

"You're too late dumbledore" hissed riddle, "Ginny is dead and I Lord Voldemort, returned!"

"It seems I am too late" said Dumbledore sadly

"What will it be now dumbledore? Let me leave unimpeded and I will spare your precious students from my wrath " hissed Riddle, the wand in his hand twitching slightly.

"You must be foolish to think that I would  let you leave here Tom, very foolish indeed said Dumbledore

"I have a basilisk at my command Dumbledore! you old fool!, you think you could match the powers of Lord voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin!? "Kill him", commanded riddle in parseltongue.

"Tom, it is not too late yet to save yourself, this path will bring you nothing" Said Dumbledore calmly

"Save myself?" Laughed riddle maniacally "Save myself? you have a basilisk to deal with you old fool!

Everything happens very fast, riddle sends a killing curse aimed straight at dumbledore, the basilisk slithers out of slytherins mouth, and fawkes swoops in to take the curse for dumbledore and turns to ashes.

Dumbledore conjurs a mirror infront of the basilisks eyes, which petrifies the basilisk itself and it crashes to the ground.

"What is it Tom? is this fear I sense? Said dumbledore, as the crash echoes through the hall "I believe I have seen it before"

"You will not best me dumbledore!" shouted Riddle, Avada....!

But dumbledore was too fast, vines were twisting around voldemorts ankles and up his body closing his mouth, Then the vines were gone in a flash, voldemort sent another curse towards dumbledore, a wall of water which turned to ice blocked the curse. Then the ice broke and turned into very thin and fine shards which hurtled towards voldemort, who summoned fire to melt the ice, dumbledore started striding forward, closing the gap, the same technique he had applied against grindelwald, to come close enough for the final move.

"You want to kill me dumbledore? you cannot kill me" laughed Riddle, "I am immortal!"

"That remains to be seen, Tom. Just killing you would not give me the satisfaction, I admit, but I have guessed enough of your claim to immortality, I would not have gone this far" said dumbledore quietly.

" You are weak dumbledore" screamed riddle, he swished his wand and a powerful wind it seemed was summoned, which caught fire and blowed towards dumbledore, but it moved past dumbledore without touching him, voldemort sent another killing curse towards dumbledore but dumbledore side stepped it with the help of magic. (Voldemort was very much outmatched as dumbledore was more experienced, more powerful and had the elderwand, and he knew it, the basilisk was his only edge which dumbledore disposed of quite easily)

"Enough" said dumbledore quietly as he drew near, and  before voldemort could so much as blink a powerful blast moved towards him with so much speed he had no time to counter it, he was thrown backwards, Ginny's wand cracking and breaking with the force of it.

Riddle was on the ground, dumbledore towering above him

"I thought you were above killing dumbledore" said riddle

"I am" said dumbledore, "I believe in giving people second chances, but you Tom, It would be a mistake to let you live"

"I will be back dumbledore" cackled riddle

"Oh I dont doubt it" said dumbledore, "until then, Goodbye Tom" And with the finality of fate itself Dumbledore brought down the elderwand, there was a flash of green light and darkness.


** This is awesome. Poor Dumbledore would have to then hunt the horucrux (es) and kill Voldemort himself

** Dumbledore should've ravaged Tom's mind on his plans for future horcruxes. Dumbledore using the (presumably) killing curse is a badass. Though it'd be interesting to see Dumbledore using Tom's sweet precious 100% compatible body as bait for main Voldewraith if he's able capture & imprison wraithmort.

"I wonder..." Said Dumbledore, trailing off and idly raising the elder wand. "Ghosts are evidence that information is not only stored in the brain, but that the mind and soul are linked. Just how connected they are is a relatively unexplored subject, even by the unspeakables." Dumbledore continued, his lecturing tone juxtaposed by the glowing wand hovering an inch from Tom's forehead.

Albus mentally cursed Gilderoy for setting this train of thought in motion and spoke a long spell chain to break and bind the mind of Tom Riddle. "Confundo-Imperio-Confundo-Obliviate-Confundo-Legillimens"

*** Now that you mention it, I forgot about the unspeakables, an untouched topic by jk rowling. What youre proposing seems very probable and none other than dumbledore and a select few would be able to pull it off. I would imagine this being an S class spell though, probably an unforgivable curse.

**** Yeah, I's expect that'd work as he has infinite time to fight Dumbledore who also happens to have a sharingan. He might just go insane since he hate dumbledore and death so hes kinda trapped talkin w/ him.

** Thanks for all the love guys, I was wondering if I could polish this up a bit by adding dialogue between, Lockhart and the teachers, Snape and lockhart, maybe a minevra dialogue or two, Snape and dumbledore and dumbledore and lockhart and make it in Jk rowlings format. Tell me what you guys think!
