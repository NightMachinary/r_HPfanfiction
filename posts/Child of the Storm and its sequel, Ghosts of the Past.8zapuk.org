'Child of the Storm' (complete) and its sequel, 'Ghosts of the Past' (WIP) have to be the best crossover fanfics I've ever read. I am puzzled as to why there hasn't really been that much discussion about them, as the author blends HP/Marvel/DC/Dresden Files and a smattering of other works into a nigh-perfect mixture. While Harry (and other main characters) are OP, the fanfic does not fall into the classic tropes usually associated with Super!Harry. In fact, the author derides such tropes; instead, such topics are treated as to how Harry and co. would realistically react.

** I really didn't like Child of the Storm and never even finished it. To me, it felt like it was written by a teenager shouting "cool!" someone 'got what they deserved."

*** Yeah, they're...long.

My personal opinion is that it suffers from a case of "let's include all the things because that'll be awesome" and the whole thing ends up being super long and somewhat hard to follow as a result. I admittedly don't read comic books, but even so I get the impression that it's more like a (super long) Marvel comic in pure text form that incorporates the HP universe than an HP fic that includes Marvel characters.

**** It does seem to get better as the story goes along. Personally it was one of my favorite crossovers. However Ghosts of the Past is a different story. In GotP the story has devolved into a big Harry is now perfect and can do anything and consequences magically disappear. Eventually I just gave up.

***** I agree, CotS is vastly different from GotP.

I don't think GotP has devolved into a perfect Harry though. He does solve issue's fairly easily, but everything else it seems more like a Harry that is working through his changes.

****** I've got no problem with him growing up. Its the whole 'I'm hurt so Jesus will come down snap his fingers and I'm healed' thing. Or how Carol can't be hurt because centuries old vampires destroy everyone until they run into a half way trained super soldier exponentially slower and weaker than her.

The writer is also running into the problem Marvel often has. There aren't many good villains available. He's made Magneto a follower, Loki a perfect citizen, and the "gods" all powerful unless you are against a teenage boy and his friends.

By all accounts Voldemort is a genius and craftier than even Harry, but he couldn't beat Dresden? Whose left to be a real antagonist to the main characters? Apparently every truly WMD of a super powered individual is blindly loyal to Harry.

******* Yea, I agree most of that. It has definitely gone on to be a whole build up Harry story for an unknown reason.

I'm actual okay with this part, but only because they aren't scared to go up against a teenage boy and his friends, they are afraid of a Dark Phoenix, which isn't that hard to swallow.

That's true, but as the author pointed out it's only a shared of the Phoenix. So while that is powerful without a doubt, could dozens of entities on the cosmic scale not do anything about that?

Its part of why when I read the words: Godlike, Lord Potter-Black-Peverall-Emrys, helpful Goblins, magical inheritance, super rich, I stop reading. Any good story begins with a compelling plot, a great story begins with a desperate need. If there is no mountain or struggle why would I want to read. Superman stories might be the only ones that have gained an incredible following while being super OP.

Honestly maybe not.

If I remember right, the skyfathers are around Multi-Galactic level, Phoenix force is well into Multi-Universal level. With such a massive difference in power, yea they shouldn't be able to do anything about it. If you're willing to debate about it shoot me a DM.

You can have good stories that deal with these, it is just extremely difficult to do right.

That's more of a preference, and more power to you. Different strokes for different folks and all you know.

#+begin_quote
  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...

I get not liking a story or the apprentice thing, but for this how else should it have be done? Dumbledore goes through James/Thor's mind to determine if it is him. I mean sure they could have put up more of a fight, but it /is/ Thor who just unleashed hundreds of lightning bolts.
