** Why doesn't anyone say the obvious?

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is very good, at least the Hermione parts. The Snape and Harry POVs seem to be shoehorned in just to wank Hermione. You've proabably read it already, but best to put it out there first.

linkffn(The Two Bodied Problem) is another Hermione centric gen fic I like. It isn't anything I would call extraordinary or go out of my way to read, but it is a pleasant read nonetheless.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** I'm pretty fond of Angelica by delivermefromeve on Portkey.

(Does the bot work on Portkey fics?)

There's also some Harry POV but it's dominantly from Hermione's perspective.

Angelica is a rather hard fic to describe without revealing spoilers, but the titular character is Harry and Hermione's daughter and appears mid-way through the fic after a time skip.

I urge people to give it a shot. It starts in an odd place, mid-adventure, somewhat involves Avalon in a little out of place manner, but has an excellent story, solid character drama with consistent characterisations, and ends in a satisfying climax and conclusion. One of my favs.

The authors more famous fic, Forever Knight, is pretty good too. That one has a lot of smut - too much in the first half of the story. But again excels in the story and character drama part.

Angelica has a couple sex scenes, too, as a warning.

** Some favorites that haven't been listed already:

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew)
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19)
- linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa) (though might be too much of a good thing)
- linkffn(Cry Out, Curlew by Evil Is A Relative Term)
- linkffn(Ill Met by Moonlight by Thomas M Riddle) and linkffn(A Pound of Flesh by Thomas M Riddle), its sequel. (/Not/ a Tomione 'ship.)
- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] (non-FFN): In Alex Mack's universe -- a universe without magic -- there is also a Hermione Granger. A teen Hermione who has her own Ron and Harry. A Hermione who will have to deal with their very own He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
- linkffn(The Snake Pit by cupcake0118) may not go anywhere, but it's a neat way to jump-start a Slytherin!Hermione fic.
- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss), with the reservation that it's too much about Hermione facilitating Harry doing stuff (though that's explained in-story).
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer)
- linkffn(Heap Coals of Fire on His Head by White Squirrel)
- linkffn(One Witch and her Elf by Rumour of an Alchemist)
- linkffn(The most gifted witch of her age by Bagge)
- linkffn(Effloresco Secundus by romantiscue) (a /Naruto/ crossover where an adult Hermione is reincarnated into Sakura)

Also might be worth a look:

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and a Prince of Serpents by CreatorZorah)
- linkffn(The Stark Effect by NexusNebulous)
- linkffn(For the Only Hope by ausland)
- linkffn(Wake of War by JeanHermioneSnape) (a Slytherin!Hermione), abandoned before it gets to the Snape 'ship, but what's written is an interesting character study, IMO.

Oh, and Harry Potter enrolled that year as well. *** A few tweaks to canon, plus extrapolating Hermione's apparent intelligence realistically.
