  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][The Revelation Of Harry Forrester]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in Boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Due to a charm Sirius put on Harry during the chase he doesn't get discovered by the American magical authorities until he has a big burst of magic during a concert. Has a good dose of musical theory in it.

Warnings: Mild manipulative Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/1/][Harry Potter: The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing]]

Harry runs away from the dursleys at a young age and lives on the streets. He doesn't get his Hogwarts letter for a few years because the place he found that hides him from Dumbledore's tracking charms also hides him from owls.

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.
