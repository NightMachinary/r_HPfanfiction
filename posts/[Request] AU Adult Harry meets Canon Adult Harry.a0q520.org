In alternate dimension fics where Harry meets another version of himself, authors always write their lives to be very similar. Same group of friends, love interests and ideals. And If its Adult Harry and Teenage Harry, there's always a power imbalance I guess.

Would like to see this!

They do not lead similar lives here...

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** It's not adult per se as both Harrys are 17 but I would recommend LeQuin's Strange Reflections. It's a good story with few moments of wtf but a pretty god characterization and enjoyable writing style.

*** I really enjoyed that story but I wish there had been some information on why the other Potters were so awful.
