I've found that much of Voldemort's credibility as a threat comes from the fact that...someone's weak and/or not committed to fighting him. The Ministry in canon, Dumbledore in plenty of Dumbledore-bashing fics particularly, arguably Harry in canon too (compared with Super!Harry fics, which is of course a silly comparison to make, but if Dumbledore and the Ministry are competent and allied, Harry would only be needed to fulfill the prophecy as a technicality.)

I would be really interested if someone has managed to make Voldemort a credible, strong thread, even though the entire non-Death-Eater world is fighting against him. Theoretically, it should be possible, through sheer magical power, liberal use of the Dark Arts, and what amounts to guerilla warfare.

Thank you!


** I'm randomly reminded of how canon Voldemort a) placed a decades-long, fate-twisting curse on a teaching post at Hogwarts, b) personally killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent people and turned them into Inferi to guard one of his horcruxes, c) single-handedly duelled McGonagall, Slughorn and Shacklebolt simultaneously and won, d) warred with the Ministry of Magic for over a decade without being apprehended and was potentially on the verge of total victory before his 'death'.

And then he goes and effs up by trying to challenge Harry to a duel instead of killing the Boy-Who-Lived on the spot, resulting in Harry escaping and warning Dumbledore about Voldemort's return. And then obsesses over a prophecy for a year (you'd think one of his Death Eaters would mention how they aren't actually binding), before he gets his act together again and takes over the Ministry in one fell swoop.

*** Voldemort strikes me as if Rowling was trying to fuse two characterizations together at once, or that she changed from one to the other halfway through.

On the one hand he is a delusional narcissist obsessed with power, who treats his subordinates as servants and has a fetish for snakes. He is a fairy tale bad guy dressed in all black, who waxes poetic about how awesome he is and drops the ball when time comes to deal with the protagonist.

On the other hand, he is a charismatic leader of a revolutionary army (one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter after all). He leads a powerful organization, has gathered a set of powerful individuals beneath him, decapitates both his main opposition and the head of government in less than two months. There are many parallels with the rise of other revolutionaries in history, from individuals such as Adolf Hitler to Napolean Bonaparte. Many of these individuals appear to have truly believed there "ideals" as well, just like Voldemort appears to actually buy into the blood purity despite the hypocrisy of his own status.

Most fics featuring Voldemort in any real capacity tend to keep him as one or the other, depending on the type of story and the author.

Which only went wrong because of something neither of them were aware of. If not for Priori Incantatem, Voldemort won. Just like he beat Dumbledore at the end of OotP.

** I did that in my story "Patron". Dumbledore and Voldemort both try to use plans and plots that advance their goals even if they fail. For example (slight spoiler for the first ten chapters or so), Voldemort had Harry entered into the TWT, but mainly as a distraction to keep Dumbledore busy protecting the Boy-Who-Lived while Voldemort could prepare his resurrection without interference. However, if Harry actually died in the TWT (Barty, who certainly wasn't about to try and impersonate an old friend of Dumbledore, had some sabotage/assassination attempts planned as well), that would be a great bonus, and the mere fact that the TWT was manipulated eroded made Dumbledore lose some face and hurt his political capital.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** I guess... linkffn(Imprisioned Realm) The Ministry is completely different from canon, and isn't so much as against Voldemort as it is a 3-way war, at least until around 60% of the fic.

Just a warning, this has some heavy shit, with rape, torture, angst and drama. But its also really fucking good.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? This is a very dark fic. Warnings within. A/N: Currently editing fic.
