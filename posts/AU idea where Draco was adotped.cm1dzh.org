Since Narcissa and Lucius never had another kid, maybe they actually weren't able to conceive a child at all. In secret, they found a child that they were sure was magical that they could adopt, and they brought him into the family, faking Narcissa's pregnancy and pretending it was their pureblood heir all along. They act like it never happened and Draco doesn't know, until later in life the secret gets out. Draco loses his sense of self and desperately traces who his birth parents really were- and was devastated to find out they were both ordinary muggles, and turns out Draco was a mudblood all along, and he has to figure out what to do with this new information and sense of self-hatred

While there are some exceptions (like the Weasleys, Blacks, and Greengrasses), I think almost all the other pureblood families had only one child. Lucius and Narcissa not having any kids after Draco is probably normal for purebloods like themselves.
