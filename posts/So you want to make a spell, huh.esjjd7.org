Well, this is a two-part question. Apologies. Another long one.

#+begin_quote
  First - How do you think spells are made? Or, if you don't think they're made, how do you think they're 'discovered'?
#+end_quote

Any method you like is fine here, no limits to your imagination and all that. I'm just curious what the spectrum of opinion is on this one.

  Second - Rowling-Magic Spells are, at their heart, tools. Learning a Lumos is thematically like buying a torch. With this is mind, I'd like to try and get a list of spells going. What spells do you think exist, or should exist, in the Rowling-Magical World?
#+end_quote

Canon, fanon, actualised and yet-to-be. We can use ones you've seen in other fanfics, ones you think should exist, ones that could exist, etc. Prosaic or esoteric, weird and kinky or secular and clean, any language or culture, and any method of casting (wandless, rings, wandless, etc). I'm hoping for something authors might be able to use for inspiration/reference here. If you're not okay with other people using your idea for their fics, please make a note in whatever comment you make. Other people, please don't be dicks to those people. Manners maketh man and all that. :)


** My head canon is that a spell to do anything and everything exists already, however the witch/wizard has to use arithmancy to predict what combination of wand movement/incantation has the desired effect.

I.e the wizard calculates the magical probability of a desired effect when they use a certain wand movement/number or stirs (for potions) etc.

** My head cannon is that spells are created by using a Arithmancy powered method or ritual pandora Lovegood made a mistake with her Arithmancy and died

Spells that I came up with are the great aurora spell (auroreas major) which drains the Magic from an area to fuel itself then expanding over a large area it also causes Wizard to want to keep casting magic further expanding it repeat,this is a very powerful spell,the way to dispel it is to destroy the Wizard fueling it then use the next spell

The border spell it creates a border over a specific area which stops unauthorized entrance(of course if you get powerful enough you can bypass it)it can also be used to contain dangerous magic such as Fiendfyre

** My head canon is that there is some fundamental difference that gives wizards and witches a sort of intuition that allows them to learn magical concepts, which in turn allow them to create spells, make potions, invent rituals, etc. These, when told to a muggle, would make absolutely no sense and would downright be counter-logical.

I like this because it bypasses questions like why there aren't and never were muggle magical theorists, why potions aren't discovered and mass-produced randomly by muggles, etc.

You could also explore how a society of people who think in a fundamentally different way would evolve alongside the muggles or how muggleborn wouldn't fit society because they also have this intuition that doesn't work in the muggle world. You could write a Hermione who was seen as a borderline learning-impaired girl before Hogwarts who suddenly became a genius. How would she deal with it?

** I really like the spellcrafting system from The Arithmancer. Numbers have magical properties, and so do equations, matrices, vector spaces, and all other mathematical constructs. So if you want to create a spell you need to figure out the equations that have the desired magical properties, solve the equations and turn the Fourier transform of the result into a geometric pattern for the wand movement and a rhythm, and find an incantation that sounds good and matches the calculated rhythm. Hexes are easily reverted because their equations have easy solutions, curses have equations that aren't analytically solvable so they can't be reversed easily. Transfigurations involve a lot of matrices and linear algebra. You want to find the charm for reversing a given transformation? Enjoy finding the inverse of this absolutely massive matrix full of complex numbers. Of course using MATLAB is just cheating.

**** It mentions that the equations of more complicated spells are far more complicated than anything you'd encounter in physics.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
