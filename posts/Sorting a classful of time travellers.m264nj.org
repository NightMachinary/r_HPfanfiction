"Ho hum, a time traveller. Whoopdee doo" seems to be the Sorting Hat's reaction in every story I've read where Harry's life "resets" to before his 1st year at Hogwarts.

So, take it to its cracky extreme: one year every student's a time travelled consciousness... and the sorting hat is 100% IDGAF.

** Oh man, I can imagine the sheer and utter chaos:

- Malfoy comes from a future where Harry snapped and became something worse than Voldemort, after dealing with said dark wizard

  - His goal is to prevent that future from coming to pass by keeping Harry's friends alive

- Pansy came from one where she and Draco were married, but their child was stillborn due a curse inflicted on her as a teenager

  - She must find the person who cursed her and prevent it from happening again

- Daphne came from a future where she married Harry and had a family, only for it all to be cruelly ripped away from her and he and their children were murdered

  - Harry is a little weirded out by how friendly this Greengrass girl is

- Susan wants to save her aunt and the rest of her family
- Seamus came from a future where Harry, a big hero after defeating Voldemort, sacrificed himself to save him and the rest of their auror squad

  - He suffers from survivor's guilt and vows to not let something like it reoccur

- Neville had a good old life: married a girl (not Hannah), had a family, and became the herbology professor. He just woke up one day back as a kid
- Hannah came from a future where she married Neville, but he died of poisoning

  - She always suspected it was deliberate and not an accident

Each future from every characters' setting had everyone different: for example, in one future Hermione went mad and went full on dark witch, and the character whose future this took place in treats her like she's still that (confusing the poor eleven year old girl): in another character's future, she's a great friend who did great things, and is treated with admiration.

They also wonder why other characters they knew back as a kids are acting so differently as they carry out their agendas (such as Malfoy trying to keep Harry from going batshit insane evil).

So many mish-mash-ups. So many interconnecting webs of chaos!

**** Haha, yeah.

Innocent, eleven year old Harry Potter is baffled why some people act so strangely around him.

*** Albus had no idea what in Merlin's name was going on but he knew something was.

Nearly every student after taking off the sorting hat had some type of exceptionally strange reaction.

The worst was that girl Luna? No that's not right? Monday? No, oh that's right!

Moon, her name was Moon. She had broken down into tears as the sorting hat called her name. It was such a scene he wasn't even sure what house she was in. She kept crying about not being real and an uncertainty principal.

Well at least Harry Potter had been a normal sorting.

He decided to check the Hogwarts Big Book of Shit's Gone Sideways and ask Hat what he thought was going on.

°•○○•°

Ron stood from the stool and spun around. Hat still on his head as he scanned for threats.

The Hogwarts Great Hall filled with kids let him know his plan had worked. With a confident smirk, that looked massively out of place on an 11yr old, he strode to the Gryffindor table.

°•○○•°

Draco let out a sigh of relief. It had worked, he could repay the debt they all owed, that he owed, to his best friend Harry. The man who had given his life not once, but twice, to save them all.

He clenched his tiny 11yr old fists and vowed to get it all right this time.

°•○○•°

Hermione Granger, General of the Winter Armies, Slayer of Mab, Champion of Summer, Master of the Wilds, and Ruler of Fae felt her mind settle in her young body.

The Other was different here, unconnected directly to her reality. To her domain. That fucker Neville had led the Dominus Santus against her. They had banished her from their reality for all eternity.

Still, he was young and Harry still lived. They was plenty of time to save her brother and mold her greatest enemy into an ally.

°•○○•°

Neville had been really enjoying that gooseberry pie with dinner when between one blink and the next he was suddenly 11 again.

Well good news, he didn't have to finish grading all the summer homework that he was flooded with every new school year.

Bad news, he had been over half done already, total bullocks, couldn't have happened last week could it!?

Worse news, puberty, again.

°•○•°

Slapping a hand over her eye out of reflex Tracy Davis realized it had worked!

She was 11!

She would have to check later, likely with Flint, but she was sure it had worked.

Why had she thought implanting a basilisk eye into her left eye was a good idea?

Oh yeah, because she and Harry had gone on a wicked bender after burning down the mansions of a few capitalist pigs!

°•○○•°

Daphne looked at Tracey unsure why she had a hand over her left eye or why she was staring at Flint so much.

Didn't matter, she had gone back in time!

After 300 years of marriage Harry had finally +escaped from her love through death+ sadly passed on.

Didn't matter she had long planned for such an occasion!

An agonizingly long three hours after his death she was here with her love again! She also had direct access to the original sorcerer stone and knew where all three Hollows were!

Her and her love would never be separated again, never!

First though she stood back up from the table and put the hat back on her head.

"I demand a resort! Gryffindor or death!"

°•○○•°

Anthony Goldstein kept his face calm and passive. His cool exterior gave away no sign of what he was thinking. It was the best way to keep suspicion off him, just blend in.

This technique was something he had mastered long ago and would normally work perfectly.

It looked wholly out of place on an 11yr old though and only drew more attention to himself.

No matter, he had a mission! He had the intel, and knew how to pass it on!

Israel would rise!

°•○○•°

"Who the bleeding hell are the HPFF Mods? It says I'm supposed to write to them in hope of locking the thread down and preventing anymore crack from spreading?"

Albus was extremely confused at what the Hogwarts Big Book of Shit's Gone Sideways said was his best solution.

There was another side note that said he could write to AO3 if he was really desperate.

He did both, though his overly elaborate handwriting made it nearly impossible to read.

°•○○•°

The nearly two year old little girl from New York was clapping happily at the cute bird that dropped a letter off in her lap.

Her parents had no clue what to make of it and shoved it in a cabinet in case it ever was important.

***** Right, just picture her knowing everything about him. His favorite food, the foods he doesn't like, habits of his, and just all the little details only an obsessive compulsive would know about an object of attention.

She's casting comfort and grooming charms on him out of reflex constantly.

He's completed weirded out, and kinda flattered anyone is being really super nice to him, over her actions.

Hilarious when she starts harping on him on habits he doesn't even know he has.

"Harry dear, don't chew on your quill."

"Harry dear, remember to use the teeth cleaning charm before the breath freshening jinx. Otherwise it makes your food taste off."

****** On the one hand, it's creepy because adult mind trying to reconnect with the husband she knew who's a literal child.

On the other hand, it sounds blood hilarious -- especially if he starts seeing her as a big sister figure.

Cue her freaking out. "No! I am not going to be friend-zoned and be considered another Hermione Jane Granger!"
