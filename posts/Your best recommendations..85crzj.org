Been reading for about six years now, and I've gone through most of the sappy romantic, hole-ridden works on ffn. I'm looking for some well written stuff, with a solid plot, three dimensional characters and a realistic storyline. Everything is game, just not a fan of slash, and i like stories that actually involve Harry - doesn't have to be Harry main, but having him in a prominent role of some sort.

Hit me with it. Crossovers, time travel, AU, gender benders, whatever. I need good fics.


** If you are not adverse to crack, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11637611/]["The silent world of Cassandra Evans"]], aka "OP Harry done right". After a rather dark start with some exaggerated Dursley abuse and the story suffering 7 or so chapters with very little dialogue, fem!Harry becomes more and more powerful while still keeping a light, humorous mood throughout the story. No Lordships, no harems and no ridiculous titles.

"Call Me" is a completely different take on the post-OOTP depressed Harry, where instead of brooding for 250k words, there is a believable teenage romance between Harry and Lisa Turpin (physical attraction -> sex -> deep feelings) and overall teenagers doing teenage stuff like drinking beer and trying weed (once). Some people complain about the pacing (sex at the end of the first chapter), but I find it refreshing after the 156176846 iteration of TRUE LOVE SOUL BOUNDS^{^{TM}} . Lots of 90s pop-culture and a few goth references, yet all but one of them are fitting and not shoved down your throat like those stories where Harry shares the authors love for whatever band/movie they like.

"Dignity in fear" is an OOTP story with a Hermione/Tonks romance and is probably the best depiction of emotions I have read. I love the Hermione, who is actually a human who gets overtaken by feelings and lust instead of being the fanon Wikipedia android. Little Harry in it besides a few thoughts from Hermione's PoV, but it has a well done Ginny as Hermione's confidante and as I said before, the best raw emotions come across perfectly.

  The Silent World of Cassandra Evans
#+end_quote

This is... actually really bad. Both story-wise and mechanically.

Mechanically speaking, the story is written exceedingly poorly. Paragraphs are page long and cover a variety of topics, sometimes entirely haphazardly. Every few paragraphs is a new point of view and some paragraphs have multiple point of views inside them. Sentence-level grammar and spelling are fine, but the paragraph structuring makes this unpleasant to read.

And actual story... I don't even know where to begin. Dumbledore is literally hoping for the basilisk to 'kill a few of the the filthy mudbloods' in his words. He actively hinders the female harry. And by hinders, I don't mean he doesn't tell them anything, but enacts a school-wide bullying and isolation campaign against fem!harry that makes the bullying of Worm's Taylor look like sunshine and roses. He memory charms and loyalty potions staff and students into ignoring fem!harry's troubles. And he was likely responsible for the Dursleys tearing out fem!harry's voicebox and vocal cords and subsequent street-life.

And that's just Dumbledore. Everyone else has extremely exaggerated and generally unlikable traits. Susan Bones has the hots for fem!harry since the moment she laid eyes on her to the point of being a stalker. Ron is typical 'this guy is so boorish and rude for asking about the scar and voldemort, let's never mention him again after the train.' Hermione befriends fem!harry for two months (which isn't seen at all and is glossed over with a 'we were friends, two months later...), but completely shuts her out after violently killing the troll.

The narrative is poor. Time jumps around from paragraph to paragraph. In one paragraph, she's publicly snapping Flint's wand because he tried ambushing her in one of the aforementioned sanctioned bullying events. Flitwick shows up and says that the headmaster wants to speak with her. The next moment, we get Snape's pov saying that the meeting with the headmaster is not going well. The very next paragraph, fem!harry had apparently decided to steal the philosopher's stone (which had never been mentioned in this story before now), made it through all the traps to Snape's puzzle, and is unable to solve said puzzle until her pet snake points out the right one.

I could go on and on. I made it to chapter nine before I couldn't justify spending more time on this fic. Maybe it gets better, but chapter nine is roughly a fourth of the way through. If it isn't good by then, it probably isn't going to get good ever.

** Read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12447494/1/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Adventure-of-the-Seventh-Safeguard][Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Seventh Safeguard]] by Charlotte Ann Kent if you're into well written mystery type of stories with a magical twist.

Basically, BBC Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (both are completely muggle) helped the trio find the horcruxes from the Deathly Hallows in a Conan Doyle detective style story. I don't want to spoil much, but there are other muggle ‘aquatints' that help as well. (Plus, the author somehow incorporated helicopters... as amusing as it sounds.)

Don't let the first person POV style derail you from reading the story. This is one of the rare stories that was actually written like an art form. When I say it's like a Conan Doyle book, I really meant it. The suspense and mystery is all there from John's relatable, yet insightful, perspective.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  She always had a soft spot for kids; the ones in this life definitely deserve better. The wizarding world needs a superhero anyway: a Wonder Woman who can talk to animals, breathe underwater, has a secret cave, and dreams up someone else's memories. The inglorious kind.
