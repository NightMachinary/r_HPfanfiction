Hello. I'm looking for the following: AU Voldemort wins scenario/ Time Travel/ Marauder's Era/ HGSS/ Teacher/Student

More specific details:

Hermione going back in time and becoming a professor at hogwarts; teaching the following students: Severus, Lily and Marauders...etc...Armed with the knowledge of the future, she's able to connect with her pupils, mostly with Severus Snape. With that being said, she able to shape him into a confident person, thus changing his future for the better. In addition, she's setting out to destroy the following Horcruxes etc... plus defend Severus against the peers bullying. (Perhaps she can be a DADA Professor or other- it's not as important.) Also, Student! Severus developes an attraction towards his professor. Please let know if anyone has read anything like this.
