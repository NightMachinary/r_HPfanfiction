**** The last list I made was an ordinary fanfic search. While certainly (mostly) comprehensive, it wasn't a definitive list.

You can guess what happened to that post's karma.

Concerning your actual comment, I agree. Most Harry/Bella stories I've read involve a massive change of heart on somebody's part. While they certainly appeal to /my/ tastes, which are quite wide ranging, they do not in anyway reflect on the tastes of [[/r/HPfanfiction]] as a whole. We're quite the diverse community, and there are only so many writers out there that write Harry/Bella, so you oftentimes don't get much choice on what tropes are present.

  "Clear your mind!" wasn't actually the best advice. Harry is fed up and takes things into his own hands and discovers a way to end the war on his own terms. No one was expecting this of the Gryffindor Golden Boy.

****** Out of the three the way people write Snape annoy me the most. He's either an unredeemable puppy kicking kitten skinning psychopath or a misrepresented super sexy hero. It's fucking disgusting either way. Personally I lean more towards the puppy kicking interpretation because the guy is an obsessive nazi and seems like the kind of guy you'd see on the news after he stalked and killed his ex.

Ron doesn't bother me that much for some reason. Mostly because I don't read many stories where Ron plays a major part in the plot and the Ron-centric fics I've read were actually pretty good.

Dumbledore I don't really care too much about since watching the author try to fit him into the plot is funnier than watching the excuses Marvel comes up with in the movies for why x character can't just do y thing and destroy the plot.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
