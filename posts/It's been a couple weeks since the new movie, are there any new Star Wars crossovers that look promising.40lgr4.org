** Just did a quick scan through the category on FF.net and only saw one story with Ep VII characters - and it doesn't look promising. I think that we'll only start to get good crossovers once the second (definitely third) movie has been released.

I think the best fics will come after Ep IX; that way we have a complete storyline to draw ideas from and it'll tone down the rampant speculation that people tend to put in fics [see any non-crossover fics written before OoTP/HBP].

**** I'd be interested in a Rey/Harry fic in the HP world. Not sure how Rey could end up on Earth though (some magic, probably).

** Including SW in general, or just TFA?

*** Preferably TFA, I've read pretty much most if not all of the good crossovers before TFA came out so I was hoping to get some good new generation fics.
