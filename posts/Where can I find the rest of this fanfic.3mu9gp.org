I read this excellent fanfic literature that deals with time travel where Harry goes back to 1975 to finish Voldemort, right in his early days! But the story is incomplete, can I find the rest of this somewhere?

** The author hasn't abandoned this fic seeing as it was updated last month. So all you can do is wait for sporadic updates.

  Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.

Um...what?

I scrolled down chapter one (after noting a reviewer mentioned incest) and saw the phrase "writhing tentacles." I'm not sure if that is a sign I should read this, or stay very, very far away...

*** I've read that summary too. Perhaps the author might have planned some smutfic/etc. in future, but what there is now is a pure thriller. I am also wondering why its m-rated after reading the whole novel.

I'm not sure which review you're referring to; the one I saw didn't say they hadn't read anything yet, just said incest writers were crazy, in essence.
