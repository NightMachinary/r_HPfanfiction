Someone in Harry's year loves cats and makes a fool of themselves stroking and baby talking to Cat McGonagall (see [[https://www.emilymcgovern.com/my-life-as-a-background-slytherin/2019-09-15-slytherin-24/]] for inspiration) and learns the animagus revealing spell due to their newfound phobia. Pettigrew gets found that year, Skeeter gets caught early fourth year.


** Turns out the kid was an orphan. Moody adopts them. Tonks gets oddly jealous.

**** agreed, Moody needs a kid to love. just imagine Moody being coerced into having a tea party by his new doe-eyed four year old daughter.

flash forward twelve years and a boy asks her out, and Mad-eye is the one the meets him at the door when the boy comes to pick her up.

****** Knowing Moody, he'd take it as a compliment.

“Vanish that and hurry in here to make my daughter feel like THE MERLIN-BLESSED ANGEL SHE IS!!!!” At top volume and intimidation.

****** haha right? but while the boy should rightly be worried about what Mad-eye will do if he does wrong, it's the doe-eyed girl that he asked out that he should be worried about the most. This girl would be raised by one of the most toughest, most paranoid men in the wizarding world. You know that he would of made sure that his little girl could protect herself from anything the he deemed a possible danger.

***** He could be worse then Molly Weasley haha; Actually, what if that is how he is at first? And then only after an intervention by Dumbledore and co. he agrees with them to stop being a "helicopter Parent" (as the Muggles say), only Moody ends up teaching the child everything he knows, by the time the Hogwarts letters arrive the child could pass the non-magical part of the Auror self defense exam. lol

** I wrote one a while ago where McGonagall stopped by the Dursley house as a cat to check on Harry and he was gardening, and then he fed her bacon to get her on his good side. I never really went anywhere with it cause I didn't see a point, but it stopped right about the time Petunia started acting like a bitch and then Minerva accidentally grew her animagus form in a supposedly impossible feat of magic and Petunia was suddenly confronted with an eight foot tall cat that loves Harry very much. Her reaction was amusing.
