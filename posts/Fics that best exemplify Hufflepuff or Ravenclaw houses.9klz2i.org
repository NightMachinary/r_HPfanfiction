I've found a good amount of Slytherin representation, and write my own since as a Slytherin myself it comes easily. Gryffindor is so oversaturated due to canon, it's impossible /not/ to find. But I haven't come across a lot of stories that really delve into the other two houses.

I've read some that parody (like BajaB's series, which is very good but not what I'm after) or take to extremes (MoR), but have yet to find any that really get to the heart of what the other houses are /like/.

Any recommendations would be welcomed. :)


** Personally, I quite like the characterisation of Ravenclaw in linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King), they are presented as not the ones with the most knowledge but as the ones with the most curiosity, hence a bigger proportion of muggleborns in it than other houses.

Of course, this is said by a Ravenclaw prefect at the Welcoming Feast so it is biased.

As for Hufflepuff... sorry but I can't recall any fic with a nice characterisation outside of the basic "work hard and be nice"...

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

  It's 1991, and eight newly Sorted wizards and witches are about to start their first night in House Hufflepuff. There'll be singing and camaraderie and macaroons and only a little bit of screaming. Arguably AU.

** I agree that the description of the houses are often very poorly done in fanfiction and often not thought through. Since I identify with being a Ravenclaw myself, the "rule abiding and strict" clich√© annoys me the most. I perceive Ravenclaw as the house that is the most curious, the one that asks the most question, the one that likes to perceive and think instead of judge. In all history of mankind those are the characteristics of people that rebel. Questioning the system leads to revolution. I would love a story that describes Ravenclaw like that that.

** The best representation of Hufflepuff house is in the "Where in the World is Harry Potter?" series by nonjon. Okay, maybe it's not the best, but the scenes showing Harry as the head of Hufflepuff are hilarious. linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter; The Untitled Cheekquel Project; You Did What?)
