Kreacher stared in wide eyed horror as the demon in front of him affixed its toga, a much too clean thing, comfortable looking and fine for any house elf. He struggled against the rope bindings, but the spell was too well cast.

How could I have come to this, thinking back he knew where it all went wrong. After serving the Black family for decades upon decades, watching as his forbearers received the esteem of having their heads mounted on the wall of honor, the house of black had fallen to blood traitors. At first, when the abandoned house had been invaded by the same blood traitors whose existence had driven his dear mistress to sorrow Kreacher had planned revenge. Oh, how he had spent nights plotting what he could do to make the filthy muggle lovers regret the day they were born, his insistent plotting conflicting against his trained obedience to Grimmauld place.

It was about that time that he met his young master. The blood traitors called him Harry Potter, but to Kreacher a mere name couldn't do justice to the young master Potter. When all else was lost, he destroyed the cursed locket, when master Regulus's murder was killed, it was all him. Everything that Kreacher had lost had been replaced by young master Potter, who allowed him to keep the precious mementos of his late mistress, who let him cook, clean, and bring to house respect an-Kreacher cut off as the demon spoke again.

She spoke in a singsong voice without inflection, touching some filthy muggle device affixed near her collar. “Day one, time is noon, beginning log now. Welcome to a week in the life of a house elf, paid in part by the Quibbler investigative department and S.P.E.W, a coalition created to improve house elf rights. This documentary will delve into the mysterious existence that is house elves, seeing what they see, doing what they do. The current house elf, Kreacher, owned by Harry Potter himself will be put into stasis for a week, unharmed but for a long nap. This investigative journalist will periodically take Polyjuice to maintain appearances. Over and out”.

The last thing Kreacher saw was a hand plucking a thin wisp of hair off his head, and a soft blue spell heading his way.
