** Because as far as writing itself goes, he's not a bad author. What he's bad with is bashing and overall lack of tension, and while those things are objectively not good there are times when people want to read “wish fulfilment” kind of stories.

Or, in other words: he's someone who writes “guilty pleasures”.

** Even if his stories are mostly "Harry and Hermione admits their feelings at some point in time and change the world in the following months", it's quite well-written and an easy choice if you want some Harmony fluff.

** His fics are technically sound and if you're ok with cliches (most ff.net readers are) they aren't too bad. linkffn(In This World and the Next) was the first fic I ever read and while I now know that it sucks I can see why a lot of people would like it, especially H/Hr shippers.

*** If by technically sound you mean his spelling and grammar is okay, I suppose..even though I did find a few grammatical errors. However, the dialogue and structure of it is cringeworthy, never mind the ridiculously paced plot and over the top bashing.

** To quote myself --- and this is just my armchair amateur group psychoanalysis, so take it with a whole shaker of salt --- Robst writes feel-good fic where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average; and there's lots of it, so you can keep reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

Harmony love is instant and constant: Harry's personality is rewritten to be the perfect gentleman and a scholar (and an utter badass, of course), and Hermione's is stripped away so that all her thoughts and actions can properly revolve around Harry, thus removing any sources of incompatibility or friction. There is no real tension, no real conflict, no sense of danger, except maybe some occasional peril for Hermione, so that Harry could be a proper Knight in Shining Armour for a chapter. This is not an uncommon pattern in romance generally written by male writers from the White Knight / Nice Guy school of relationships, as well as by female writers from the Twilight school of relationships.

** I think I heard him described as someone that writes for the lowest common denominator. Most people that visit this sub don't like his writing, but we're not representative of the average fanfiction reader. A lot of them are much more casual about it, are reading his stuff because they're bitter over Harry and Hermione not getting together, and either don't care or simply don't notice the overuse of cliches, white knighting, and Mary Sue-ing.

It's also a guilty pleasure for some people that like that kind of stuff. I don't personally like his works, but I've read other fiction that is low quality, but which I still enjoyed.

** He's generic. His stories are the equivalent of a loaf of bread - standard, filling but not incredibly nutritious, not horrible but not particularly delicious either - and so a lot of different people read them. I'd also probably assume that a lot of his readers are new to fanfiction, and so aren't tired of cliches and bashing. Iirc, Harry Crow was the third fanfiction I read, and while I didn't finish it, I got about half the way through before I switched to something else and added a favourite to come back to later.

His bashing is annoying, but the hero worship of the protagonist makes up for it in terms of tone of the story. It always feels like Harry is right, everyone else is wrong but the reader is on the 'good' team. Of course, that only holds up to a certain point but it's enough to get less experienced readers without as much trope exposure hooked.

** some of his stuff reaches crack fic levels and can be pretty funny. Squirrelmort, Crappy the goblin/TMR possessed.. Sybil and the groundskeeper at the Riddle place getting it on and making the Dark Lord ill. That's good stuff.

Some people like comics. Some like Greek tragedies. I'm not going to look down on those Greek lovers.

** Because he puts out a prodigious quantity of bland, HHr flavoured, tension-free mush that appeals to the lowest common denominators of the Harry Potter fandom. I don't know why people are calling his writing 'technically sound', because he overuses run-on sentences something dreadful. His grasp of punctuation is spotty at best, and the overall structure/flow of his pieces are a fucking train wreck. It's just that he can put out a lot of it at regular intervals, and it's practically already been digested once, so it never actually stresses your average reader with anything like romantic tension or conflict.

Robst is a bad author, but most people don't actually care about that, hence Dan Brown's popularity in certain circles. It's like pop music. Most people don't care that pop music reuses the same four chords to produce its signature sound. Pop music is incredibly popular, go figure. It doesn't generally try to challenge anyone's sensibilities, appeals to very basic/universal concepts, and usually makes people 'feel good'. Its popularity and ubiquitous nature produces conformity, and produces a sort of positive feedback effect. This is the same with Robst, where people insist that he's 'not a bad author' and put his crap on recommended reading lists, and so he becomes more popular, despite his writing being demonstrably terrible.

Incidentally, wasn't In This World And The Next the one where 'Harry' and 'Hermione' deliver 'justice' to the Weasley family for grievances in an alternate timeline? Robst's stuff is full of these petty and often violent revenge fantasies, of the sort a teenager might concoct without considering the consequences. I suspect that this is because a large subsection of the fanfiction population are either too young or too lacking in empathy to understand morality outside of a black/white context. If someone wrongs the Potters, they are generally willing to do just about anything in return, with little consideration of morals. So... there are legitimately a large portion people who don't see anything wrong with the above, and they're /not/ sociopaths, medically speaking. They just... don't think about it enough to see the blood-drenched elephant in the room. I doubt Robst sees it himself. He never did strike me as much of a philosopher.

** Because he's the McDonald's of fanfiction. Robst is a brand that guarantees frictionless, feel good romance, antagonist bashing and wish fulfillment. Ultimately little substance or style, but that's never been a prerequisite for popularity
