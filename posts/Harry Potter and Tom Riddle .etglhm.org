No, i don't want a Slash fanfic.\\
What im searchin is some fics where Harry and Tom shares a friendship/brotherly or even mentor and apprentice relationship (But has to be some emotion between them, like theyy care for one other)\\
I want Tom Riddle as he is in the diary, charming, smart and cunning, and not how he became as Voldemort, i'know (God complex, mad, twisted)\\
He can be the sabe tom that displeases Muggles or does't care about killing to get what he wants, but i want him to be more like the one in the diary.\\
-No Slash or Fem Harry.\\
-I would preffer something a bit long (It would be wonderful if you guys have something completed, and yes i've already read prince of the dark kingdom)

BONUS: I would like very much if there's some focus on their parselmouth hability, just like, using to tank to one another, or amusing interaction with Nagini or other snakes.


** The unwinding golden thread has a bunch of what you are looking for. Harry Potter accidentally time travels to the 40s. Harry unintentionally changes a bunch of things and these changes cause him to eventually form a close non-romantic relationship with Tom.

  Trying to protect the Philosopher's Stone, Harry is kidnapped by Voldemort, who uses Legilimency on him and learns that he is a Horcrux. After that, Harry is forced to learn how to survive the violent and surreal reality of Voldemort's everyday life, and try his best to make it back to Hogwarts in one piece. Simultaneously, a war looms on the horizon. Grey!Harry Sane!Voldemort

#+begin_quote
  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

** *Lily's Changes* linkffn(6992471)

It starts as a adversarial accomplices, then accomplices, and then it moves up to equals with mentor vibes. There's a big difference between Voldemort and Tom Riddle, and this fic goes into this. I think it was the horcruxes doing it, the more there are, the higher his instability is. They fix this. This fic does throw Dumbledore under the bus though.

H/Hr/L, but it isn't part of the focus. Mainly the final chapter/epilogue stuff.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
