Same as what title says. For stories that delve into warfare (for lots of them) involving potentially very lethal attacks, everything seems so... clean cut. Maybe I just haven't found/read those stories, but where are the 'Muggle'-inspired torture sessions where instead of using the Cruciatus Curse or such you use spells to break people's kneecaps or rip off their fingers (not fingernails, the whole fingers) or putting a small object enchanted with a latent Blasting Curse up someone's arse (for the more passionate)?

I mean, the Cruciatus Curse is all well and good, but what's scarier? Being hit by red lightning bolts that cause pain or being held by your feet above a pit full of raging and hungry Inferi? Because, unless you deal with complete fanatics like Crouch Jr. and Bellatrix, the psychological side of torture is just as important, if not more so, than the physical one and when you deal with radicals whose whole ideology focuses around blood it's important that you show you don't care if you happen to senselessly make their sacrosanct blood flow. After all, it's not yours.


** I mean, what's worse? Excruciating pain at the hands of a wizard who has disarmed you of your wand, your most precious possession, using a curse whose use is unforgivable or less excruciating pain at the hands of inferi? I'd take the option with less pain myself, especially if I was an experienced death eater or order member.

Given how unreliable torture is anyway, I'd rather see some realistic interrogations based on establishing rapport. Or, veritaserum, legilimency, and rapport.

With torture, you've got a lot of uncertainties. Do they even know the information I'm seeking? Are they telling me the truth? Should I torture more to make sure they're telling me the truth? Is there a way to independently confirm the truth that I've obtained from duress, though it's unlikely given the point of interrogation? Are they going to die before they tell me the truth? Will they go insane? Will they go into shock if I continue to torture them? Torture is uncertain. Sure, you might succeed with untrained people of low value, but those people are probably going to break from the threat of torture anyway and probably won't have important information.

Then you have the ethical concerns, which many may ignore, but in the Harry Potter universe, there may certainly be actual ramifications for them. Killing damages the soul, dementors cause despair and depression foments them, happiness can power spells, sadness can result in the loss of magical powers, and many other examples. What's to say that torturing someone won't have consequences? It may be up to the author in the end, but I think it may be a more creative and original take to have more realistic interrogations. I don't doubt that torture may work for someone like Voldemort who can use legilimency, but for people like Harry? He needs other methods.

** Torture can get you false confessions, but not good information.

Trained ones will pick a story and stick with it.

Untrained ones will just tell you what you want to hear.

Luckily, Wizarding world does have Veritaserum and Legilimency. So the solution is fairly simple: some Muggle torture first (reversible with magic and repeatable!) to destabilize the victim, followed by Veritaserum and/or Legilimency.

There are of course many proven Muggle ways for interrogation:

- Repeat questions to identify inconsistencies
- Interrogate prisoners separately to see whether their stories match
- Identify weak willed enemies, or in our case, Wormtails

I have to admit that memory charms are a big problem. It will take experience and effort to overcome these.

*** Voldemort uses Legilimency and the Cruciatus on Grindelwald to get him to break. I've always thought Scrimgeour Obliviated himself when confronted by Voldemort, because if Voldemort can get information from Grindelwald then he can from Scrimgeour as well.

** Torture is completely useless. A tortured person will tell you what you want to hear to make it stop, even if they're completely innocent. False confessions are a real problem irl as well, doubly so because most police forces try to coax one from anyone they have, even if they know the person is innocent.

That doesn't even go into detail of innocent people tortured for no reason. No, I don't like it. Especially because the WW has ways of extracting information without pain.

** Truthfully it depends on how effective the cruciatus is in the story. In canon it was enough to permanently damage Nevilles parents, so I can see the threat of it being enough to break weaker people

** Just remember it's one of three unforgivable curses, sure it's easy to think it's not that big of a deal when every dark wizard throws it around and even Harry throws it around once, it's still one of the most painful ways to hurt someone in the wizarding world. A lot of things can be healed in the wizarding world. True torture in the wizarding world would be doing things that can't be reversed.

To answer the main question, I don't mind reading it in stories.

** I've always felt like Voldemort showed very little spell diversity for a supposed master of the dark arts. So I do think more gory violence has a place in fanfiction, as long as it doesn't take away from the plot. Can't think of any of the top of my head, but there are stories I read that had a good momentum the first 10 or so chapters and then spend the following 8 or so dealing with the angst of being tortured. I get that there are plenty of people that do like going down that rabbit hole, but I'm much rather prefer stories that don't needlessly drag on. The author acknowledges that it happend to someone like Tonks, readers hate villains all the more, story continues.

** One of my most favourite fanfictions covers some of this, but not telling how it happened, only how the victim is being treated afterwards. And I think the mentioned violence is necessary for character development, also it is only mentioned in the context of healing. linkffn(7413926)

  AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold. Complete.
