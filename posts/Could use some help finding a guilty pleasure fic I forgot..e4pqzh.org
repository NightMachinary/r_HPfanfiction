#+begin_quote
  The Semiclassic 'everyone has been lying to Harry about everything' plot. Very AU. Bashing of pretty much everyone. Mind Control Sex. Language. Dumbledore decides the Old Families won't tolerate the Chosen One being with a mudblood. Sucks to be Ron Ginny

**** (cc [[/u/SwiftNinja99]]) it was a Game of Thrones reference - what happened in the OP is basically what Tywin (or Jamie?) did to Tyrion.

***** Except, it was all a lie and Dumbledore just said that she was a whore when she actually wasn't.

So not whenever Tom meets anyone new, he asks them "Where do whores go?"

** Not the same fic, but that reminds me of a very similar one where Dumbledore was manipulating Tom into being a sacrificial "Harry" to fight Grindlewald before he swooped in and saved the day. The girl was another Hogwarts student/graduate and Tom killed her after overhearing her ask Dumbledore how much longer she had to pretend.
