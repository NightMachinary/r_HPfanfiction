This idea has been stewing in my head for a while and was wondering if anyone has found or written anything like this.

Themes like "high fantasy, low life," a magical world that is revealed as increasingly dystopic, Voldemort's power grab revealed as a struggle to find meaning in a magical world drained of the "magic", pure blood megacorporations controlling everything the goblins don't, etc.

Just curious what is out there


** Have you heard of Shadowrun?

****** Can confirm, I've finished all three and it's an almost perfect blend of fantasy and science fiction with cyberpunk tones all over. Shadowrun: Dragonfall is especially good, with great characters and an interesting plot.

** I believe the term you are looking for is Arcanapunk. As others have already mentioned shadowrun, you might also be interested in the Eberron setting for D&D. Not as grimey as classic cyberpunk but has some rather interesting takes on widespread magic and racial characteristics (orcs are THE druidic culture, gnomes are spies and assassins par excellence, there are halfling clans that ride on dinosaurs etc.)
