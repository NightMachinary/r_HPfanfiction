The year is almost over now, and I've been reading fics throughout the whole of 2016. I'm not only reading HP, but I thought I would ask you all here since this is the community is where I have previously spend a bit of time.

2016 has been a bit slow in terms of HP fanfics, hasn't it? I only added 11 new fics to my following list for the entire year, and only 7 of those are actually published this year.

Perhaps I have become more critical of what I read, perhaps the quality has been in a sharp decline, or maybe I just haven't found the gems out there. Unfortunately reading the top fics of 2016 thread has not helped me found any new fics that I want to read.

My new pet peeves include:

- Caps lock.

When an author wants their character to shout something, an unfortunate number of authors tend to use caps. When this happens I skim through the chapter to see how much is in all caps, and then tend to abandon the story if the amount is too big.

- Teenagers acting like adults

I know you want to write about a capable protagonist, but there are limits. Teenagers try to act like adults all the time, and in many of the stories they actually face adult problems. The thing is... they really should stumble, and not breeze through everything. They haven't made the mistakes or received the advice that make normal people avoid certain traps in how to act. Teenagers tend to face the problem head on, which is a typical problem for Harry, and not calmly analyse the issue and act around that. In many fics the people who tend to act like teens are the one being constantly bashed for not being as great as the protagonist and his/her posse. Where did he gain the life experience that lets him know how to handle his wealth, responsibilities etc?

- Nobody else having tried something the author finds self-obvious

This is especially a problem in some wandless scenarios. Either it is really damn difficult and your protagonist shouldn't be able to do more than cantrips without a miracle and decades of experience. There are witches and wizards all over the world trying this, especially as children - it can't be so simple your protagonist is the only one who has figured it out, especially if he or she can teach it to others.

So, what about you guys? Any new pet peeves? Or maybe you changed the type of stories that you read? In that case, why?

Prime example: Harry is friendly to a goblin, knows/learns a few of their sayings, and suddenly is Goblin Friend #1.

Doesn't he think that 1000s of Muggleborns before him attempted that?

** My number 1 pet peeve becomes slavish canon rehash, more so in time travels. That's my primary reason why I soured on my former favorite "Backward with Purpose: Always and Always", linkffn(4101650).

The "Innocent Series" by marauderlover7, linkffn(9469064), starts out fairly well, but the author still forces the plot back to the TWT canon rail. I mean why? Why couldn't they develop some original plots?

"Lady Archimedes", linkffn(11463030), is written by one of my favorite authors, White Squirrel. This story develops a super Hermione, and yet the author always forces the plot back to canon rail. It's very frustrating for me. [[/spoiler][For example, the DoM battle played out differently than in canon and Hermione really shined. Voldemort knew this, and for some unknown reasons, didn't target Hermione, and still tried to go after Amelia Bones and Emmeline Vance as in canon. Why?]]

--------------

The CoS event is a major example why sticking to canon is a bad idea. In canon, only through shear luck wasn't anyone killed. Also, if either Ginny and Harry had slightly more common sense, they would tell another adult about the Diary. Furthermore, if Arthur Weasley didn't get the Muggle Protection Act passed and tried to nail Lucius Malfoy, Malfoy had no reason to give away his Lord's precious item. Suppose any of those conditions had changed, things would play out very differently. Nowadays, Year 2 is my litmus test for how much canon rehash an author wants. I highly value fics that try to develop original plots for that year, some of the examples are:

"Applied Cultural Anthropology, or", linkffn(9238861)

"Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance", linkffn(10991501)

"Unspeakable Things", linkffn(6473434)

"Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past", linkffn(9932798)

--------------

Then there is the famous 'mandatory' TWT, Moody-impersonation, graveyard resurrection plot. A few days ago, I asked for completed fics that begin in early Hogwarts years, but do not have that particular plot rail in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5kb91z/rant_and_request_looking_for_fics_that_begin_in/][this thread]]. The result is quite disappointing.

I don't like the Book Moody impersonation plot at all. Only through an insane amount of luck did Barty Jr escape detection. Regardless how many questions Barty Jr could ask Moody, it would be very difficult for Barty Jr to cover all venues of potential security questions. The risk of being uncovered and the consequence of such a failure was unacceptably high. A far better solution would be to impersonate his dad, who could both get to the Goblet and have direct access to important Ministry officials. In addition, no other people knew his dad better than him, and he got to fool the Marauder's Map!

Unfortunately, VAST MAJORITY of fics that cover Year 4 still went along with the canon plot. Even more infuriating is the fact that many fics developed a super!powerful!smart!Harry in the first four years, only to have him still falling to Wormtail's stunner in the Graveyard.

*** I agree with your point that authors tend to stick to canon even though the plot should have definitely diverged through a plot altering event. E.g. Harry not being raised by the Dursleys. This would change the plot entirely as Harry's personality would be vastly different depending on who raised him. This would then lead to Harry being sorted into a different house and having different friends. If harry is sorted into a different house he doesn't become friends with Ron and Hermione. He also doesn't join the quidditch team in his first year because he doesn't have the confrontation with Malfoy. A lot more things would diverge because of these instances yet somehow authors still have him friends with Hermione, join the quidditch team etc etc. It's really infuriating because a lot of authors have good idea's that could completely change the plot yet they are so hell bent on keeping it canon compliant.

*** Yeah, I hate that in all the time-travel re-dos Harry is so scared of /changing the timeline/.

Knowledge of the timeline isn't really needed to get out safely. You have perfect knowledge of the state of things /right now/, so use it. Talk to Dumbledore, tell him you're 35, put in a litte bit of proof, or to Lupin if we have an evil!Dumbledore for some stupid reason.

Take a few smart people, get the Horcrux in the shack and then blast it away. Dumbledore never dies. Make sure Voldy never gets resurrected (or does so later) because a few more years of peace are nice. The diary: Either take it from Ginny in Diagon Alley, or in Hogwarts and then take the secret passage out and apparate over to Gringotts and put it in your vault. Take the Diadem with you when you're on it. Or better yet, hide it in the chamber, Ginny can't reach that while not possessed and if you're friendly to the basilik it'll help you destory the Horcrux, or else accio a rooster. Then you can destroy it easily.

But letting a Basilisk loose is a bad idea, generally.

I think this is the perfect example of our different approaches to the HP books. You seem to /want/ there to be problems with canon - you take joy in finding what you believe to be failings and errors and do not seek out any kind of way to explain those apparent failings, instead being satisfied with your cleverness in having found what you believe to be a problem.

Case in point: we are repeatedly told that Hogwarts is a very safe place. Snape, in OotP, explicitly tells us:

#+begin_quote
  the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them
#+end_quote

Yet despite those clear statements, when you are presented with a series of events within Hogwarts that indicates that its inhabitants are receiving less harm from situations than would normally be the case, your reaction is not "there is something magical causing it" but rather "Aha! Look how badly this has been written! Everything is just luck!"

It seems to me to be a rather sad approach, seeking to destroy and tear down rather than to find ways to elegantly tie everything together in a manner that is constructive and consistent.

I guess for me it's the difference between showing and telling. It's all fine and dandy to tell me that Hogwarts is safe. But I won't believe you if the next book involves a murder plot at your super safe school.

The world of Harry Potter is new (or at least was when I first read the books), and I need something to base what I consider "normal" on, and a few lines about how safe Hogwarts /should/ be aren't enough.

This happens also a lot of complaints I have about stories in general (not just canon). Characters in my mind are characterized about what I see him do. [[https://youtu.be/9rleGD8gGd4?t=2m30s][It's like the CinemaSins comment on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone]]:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione: Harry, you're a great wizard.\\
  Cinema Sins Guy: Listen, if Harry's such a great wizard he would have performed at least one spell this movie.
#+end_quote

EDIT: Also, it doesn't matter if it's ancient spells or sheer dumb luck that save the protagonists, it feels like a cop out. Coming up with an explanation to a deus ex machina doesn't suddenly make it go away; that explanation needs to be integrated into the storyline. If it was ancient magic that saved the day, it would be cool to see this incorporated into other scenarios.

The whole plot point around Lily's blood protection went from Harry being saved by luck to a major part of the series that was incorporated into both Dumbledore and Voldemort's future plans. That in my opinion is an example of what would be a "cop-out" nicely integrated into the story and world.

**** Hogwarts safe? Gimme a break!

Year 1: Headmaster used the school as a battleground to lure the worst Dark Lord in centuries amid hundreds of students/children.

Year 2: One extreme dark artifact escaped detection and was possessing a student, unleashing a super monster that could kill with one look. Can you imagine how many would have died if this thing got into the Great Hall during a feast? Current headmaster knew the monster already killed one student 50 years ago, knew that student's ghost was haunting a bathroom, and knew another student was being framed for the murder. But that headmaster didn't bother ask the ghost what killed her and where the monster came from, and he didn't bother to clear the other student's name. 50 years later, attacks began anew, and all teachers were running around baffled until one 13 years old solved the mystery in an entry level creature book. Safest school? LMFAO!

Year 3: Crazy Ministry posted soul sucking monsters around the school to catch one prison escapee. Nobody asked the question if that escapee was able to escape in the first place from those monsters undetected, what were the odds those monsters could detect him again? Animagi also severely comprised school safety this year.

Year 4: DADA teacher, one of Headmaster's best friends, was captured and impersonated by a Death Eater. The school apparently had no protocols against polyjuice, imperius, and dark artifacts. Safest school?

Year 5: Ministry minion Umbridge was torturing students, enough said.

Year 6: Headmaster willingly let a Death Eater carry out acts of murder and sabotage. He repeatedly rejected warnings from a concerned student. Two other students were almost killed. If that 'concerned student' didn't take precautions on that particular day, could you imagine what would happen if Fenrir Greyback got into student dorms?

Year 7: The entire school was turned into a torture camp.

Hogwarts was a safe school? Its record spoke a different story.

*** What's wrong with sticking to canon when it's actually relevant. Moody was impersonated successfully for an entire school year. End of IMO. I will agree that Super! Harry is somewhat garbage but I honestly think that your experience with the books or maybe FF is limited.

** I used to be really into bashing stories when I first started reading HP fanfiction a few years ago. Not even because I really disliked the characters to that extent. It was just because I thought of it as another genre. I very rarely read them now because they usually go overboard, but now they're kind of a guilty pleasure for me.

** I've come to get a bit annoyed by Slytherin!Harry. I don't mind it, but seeing it over and over again is a bit tiring. It's starting to seem like a chance for people to bash the Weasleys and Dumbledore.

The hat said Harry would do well in Slytherin. That Slytherin would lead him to greatness or whatever. Why does everyone assume this means he was secretly meant to be in Slytherin? Slytherin is mostly the house of ambition and cunning, right? Well, maybe the hat was just saying that Harry would learn to be an ambitious person in Slytherin, which would lead him to the so-called-"greatness". Maybe it was just a test. What better way to gauge if someone is truly an ambitious person than to tease them with the chance for "greatness"? A huge theme in the books is that your choices make who you are. Harry /chose/ to be in Gryffindor for a reason. He never wanted "greatness". He always wanted to be an average dude who happily moseys along through life, even before Hogwarts.

I don't know. I'm all for changing the house he's in, and even his personality if it makes sense. I just wish there were less stories where he's all angsty and dark and completely out of character for seemingly no reason.

Wait a minute.

Didn't the hat ask Harry about Slytherin because he specifically said he didn't want to go there? Like, the hat said, "What house should I put you?" and Harry kept repeating, "Not Slytherin!" and then the hat tried to ask why? Because if that's the case maybe the hat wouldn't have even put him in Slytherin. Gah, whatever it doesn't matter. I'm just rambling at this point.

*** I believe Harry said no to Slytherin because of Malfoy, and Hagrid and Ron's subtle bias against the House.

Gryffindor is the only House for canon Harry, because he's not cunning or ambitious, he's not hard working(he is mostly loyal), and he doesn't care about learning. Harry went to Gryffindor because it was the only one left.

*** Where are you finding these Slytherin Harry fics? I've only read at most 10 Slytherin Harry Fics. Around 2 or 3 Hufflepuff Harry, and maybe 20 or less Ravenclaw Harrys :(

** I used to not like "teenagers acting like adults." After some soul searching, and reading various fics with more realistic teenagers and children, I have concluded I give zero fucks.

Harry speaking formally (and archaic) while lecturing the Wizengamot is preferable to hearing teenage girls make constant genital jokes (thanks, Taure).

As for preferences, having been battered with politics all year, I am no longer able to tolerate biased authors coloring their writing. This year, I found in particular Lady Khali's "Well Groomed Mind", and Starfox's various works, especially distasteful. While I do not have anything against political fics, I think, unless you are writing a manifesto, it is the duty of the author to not let your own views color those of the characters.

I tried to read Well Groomed Mind a few weeks ago and I almost had a conniption when Harry started lecturing Dumbledore about quoting Jeremy Bentham and how utterly awful the ideology is and blah blah blah muggles see through this horrible thought and how dare you value the greater happiness over individual happiness you bigoted neo-nazi grindelwald wannabe - Sorry about that.

tl;dr: if you want to have political undertones in your fic, I don't want you siding with one of them. I think every Slytherin Malfoy friendly Harry story is written by a hobbyist Klan member frothing whenever he's forced to write down the cursed "mudblood" word... but the other side is just as bad. If you want to deal with a topic as vast, deep, and important, as ideologies and politics, you're going to have to do it properly. If one side is just a puppet for you to bask in your superiority over: [[/r/politics]] is that way -->

For a pet peeve: looking at the top fics published this year, there's a lot of Fleur. Lungs on DLP said this three years ago:

- Harry/Fleur: *THE SHIP. THAT NEVER. SAILED.*

If you can't write romance, don't write shipping. If you are only decent at romance, don't pick the most unlikely pairing in the whole fandom. Blaise's mom is more likely! (thanks again, Lungs!)

Looking further on the list of new fics, I must ask this one thing: Fuck off with your idiotic "gamer" fics. This concept is possibly the worst one yet. Having the characters read the books while making crappy jokes? Preferable to this.

What else? I don't want to think about it. Maybe 2017 will be better. Sadly, J.K is seemingly trying to necro the franchise, which will infuse the fandom with new blood: more tropes and more shit. While the wealth of fics we have is kinda nice, I'd much prefer not having to wade through 98% of Robst quality shit to find readable ones.

Worm may not have a lot of fics, but at least the majority is readable. Thanks a lot, teenage girls.

**** Eh, you know. JKR set Voldemort and his goons up as bad guys. There's not a single redeemable thing in their entire ideology. That's strange, because I can think of no other ideology like that.

Oh wait.

I remember now. JKR started writing children's books, and transferred into YA. Neither of these genres are known to have interesting and realistic villains.

I suppose if a fanfic writer sets out to do the same, having mockeries of bad guys could be acceptable. Even then, it feels cheap. No work of fiction was ever weakened because it had fleshed out villains. The same goes of fanfiction.

***** You don't need to try and make racism and bigotry less revulsive and evil than they actually are to have a fleshed out villain - that's what other parts of a character are for. Love for their family, honour according to their ideals, wit and charm, understandable motivations (loyalty, fear, revenge), greed, and so on.

For example, "Divided and Entwined" has two POV characters joining the Death Eaters during the story, but not because they think all muggleborns must die. Both are driven by circumstances, and a few bad decisions - as well as understandable fears of being killed by the other side. In the same vein, the "good guys" are on a slippery slope, since no matter their ideals, the means they are using, and the mere fact that they are in a nasty civil war, will cause them to consider or even commit questionable actions.
