#+TITLE: Need help remembering a fan fic. It had a original female main character, she went to a wizarding school in America, and the plot was completely separate from canon HP (it just existed within the same universe).

I seem to remember it being a very popular fic.


** Is it the Alexandra Quick series? I've never read it but it seems like it from your description.

** Last I had heard A-Quick was still in limbo. Can't blame the author for other stuff she's got going on- as much as we all want the series finished, it happens and I'm grateful she gave us a damn good series as it is.

Her last update on A-Quick was nearly a year ago, and she just doesn't seem to be writing much. I did like her other fanfiction work, Hogwarts Houses Divided.
