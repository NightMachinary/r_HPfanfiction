Hello :)

So I recently read Song of the Trees by Tinn Tam ([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees]]). The premise of the story is that Harry is pretty messed up after the war (which doesn't follow DH) and there's something really strange going on with the Forbidden Forest that only he can seem to notice. It's written really well and the author manages to create a lot of suspense and "shivers down the back of your neck"-esque feelings.

Anyway I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for stories with a similar style (thriller/mystery)?


** Tough call, as Tinn's story is one of the best. The closest I can think of is a haunting story by Ella (Deadwoodpecker) that appears to have been taken down, unfortunately. Pity.

A thriller/mystery that you might enjoy is C. K. Talons's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1312532/1/The-Human-Condition][The Human Condition]]?

*** Ooh sounds interesting, I'll check it out :) Thanks! Don't really have the time to slog through the mountain of shite to find the good stuff any more, not that I'm a better writer or anything!

**** C. K. Talons's story is quite old, but is very nicely done in my opinion. Hope you enjoy!
