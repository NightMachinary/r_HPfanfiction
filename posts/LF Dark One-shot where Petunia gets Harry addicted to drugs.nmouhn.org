I read this a long time ago and can't find it now. Harry is like 5-7 years old in this fanfiction and I think the horcrux has corrupted him along with his addiction to drugs. Petunia is also addicted to drugs and divorced from Vernon. She has a boyfriend that ends up killing his side piece and Harry helps him hide the body.

Eventually Dumbledore and Snape find Harry and takes him from Petunia to Hogwarts for medical attention. Harry is happy despite the trauma because Petunia will always belong to him or something. Very dark and creepy Harry.
