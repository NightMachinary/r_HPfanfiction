I've read tons of Harry/Hermione fanfiction but they've always bashed Ron and the other Weasleys. I would really like to read a story where Ron has a different love interest (preferably Luna) so he doesn't care that Harry/Hermione get together and isn't bashed because of it. I also like Ginny/Neville but that's not a requirement just a side ship I wouldn't mind reading about too. Thanks.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Eventual slow Harry/Hermione and Ron/Luna in the background, but before that there's several other pairings including Harry/Ginny and a few others. Not much bashing, although Voldemort is a bit less effective than in canon but he's not the main villain anyway, Lucius Malfoy and Barty Crouch Jr. are competent and continue causing trouble for the new aurors Potter and Weasley long after Voldemort is gone. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore are all powerful and competent.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
