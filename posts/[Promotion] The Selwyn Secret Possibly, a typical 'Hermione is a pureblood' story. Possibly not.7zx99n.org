It's for you to decide! In my shamelessly unhumble opinion, it features a decent backstory, a mystery surrounding her heritage, and a very pragmatic Lord Voldemort (when he appears, that is). Starts after year two, as Hermione discovers who she is, but is forced to keep her identity a secret.

Edit: Hermione is forced to live with the Malfoys, whilst keeping her own pureblooded nature hidden. Story focuses on the clashing idelogies that led to the first War, with a little bit of romance mixed in.


** I think that has the worst summary I've ever seen. That would put me off even if the premise appealed.

*** Yup. I'd just assume that it's yet another Hermione Lestrange story and then scroll on.

**** Yeah... wow, the summary really needs work. If you want to grab people's attention, don't make it a joke. It sounds like a parody.

***** Wait is it not a parody? That summary 100% implies it is a parody fic poking fun at the cliches involved in the Hermione is a pureblood genre.

****** Nope, not a parody! The summary's a more a lighthearted jab; obviously, missed the mark for some.

I know identity is a harshly debated topic, but I will never understand how new knowledge of one's heritage would change one's identity. *Nothing has changed about you, you dingus!*

*** Don't confuse several meanings of "identity". I think this is "identity" as in "who you legally are, official names and genealogical data and stuff", not "identity" as in "the kind of person you identify as".
