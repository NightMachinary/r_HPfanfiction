I'm looking for fics where harry or any other person from the harry potter universe is thrown into the walking dead universe, I don't care if its slash but I'd rather it wasnt and if it is slash it's not 90% sex scenes. I've read a few that I could find and my favourites were;

Master of the Walking Dead On Whom the Pale Moon Gleams. Walking Dead Wizard I'm not 100% sure if these are the correct fics as I take random links and put them in a folder to read later when I'm bored But if they are then these were the ones I fully enjoyed and I fully recommend them to anyone who hasnt read them even if slash isnt your thing. Idk if people will actually see this tbh HP is kinda old now but eh. hobby.. Thanks for your opinions and I will make sure to read every fic posted in reply.

:EDIT I forgot to put that I will read even books that do the same but just add zombies into the HP universe etc. It doesn't need to be specifically WD


** its not twd but zombies

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire.

** Unrelated but I'd love to see Umbridge in the Walking Dead universe. Like I've never really watched the show but the idea of her becoming the lord tyrant cult leader over a village of filthy muggle slaves in the midst of the apocalypse just appeals to me for some reason.

*** I'd recommend you watch the show then read the books i put if you are up to it. Atleast watch up to S5 EP 5 which is where I am at currently and there is no spoilers in the three books from there.
