Hey guys, It's really starting to bug me but i can't think of the name of this story of Harry/Hermione resisting each other love for each other because they both have kids. It's Epilogue compliant, Ginny works for the daily prophet. I think ron is with a qudditch team.

It would be such a huge favour if someone could find it for me. It's been bugging me a lot recently. I forgot to follow the story so i have no idea if there has been any updates to the story.

** I wrote one similar to what you're describing, though it's probably not the one.

  Through a series of snapshots from the eyes of Harry Potter, this is the story of his journey through life with the woman he loves. Harry is with Ginny, Ron with Hermione as the Wizarding Community expected. Still, Harry and Hermione have always shared a special bond. How far will this take them? H/Hr - Epilogue Compliant

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

*** Is it any good? I may not be reading anyway because the premise sounds retarded, but I've seen this rec'd by harmonians dozens of times and I am curious.

**** Eh, I liked it all right. It's an interesting case being Harry/Hr, and Ron and Ginny definitely are flawed, but it's not bashing. Everyone's human, no one's perfect. Some pretty decent smut, if I remember correctly? It's been a while. The actual plot is kind of lame, read it for the character interactions.

I could be kinda off on all of this, as it was quite a while ago that I read it.

***** Thanks, Newcomb. I'll put it on my reading list, though /Delenda Est/ and St Margarets's stuff get higher priority.

Do you know any other good H/Hr? I notice the pairing didn't get much love on your favorites list. The only one I liked was book 1 of /Paradigm of Uncertainty/, but I admit I'm not well read when it comes to the pairing. No bashing, please.

****** Yeah, off the top of my head I can't think of many. I like the idea in theory, but I haven't seen the execution much. I tend to like it when they have a strong bond like they did in canon - like in Stages of Hope.
