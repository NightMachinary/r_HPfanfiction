Looking for completed or regularly updated fic in which harry learns about the ancient houses and joins the wizengamot after the war


** *Novocaine* linkffn(13022013)

No bashing, addresses the pink elephants in the room: canon pairings, and ends them in a BELIEVABLE way.

Harry teams up with a group of people to put the Potter money towards rebuilding Magical Britain. Has Politics, Economics, Wizengamot meetings/hearings, "traditions", and a bunch of other stuff.
