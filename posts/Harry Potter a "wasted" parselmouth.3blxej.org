In canon and in most fanfiction (that aren't built around the concept) one of Harry's most amazing magical ability is often forgotten.\\
Any normal person would have at least shown some curiosity in a completely different species you can talk to but Harry never does, why?


** What do you envision him doing with this ability? I guess I can see him ordering snakes to spy on or bite people he doesn't like, but I don't know how effective that would be in practice. (He has no shortage of spying tools available to him, and wizards are more resilient than muggles, anyway.)

I guess he could have tried to command the basilisk, which would have been something.

**** In the books, is there anywhere he or Voldie actually converses with a snake? I know he talks at the snake in the zoo, and gives an order to the conjured on in CoS, but do the snakes in the books actually show intelligence and talk back like a human (or at least a human from a very different culture)?

***** No, that's the point, why he doesn't he? He definitely has a conversation with the Zoo snake, and the talk Voldemort has with Nagini at the beginning of GoF might also count.

*** let's say you find out that you can talk to hamsters:\\
the first time you talk to one is an accident, you don't give it much thought (why the hell not I have no idea, but let's say children be children).\\
The second time you do it you find out it's an incredibly rare talent; you are a Hamstertongue, the first in decades. what do you do?\\
"Proceed to ignore Hamsters as a species for the next 6 years" it's not really the first answer I would expect...

** Agreed, though honestly I have come up largely short on what use he could put it too. Maybe passwords in an unknown language would be good security- except from Ron :P

On the flip side however I roll my eyes when Harry, usually in Slytherin, gets a snake familiar and then grandstands and says 'if any of you mess with me she will bite you and kill you!'. And all the people were cowed and wept bitterly at their ruin. When all I can think is a school teaching magic might offer those other students the means to say levitate it, burn, cut it, vanish it etc. I somehow doubt it requires the combined efforts of several trained wizards to put one down like a dragon.

*** The "except from Ron" thing makes me frown, if a dunderhead like Ron managed to learn the word for "open" then it's possible to learn the meaning to each and every word in parseltongue and doesn't that make it like any other language in the world? where does the genetic of it come into play?

**** I think Dumbledore can understand parseltongue, probably through his research. Maybe just not speak it.

And Ron had been shown mimicking voices before he got into the CoS. Might've taken him awhile but with having heard it so recently he may have been able to guess it correctly.

Or maybe he insulted the stone snake's mother and it opened up. :p

** I'm not afraid of snakes, but I wouldn't go actively searching for them even if I could talk to them. That is, assuming that a snake would have anything useful or interesting to say...reminds me of the book *The Knife of Never Letting Go* by Patrick Ness.

**** I can only speak for myself, but I don't stumble across snakes very often. Or often at all. It makes sense that he would put it out of his mind or forget about it. Finding out he was a wizard probably overshadowed it and he may have assumed every witch/wizard could do it.

****** Meh, not to an 11 or 12 year old though. Being able to make things fly and stuff like that seems much cooler to an adolescent like Harry. And afterwards, one thing that Harry hates is being different, so of course he didn't pursue it further. Really the only notable thing about Parselmouths is that they are rare. The only reason others care is because they are associated with dark wizards.

**** It wasn't special in anyway. Until the dueling club incident, he had no idea that it wasn't just something that wizards could do. In the aftermath, when Ron is explaining things to him, he makes it pretty clear that he thought everybody could do it.

Also, in the grand scheme of things, its a pretty unimpressive power even if everybody else can do it. Harry was like 10-12 in the time before he knew about the stigma. In this time, he learns about the entire wizarding world. Basically, he had other stuff going on, and in all likelihood forgot he could do it (or at the very least didn't mention it because he thought everybody else could as well).

Isn't that pretty much what being a parselmouth means?

He does it with the snake at the zoo before he even knows he's a wizard - and seems to do well enough.
