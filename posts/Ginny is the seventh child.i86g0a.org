So Ginny is the first girl in several generations in the Weasley family and is the seventh child in her family. I feel like that's something that should be acknowledged as pretty big considering the significance of the number seven both in universe and irl legends. I'm looking for any fics where this comes into play, even if they aren't Ginny-centric, like maybe there's another prophecy pointing towards her or she's more powerful than she would otherwise be (it'd be really cool if she had a lot of trouble controlling her magical power). Thanks so much if you find something!


** It comes up and is discussed in the fic /The Odds Were Never In My Favor./ It's somewhat important to the plot so I won't spoil it by explaining the exact circumstances, but it comes into play with the whole CoS debacle.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** It comes up in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance trilogy by GreenGecko]] though not until the third part of the trilogy, I think. Harry visits another dimension and teaches the Ginny there a bit and she has a prophecy about her also.

  The first of three stories about what happens when the seventh child of a pureblood family asks for and will be granted anything they want. Read what Harry Potter does when that seventh child forces him into marriage. Warning: slash, Harry/Charlie. Hermione, and Weasley bashing apart from Charlie. Now a one shot.
