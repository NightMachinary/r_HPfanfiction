Just Harry going after people like Malfoy or Umbridge or Voldemort, dredging up every despicable, pitiable, deplorable thing he can, laying all their faults out before them in a timeline of depressing mediocrity. These people decided they'd [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie][Break the Cutie]] and a previously calm or stoic Harry reaches his [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint][Rage Breaking Point]] and they learn that [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon][Bullying a Dragon]] will never go in your favor.


** The closest I can think of on the spot are [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/cywscross/pseuds/cywscross][cywscross]] stories. Harry tends to be rather well spoken and shoots down people with calm poise. But he doesn't tear Umbridge, Voldemort or Malfoy apart as far as I know...

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] he starts to take his studies seriously after 4th year and gradually learns how to keep calm and verbally backtalk.

Or in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3390668/chapters/7419224][C'est La Vie]] he also showcases calm poise.

(Both are incomplete)

Otherwise....I think wbwl have usually smackdowns you're looking for. Though I don't keep track of them sorry.

*** I mean... not in particular? But if you've got a link I won't say no. I'm just tired of the usual reaction to an insult being indifference or escalation to violence.

** In my story, I have included a scene where Harry tears down McGonagall and other teachers for bringing in a Cerebus inside school full of children.

Not exactly want you are looking for but I tried to make that scene as cool as possible!
