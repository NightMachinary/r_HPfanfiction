*** The Arithmancer has some actual, university level math. I'm learning Eigenvectors in the math lecture and I'm like "wasn't this what Hermione used to construct that curse".

#+begin_quote
  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.

*** The first two parts are at a million words. Are there annoying tropes, like page after page of a character's mental ramblings, or giant diversions into back story? I can handle character deviations from cannon, because that's half the fun of a fan fic, but bashing a character gets tiresome and boring.

**** IIRC it doesn't really bash anyone, though it has awful pacing, and at least up to the fourth book it's mostly a canon rehash from Genius!Hermione's pov.
