  Albus Dumbledore rose to his feet, smiling at them in that way of his, like he knew something you didn't and he was proud of you for it. "Friends," he began.The door thudded open and the Marauders burst in, late and pink-cheeked with cold. The headmaster smiled at them, too, and Sirius gave a cheery little salute back.Severus sunk lower in his chair, staring witheringly over his butterbeer. "You told Potter about it, too?""He might as well put all that energy to good use," said Lily. "And, to be accurate, I told Remus.""But Potter, really?" said Severus."He and Black cooked up a jinx that gives you a boil every time you say a slur to a Muggleborn," said Lily. "It was either invite them to Alice's war club or bake them cookies, and I know where my skills lie."Severus sniffed. "Don't come crying to me if he tugs your pigtails.""Come crying to me if he pulls yours, and I'll deck him," said Lily.(Slight AU in which Severus apologizes, tries harder, and stays friends with Lily)

  Sirius throws a party for Harry's third birthday. And not just any birthday party. Twenty pre-schoolers. Thirty assorted parents, caregivers and other adults. Weasleys, Malfoys, Longbottoms, the Muggles from down the road. Fizzy drink and chocolate cake for the children and elf-made wine for the adults. And the star attraction is Severus Snape. What could possibly go wrong?

** Not sure if it counts, but the first Weasley Girl story has Snape resign at the end, due to several plot-related circumstances... a lot of people say that the fic's too lenient with Snape and he gets away with too much horrible behaviour, but I don't know. It IS kind of funny when Hagrid, of all people, loses his temper with Snape and tells him to grow up. ^_^

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

** linkffn(12481024), assuming you aren't averse to Snily

EDIT: It just occured to me that you were probably looking for Harry Potter-era fics. I was stuck in a Marauder-era mindset, sorry. What can I say, it /does/ technically fulfill your request

  What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

** There's a fanfic called “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12594346/1/Time-Travel-Really][Time Travel! Really?]] ”, it has a time travel f!Harry in Ravenclaw, she does get Snape fired. it's a bit slow paced, but i think it's worth the read!
