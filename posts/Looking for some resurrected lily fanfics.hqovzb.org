Preferably, I'm looking for fics where she is resurrected before 3rd year. I have been reading Nesting Dragons on ao3, and would really like to read some more stories of that type.

  "Lily, you don't understand-""I understand that we unfortunately have different priorities, Albus," Lily interrupted, the fire in her eyes familiar to all who knew her. Familiar, but not the same. The fire had somehow turned very cold."I 'died' for my son," Lily continued, her gaze passing judgment on everyone present. She turned back to the Headmaster. "My son, Harry. Not your Chosen One. Not your Boy-Who-Lived," she spat.

#+begin_quote
  A boy who grew up in a cupboard used to dream that his parents would save him from his miserable life at Privet Drive. But when a man with two faces offered him the chance of a lifetime, he realized that maybe, just maybe, he could actually save his parents, instead. All he had to do was give Quirrell the stone... (Sorcerer's Stone AU, begins during Prisoner of Azkaban)
