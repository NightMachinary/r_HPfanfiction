What are the best fics that you've read in which the summary hasn't done it justice?


** There's an author on AO3 who puts like 5 words in their summary and NO tags, just the relationship. I refuse to read something without tags because I don't like being thrust into topics I don't like (death, BDSM, ABO, etc.) so I have zero idea if their work is any good, but it's the BIGGEST annoyance.

** Antithesis is one of the best fanfics I've ever read. The summary makes it seem like a cliche dark/edgy Harry, but it's so much more than that. The characterization of Harry (or Adrian as his name is changed) is so incredible. It's a WBWL fic where Harry is given away by Lily and James for “his own protection”. Harry ends up getting sent to an orphanage, and then “adopted” by very questionable characters. He grows up in an extremely unhealthy environment and that really affects him as a character. The narration is extremely unreliable because Harry is such a messed up kid, and he sees his brother and parents as enemies. But in general, this can't be considered a story that bashes. All the characters try their best to help him, and are at the most, misguided. I don't know how else to explain this beautiful story without spoilers. It's incredibly emotional, and I guarantee you, you will be crying. From what I remember, it's not a retelling of all 7 years, and it goes off on its own A LOT. Please, please, please give this a try!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed. If you can read up to the sorting chapter, you'll have a good idea of how the story is written and if you like the style or not. It's more than 400k words, and I think I managed it in like a day and a half because I was so invested. Happy reading!!

*** The summary does not do it justice. As a whole, the story is fantastic and does a lot of unique things. I adore the characterization of Lupin in it.

In addition, I don't think it hits its stride for a bit. I'm admittedly picky and tend to quit fics if the writing is poor, but once the author picks up a whole squadron of betas partway through the story, you can see the writing thrive and develop. By end the end it was one of my favorites.

**** It's not like they just throw him away and are horrible to him. Lily and James decide they need to go into hiding and they can't take Harry, because PLOT. But they legit think think that he'll be fine with Petunia, and they actually give him the option of going with Remus or Sirus instead. But he decides to go to the Dursley's because they're muggles and no one would think to find him there. He thinks that it's the best way to keep the rest of his family safe. They don't want to do it, but they feel it's the best way to keep everyone safe. Including Harry and his Brother who is believed to be the BWL.

** About half the fics in my favorites list....

Notable example:

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

This fic is about Sirius and Harry hiding from the entire wizarding world that tries to hunt down the Death Eater Sirius Black, kidnapper of the Boy-Who-Lived, all while trying to figure out what Kreacher's locket really is, and about Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Dumbledore, the Malfoys, etc who all play roles in the search.

The summary mostly talks about the Dursleys, which only appear at the very beginning.

** Linkao3(common sense by Grohiik)

This fic is amazing and nuanced and has some of the best worldbuilding and characterisation I've read in the fandom. It's full of wit and intrigue. It's the kind of adventuresome hero's journey I wished I'd found in canon. The Harry of this story is as kind as he is clever. He uses his clear-sightedness as a way to help even those he doesn't like very much. He's easily the most likeable Harry I've read. He's not OP except through hard won wisdom. He's curious and cunning in ways that are not synonyms for cruelty the way so many Cunning!Harrys are.

The summary, however, makes it sound like some kind of zillion lord Harry fixing the wizarding world with the power of slash, privilege and "The Dark".

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)
