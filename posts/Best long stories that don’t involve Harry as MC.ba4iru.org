As it says, what the best long stories that don't involve Harry as MC? No Snape/Hermione, Dramione or Ronmione. Also no Jily as MC. Hermione doesn't have to be a MC, but let's face it if a fics doesn't involve Harry it will involve Hermione. I've read everything by MaryRoyale and ShayLonnie. I Don't mind time travel, AU etc. would be cool if it was some sort of pureblood culture in it but it's not a must.

Thank you!

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  How could she sit there, looking at all the innocent children she had sworn to protect, when she belonged to the guilty ones? How could she accuse others when she should be accused? And how could she have ever been so stupid to fall for one Tom Riddle?

** I just found "Hermione Granger: Demonologist" last month. It's short and funny, and surprisingly well fleshed out.

And I read Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty last year. The main character is a young wizard from dungeons and dragons who brings D&D rules into the Harry Potter universe. Also surprisingly satisfying!

  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

** The Red Knight

Ron (as MC) time travels to an AU with a fem!Harry. Before he time travelled he was shipped with Hermione, but afterwards no. Some pureblood culture stuff too. WIP. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/]])

​

Bad Oracle

How Cursed Child should have been written. Delphini as MC.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13788267/chapters/31695750]])

​

The Bureaucratic Error

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052940/1/]])

Lupin as MC. After dying, Lupin ends up annoying someone in the afterlife and thus gets sent back to the beginning of book 3. WIP.

​

Exile

Draco as MC, some pureblood culture on the periphery of the story. Focuses on Draco living in the muggle world since he was banned from using magic for a couple of years.

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

  As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.
