I put this up on AO3 a while ago, and I've edited and improved it today (thanks to some feedback on another post here about how to do OCs well) and I think I'm ready to share with the group. This is the first 50% of the story. The second 50% will go up over the next week or so.

It's a slight AU, which all began when I had a conversation with a friend about why none of Lily's friends (apart from Snape towards the end) are ever mentioned or make any effort to see Harry. Lily's treatment in canon drives me mad - she's basically a vessel, not a rounded person. So I've made an OC who is Lily's friend.

Key points of divergence for the AU are:

-Alphard Black had a daughter the same age as Sirius, who befriends Lily and Snape. This makes Sirius and James a bit better about Slytherin and there is no huge rivalry between the Marauders and Severus.

-Severus and Sirius are so fabulously gay - and yes, together. Because c'mon, that hatred? Sexual tension can explain it even in canon (I jest, the real reason I made Severus gay is because it makes his friendship with Lily a) totally platonic so he isn't a stalker and b) less threatening to James thus facilitating James being ok with the truce)

-Snape therefore doesn't become a Death Eater, so Dumbles needed another spy - enter Lucius Malfoy, who is a big soft Good Guy here for absolutely no reason other than I want him to be.

-The Ministry, not Albus, were responsible for Harry's placement with the Dursleys. Because that makes more damn sense than it being the job of a headmaster.

There's also a big old mystery about what the Unspeakables are up to, and some rogue Death Eaters seem to be involved too.

If you like the sound of that, you can find it here: linkao3(Lily's Snakes) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15818769/chapters/36824886]]

Any and all feedback welcome.


** If you mainly need someone to give it a once-over, and give you feedback, I'm happy to. My only thing is that I won't touch fics that aren't complete. Need tweaking? Sure. Need beta-ing? Cool. Incomplete? Hard HARD pass. If this is genuinely complete, and you're just looking for a second pair of eyeballs to look things over, I'm your guy.

That said, if this is something that's heavy duty dystopian, or otherwise really dark, I'm really not your guy. The world is fucked enough without having to see that mess in fics as well.

*** It's half done, so maybe I'll get back to you in a couple of weeks when I'm nearer the end? Thank you!

Dark/dystopian isn't my thing at all dude. This is a pretty light going work - bad things happen, because some bad things have to happen for the story conflict, but they aren't graphically described, there's no sexual violence or torture, it's gen all the way (other than a couple of F bombs dropped by Sirius Black!) I think the worst thing that happens to one of my characters is being briefly kidnapped and having to live in a cell for three days with only cold soup to eat before being rescued! I can't write dark stuff, I'm with you on this - the world is on fire, why would I set my imaginary world on fire too!? The few instances of A Bad Thing are canon-typical bad things, if that makes sense.

In fairness I lost a day yesterday when I finally got a copy of Animal Crossing and did literally nothing else. Couple of updates by Monday though, promise
