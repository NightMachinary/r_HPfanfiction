Basically what the title said, but let's expand it a little, to all the confrontations between one charachter and Voldemort. We've all read a good 50 confrontation between Harry and Voldemort in the graveyard, but what about the other times? Are there any fights that have stuck with you, that you still remember as being fun, or terrifying, exhilarating maybe?

My personal favourite is in Behind Blue eyes by Paffy, where after a stressful chase through a church (then a graveyard), the female protagonist ,who is muggle, gun's down voldemort with her revolver. I remember feeling this huge relief wash over me, and a death that would have seemed far fetched in any other fanfiction just worked wonderfully.

So, What's your favourite?


** There was a fic that was loathsome for several reasons. In it, Dumbledore is going senile, so McGonnagall foists him off on a useless project. Harry suggests that one of his visions revealed that Voldemort is allergic to citrus and diabetic, so Dumbledore needs to devote all his efforts and alchemical expertise to creating the perfect lemon drop.

He works at it for months, creating not only the lemon drop but a perfect delivery system. At length, he finishes. At the final confrontation, he lobs the lemon drop, which hits Voldemort in the back of the throat.

Pop. No more Voldemort.

Is it the one where Vernon commits suicide after being framed for major theft from Grunnings, and Severus Snape is forcibly committed and given yogurt enemas daily after being framed for molesting Dumbledore?

  After a few more seconds, in which the golden house elf got his Dark Lieutenant in a headlock, [Voldemort] had pulled himself together and made it to his feet, wand in wraithlike hand, and he might /still/ have escaped had not Harry Potter chosen that moment to hit him with a brick.

  Bracing himself, Harry swung said shovel as hard as he could at the back of the villain's skull. With the blow, Harry had effectively knocked Voldemort's eyes out of their sockets, shattered his skull and turned his brain into runny porridge that dribbled out of his nose, ears and the gaping wholes where his eyes had, until very recently, rested.

** I don't know about my favourite, but I suppose I liked the ending of The Trusted Hero...which is a fanfic of a fanfic.

linkffn(11155084)

Basically, after taking over the Ministry, Voldemort uses a ritual to super-magnify his magical power, but Harry, who's still a horcrux, ends up being affected by the ritual as well.

They have this big old duel which ends with Voldemort's magic overloading and failing, or something. I suppose it's unique, and not a sucky ending.
