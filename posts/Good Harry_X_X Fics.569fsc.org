Are there any good fics that have Harry with 2 girls?

And specifically, anything with Harry/X/Daphne?


** Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches: Revenge is Best Served Raw) is a tropey yet okay future harem fic. Daphne and Harry are betrothed right now and Luna has a consort contract to have lots of little Lovegoods by Harry. The other girls haven't made overtures yet.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
