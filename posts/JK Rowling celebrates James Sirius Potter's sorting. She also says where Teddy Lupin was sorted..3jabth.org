*** I always had Teddy pegged for a Ravenclaw. I'm not sure about the other two Potter kids. I like how there isn't any canon (some would debate if her tweets are canon). I've read fics with Albus and/or Lily being Slytherins and it can work. I think that what I like about Next Gen fics is that there's something of a base in terms of who the usual characters are, but there's still so many things (houses for many of them) that haven't been set in "stone."

******* I thought the only evidence was the fact that there's a Dorea Black + Charlus Potter = James Potter on a picture or drawing of the tapestry? And that's not even confirmed to be Harry's father?

I'm all for and personally believe this, +but it puts a wrench on the whole 'Harry needs to stay with abusive buttheads because they're his only family' because then he'd have the Tonks as a living and good family and not to distant of a relation,+ but he'd also be related by blood somehow to like half of Britain's pureblood population just through his grandmother.

Edit: struck out inaccuracy regarding the blood protection.

******** Interestingly, the family tree just says one son; said son is not even named. But, at least Dorea Black Potter is dead before Harry's parents die. Rowling said that James's parents were older when they had him. She also said that James was an only child. I wouldn't call 40ish old, but it's older than many parents we see in the books. But, you would expect Sirius to make a note if when he mentions the Weasleys.

Honestly, it's a wash, I think. I choose to accept it, but I can easily see why someone wouldn't.

The key thing with the second part is that Petunia (and Dudley) are Harry's only living relatives on his mother's side, his mother's family being necessary for his protection.

You're right on that last bit, I just double checked and it did have to be specifically Lily's blood, not just a blood relative of Harry's. I do still think it a shame that he could have had living blood family that entire time and never knew it though.

**** Canon is a fuzzy area. Some only take the books as canon; others extend to movies, Pottermore, her tweets, video games, etc. If you think it's canon, it's no concern of mine. I wouldn't consider it so.

I'm mostly ticked by people who first insist it is canon and then consider alternative fanon inferior. Her tweets encourage a bad case of superiority amongst people who feel they are "more right." Not her fault; it's just how some people are and it's frustrating to deal with.

Can't HP have "book-only canon" "word of god canon" (or another phrase that includes everything JKR says), and then "fuck it all canon" like the wiki does? Do we have to be mad at each other about which canons we prefer? It's the silliest thing, and I agree, it creates superiority.

thinking back on a comment made where it pointed out that basically harry potter is about being born exceptional (which is kind of funny given pureblood bigotry)- oh you're last name is this and your parents were them- head boy for you. it's just too neat. it feels shallow to me- like a personal fluff fanfiction, it lacks that weight of authenticity. probably harsh for a tweet but from the pottermore stuff i've read it's more of the same.

*** There are only four Houses. Unless you see a reason to believe Teddy is a show-off, a power-hungry cunt or intellectual elitist, I'd say Hufflepuff fits him as a person.

He seems engaging, willing to do hard work (he made Head Boy, after all) and not necessarily motivated by popularity or strong convictions (snogging Victoire when he should be acting as a positive example).

Also, James looks to be an attention-seeking little spaz, so Gryffindor is an obvious destination.

Albus Severus might end up Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff in my estimation; he has no interest in living up to his names or competing with James.

I won't pretend to know what JKR thinks about this, but I'd imagine her thinking about Harry Potter as a closed chapter. The books themselves are written, she's created an incredible world that is still being explored today and the people generally look back on the Harry Potter series very positively.
