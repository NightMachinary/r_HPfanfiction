:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry time travels and in terminator fashion he finds himself naked. I think he just kind of reflexively apparates to somewhere he's familiar with, which might have been his room at the Dursley's house. Except it's not the Dursleys, it's the Evans family who had recently moved there, and his old room is Lily's room. And no, it's not that sort of fic.

Lily freaks out like you'd expect, Harry is alarmed, and it ends up with an angry father interrogating him at gunpoint. Harry soon disarms him, apologizes, tells them that no, seriously, this is actually just a weird accident, and leaves.

 

Anybody recognize this fic?

*** Welp, guess I was wrong about it being that type of fic.

This is definitely it though, thanks!

*** Huh. I always wanted a fic that explores how a (time-travel) Harry/Lilly romance would play out, without being a mere excuse for incest porn. Thanks for linking this!

  One year into Voldemort's rein, a confrontation with the Dark Lord catapults the Boy-Who-Lived into 1975. Will he be content to sit around and let the past repeat itself? Absolutely not. Time Travel. Not very HBP or DH compliant. Awesome!Harry. Eventual Harry/Lily/Narcissa/Bellatrix. Not a smutfic.
