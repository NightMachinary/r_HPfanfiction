I'm reading this fanfic on wattpad, but it's uploaded only until the chapter 14 out of 25. Is there a place where I can find the full story or the author Is still writing it?


** I'm fairly sure it's complete. I think it might have been taken down - it used to be easily searchable on ffn. It also had a facebook fan group only a couple of years ago. I think you can download it in pdf format?

As I understand it, the writer had a habit of deleting all evidence of his account and moving onto another. There was also a big scandal about an attached cult.

Someone on that link has uploaded a copy of it, plus it goes into the issues regarding the author.
