If Harry was a magical creature what would he be and why?


** First are you talking about being a magical creature from the get go (eg it's in his blood) or being able to transform (animagi) into a magical creature?

Assuming you want magical creature bloodline, The most common "magical creature" that I see in Fics is for Harry to be part incubus (male succubus/demon). And this runs the gamot from a past ancestor having kids with a demon, to Lily being the Hell Queen on a visit, to Lily sleeping with a demon, to Lily making a deal with a demon to protect Harry and the demon "changes" harry so he survives.

One story had Harry have Sirens in his background and he becomes a winged Siren. In another story harry is descended from a different winged magical creature. Both stories have these creatures being very protective of those they consider mates/family and that's fits well with Harry's canon personality and desires (eg saving people thing and desperately wants a family). And a flying creature just makes sense for how good canon Harry is on a broom. I mean come on challenging a top air predator (dragon) in the air?

So as much fun as an Incubus story can be I prefer these other two "flying creatures". Great flyers and very protective of their mates/family which matches Harry's canon traits/personality.

The stories are Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd

  When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
