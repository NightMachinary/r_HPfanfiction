Looking for stories where Harry dies, either when he's younger before Hogwarts, during Hogwarts or during the war or whatever but the battle between the students, Professors, Order Members, Death Eaters and Voldemort still goes on.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308630?view_adult=true]["the kids who chose themselves"]] - this one has both Harry and Neville dead, as Voldemort went after Neville first and then the Potters, just to be safe. It's a short story, but it hits really hard. The whole series does, the author's just fantastic.

*** The whole "Boy with a scar" series is pretty amazing, but other than this one, the others feel too canon rehash-y for me.

Oh, harry is a girl! and everything goes the same.

Now Harry's transgender! And things go the same way.

Look, Ron's the BWL now! And guess what? Things go the same way.

**** They're all good but the writing style is just so sentimental and I thought it was way too melodramatic at times. Also the low-key Dumbledore bashing in all of them gets old.

**** Yeah, i agree that the "stations of canon" thing the author's got going on is sometimes super frustrating! To me, they fit better as character studies than as true AUs because of that.

  What if Voldemort went after Harry and Neville, and gave no one a chance to die for them? What if both Chosen Ones died as children?--There was no prophesied boy, but there was still this--dozens of shadowed young faces refusing to run, even at the very end of the world. Dumbledore looked out at his chess pieces, pawns and queens; his children and his friends; his collateral damage. He had the beginnings of a plan swelling in his chest. It would take them decades to get their hands, quietly, on every Horcrux. Tom Riddle had to think they were secret. He had to think he was safe. It would take them almost decades, but one day he would be mortal again. These dozens of faces--they were mortal now. Alastor Moody could feel mortality in the aches of old broken bones; Andromeda rewrote her own last name. Remus and Sirius felt empty, gaping holes in the seats around them, and they made crude, expansive, joyous toasts to friends' memories. When Molly first reached over and held Arthur's hand, they knew this was something that could not last. That was why they held hands, held on, held tight.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
