There was a particular story where the Make a Wish Harry gets transported to the world of D.C characters. They stop him from drinking coffee, he dates Supergirl I believe

Does anyone know the name of the story, I can't for the life of me remember it. Cheers.

  The unofficial fourth of the Make a Wish series by Rorschach's Blot, it was originally written by Overkill aka Irrational Intelligence and removed for some reason. EDIT: Have separated the chapters now.
