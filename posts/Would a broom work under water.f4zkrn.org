** Nothing in canon says it would or wouldn't. I'd lean towards saying yes, it could, but would be extremely difficult to ride.

However you could use it as the base for a magical submarine.

  "You are gathered here today because the world is going to end within the next three years," Hermione said succinctly. "But my husband, having died before, is in no hurry to do so again. We are here to try and save wizard kind itself." A Harry Potter/Battlestar Galactica Crossover, with a touch of 2012 fused in for the fun of it. Obviously not Epilogue Compliant.

** If it was made specifically for that reason?

Not enough information is given inside of canon.

- /IF/ they did work, they would be significantly slower. It's harder to move through water than air.
- Water could wash off the potions, enchants, etc.
- The enchants and whatnot could be specifically tailored to air travel, and not water travel.

**** You're right that it appears that only charms/enchantments seem to be used to make the brooms - but I could imagine potions being used as a part of taking care of them, or in some specific uses.

For enchanting, we really don't know the mechanics of it at all. I could certainly see charms being washed off if there isn't some sort of added charm to it specifically to ward that.. and it could lead to some pretty funny scenes!

***** I don't know, I for some reason seem to think enchantments can't be affected by physical things, and isn't enchanting a combination of charms and runes?

I think there's some sort of paste kind of thing that is applied on the broom, similar to that wand cleaning stuff

****** It's a valid interpretation, for sure - though enchantment wise, I think that canon doesn't really use runes for anything with them, and they're just a sub-set of charms. I do prefer the avenue that has it as a different category, that can be done with either (or both of) specific charms or runes. But in terms of physical interactions, I just don't think that we know for sure (nor how permanent most enchanting is). I think I kind of like the idea of lower quality enchantments being washed away or broken, vs the ones who do a better job not cutting corners and including water-resisting aspects or other charms that keep the items and enchantments more intact, but that's personal.

I think the broomkeeping kit Harry got had some wax or polish in it - is that what you're thinking of?

******* I personally have a headcanon that enchantments last as long as they have magic to power them, and if you use runes you can lower that amount of magic usage needed for upkeep by a ton, quality of the enchantment depends on how well the charm is performed or the rune cut.

Your idea does sound appealing to me, although I think I'll keep my own headcanon for now

Yes the wax polish thing is just the thing I was thinking of

******** Yeah, I'm very much on the 'canon is generally vague, so everyone's headcanon is valid and generally more consistent' way of thinking about a lot of the more specific details of magic. Your approach would be quite interesting as well.

** Even if it could, water resistance on the rider would be ridiculous and extremely unpleasant. Like water skiing but without skis or standing up. Just being dragged through the water at such a high speed would be very, very disorienting.

It would get in your mouth, your ears, your nose. The noise would be deafening, and the pressure would push back your eyelids, forcing your eyes open and water in or around your eyes.

Control would be nonexistent, all you could do is hang on as your broom would just goes /deeper/ and there's nothing you can do.

You can't let go because what if it keeps going? What if it keeps going and you can't escape the seat? What if something gets caught on the foot pegs and it just keeps dragging you deeper and deeper?

** I would say no. Brooms are enchanted to fly, not to swim. That may not seem like a big difference, you're just moving through different substances, but it would probably make a difference to the magic
