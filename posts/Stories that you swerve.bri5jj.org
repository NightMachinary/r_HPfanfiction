Sometimes you find fan fictions with your perfect pairing or plot but something is not right. What are those fanfictions for you?


** If it's written in first person, present tense especially.

*** Yes absolutely. The minute I see that first “I”, gonna nope outta there so damn fast. I'm not sure I've ever finished a first person POV fic. It makes me cringe

**** I give a pass for the occasional diary based story, but that's as far as I can manage.

*** First person isn't that bad if it makes sense to write like this (SI stories) or is executed in a magnificent manner (7th Horcrux). Otherwise it certainly would be weird.

Present tense is a menace though. I can't fathom how people can read stories like that

** When Harry gets sorted into a different house but still ends up saving Hermione from the troll/becoming friends with Hermione. In general, I instantly nope out of any fic that over-glorifies Hermione just because it's an overdone trope and most of them are badly written.

** I read a fic quite recently, about Hermione time traveling to first year, in the body of an OC Rosier, to stop an unexplained explosion that killed everyone after Harry and Voldemort's duel in the courtyard. The premise was amazing, seeing Hermione struggle to keep herself away from her friends was great, grammar and vocabulary were a cut above the typical fare and the author even managed to make the conservative pureblood society more interesting by inserting elements of victorian culture. And yet we go through 7 years but nothing much happens. She doesn't mess with canon, at first for fear of butterflying herself out of existance, then when minor changes happen anyway she discards the thought, but doesn't do anything anyway! Basically fucking nothing important changes from canon until the last couple chapter, where she starts moving pieces and asks people to do things on faith that she'll explain everything once the battle is over. The battle ends, she solves the problem, and when people start demanding explanations the story ends, at exactly the part I most wanted to read. So frustrating.

Edit: holy shit, the sequel started last month. I retract everything.

*** Oh yeah, OC-driven stories are pretty much untenable to me. As ancillaries they are fine, and can even be great, but as a protagonist they are almost never good

** Albus Potter being sorted into Slytherin. If the story's really great before it happens, I might stomach it, but generally I just find it really cringy. Just because a kid is scared something might happen because his older brother was mocking him about it (which is what older brothers DO) doesn't mean it's going to, or even likely to happen. We don't see even a shred of Slytherin-like behaviour or personality from him at any point.

It's part of why Cursed Child reads like such cringy fanfiction. Even when given the opportunity to expand on his personality, he's a Slytherin who acts like a Gryffindor the entire time.
