  This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with

  Harry winds up in Japan and lives a completely different life from the one Dumbledore planned for him. He returns to England and ... you need to read to find out.

That summary made me cringe.

Can you give me an overview, because as of right now my weeaboo detectors are tingling.

**** Your weeaboo detectors are right. Harry joins the yakuza in that fic, and it is basically a fic where he shits on the Ministry, dodges manipulative Dumbledore's attempts to make him more british and less independent, and brings japanese "culture" to his corner of Hogwarts. Also Hermione is a weeaboo. Essentially another arrogant fix-fic.

**** He is taken in by a yakuza boss family after they find out he is being abused. As many abused children do, he wanted to please his family, and the best way to do that was by being the best he could be. When he is sixteen, the ministry of magic force him to come back. Smart, deadly, powerful Harry.

****** Sort of. Kinda. In a way. I don't want to spoil it for others but technically you're right. It was his father. But only because they ministry threatened to take his inheritance.
