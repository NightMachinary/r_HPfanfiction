Any fics where Dumbledore and Grindelwald took over and the main character is Tom Riddle. I want to see what would have become of the most brilliant student whoever walked the halls of Hogwarts. I would prefer a LONG fic.


** Not quite the main character, but linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted) has Dumbledore and Grindlewald use a fake war (I think?) to create a European Ministry which Dumbledore heads up. Grindlewald is destroyed by the prophecy on Harry and Riddle has instead become Headmaster of Hogwarts. Riddle mentors Harry in this the same way Dumbledore did in canon, just more hands on

#+begin_quote
  A chance meeting and Albus and Gellert would become inseparable friends, until the death of Albus' sister. But what if Ariana had survived? Almost a century later, a boy named Harry Potter would survive the Killing Curse, finally bringing an end to Grindelwald's war. Now, as he finds a place for himself at Hogwarts, there are signs that suggest that the war might not truly be over.
