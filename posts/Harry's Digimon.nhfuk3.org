I'm doing a Harry Potter and Digimon crossover and I wanted ideas for Harry's Digimon. I have a few ideas I'm playing with, but I want your guy's opinion. BTW the Digimon will be 01, 02, and Tri.

1. Guilmon. I love Gallantmon, but I don't know if it's going to be with the other seasons.
2. Wizardmon. I will mess with his line.
3. Use Hedwig as a Digimon. It will give me the freedom to mess around
4. Other. I'm opened minded about this please give me an idea's/opinion.


** I was just playing Digimon Cyber Sleuth so this is really timely to me.

Guilmon is a pretty good idea. He's my favorite of the show Digimon, because of his viral-yet-adorable nature. But I think he'd be really good for Harry. And maybe you could link a digivolution to Megidramon to his being corrupted by the Horcrux?

How about a Dracomon that eventually digivolves all the way to Examon? Examon has got Arthurian-based lore which I think fits well with Harry.

*** Mate I know what you mean about just playing it. I got it for my switch last weekend and it's sweet Examon looks like a bloody dragon from legend but has a freaking cannon for an arm. I might pick that idea

**** Same! I played the first game on my Switch, had a blast, completed it, (500+ hours!) and am taking a break from the series for a little bit before playing Hacker's Memory.

** Hedwig but it's an - to use this sub's favorite word - eldritch creature. It has eight wings that when she spreads them she can cover the sun even if she's pretty high up in the sky, she has a peacock-like tail with actual eyes on it that can shoot lasers, her beak is just her nose and her actual mouth looks like that of the sarlacc from Star Wars when she opens it. She also has a second mouth on its chest that when it draws air it also sucks the souls of all the people around. Her eyes can penetrate your mind and make you relive your worst fear in an endless loop until you're driven insane.

*** That sounds like a temple boss after you get the master sword in Legend of Zelda
