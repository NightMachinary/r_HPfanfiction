I apologise for all the mistakes that you'll read, english isn't my native language.

I've been reading fanfictions for a long time, and I have always wondered - why are the writers treating those two like they are nothing ?

Voldemort is a magical powerhouse, a charming leader, and a cunning tactician. Through a bloody war, he managed to conquer almost all of magical Britain. Everyone was afraid, both of him and of what he accomplished. He discovered and created magics so powerfull and terrible that his only equal was the best wizard of his age with the most powerfull wand in existence. And even then, both Dumbledore and Voldemort weren't sure if they could defeat each others.\\
The only thing that stopped him was a magical Deus Ex Machina, and it only killed him for 13 years. He created 7 horcruxes when it was believed that 1 was the maximum.

Dumbledore has a carefully crafted persona as a bumbling old man, but he is wise beyond recognition, and respected by both his allied and his enemies. He has been playing the political game as headmaster of Hogwarts and all his other titles for several decades. He is qualified enough to act as a lawyer, and is quite good at that. He is also powerfull, because he managed to defeat the previous holder of the most powerfull wand in existence, but without killing him. Half the wizarding world loves him, the other half is either afraid or with the Dark Lord.

Yet, in fanfiction, here comes Harry Potter, a 12 years old, 14 years old, or even just 8 years old idiot, with no experiences other than his bi-weekly hour-long "pureblood tradition" lesson in the political game. He is malnourished, beaten by his abusive relatives, so much that Vernon Dursley, a man obsessed with normalcy, is quite willing to use a belt to scar him for life. Harry Potter is quite hardened by the hardships of his poor upbringing, because his cousin, Dudley Dursley, is a massive gang leader and he hates him and wants him dead.\\
This Harry Potter comes to the wizarding world, suddenly decides "hey, I'm gonna do things !" and he manages, in one year to :

- Ruin the public's perception of Dumbledore, the "greatest and most beloved wizard of the century", making him the most reviled fucker this side of the magical world\\
- Destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes with the help of the goblins, a race of elitist warriors that treats every creatures as beyond them - except for Harry Potter because he respects them and killed a basilisk or some shit like that\\
- But he didn't really destroy the horcruxes, because he managed to save the priceless artefacts within\\
- Even the horcrux on his forehead is killed, by some munbojumbo magic like exorcism (because Dumbledore wouldn't think about that, clearly)\\
- And finally kill Voldemort and his legion of Death Eaters, both inner and outer circles, change the entirety of magical Britain's mindset, and be revered as a hero.

In these fanfictions, Voldemort doesn't exists, and Dumbledore doesn't exists. It's always "Tommy", "Tommy-boy", "Voldeshorts", "Moldyshorts" or the classic "Voldy" - and "Dumby", "Dumb-as-a-door", or whatever other "Dumbles" they managed to create.

In these fanfictions, Voldemort is a child throwing a tantrum, Death Eaters are winning just because they are killing and the order does not, because Dumbledore believe KiLlInG iS bAd (conveniently forgetting Remus' own words in book 7 : "if you do not want to kill them, then [something I don't quite remember]". But hey, it's just Remus, and he just believes Dumbledore is one of the greatest wizards ever - if he says that it's not because Dumbledore is okay with this but because he never quite said it. Or something.)\\
Dumbledore has had many enemies in the past, but it's a 12 years old who managed to knock him down. Not in ten years, not in five, but in nine months. And it is all because Harry Potter - and his allies, Hermione Granger who stopped worshipping autority figures because Harry is her brother/future husband/bestest of friends and Neville Longbottom is a better Ron than Ron will ever be, because all there is to Ron's character is a jealous prat - managed to see behing Dumbledore's facade as a kind, old grandfather, and they saw him as what he really was : a thief obsessed wih power. What's that, Ariana's fate ? His continued refusal of the post of minister ? Meh it's prob'ly nothin'.

What did I forget ... ? Oh, yes, Death Eaters. Suddenly they sucks and any child trained for 10 days is better than all of them combined. Except Bellatrix who's just above them. Ah, and either Draco Malfoy becomes friend with Harry Potter - so the Malfoy family becomes good - or he doesn't, and then he's dead.

I could rant for longer, but I think you get the idea. If you're writing a fanfiction, and your Dumbledore is a bad guy - that's not a problem. My top-three favourite fanfictions had a bad-guy Dumbledore. Just don't make him weak. He's been at it for a century, so I'm sure he'd be able to at least hide the fact he's stealing from Harry Potter's suddenly appearing magical vault of infinite wealth.


** One of the issues is that the powers that Dumbledore and Voldemort have are less shown - and more /told/. For instance, you describe Voldemort as "a magical powerhouse, a charming leader, and a cunning tactician." - but in terms of what we actually see, I'd say that it's only the first one. The other two are more said/description based, and it conflicts with a lot of what we see. His leadership style seems very heavy on the 'curse and scream at your subordinates' and less on charisma/charm, and his tactics often.... don't make any sense? For instance, the battle of Hogwarts is not a particularly tactically impressive engagement.

It's similar with Dumbledore - he's very powerful, he's said to be very wise, and there's a lot of respect for him. However, we also see him making a lot of poor decisions/mistakes, be easily removed from power, and only has a smaller subset of people that actually seems to trust him or regard him as a threat, given how easily he gets discredited by a fool like Fudge. That goes double when we consider how useless he is at politics in what we actually see - that is, despite Voldemort's return, Dumbledore's political sense seems pretty bad.

So what we're left with for those two characters is a very impressive backstory and a lot of talk - but in terms of what they actually display, for narrative reasons, they're /far/ less impressive. Fanfiction authors powering up Harry will often jump on those less impressive aspects and exaggerate them, because they want to write a power fantasy. Really, a lot of it stems from canon Harry Potter really making neither of them out to be particularly impressive outside of their reputation and magical power.

*** It might just be that it's been so long since I read the books, I don't remember all that they did and just remember what they were depicted as. But if that's the case, then it's quite sad - people are more attached to what is shown than to what is told.

**** I don't think it's sad - after all, part of what makes a character like Dumbledore interesting is that his persona is /not/ the truth - he makes mistakes, he's much more complex, etc.

I think the sad part comes from when an author decides to massively power up Harry or their protagonist, and then de-power the others accordingly. Then, antagonists (and Dumbledore is an antagonists in many of those fics) who are /supposed/ to be dangerous are suddenly toothless and laughable.

** Most people aren't good writers. I like to think of myself as passable nowadays, and I've been at this for about 15 years now. Every time I sit down and storyboard or research something obscure or dumb, I learn something new. I develop a new technique to make a scene exciting, I learn to be less obtuse, my internal consistency grows.

That being said, most people are novice writers. Most don't know how to storyboard, or that they should even do it. Most don't have a defined plotline with arcs mapped out. Most don't develop their magic system to be logical.

Add to that that most writers are young, and that young people have a totally different perspective. For me, everything Dumbledore does that's not just in service of the plot makes sense - most of his bad decisions aren't because he's evil or an idiot, they are because the other choice would be /even worse/.

Voldemort is similar. These writers are influenced by videogamey magic systems, and cannot accept the mysticism inherent in JKR's system. This is why "magical cores" are a thing, for instance. I'm always a fan of beating a foe through trickery or traps, but these require careful thought so as to actually be good traps the enemy would fall for. If they are dumb, that makes the antagonist dumb for not seeing them coming.

These power levels, then, are usually scrunched together - the writer doesn't have a sense of scale for most things, and so makes it possible for someone to reach the level Voldemort and Dumbledore are at in under a year. Much of this is because of a desire for epic battles and a strong protagonist. They usually notice this problem also, but go about fixing it in the wrong way - they make power inherent rather than learned. This creates a sense of elitism and a power level which wraps back to reinforce magical cores.

*** I didn't really think of it that way.

It's just that most of the time, the stories I read are quite good - proper syntax, good writing forms, all of that - and so when the content doesn't follow the same quality, with the examples I've given, then it just ... Irks me I guess ?

I never really think to much about how old the writer is, because I always think "yes, this story is well-written, so it's someone who knows what they're doing" without going deeper. And I won't lie, I'm making a mountain out of a rock, here - usually there's only one or two of the issues I talked about, and the rest is good.

Thanks for the reply !

(But - 15 years of writing fanfictions ? I'm pretty sure you're putting yourself down by saying you're only passable, after all that time. To be fair, that's what every writers I've talked with said - that they are "not that good", or "passable", or whatever else. Don't put yourself down, you wouldn't have continued that long if you were just good enough to provide a passable entertainment)

**** (Might've been closer to 10, really. Time is really wonky nowadays. I can't tell how long ago 2010 was, or if the time between 2007 and it was shorter or longer than between 2010 and today. Well, I /can/, but it just feels weird. Anyway, I was in my early teens then, and all my stuff from back then is very awful. I've not deleted it as it humbles me whenever I begin feeling arrogant about my writing. I've seen too many authors becoming massive egoes who destroy everything around them and only maintain a small cult of personality, so I try to keep myself cooled off from that.)

And yeah, the writing quality in a higher sense can be perfect, syntax and vocab and grammar and spelling can all be great, but if you look at it with this in mind you'll soon begin to notice the telltale signs of a younger writer. They're more fairness-oriented, for example. Most actions get an equal reaction, sometimes disproportionally so to make up for faults of the character. You'll see this in bashing fics. Most of the time the writer will also be rather impatient, and rush plotlines along until they get to a part they like writing about. Those parts are then very drawn out, lots of detail and such, while the journey is insubstantial. You'll see this in "Harry trains a lot and then kicks everyone's ass" fics.

** Well I believe a part of that is due to the books ie they make it easy for folks to "disrespect" Voldemort and in some ways Dumbledore. Because while the backstory has both of them being immensely powerful, their actual actions in the current story line don't really reflect that. (Now I understand there wouldn't be much of a story (canon) if JKR did other than that).

For instance, in the first book Voldemort takes months to finally figure out how to get past all of the traps protecting the stone and yet three first years make it through with no real problems. What happened to the all powerful evil wizard that first year students have no problem making it through traps "designed" to stop Voldemort that seemed to have had no problem keeping Voldemort guessing for months?

And those same "traps" bring Dumbledore's "brilliance" and power in question. He designs a series of traps and hurdles that are supposed to keep the most evil dark lord at bay and every single trap is easily defeated by first year students using spells they were taught that year. Really?

Now I'm not near my computer so I can't provide links but some examples of fics that try to address these "discrepancies" in the so called power of Voldemort and Dumbledore.

So in one fic Nicolas Flamel hears that his stone was in jeopardy and he shows up at the school and ends up blasting through all of the traps without breaking stride. Basically showing what a truly powerful Voldemort could have/should have done.

In another fic Dumbledore discusses how he had to go in and "dumb down" all of the traps that the professors installed in order for Harry to be "tested". So the Devil's Snare was combined with another plant that also hates sunlight but it's reaction to sunlight is to throw poisonous spikes. So to get past it you have to use an obscure light charm as the normal ones would get you hit with the spikes. The potion challenge had every potion be Draught of Living Death. To get past the flames you had to again use an obscure charm. Etc.

Then look at some of the convoluted plans Voldemort puts in place. He gets a supporter into the school who basically doesn't do much to capture Harry for a year. I mean if he really wanted to use Harry's blood even if the ritual couldn't be done for several months he could've had the fake Moody removing any tracking charms on harry, stun him, turn him into a quill, get outside of Hogwarts protections and port key Harry to voldemort. (It wouldn't have been much of a story but it would've made more sense from an evil dark lord perspective and it was well within Barty Crouch Jr's power level to do that).

So the things that are in the books (written for kids) that are there to make Harry the Hero lend themselves to justify why fan fic authors can write stories that "disrespect" Voldemort and Dumbledore.

Plus I agree with some of the other commenters that many of the writers are younger so "putting it to the old guys" has much greater appeal and results in a more powerful Harry and more inept Voldemort and/or Dumbledore.

*** I think I've read the first one long ago, or at least one with the same premise.

Yes, (repeating myself from comments to comments) I may have throught to much about what they were supposed to be and not about what they shown they were. I agree the first year traps seems kinda dumb, but - the cerberus was a good first defense, since it took many months and a dragon egg for Quirrel/Voldemort to find how to get past it, and I always throught that beyond that, the real test was supposed to be the mirror. And that if it wasn't, then Voldemort, after blasting through everything, left little to no resistance - so the three first years managed to do their things and cross the traps.\\
For instance, there was a mountain troll, and it is apparently really hard to defeat one - and a stroke of luck from Ron and Harry to save Hermione from one. There was a giant chess game, where being defeated knocks you out cold - and all of that with the logic puzzle, and you get a set of traps that a team can defeat if they are good enough at individuals things, but alone - they wouldn't.

For the fourth year, I have nothing more to offer than - Voldemort has the sense of drama I guess ?

** Because J.K. Rowling stated, but never showed Dumbledore and Voldemort's magic prowess.

Fuck, that duel in the end of OotP, which happened in the Ministry Atrium, Dumbledore and Voldemort should've brought down tons of debris on top of their heads, and blown it away without a second thought. Dumbledore, a Transfiguration Master, fires spells, and Voldemort, said to be the most dangerous Dark Lord ever, uses nothing other than a couple of Killing Curses and a Cruciatus every now and then.

Damn it, where are the mind-bending, reality-altering feats from Dumbledore? Where are the sinister curses Voldemort uses, unseen, which can sap life right out of a person?

Shit, the most impressive feat of magic we saw was Harry driving off a hundred dementors with a single Patronus at 13. Hermione casting an Undetectable Extension Charm on her beaded handbag is more wondrous than the frankly lackluster duel we got to see.

You remember the things said about Voldemort and Dumbledore's political and magical prowess. But it was never really seen in an awe-inspiring manner.

But the real reason why these fics are a thing is that 12 year old fanfic writers deal with their inadequacies by having a similar-aged Harry kick everyone's ass.

Nothing like projecting your insecurities on a fictional character, I suppose.

The thing is, the magical world is a really small communauty, so it's less like propaganda against Hitler and more like a Werewolf game - except everyone know exactly who are the werewolves, who are the important figures in the villager's side, and if the entire village doesn't go against the werewolf leader they are all killed at the following night.

I'm sure everyone would like to make fun of them, but they can't because they can /feel/ the danger. There were much less caricatures about Hitler in Europe, because that's where he was. Americans didn't feel the war, because only their soldiers were in danger - so they were free to mock a man who wasn't really dangerous in their eyes.

** You seem to be doing the exact same thing as the stories you hate. Overstating the qualifications and abilities and ignoring the flaws of the people you like and ignoring/downplaying the achievements of the people you don't.

You praise Voldemort for splitting his soul multiple times and ignore that this act is essentially what stripped him of all the things you find fascinating about him (his charm and cunning). Based on his ultimate goal (eternal life) I would say he was an abject failure since he ended up dying in his seventies, not to mention that ten of the years he was 'alive' he was essentially a spirit. If he was self aware in the least he should have seen the 'Deus Ex Machina' from a mile away and planned accordingly. His grand plan to rule the wizarding world lasted about a year before he was ended permanently so again...failure. If he was cunning he would have never had his weaknesses exploited over and over again by a child.

And Dumbledore made multiple mistakes and cruel decisions throughout the books...this isn't up for debate. You can't have it both ways. If he is wise beyond recognition than that means he purposely made mistakes to test/groom Harry to sacrifice himself. I personally think it is implausible that so many people believed in him...not because he was evil but because of how many poor decisions he made and how many things that happened under his nose.

There are poorly executed/written stories in every trope of HP but if you are asking why writers treat them this way than reread the books. All of their flaws and mistakes are front and center in canon.

*** It seems most of the replies I'm getting are showing the same conclusion as yours - it's been to long since I've read the books, and I am more attached to their ideas than to what they show. That's a hard blow, I'll admit, but I'll suck it up.

(And yes for the purpose of this rant I may or may not have slightly exagerated their abilities, but that's still what they were at least supposed to be, as told by everyone in the books.)

  Disrespecting Voldemort

Ok, I'll call Godwin's Law here, but I don't give any respect to Hitler, why would I respect Magical Hitler?

Fear, sure. Respect? Nah.

You fear them. Hate them. Not respect them.

*** It still doesn't even count in my books, because Magical Britain practically conquered itself with Fudge and Umbridge.

Fudge gave him free reign for a year, and Umbridge most likely gave him the keys to the kingdom when he finally showed up and an effective playbook.
