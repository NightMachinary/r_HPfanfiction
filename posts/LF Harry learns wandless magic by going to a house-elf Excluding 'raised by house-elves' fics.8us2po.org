I know there's a fair few stories where Harry is raised by house-elves and learns their magic, but are there any point-of-divergence stories where he decides to go to Dobby or some other elf to learn how to use magic without a wand?

...I still haven't written that idea where Harry goes to Dobby a little into 5th year because he's sick of being helpless without his wand.

  (alt title: Disproportionate response). Give the death-eaters a second chance? No way, not even a *first* chance! This is a "redo" fic with a twist. The pairing will eventually be Harmony but a good part of the story happens when they are too young so hard-core Harmonians need to be patient. Rated M for possible violence in later chapters.

*** Ah, I've already seen that one. I'm not sure I liked it that much, though. Despite Harry being Dobby.
