It has to follow these points: - post war - post Hogwarts during the war is fine too as long as it's not too depressing - Fred is ALIVE and well and will still be so in the end (he can have been hurt during the battle, turned into a vampire, a werewolf, missing a limb, become the second reincarnation of Christ... I don't care as long as he's alive) - may contain Fred/Angelina and/or George/whoever you want as long as it doesn't negates other canon ships and is not closely related to him

Anyways thank you ðŸ˜Š


** linkffn(Twin Vice Paranormal Detectives) is the best fic I can think of that fits your criteria. Admittedly, Fred isn't quite alive, but he's still very much one of the main characters (and as the story goes on, it's hinted that his status is more complicated than it seems). The story is exciting, engaging, hilarious, and beautifully written. Every character that shows up is characterized very well, but it never stops being a story about Fred and George. The only downside is that the story is unfinished, and will probably remain that way, but it's so good that it's worth a read anyways.

Also, if you haven't already, I highly recommend giving linkffn(Fox Ears) a try. This fic explores the aftermath of the battle, how Fred's death affected George, and what George is going to do to fix it. Fred is dead at the start of this one, but he gets better soon enough (and there's tons of alive Fred in the sequel as well). The story's an emotional roller-coaster in the best way possible, and is probably the best portrayal of the Weasley Twins out there.

  Post DH: Fred is a ghost with a curse on his head. Now in order to save his soul, the twins must solve a series of murder mysteries that will lead them to a dangerous secret stretching deep into the vault of the Founders' history. Fred x OC, George x Luna

  The Weasley family is deep in mourning after the battle of Hogwarts, but George has better ideas than to sit around and cry about something he'd rather just fix. And Charlie believes he can do it. Post DH, Charlie's POV.
