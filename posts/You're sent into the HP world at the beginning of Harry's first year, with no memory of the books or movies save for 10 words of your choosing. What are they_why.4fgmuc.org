  Dumbledore, horcruxes: Bellatrix's Vault, Grimmauld, Gaunt's shack CURSED, Room Requirement.
#+end_quote

Pretty self-explanatory: giving Dumbledore the locations of the horcruxes and forewarning him about the curse on the ring. End result is that all of the horcruxes but for Nagini and Harry are dealt with early on and Dumbledore isn't taken out of the war early (perhaps meaning the Ministry never falls).

The "Dumbledore" is in there so I know to take the information to him. If it was just "horcruxes" I wouldn't really understand the context and might dismiss the information or keep it to myself, not realising how important it is.

I played with leaving out "horcruxes" and letting Dumbledore deduce the pattern on his own, but that could have left him not figuring it out until he finds his first horcrux in the Gaunt shack just before HBP. This way he knows they're the location of horcruxes from the start. Still, a single extra word would have been really useful as it would allow me to say that it's the diadem in the RoR. As it is, Dumbledore is gonna have to go through a lot of junk lol.

A good alternative which would allow Dumbledore to lay a trap:

#+begin_quote
  "Triwizard third task Voldemort resurrection Little Hangleton Graveyard father's bones"
#+end_quote

This one runs the real risk of Dumbledore letting fake!Moody in on his plans though. So maybe:

#+begin_quote
  "Triwizard third task Voldemort resurrection Little Hangleton Graveyard. Moody imposter."
#+end_quote

Alternatively you could just be completely selfish:

#+begin_quote
  "Potter will win but Voldemort will rule for a year."
#+end_quote

Lets you know to pick Potter's side but not to be too open about it.

ALTERNATIVELY, if we're just gonna go for naked greed:

#+begin_quote
  Ireland wins cup but Krum catches snitch. Don't trust Bagman.
#+end_quote

Lets me place a winning bet and tells me to avoid placing it with Bagman, who won't pay out.

*** It seems really short sighted to me to transmit information about finding the horcruxes - considering they were able to do that even with the little resources they had available. My message would focus on attempting to improve their circumstances and resources - avoiding the weirdly desperate Horcrux hunt alltogether.

Not exactly sure how to best achieve that, but preventing Voldies resurrection seems pretty damn good - so I like your alternative. Could maybe try something completely different:

#+begin_quote
  Pettigrew traitor; Quirrel is Voldemort: CAPTURE alive, Horcruxes! Remove Fudge.
#+end_quote

I'm assuming that Dumbledore is able to contain Quirrelmort (coma, magical stasis, whatever). I'd have to consult some wizarding experte before transmitting that message.

**** I kinda felt the reverse - that preventing a single resurrection was short sighted because, as Dumbledore said in PS, there would always be another attempt.

The long sighted position is to seek to get rid of Voldemort for good, and do it in a faster way than in canon so as to reduce losses. Getting rid of the horcruxes early and keeping Dumbledore alive seem to be both pretty strong actions in that direction.

I don't want to delve into critiquing JKRs writing too much, but that is so dumb. If it were that easy it wouldn't have taken 15 years for Voldemort to pull it off.

Honestly, I feel like Lucius and his supposed influence was rather insignificant. He was at his apex worst by letting Slytherin's monster loose in the school in CoS, but even he didn't REALLY know what he let loose. And he was powerful in spreading dissemination and fear in PoA, but he couldn't have been the only one corrupting Fudge. And Fudge is a coward, he was looking around for a reason not to believe that Voldemort was back. After the battle at the ministry, he was pretty much insignificant.

** I took the 'ten words' as being given without context- they may appear in any order, without punctuation. With that in mind, each of the ten words I chose ought to provoke research or at least weighted consideration [listed alphabetically]:

- Animagi - research would put in mind the idea of sneaky wizards as animals, which answers several riddles

- Basilisk - probably the most dangerous threat at the school, it was a miracle Harry defeated it; by focusing on it, knowledge of its capabilities should help in its handling. Also a possible source of revenue since I'm not Harry and could use some bribe money

- Harry - the only name on the list, to point out that he's the man at the nexus of it all

- Horcruxes - an obscure and horrifying topic that ought to focus the mind on the biggest unanswered question of the last twenty years- 'how did Voldemort not die?'

- Marauders - research wouldn't lead anywhere until the twins overhear it, but the map and its makers are worth digging into, and Professor Lupin might explain more

- Occlumency - reading up on this opens the whole topic of mental defenses, Legilimency and the ability to lie under veritaserum

- Parselmouth - say this near Harry and the topic of his snake-speaking and its relation to Slytherin and the heir thereof should open some interesting doors

- Prophecy - by bringing it up, the topic of Divination is given a bit more weight and may lead to questions about how prophecy happens, how it affects the subjects and may even touch off the fuse on Harry learning about his own

- Resurrection - related to the second Hallow but also to prompt research into one of the fundamental rules of magic- it can't work, so something else must be going on there. Bonus points if it happens to lead towards Riddle's re-embodiment ritual, but there are no guarantees of that.

- Seven - admittedly this could be more a distraction than a help, but making the number extra-relevant wouldn't hurt

  Dumbledore: Crouch hiding son; Weasley rat Pettigrew. Horcruxes. Basilisk bathroom.
#+end_quote

Pettigrew and Crouch Jr being captured means Voldemort flees as a shade after first year and will have a lot more difficulty finding a way back to a body. That could afford us several years of peace.

It alerts Dumbledore to the existence of horcruxes and informs him of the specific nature of the threat in second year, as well as hinting at where to find it. If possible, he'd put protective charms around the bathrooms that could alert him to the presence of a basilisk. One or two people get petrified or killed, and then the beast is slain.

It frees Sirius, though that's minor in the grand scheme of things.

"Horcruxes" is probably not that useful in the end, but it would get him to pay attention.

** So, I'm sent into the Harry Potter world and I have 10 words I get to remember but it can't just be these snippets and words because they won't do anything. They have to mean something to someone who can do something about it, either myself or someone else. And I have to be very careful about what I choose. Just thinking about what I could talk about...

Horcruxes. Well Harry is already a Horcrux, so is there any way I can alter the chain of events concerning the Horcrux that doesn't result in Harry dying? Because I'm pretty sure he only was able to survive because Riddle used Harry's blood in his resurrection, and Harry willingly gave his life up, which destroyed the Horcrux inside but kept him alive. So I have to choose to do nothing with the Horcrux because I can't explain how to do that.

The biggest change I can make is Harry's family. And by that I mean Sirius. But you can't say "Sirius innocent." Doesn't mean anything. Say "Pettigrew was secret-keeper." (Can secret-keeper be 1 word? I'm going to be lenient and say yes). That can be conveyed to Remus or Dumbledore and start the spinning wheels. Give Dumbledore time to have knowledge of Sirius's innocence and he would've worked a way to prove his innocence and find Pettigrew.

So we've used 3 words so far, 7 left. What else do I want to remember? Well, who can I save? Dobby, but his sacrifice is vital to saving Harry Ron and Hermione. Mad-Eye, but I can't think of how to get him to not fly. Dumbledore? I can say "Ring is cursed." That's an option. But Dumbledore was obsessed with the Hallows, it was his life-long dream, it's doubtful my words can dissuade that desire to put on the resurrection stone (we all know how much he regrets things in his past).

So who to save? First, it's Cedric. Young powerful Cedric, who probably could've been recruited by the Order, fought against Voldemort, and changed the world. How do I save his life? I have to know to stop him in the Triwizard Tournament. "Cedric can't win." If I know this, I would know when it comes to it that Cedric can't win the Triwizard Tournament. It's the obvious thing he can't win. I may mistake it for a Quidditch game the year before or something, but once he's chosen as a Champion, I'll know it means this How do I do this? Myriad of ways. I'll be able to sneak up on Cedric and stun him in my 4th Year. Do something, anything, to get him to not be able to participate. Or I tell Harry that Cedric can't win. Maybe that puts just enough doubt in Harry's mind that when he has the moment, he saves Cedric, then stuns him and takes the championship himself.

So 4 words left, do I save someone else's life? Who is left? Sirius? Tonks? I can say "Use Sirius's double mirrors" to Harry. He'd ask Sirius what that meant, Sirius would explain, and they'd never go to the Ministry that night. But in all likelihood, a lot has changed with Sirius if my first words worked, and Harry finds out about those mirrors through living with Sirius. So I save Tonks. "Stay home Tonks" That gives the effect of knowing Tonks should stay home. Yes, it's one less fighter, but if these words of mine have already saved Cedric, already saved Sirius, hopefully these words have been proven to mean a lot, I'm treated like some type of seer, and I can hopefully convince Tonks, Remus, everyone, to stress that Tonks must stay home. Teddy deserves one of his parents.

So one word to spare... Maybe I just say "Colin". By the battle, I've figured out my nine other words had meaning. I know they mean something. All of them. And saying "Colin" means that it is important to be around Colin. Hopefully I just become his friend, stick around with him. And when the meaning of all these other things have come true, I decide to stick with Colin in the final battle. I'm side-by-side protecting him. And maybe I save him. Maybe I sacrifice myself for him. Maybe my friendship helps us grow as wizards and whatever battle he lost, he now wins.

I could've chose "Fred" but honestly, what am I going to do to stop a wall from exploding? We don't know exactly how Colin dies, so hopefully I can save him still.

I really enjoy the Innocent series by MarauderLover7 as a good example of Harry living with Sirius. linkffn (Innocent by MarauderLover7).

And any canon fanfiction of post-Hogwarts, two of the saddest things are seeing Teddy parentless (and Andromeda without her husband and daughter!) and the poor muggleborn Colin, often because his death is overlooked.

One thing I overlooked a bit but I'm not sure how it would fit is something along the lines of "trust Severus." But honestly, whose life does that save? Who benefits from that? Apart from everyone not thinking Severus is a git, does that advance the war, save anyone's life? Thinking about it, I'm not sure how to save Severus, or how Harry trusting him would help them in their journey.

***** Hey look! A chance to upvote you again!

I've never read Innocent, but I will do so soon. I'm currently re-reading This Crude Matter by Ynyr.

I think Severus living wouldn't.. really help anyone. I think, if anything, he was glad to go. Besides, you can't save everyone.

** Voldemort Horcruxes: diary, locket, ring, Nagini, cup ,Diadem, Harry

I feel like Dumbledore could go off of that. Save a lot of hassle. They can get through their first year fine. Year two would show which diary, which could lead Dumbledore on the hunt for the rest that arent obvious.

** The question didn't specify, but I'm writing this as if I was Harry receiving these 10 words. I was tempted to include Quirrellmort, but he never really did much to harm and was safely eliminated without any deaths other than Quirrell. Same with the basilisk.

*Pettigrew Alive Scabbers* We need Sirius out of Azkaban and Pettigrew in it as soon as possible

*Hangleton Riddle* Site of Voldemort's resurrection, his HQ, and a horcrux.

*Sirius Mirrors* Even if we can get Sirius out early, we need the mirrors. That would reduce so many issues in fifth year and even fourth year as well.

Three more words.

+*Bang Luna Lovegood*+

Err...

+*Show Umbridge Centaurs*+

No. That's not right either. Maybe something with Cedric. He dies a very pointless death. I doubt that you could convince Tonks or Colin to stay home and I'm not sure it's possible to be with them at the battle.

** There's actually a fic with this basic premise: linkffn(8127137). Hermione manages to send a message to her younger self when she happened to be using a computer, so the message has to be extremely short. I don't remember much about the fic, but I liked the premise about Hermione slowly figuring out what the message meant.

** Horcrux, Quirrel Voldemort, Harry abused, Sirius innocent, Pettigrew alive, ambition

Horcrux in order to tell Dumbledore why Voldemort still exists (I'll leave it up to him to find them and without any pressure (as he's not pressed for time) I am sure he will figure out that the damned ring is cursed, so he does not die early!)

Quirrel and Voldy in order to trap Voldemort (if Quirrel is stunned and then kept contained but alive somewhere, I am sure Voldemort will not escape!)

Harry's neglect or abuse (I used the word abuse because it's stronger!) in order for people to remove him from the Dursleys

Sirius and Pettigrew is self explanatory I think :)

And finally: Ambition in order to tell Harry that it's good to have ambitions (in order to get him sorted into his "true house" (sorry, my opinion and I also think Slytherin would have made him great - why? Because he would have had to rely on himself more (no Hermione proof-reading his homework or helping him do it!)!)

** Well, that question is awfully general, isn't it? what form do I assume there? am I a muggle or a wizard? a kid or an adult?

Assuming I'm a wizard in Harry's year, and don't have enough time before the year starts to go to Durmstrang instead, it will probably be something like "ask kitchen elves Requirement Room, Patronus, distrust Ministry, Legilimency".

Sorry, not going to fuck with the timeline.

** If we really can't remember anything, I don't think a list of keywords will help. We need a concise statement with enough information to be useful, but a clear urgency:

Ron Weasley's rat is Peter Pettigrew. He will kill again.

I figure this will get us where we need to with the only threat in the books that Harry and friends were really unable to deal with. Test Pettigrew for Animagus powers in book one, free Sirius from Azkaban, and use Pettigrew to find Voldemort on their own terms.

** Little bit late, so I'm gonna take it in another direction.

#+begin_quote
  Magic!! 4 Privet Drive - give owls letters - 'Dumbledore: "Scabbers Pettigrew."'
#+end_quote

I'm a Muggle. I have no idea there are wizards, I don't know about Hogwarts or Voldemort or the fact that there's a secret invisible street (which Muggles can visit, going by Granger's parents!) selling artifacts filled with game-breaking powers.

Presumably I'll eventually figure it out based on Harry's acceptance letters, hopefully I'll manage not to get Obliviated.

But in the meanwhile ... if Dumbledore knew Ron's stupid rat was Pettigrew .... then Pettigrew wouldn't escape, track down Voldemort, and bring him back.

Sure, he'd probably stir /eventually/ and rise to power - although he didn't seem to have many loyal servants left, really - but we only need it to take a few extra years for Dumbledore and Harry to destroy the Horcruxes in years 6-7 and solve everything. Conveniently, this also means he never frees Barty Crouch, and Pettigrew's "testimony"/existence will exonerate Sirius, so that's years 3-4 (and, hopefully, Harry's home life) sorted as well.
