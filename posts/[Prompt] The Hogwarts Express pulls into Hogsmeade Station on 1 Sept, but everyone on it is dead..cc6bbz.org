Just nothing so boring as a Death Eater attack.

*** That would make a terrific horror story, especially if you started with the teachers discovering it and the widened the scope to how the rest of wizarding Britain reacts to it.

Of course, it would likely only be a oneshot since it's hard to make a longer story with 3/4 of the cast dead, but I'd still love to read it.

** Well, there is linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts, a Fairy Tale by Forest_of_Holly), but that's part 7 of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][the series]]. However, I cannot recommend the series more. It is really good, and some of its parts are probably the best pieces of fanfiction writing I know about.
