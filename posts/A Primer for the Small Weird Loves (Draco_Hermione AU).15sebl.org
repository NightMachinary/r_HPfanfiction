** This one /isn't/ my story. ;-)

I've been reading this in-progress, regularly updated fic by unicornesque. It's an AU, fourth year fic with the premise that Narcissa and Lucius separated before Draco was born. Draco has been raised in France--with no contact with his father--and attended Beauxbatons. When he goes to Hogwarts to cover the Triwizard Tournament for the school paper, he meets Hermione, the Hogwarts community--and learns some interesting things about his Dad.

I like this take on a possible variation on how Draco might have turned out. Check it out?

*** Yes, that's the sort of thing that's made me really like the fic. I've added to my favorites list, and I don't do that with many!

**** I'm really enjoying it, but so far Draco is kind of a Mary Sue, don't you think? He has no human flaws.
