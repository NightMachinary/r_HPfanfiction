It is linkao3(17194829), and can I just say how thoroughly I have enjoyed this story even after rereading it multiple times. It is neither funny nor happy story, but it is very beautiful. Highly recommended!

  "The sorrow birds find what is weak, my chest, beak-marked, my eyes long gone." - Ann V. DevilbissLily Potter is dead.No.Lily Potter should be dead.The cheerful little owl clock on top of the dresser hesitates, then ticks onward. The baby in the crib sucks in another eager breath, and wails anew. The dead girl on the floor- the should be dead girl on the floor- opens her eyes.(Lily lives, but sometimes wishes she hadn't.)

** Completely agree! That author is one of my favourite authors in the HP fandom! You should read her other works, they are amazing. There's an unhealthy relationship portrayed, and it' s the only way any pairing with Tom Riddle should be done imo!

  "Now I have three heads: one for speech, one for sex, and one for second guessing." - Analicia Sotelo. 'South Texas Persephone'.Her door clicks open and nearly clips her in the face. It could be a sudden draft, but Amy is doubtful. Her fist clenches shut around the marble. It is pretty. She could look at it for hours, the way it catches the light. It's almost like a sweet. Want curls up in her chest like a cat. She thinks she'll keep it. A gift from the big grey orphanage, just to her.“That's mine,” comes a thin, cold voice, and she sees the boy across the hall for the first time. His room is directly across from hers. He is pretty, she thinks, like a drawing from a book. The lines of his face are smooth and pale. His hair is dark and neatly parted. He holds himself very rigidly, like a miniature soldier or a wind-up toy. “That's mine,” he repeats, sharply.(In which Tom Riddle is not the only strange child to come out of Wool's.)
