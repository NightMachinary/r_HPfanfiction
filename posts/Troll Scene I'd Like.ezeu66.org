Hermione shrieked again as the troll swung its club heavily into the wall above her. She kept a constant stream of purple sparks and blue smoke issuing from her wand as she formlessly poured her magic into it.

"Harry! Take mine and do that!" Ron shoved his battered old wand into Harry's left hand, replacing a chunk of debris that was there. "Not doing me any good." Which was true--Ron couldn't cast a single spell that would help.

But as Harry started sending pulses of badly-matched magic into the other boy's wand, it reacted with violent gouts of force and flame. It was enough to make the troll hold up its club like a shield and paw at Hermione with its other hand, rather than pulpify her.

Ron continued to throw broken pieces of rock and wood at the thing, landing precise hits on its face and fingers. "Turn it to iron, mate! Looks like a big match, doesn't it?" Ron showed Harry the next piece of wood he meant to chuck. Harry took his meaning, and Ron sent the splinter flying end over end.

"/Ferrofors!/" Harry incanted with his concentration on the wood piece. As it flew, it smoothed and its edges became sharp.

The impromptu throwing axe caught two of the troll's three fingers, severing them and causing the troll to drop its club. It bellowed and took stock of its remaining fingers and assets. It came to a conclusion amidst continuing assault by Harry's off-wand, and it turned to face the two boys.

"/Wingardium Leviosa/" the colorful sparks halted as Hermione magically raised the club with all the might she could muster. It flew from the ground and uppercut the troll, it's snarling mouth clapped shut hard enough to break teeth loose. The troll staggered a moment, and the club climbed higher in the vaulted room.

"/Ferrofors!/" Harry called again, this time turning the levitating club into a stalactite of blackened wrought iron. Hermione's spell failed under the added weight, and the widow maker fell, grazing the side of the troll's head before impaling it through the collar. It collapsed--luckily away from Hermione, who wasted no time scampering over to the entrance of the bathroom.

What I really want is a Golden Trio who enhance each other's strengths and shore up their weaknesses. I want a powerful, willful Harry. A Ron who sees potential and how to reach it. A Hermione who's spell repertoire seems endless.

I imagine them going through school, practicing dueling together. Hermione wins when she bring something new and unexpected to the table. Ron wins when he figures out the best way to use the new spell. And Harry wins when he masters the new thing and way.

The Hermione in the last one is especially unhinged.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
