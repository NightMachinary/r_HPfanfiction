And while it is widely acknowledged that his two friends are the most deadly ones, their close friends all agree that Harry is by far the scariest one, after all, he is the only one that gives magic cancer to the people that genuinely angers him

This version of Harry is more stern/Non-nonsense (somewhere in between Snape and McGonagall) though he easily relaxes among friends, Hermione is playful (Luna-Bellatrix) and Ron has a gentle demeanor when not in battle (Dumbledore minus weird quirks)

*** I had similar for the girls for my list.

Though i had Ron as a barbarian, his emotion gets ahead of him sometimes but he still gets in the thick of the fight.

I had Harry as the Fighter. Solid defense spells but also some offence. Sticks to the basics (Equivelent of sword and shield) mostly but does them well

For some reason i always had Neville as the Paladin. Willing to stand up for what is right in the face of all darkness. But Even from a young age willing to tell his friends that he thinks what they are doing is wrong and hold to that conviction.

**** Oath of Ancients Paladin:

#+begin_quote
  The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things---leaves, antlers, or flowers---to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.

  *TENETS OF THE ANCIENTS*

  The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

  *Kindle the Light*. Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

  *Shelter the Light*. Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.

  *Preserve Your Own Light*. Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.

  *Be the Light*. Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

*** I used to see an advertisement for a HP Mage the Awakening game all the time on a discord. D&D would be a weird choice... but so would basically any system since HP is so unique in that it lacks summoning, mana, really any kind of limit to spell casting beyond speed.

If I was homebrewing an HP system then I'd probably make speed determine how many spells in a round, or perhaps have a wheel initiative (even though I've only had a bad experience with that)... or probably go extra rules light and do a Powered by the Apocalypse type thing

**** I really like it, It's called “The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic”.

The MC is accidentally summoned along with the actual targets of the summoning, the most popular boy and girl in his school.

They get their magic tested and find out their attributes.

The boy and girl are Heroes, and have attributes reflecting that.

The MC gets healing magic.

Cue terrified talks of “her” finding out.

She shows up, turns out she's the head of the Medics, she's also terrifying as hell.

She -kidnaps- takes MC for training and so the series begins.

Healing Magic is strong but there is a trade-off.

If you have Healing Magic, you cannot learn any other type of magic.

It's also rare and seen as a “trash” magic.

Healing Magic is all about creativity.

Rose (the head of the Medics) uses it to extend training to superhuman levels.

When you fall down, she heals you and shouts at you to get up and continue running.

As a consequence, her training breaks people mentally, they change greatly.

But they also become superhuman, to the point of being fast enough to disappear from sight.

The Medics are called “The Kidnappers” because those wounded on the battlefield are retrieved so quickly that it looks like they disappeared.

I really recommend it.

****** It's not something that can outwardly hurt someone.

If you punch someone while encased in Healing Magic, it does the damage then immediately heals it.

That's why it's seen as trash, you can't really use it to attack.

Or so they think.

Rose and the MC have different ideas.

It also goes deeper than just “Healing Magic heals you” it's a bit more complicated.

Just on the topic of it being rare and “trash”.

There's only one kid in the worlds most prestigious magic school that has Healing Magic, he gets bullied and beaten up just for having it.

That still doesn't really make sense though, have you ever played a game where people thought healers were trash because they didn't do damage? Everyone loves healers because they need to be healed.

******** I never said that they were smart, they just don't think it's good (they're 300% wrong).

Keep in mind that if you have Healing Magic, you can't learn any other type of magic.

That's a massive downside.

Especially in a world that takes great pride in what magic you have.

When compared to things like Lightning, Fire and Light, Healing Magic looks (at first glance) not very good.

********** I'm right there with you, do you have any idea how easy it would be to take over the planet with Healing Magic?

Here's a hint, Healing just sets something to what we would consider an unharmed state.

Any disease? Cured. Any physical disability? Fixed.

Hell, you could probably use it to increase your senses to superhuman levels.

You can certainly do it with strength.

You play a Healing main?

You're a saint.

And probably in need of several therapists.
