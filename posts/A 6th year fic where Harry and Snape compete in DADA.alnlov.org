I can't remember the title, just a specific turn of events from the start of the story:

In the first DADA lesson, Snape calls Harry up for a demonstration, then humiliates him by getting a spell past his shield and cracking Harry's ribs. Snape asks Harry if he needs to go to the infirmary and Harry refuses.

In the second lesson, Harry retaliates and is able to get a spell past Snape's shield, similarly cracking Snape's ribs. Harry very cheekily asks if Snape needs to go to the infirmary.

That's all I can remember, but I'd like to find this fic again. Thanks for any leads.


** I'm pretty sure you're referring to The Awakening Power. It's one of the better H/G stories, imo.

**** Nah, Harry's just made of sterner stuff. Kid was willing to do things like literally face his greatest fear, have his mind violated by someone he hates, and carve words into his hand. Not once, but over and over again. A little bit of cracked ribs is nothin'.

*** To be fair if its anything like the NHS then the response would be "Yep, you've probably cracked a rib. We're not going to check because the answer is the same either way: go home, rest, take painkillers if it hurts." [NB, not a dr, just a patient]

Maybe he just knows the drills.

*** Might not have been that severe. I'm just going on memory.

** Damn, I definitively remember reading this, but I don't remember the title either.

However, considering that pretty much all 6th year fics I've read are Harry/Ginny I can thus conclude the fic you're looking for is probably also Harry/Ginny. Not sure if that helps.

*** It ended up being awakening power, fyi

You were correct in it being H/G
