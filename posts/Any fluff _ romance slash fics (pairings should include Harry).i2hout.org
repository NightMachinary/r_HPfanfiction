Are there any plot-heavy romance fics but aren't overly sexual? A smut or two is fine but i don't want to read them in almost every chapter. :)) Pairings: Snarry / Tomarry / Drarry would be much appreciated but other ships as long as Harry's one of the pair sounds good too. Thanks!


** I mainly read Drarry, I'd recommend linkao3(All Our Secrets Laid Bare; Running on Air; Tea and No Sympathy; The Bucket List by GallaPlacidia; A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption)

For Tomarry, linkao3(love is touching souls (surely you touched mine); Don't Fuck with Florists They'll Fuck You Up; full circle by tetsurashian)

For Snarry, linkao3(Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl; The Boy Who Died a Lot; Anachronism by starcrossed)

Also, try [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]]!

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.

  A fuck-or-die fairytale in which Draco Malfoy lives a despicable and unapologetic life --- that is, until he's cursed to die unless he can fall in love with and fuck Harry Potter.
