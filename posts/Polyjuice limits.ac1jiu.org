This has been bothering me for a bit (about an hour and a half, give or take), but are there established /limits/ for Polyjuice potion? I mean, the "no human-animal" thing is a given, we see that in canon, but what about human-like creatures? Like, Giants, Trolls, Veela, etc. How about "Human+", like Werewolves, or even Metamorphmagi? For added clarity, yes, both sides, as in, being the potion taker, or person giving the hair.

​

I suppose this could also be considered a fic request, if anyone has any good ones for the subject.


** We know that half-giants can't use it, so presumably giants can't use it either, and therefore one wouldn't be able to turn into a giant. This likely extends to trolls. Fleur, despite being part-veela, was able to use it to turn into Harry, and you'd likely be able to use it to turn into her (dear lord, could you imagine?).

Anything past that is debatable.

** Polyjuice allows you to turn into anything that resembles your own body make-up. However you do not gain their magical abilities.

So you can polyjuice into dumbledore or a veela, but you won't have super magical powers or the Allure. You can look like tonks bas form, but can't metamorph yourself into anything.

You can use any of the creatures you mentioned but the polyjuice would be a failure much like hermione catgirl. It can't make you grow enough to be a troll or giant, it can't give you the ability to breathe underwater so mermaid is a failure. You would be fine polyjuicing into a werewolf, but you wouldnt transform yourself.

Transforming into a vampire would likely be fatal since your bloodflow would stop, and you don't have the undead magic to keep yourself semi-alive.

So to recap the polyjuice potion does not allow you to grow or shrink more than 50% your bodies mass and you will not gain or lose your own magical abilities. Polyjuice will not work on cross species without obvious inaccuracies, much like putting on a gorilla costume on halloween does not make you a Gorilla.

Lastly polyjuice is made for human consumption, I imagine if you are a giant and want to look like another giant you would need to recreate the potion with a few substitue ingredients.

  Tonks base form
#+end_quote

Which isn't really canon. We know that she gets stuck in HBP, but given that babies start shifting immediately, it is difficult to say whether there is a fixed base beyond functional reproductive organs or if the "base" is just a representation of who the metamorph is (eg Tonks' base could very well have pink hair and change with time).

** I'm not sure if this is a dosage issue or a hard limit of the potion itself, but the trio had an hour time limit in the second book for it to wear off. Barty Crouch Jr. in the fourth book was consistently seen drinking Polyjuice out of his flask, so this supports the idea that it has a relatively short time limit. In the last book, the waterfall in Gringotts (Thief's Downfall, I think) washed away all potions and enchantments, including Hermione's Polyjuice transformation into Bellatrix.

*** I'm about 95% sure that I read that polyjuice can last for a long time, far longer than the hour the kids had, if it's made with better ingredients and by a potion master. I want to say it can last for up to 12 hours. A second year, admittedly a gifted one, making polyjuice in a bathroom of all places (and with stolen ingredients of dubious quality) would not make the same quality potion as a Potions Master like Snape would in his lab with proper equipment, knowledge, and quality ingredients.

**** In the 4 examples I can remember that gave us a hard time limit (CoS, Crouch Jr., 7 Potters, and the Ministry infiltration in DH), the limit is 1 hour. Longer time limits aren't mentioned, and I'd assume Snape brewed the potion for the 7 Potters section, so if it were to come up at any point it'd be then. The only other place it might be brought up is Pottermore, but I really don't go on there and a lot of people consider it dubious canon at best.

** I would like to add my own question to this discussion: Does Polyjuice change the reproductive organs? I mean - let's take the scene of the Poly-Potters, where Fleur, Hermione, Ron, and the others took Polyjuice to look like Harry and allow him to escape to the Burrow. Did they all change /down to the last detail/ to Harry Potter?

If yes - then does it not invite abuse? Suddenly privacy seems like a rare good.

*** Between Moody's eye, invisibility cloaks, disillusionment charms, memory charms, confundus charms, truth serums, and the Imperius curse, privacy was already a lost cause.

I believe Polyjuice potion will change a person physically into another person right down to the DNA, for the length of the potion's effect. We know Barty Crouch Jr. actually lost his eye and leg when polyjuiced into Alastor Moody, and all the poly-Potters were equally nearsighted as the original.

If someone were to use Harry's body parts (it doesn't have to be hair) for a Polyjuice potion, they could then impregnate a girl with his (genetically) legitimate offspring. I don't believe that they would be able to speak Parseltongue and their affinity with magic wands would stay unchanged, because those qualities are not physical traits.

I'm split on the idea of werewolf traits. If the polyjuice had material from a transformed werewolf in it, I think they'd turn into a werewolf immediately, whether the moon was full or not. In fact, the polyjuiced person would probably retain most of their self-control despite the physical change, though I can see them feeling constantly over-adrenalized during the potion's effect. The kicker would be whether they would return to normal; Hermione was mutated into a half-cat by using the wrong sort of source material, and it took weeks for Madam Pomfrey to set her right.

**** First of all, thank you for your reply to my question.

I'd say: interesting. Yet another not fully thought threw concept with too few limits.

Polyjuice, in the way you have chosen to describe its effects seems oddly /over/powered and far too easy to produce for its ability. What's keep people from using this potion to destroy someone's else life? Morals? I find it doubtful. The fact that it seems not widely abused lends itself to the idea that there must be a way to forcefully stop the usage of Polyjuice, and yet, the idea lacks a solid foundation.

I want to think that the Polyjuice does not physically make you /them/ but rather makes you a copy. A good copy, for sure, but in the end you'll be a fake. I'll accept that it changes your outer appearance, but I reject the idea that it can physically alter a human being in ways of their inner organs. I reject the concept of bodily transformations through a single potion so easily crafted by second year students allowing for such drastic changes. Case in point, if a man changed into a woman, and it would indeed change their inner organs including their reproductive organs, would then in turn a man be able to impregnate the man-changed-woman? And what would happen if the Polyjuice had run its course? - Too many variables, I'd say.

While I can see that the case in point of Hermione growing cat-ears and a tail would perhaps counter my rejection, I see these traits as still falling under the point of "outer appearance".

***** By my interpretation, a man changed into a woman with polyjuice could be impregnated, but only after they'd stayed a woman long enough for the impregnation to take hold- a process that happens over days in the real world, rather than it being a binary state that changes instantly. When they reverted to male, the fertilized egg would be lost.

Canon supports the idea of gross physical modifications to the original: as I mentioned, Polyjuiced Barty was missing his leg and eye. Goyle and Crabbe were forced down to the size of little first-year witches. I doubt the principles of magic would care if the flesh being modified was inside or outside.

Incidentally, Polyjuice isn't 'easy'; it requires a gifted potioneer (Hermione and Barty were both talented in this field) and rare ingredients, along with an extended brewing cycle- at least a month, if I recall.

** Seems to boil down to appearance and muggle-y traits.

They all got Harry's eyesight, but I don't think Voldemort could have called Hermitrix through the Dark Mark.

What I've been asking myself lately, is, whether you would get back-pains or even cancer by polyjuicing into someone suffering from that.

And you would probably get Tonks' current form (like you always look like the person does at the time), and we don't even know whether Tonks has a 'base form'. (My headcanon is that she has one, and it's just her 'normal' look sans pink, spiky hair.)

**** I've always found that a bit cliché. The mini-Bellatrix that of course /only/ Harry would appreciate.

I think the closest we get in canon is her apperance when Harry stumbled across her in the castle in sixth year, and he was able to recognise her, even without having seen her mother. Basically the same, just boring.

***** About the Bellatrix resemblance. It's a movie I use quite a lot in my stories, either as part of some unintentional shift (mostly when angry/protective) and sometimes because it scares the shit out of people (either as intimidation or as part of her lack of "The ability to behave herself").

And while I'm not a fan of Tonks being Harry's Bellatrix (that is surprisingly common), it is definitely an interesting theme to play with if used occasionally.

****** I was talking about that being her 'base form', which it is in a lot of - at least early - Honks. Even The Merging has that.

I mean, sure, she could probably pull off a mean Trixibells lookalike, but that doesn't have to be her 'True Form'^{TM}. For all we know, she might have got most of her looks from Ted's side of the family...

******* Yeah, a fixed base makes little sense and its only purpose is that Harry can be "awesome" (or cringe-worthy) by being the one caring about it.

I'm a firm supporter of a fluid base which is a representation of who the metamorph is/defines themselves to be (subconsciously). The Bellatrix-shifts could be part of those random mood shifts, like red for being annoyed at her name. But many fics, even good ones like "What's a little death between friends" take this one step to far and turn her into a Bellatrix clone, behaviour wise.

** Hm...a metamorph is rare, hell it would be cool if it temporarily gave you the ability (damned, Tonk-Parts would be immensly valuable this way!) because a metamorph kind of is what he or she imagins that they are! As far as I know the "base-form" thing is fanon, so a metamorph is constantly in flux (hell, in theory they should be immortal as they can appear older or younger than they are etc.)

If you turn into Fleur, would you get the alure? Damned, that sounds like either a totally bad idea or a very good one, take your pick ;)
