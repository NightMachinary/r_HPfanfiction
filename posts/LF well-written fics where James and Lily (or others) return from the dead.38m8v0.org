** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1510989/muggledad][Muggledad's]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6780275/1/The-Last-Casualties][The Last Casualties]] is quite well-written and interesting, although it does swerve into some of the fandom cliches at some points. It's definitely worth a read, though, and there are some good twists that keep the plot interesting.

** It probably doesn't meet your preference for a lack of OOC-ness or cringey-ness, and it isn't both of them, but Harry does manage to bring Lily back to life with a completely impossible ritual in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6849022/1/An-Old-and-New-World][An Old and New World]] by Lens of Sanity. The resurrection doesn't actually happen until the second half of the story, but I would recommend it as a fun read even if it doesn't quite meet what you're looking for. (Disclaimer: This story is complete crack, so don't go into it thinking you're going to get any kind of seriousness)

** There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4641394/1/The-Substitute][The Substitute]], but in it they just /return/ to Harry's life --- turns out there were never killed in the first place. Dunno how relevant it will be to you.

** Spoilers for the fic by posting it here, but I remember liking this one. Warning, it's not James and Lily.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/][A Little More Time]] - summary: DH Spoilers Was it possible to save two lives without altering history? Was it possible to given them a future twenty years after they had supposedly died? Teddy Lupin thought so...

** The only one I remember reading that wasn't cringe-worthy was this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8990343/1/Mystery-Of-The-Veil][Mystery of the Veil]] (15 chapters, 150k words, last update 2014, Apr 26, well worth the read imo)
