Hi guys i don't know if anyone can help I've been looking for this draco malfoy fan fic for years. I cannot remember the name but I can give a brief description of the story. It was on quizilla years ago please if anyone recognizes the story, has it saved or knows the author please inform me. Ok here is the description. Character was also in the Slytherin house, her and draco had a love/hate relationship the eventually became a couple however they ended up breaking up and in the end of the fanfic she marries blaise and she see's draco at the train station with his family.
