Ravens are the loudest, most academic, philosophical, artistic, and argumentative bunch of eccentric individuals grouped into one tower. They are /Meme-tastic/. They have all the wit of Slytherins, all the gall of Gryffindors, and all the clique-y behavior of Hufflepuffs. They get away with more in the name of "academic pursuits / excellence" inside of their dorms than James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter ever would have gotten away with both inside and outside of Gryffindor Tower. The Ravenclaws squawk and haze all year 'round and learn to ignore that which is unimportant, irrelevant, and slighting, because they are simply accustomed to more chaos and mayhem amid their fellows than the outside students can comprehend.

Some colloquially describe their Head of House, Flitwick, as "chill". What he is, in actuality, is "smart". He'll let everyone get into a tizzy and consequently allow the responsible members of his House to wear themselves out trying to bring peace to the ruckus. Only then, if their efforts prove unfruitful, he will step in and merely stare everyone into quiet submission. Only the House Library and bedrooms have legitimate authority-enforced quiet. No arguments, no debates, no inflammatory remarks about the outrageous paint-style of some of the castle portraits. The rest of the dorms are a madhouse.

In order to understand certain left-field comments or even entire conversations, a Ravenclaw has to be up to date with stories, quotes, lyrics, song titles, tunes, and memes. These are all constantly referenced depending on the content of the current topic. Each generation keeps the best or most cautionary memories alive by creating their own memes and inside jokes from conversations and happenstances. The history of past generations is therefore also kept alive. Particularly mean upperclassmen will program the knocker to require outdated references as its password. This is partially why Ravenclaws can usually be found with their nose in a book; in order to understand (or invent) a cryptic conversation with their wisers and betters, they must first understand the context. (This is LITERALLY my family: "I'll be back soon." "Lord willing!" "*hums theme from an old 1966 Don Knotts movie*")

The Ravenclaws literally do nothing to hide what they are, yet somehow manage to maintain a stereotype of a 'quiet', 'bookish', and 'odd', if not 'anti-social' community. While that is sometimes true, for some students, it is also so far off of the mark for indicating what their lifestyle at Hogwarts is actually like that it is now a running joke. "How outrageous can we be outside of our dorms while still being seen as boring bookworms?"

I like to imagine that Luna's odd behavior was inherited from both her Ravenclaw Alumni parents. She had been sorted into a House which would uncover the origins of the ancient "Nargles" meme, discover its long-forgotten meaning and applications from centuries past, and then just run with it. The hazing was absolutely normal and not something to be concerned about at all, no matter what anyone else said, hence Luna's complete and utter lack of concern. Also, many of the 'odd' things she says or does is a mix of quoting or referencing something she picked up either by her parents or by her classmates and not really knowing how to talk to people.

Ravenclaw becomes my favorite House if I imagine it this way: chaos. Absolute chaos. Flitwick tranquilly sipping his tea. Outside of the House: Slytherins getting into petty scraps with Gryffindors and vice-versa. The Ravens glide on by. It's so stupid it's not even worth a reaction. They are so unaffected by insults that it slides off of them like water off a duck's back. Ravens hear about the Most Notorious Hogwarts Pranksters? "Pfft. Amateurs."

** “So, any luck with Fleur?” Harry asked Ron as the taller came into the common room. He didn't look exactly down, more perplexed.

“Um no. Roger Davies already asked her out...” Ron started. Harry stayed silent as Ron's face scrunched up.

“I-I got her just as she said yes to him.” The redhead mumbled uncertainty. “Davies kind of just jumped up and screamed something-I-I don't know..”

With a frustrated huff Ron turned to his friend.

“Harry. Do you know what ‘Poggers' means?
