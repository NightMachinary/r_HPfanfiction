I haven't really read any good fics featuring an Anti-Hero Harry. I don't want a dark Harry that wants to kill everyone but one who is dark on the outside but good inside. Maybe similar to Tom Riddle only actually good?

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.

** I think Hail Odysseus by Brennus covers this pretty nicely. It's a Slytherin Harry who was raised by Grindelwald to be a pretty ruthless magical soldier.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

** (Imprisoned realm by lovehp) It's dimension travel and canon!Harry meets the Death Eater dickhead of himself and finds out who the boy rally is. Very dark because of adult themes.
