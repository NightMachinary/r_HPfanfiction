I'm curious to see what makes some fannon pairings work. I do understand the basic reasoning, but why do you like it? For example, fannon Dramione is basically that great tension of desire be hatred- torn between two sides of a war, two people can't help but succumb to their most human emotions. Harry/Voldemort is that idea that two people who hate each other would also feel strongly for one another, and something about being marked equal. The idea of prophecy murder acting as some sort of aphrodisiac. And it usually allows for Dark!Harry with strong Pureblood overtones. Other fannon couples like Remus/Sirius, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Ron/Pansy, etc. - what do you like about them?


** I've always harbored a secret love for Tonks/Charlie Weasley. I can imagine an exchange like this:

#+begin_quote
  /Charlie/: I like dangerous creatures.

  /Tonks/: I'm a dangerous creature. (/trips over the troll leg and sets all the portraits off screaming/)
#+end_quote

As for Wolfstar, I've never liked it. I can see Remus harboring a secret crush for Sirius and that's why he said yes to Tonks, but JKR has /heavily/ implied that Sirius is straight.

*** Wolfstar is a ship I have no objections to in theory, but in practice I seem to never like it. I think the problem is that it actually takes a lot of work to get Sirius and Remus to a place where they could be in a relationship - it's implied in the books that Sirius is closer with James than Remus, there's the whole almost-turning-Remus-into-a-murderer thing, and both Sirius and Remus thought the other was the traitor. It's not that those things couldn't be overcome, but a lot of fics have them get together more easily than I can believe.

**** A lot of fics have them 'get back together' when Sirius is found out as innocent, but I don't think all of the past stuff could have happened if they were in fact a couple (or at least, I hope not; that's even more unhealthy than SnapexLily). In PoA they're also described as hugging like brothers, which is very different from a more romantic hug.

The only way I can see Sirius and Remus together is during OotP, where Sirius is completely broken and just latches onto Remus for love. In other words, he's using Remus.

** For a pairing to work for me, I have to genuinely like both characters as they existed in canon. I hated Draco in the books, for example, as was intended. So I can't possibly read him in the context of a relationship-driven story, and I have a particular aversion the idea of Draco/Hermione or Draco/Ginny for both personal and practical reasons. Conversely, Harry and Ginny separately were my favorite characters so I usually exclusively read that pairing.

Pairings also need to stay true to their canon characteristics to work for me. If you're completely changing the personality of a character to make them work with another, it just shows that the pairing doesn't actually work.

Finally, context matters for pairings to work. If you're writing Slytherin!Harry, then I can get behind him with a Slytherin OC. But canon Harry in Gryffindor probably can't realistically be paired with a Slytherin due to his own inherent biases. Which makes a story like The Changeling so good since [[/u/annerbhp][u/annerbhp]] actually was able to expertly pull it off.

** I do not care about pairings themselves. What I do care about is that the characters develop organically, that it doesn't feel forced. With some pairings (and with every single thing ever for some bad writers), this is very hard and sometimes even impossible to achieve.

I've seen some people write those weird pairings, in ways that made sense, but doing so requires talent and dedication and patience, something that many writers who write fanfics simply do not have (you know, “Sturgeon's Law” and all). Case in point, I've read a story that has Harry be in a relationship with Tom Riddle (it's a time travel kind of thing), and the whole thing is justified well enough but at the same time is really rather sad because you know that on Tom's side there's just attachment and convenience whereas on Harry's side it's basically a result of having gone through a lot of crap and Tom being his first point of familiarity in so long. Likewise, I've read a fanfic which gave a very neat impression of a Draco/Ginny pairing and boy was that one hilarious because they basically both got into it for profit and it just somehow happened and you can't help but laugh at it but at the same time it doesn't feel forced at all.

So yeah, for me if you can make the pairing read natural and the characters feel like themselves and your writing is good, for as long as I'm in the mood for romance and your style isn't completely opposite to what I like I can read it and enjoy it. But I don't particularly care about pairings, let alone specific ones.

** Some don't work because there is no feasible way they can be done, and if there is I have not seen it done.

Harry/Voldemort: He killed Harry's parents, attempted to kill him, and in general has tried to fuck up his life every step of the way. Voldemort in canon is incapable of understanding love, so this just won't happen.

Dramione. Draco always has to be OOC and just isn't redeemable after a certain point. (I would argue Year 5 or 6) and if this is to be done massive changes must occur to his character making more of an OC than Draco. Hitler and the Pope aren't going to be friends unless Hitler isn't Hitler.

Harry/Tonks. Hard to find moments where they are actually in the same place due to age gap, Tonks needs a legitimate reason for being interested in Harry rather than "OMG he didn't ask me to change". Harry is at Hogwarts 9/12 months a year, hardly conducive to a relationship with someone with a real job.

Harry/SlytherinOC, Harry/Ginny, and Harry/Fleur are all pairings I can see working out.

**** Susan also doesn't really have much canon characterization- she's a Hufflepuff, in the movies she's part of the group with Ernie that thinks Harry is the Heir of Slytherin, and in the book her first appearance is in OotP with the DA. Susan has canon characterization on a level comparable to Demelza.

***** Still more than Daphne Greengrass, though, and yet there's more fics featuring Daphne than Susan. We also know that Susan has a similar background to Harry, so there's a bit more to her than any girl (other than Ginny) on the Quidditch team. A good set-up would be the romance beginning in sixth-year, once Amelia dies.

Since JKR seems to follow a trend of girls with plant names = true love, here's a list of canon girls who are options:

- Ginevra: "white" and "juniper"
- Daphne: "laurel" and "victory"
- Astoria: either from "aster", a flower which means "star", or "astor", which means "hawk". I'm thinking "aster," though, since she's paired with Draco. This means that the Malfoy family also follows the plant-name = true love trend, since Narcissa = daffodils. (JKR obviously intended it to either be Rose or Lily Luna as Scorpius' love interest.)
- Susan: "lily" and from the Bible
- Padma: "lotus"
- If you want to do slash, Anthony: associated with flowers as well

Incidentally, Amelia is also the name of a flower. JKR seems to have an obsession (and apparently I do, too, since I know all of this...)

/Edit/: I also forgot Lavender Brown.

/Edit 2/: I've seen some slash and fem-Harry with Oliver Wood, too.

Harry gets lot of attention and hides from it, we don't see Fleur let it faze her. She is older, I'm not a big fan of Harry/Fleur in 4th year but later, especially if she never meets Bill it could work. Ginny is the safe choice, Fleur is Harry standing up and embracing who he is.

*** I think the key to making Dramione possible is either a long-term change where Draco is slowly converted from a DE and then starts to fall in love with Hermione later, or an event that is so shocking that it tears apart his worldview in a way that he can either go full-blown crazy trying to deny it all, or be forced to confront the truth (which is what the story will follow), and take some time in introspection and research to move away from his previous views somewhat quickly.

****** I kinda see where you're coming from, from the perspective of Draco essentially being an OC in most fanfics, but it seems nitpicky to say that it invalidates the fanfic pairing. IMO there's an implicit understanding that almost any fanfiction Draco, even the ones with good characterization, aren't "really" Draco Malfoy. This can be a gradual change in some fics or a sudden change in others, but it's a spectrum, not absolute. Otherwise the vast majority of fics, even good ones, don't actually have "Harry Potter" as a character.

That said, I hate reading any pairing with Draco as a primary character, or basically any fic that tries to "redeem" him. I don't mind him if he's in the background, or undergoing character development, or even an important character, but I basically don't feel like reading stories where he's the primary protagonist.

** The pairings I like mostly work because the characters work well together in my head. That takes into the account the fanon I have about them, the headcanon and their canon personalities, as well as my wishes for canon and the pairings within that. For example, I wished for a final Harry / Hermione pairing in canon, and the necessary lead-up towards it within the last three or so books of the series.

What does not work - as in, absolutely never works for me, are abuser with abused. Draco and Hermione, Voldemort and Harry, and also Snape and... well, basically anyone. When a pairing is the focus of a story, I dislike reading about abusive relationships or even potentially abusive ones. And Voldemort... Voldemort is literally characterized by his lack of love for anybody. Seeing him, in particular, with anybody is an extreme turnoff for me (given we talk main series Voldemort, and not, for example, a young Tom Riddle).

I also find a huge age difference to be something I dislike. Harry / McGonagall, or Harry / Voldemort are such examples. If an entire generation can fit between the characters, its /waaay/ above the line. Personally, Harry / Tonks is already scratching the upper limits (even though I really like this pairing).

And some pairings I just dislike for the tropes associated with them. Harry / Daphne is a red flag for me, because of the Slytherin Ice Queen trope. Certain buzzwords combined with Harry / Ginny are as well (for example "manipulative anybody") as they often go into childish OTP preaching / gloating. A /metric shitton/ of Harry / Hermione is */awful/*, and I really keep a lookout for certain buzzwords to see if I maybe like it (funnily enough, given my preference for canon). Draco / Hermione often whitewash the genocidal, racist and fascist movement Draco glorifies in order to make him more palatable. And so on and so forth...

** Harry/Hermione: I don't hate it, but I can't see it working out. They have zero sexual or romantic chemistry between them and it's much less convincing than Harry/Ginny which is at least canon. Ron's hardly the obstacle between them; drop him into the ocean and I'd still have a hard time believing Harry/Hermione. I suppose it's partly because I identify with neither Harry nor Hermione.

All [previous gen]/[Harry's gen] pairings like Snape/Hermione or Sirius/Harry I dislike on principle. It's okay I suppose if the younger party is at least 30, but they rarely ever are. Time travel doesn't make it okay in my head; one of the parties would have known the older version of the other and that's arguably unfair.

I have a morbid fascination with torturing Ron by pairing him with characters I hate, so I like to pair him with Draco et al. I despise Draco/Hermione because of the /extreme/ power imbalance (practically wealthy Nazi boy/immigrant Jewish girl), but I can work with Draco/Ron, Ron/Pansy, etc. Ron is familiar with the gritty details of the magical world and at worst he's a blood-traitor to the other party; if anyone could cast doubt on the Weasleys' ancestry then the Ministry would've done it in DH.
