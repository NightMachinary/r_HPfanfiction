I hate having to carve up chapters to upload.

Edit: forgot to add, it's safari I have this issue with.


** That's definitely not a file size limit - I've seen chapters much longer. It might just be an issue with your Internet connection - try the troubleshooting wizard. Of course, your ISP may be throttling your uploads to reduce piracy and/or bandwidth. And sometimes the website just blanks - for whatever reason, the request times out or something. Try again tomorrow?

*** It's a consistent issue, i've never been able to upload large chapters via safari. I had to reinstall chrome to upload it.
