** To be honest, I usually stay away from self-inserts. But if I had to pick a good one, I'll say read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10356239/1/Disenchanted][Disenchanted]] by Yuuki no Yuki. It's a surprisingly good self-insert fic that I was invested when I found the story. The author actually made a decent plot with excellent an writing style even though the fic is from a first person POV. The author really did a number on my emotions with this story as well, which says something about the quality of the fic.

  When I imagined being a witch I imagined magic and flying. I imagined proving to the world that Slytherin and Evil are not synonymous. I imagined love and adventure. But most of all I imagined waking up-eleven years old-on the Hogwarts Express alongside Harry and Ron. So why, pray-tell, am I in a nursery, in 1970? This is not what I imagined! A realistic SI.
