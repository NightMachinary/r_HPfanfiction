Hi all. Let's get the things I don't like out of the way.

No Mslash involving harry, no fem!harry, no harem with more than 3 participants including harry, no crossovers, and no evil!harry

Please only rec things that are longer than 80k as a stand alone or are a part of a series that is longer than 80k.

I prefer stories that are 6th yr+ or post hogwarts. I tire of reading 1st-5th year stories.

LF harry/luna that isn't just smut.

LF Indy/political/lord style stories, or a combination.

LF do-over/Dimension travel/Time travel, or a combination.

I always prefer a Greyer harry who isn't afraid to take the fight to his enemies with more than stunners!

Pairings, and tropes, do not really matter, though I do lean more towards harmony, as long as there is a romance I'm happy.

Combinations of what im looking for is fine. Hit me with your best recs. Thanks!

** I believe Your last word of the sentence starting with LF Harry/Luna triggered the bot.

Try Luna's Hubby by Meteroricshipyards

For a Greyer Harry that takes the fight to the Deatheaters try Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence

The Story Don't Look Back in Anger by RobSt gives Harry a unique power

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
