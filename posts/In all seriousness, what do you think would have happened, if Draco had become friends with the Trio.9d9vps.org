A lot of fanfics -- all across the spectrum of writing -- have explored this concept: what if Draco was the fourth member of what fanon calls 'The Golden Trio'? Some have taken the idea seriously, while others have not. But what do you really think would have happened, bearing in mind that the events are derived from (mostly) canon?

Picture this: the events of book 1 occur more-or-less the same, though by the end of the book, Draco is puzzled as to why his olive branch to Harry had been snapped.

Come book 2, he decides to utilise subtlety and cunning to a greater degree, particularly through being less antagonistic to Harry (and to a lesser degree, Ron and Hermione). Basilisk is unleashed, yadda yadda, then comes the nail that changes everything.

"Filthy little mudblood!"

In this AU, the adverse reaction to the slur catches Draco unexpectedly. Yes, it wasn't a /nice/ word, but it couldn't that bad. Right? He goes to the library to investigate the word's origins and its history -- what he finds isn't pretty, which is what you get for researching the (mostly) uncensored version of events. Seeds of conflict have been planted in his mind. As time goes by, Draco tries desperately to reaffirm the beliefs he was raised with, only for it to backfire, with the formation of his new perspective. After much internal strife, Draco tries reaching out to the Trio, only to get rejected. He doesn't dare reveal this to Crabbe and Goyle (secretly Harry and Ron). Then it happens, Hermione is petrified.

Without Hermione, Harry and Ron have no clue as to who could be the Heir or what lies in the Chamber. Plus, without Hermione, their abysmal lack of subtlety allows Draco to overhear some details -- maybe this is his chance to show them that he was serious. Draco visits Hermione in the Hospital Wing (insert awkward, one-sided dialogue), where he discovers the note in Hermione's petrified hand. Now that he knows the monster, he researches everything he can find on the subject of Basilisks; it helps to be a part of a 'Dark' family. Once he has everything he can get his hands on, Draco relays the information to Harry and Ron, who don't trust him but accept the information.

Ginny is saved, yadda yadda, although the end of CoS sees the Trio being willing to give Draco Malfoy the chance to be a friend. How does the rest of the series play out, with Draco going through a 'Zuko-like' arc?


** Draco still called for genocide in the same book. It wasn't just one insult, it was a deeply rooted belief.

If you want to change things, he needs to question the ideology first. Hermione is living proof that pureblood supremacy is bullshit and if you want him to change in a believable way, you need a longer time frame. End of year one, Hermione is top of the year. He talks to his father, but the answers aren't satisfactory. He talks to his mother, who points out that her half-blood niece is a metamorph. Draco decides to observe things in Hogwarts. It takes time to change beliefs on such a fundamental level (unless the Red Army swarms your country while the Allies wasted your cities and there's some large-scale denazification going on).

If you have Draco question things at the beginning of book 2, the real Change would probably not happen in the same year and no big changes in the next one either. The Buckbeak incident and the aftermath might even be similar.

*** I want to see this so bad. I'd like the story to show little moments of all of these suggestions, followed by a canon divergence in like year 5.

3 - I can't see Hermione trusting someone like Draco when she has a huge secret.

4 - Some author would use this year to replace Ron with Draco, which isn't what I want.

5 - The perfect year for Draco to swoop in and help the trio. Use his authority to keep the DA hidden, help Harry escape (or even confirm Sirius is safe, I dunno). Just perfect timing. Then you get the whole 6th and 7th years to show them getting closing and more trusting.

*** This is why I both love and hate dramione fics: a lot never bother with character growth; they just alter draco in the very beginning, which is often simply infuriating. But a great dramione will lead his character on a path of self-doubt and discovery. In canon, Draco had so many opportunities to question his circumstances and become better. JKR never went there, sadly. So reading a fic where a transition from 'pureblood racist snob' to 'conflicted hero' is handled gradually and poignantly...well that can be extremely fulfilling.

I always scoff at the notion that if Harry just had shook Draco's hand they would have become best friends. I see no way this would have happened. You'd have to change Draco's entire upbringing for him to seriously consider Harry as a friend (instead as some kind of political maneuver) and even then Harry might not look favourably towards a friendship with him, because he clearly dislikes the snooty attitude. Any kind of comment about Ron, Hermione or other of Harry's Gryffindor classmates or Quidditch teammates would kill this pseudo friendship immediately and entirely.

I'm not sure what you are alluding to here? Mudblood is not that difficult to grasp even for a 12 year old. What would he have to learn about the word? You don't do Draco any favours by painting him as some kind of imbecile who doesn't understand what it means to call someone's blood dirty. Canon Draco hates Muggles and thinks they are filthy, not much more than animals. He doesn't have to look that up in a book.

I always thought the idea to de-convert Draco would be interesting, but some nuance is needed to pull it off. As [[/u/Hellstrike]] has already pointed out it needs to be a slow process. This necessitates that you don't take the easy way out, like

I hate, hate, *hate* writing like this. It's incredibly lazy. [You may have seen me criticize the way Ron returns in Deathly Hallows, getting there just in time to save Harry's life]. If you want to bring Draco into the Trio he has to do it on his own merits and not just be planted in a position where he gets to save the trio somehow. Particularly the whole ordeal shouldn't just be about the Trio accepting Draco, but also about Draco accepting and understanding the Trio as people who deserve his respect: They have to somehow 'prove' themselves to Draco to make it believable, not just the other way around (and preferably without them having to save his life 5 times in a row until the idea permeates his thick brain).

That's no easy task. Draco despises Harry and his parents in particular (blood traitors and a mudblood, who were in league with Dumbledore the barmy muggle lover). He needs some reason to come to understand that the whole pure-blood ideology is bullshit and somehow come to the conclusion that Harry and his parents are good people. Getting Draco to genuinely respect Ron (blood-traitors *and* poor) or Hermione (ewww, Muggles, she's barely even magical) might be even harder. All in all quite a tall order! If that is conveyed convincingly the issue of the Trio accepting Draco will be minor. They are nice and aside from Ron not super prejudiced, if he truly changed they will give him a chance.

In general I prefer the idea of a AU with differences prior to Hogwarts (for example Draco distrusts his father for some reason, a minor change that could have huge impact: Draco starts to think that the opposite of what dear old Dad claims is usually true) or just getting Draco as an ally without becoming friends: There are practical reasons for him (and possibly Narcissa) to abandon their cause. They don't immediately have to become best buddies with their former enemies. This grudging cooperation would be a more natural position for him to slowly de-convert ("Oh hey, wow, I didn't need to intimidate or bribe them in order to trust them with xy").

Edit: One of my favorite parts of HPMOR is when the Harry in that fic tries to seriously de-convert Draco and after all the work... it just doesn't work and Draco is still a bigot.

*** I can imagine an AU where Draco eventually is friendly towards Harry and Hermione, IF the mudblood incidents don't happen. I don't see Ron accepting Malfoy or the other way around however. They both hate each other. But unlike Harry and Hermione, who got in his good books through their actions, there is little canon Ron does which would impress Malfoy. I think scoring Lavender might be a first.

Ohh same! Would've upvoted just for that (but the rest of your post is good too).

** Ahhh I have been hunting fanfics about this. If someone knows of one, let me know. I am very curious about it.

Draco had some... peculiar education, let's not forget his slurs against Hermione or everyone's family. It could have been interesting for me to see him being called out, to be educated and to break the circle of... well. Being what he was expected to be from his family. He clearly cares about his parent's approval more than anything else... I have a lot of feelings about this, lol. Not to romanticize him, he did bad things, he is not a hero! But since the books are from Harry's perspective... ehhhh we will never know.

Cursed Child, polemic I know, kinda showed us that... he is not evil. And as he matured he was able to do what he probably never got from his parents. To let his son BE. To support him. To care about his wife. I think he did all the things Lucius didn't. He didn't want his son to carry his dad's reputation on his shoulders. To some extent, Harry wants the same for his son.

Draco Malfoy is not a character to romanticize, but to analyze. We know so little about him!

*** Also, if a change had occurred during his student years I think it could have been interesting to start at POA and just... develop and mature in HBP. He was breaking emotionally speaking. All eyes were on him. There was /some/ hesitation to finish his task, maybe even remorse. He cried and Myrtle tried to comfort him! He lashed on Harry in the bathroom. But that, in my head, was the moment where he could have let his emotions push him to do the right thing. That moment of weakness was perfect for Harry to maybe step in and. I dont know, be there. I think if Harry had known he needed or wanted help, he could have helped him. Potter is stubborn and his hero complex could have lead the story to places my imagination can only begin to scratch the surface hahaha!

** I think you'd have to model draco more similarly to Sirius and his upbringing. We know that sirius' parents raised him with a lot of pureblood ideology and he ended up bucking the trend. Maybe sirius is naturally rebellious or his parents were more abusive. Im not sure. So maybe with draco, maybe narcissa was less loving to him, maybe Lucius failed to stay out of Azkaban. That might bring draco more towards being friends with the trio or even being sorted into gryffindor.
