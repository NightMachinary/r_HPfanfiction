** Hmm...well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7911105/1/Defending-Sirius-Black][there's a short fic by Luiz4200 called Defending Sirius Black]].

It's a bit poorly written, but I find it a guilty pleasure nonetheless. It's about Vernon Dursley deciding to try and get Sirius a trial when he's first imprisoned, and everyone else going out of their way to try and stop it.
