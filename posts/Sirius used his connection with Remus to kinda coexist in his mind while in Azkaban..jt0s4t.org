1 year into his sentence in Azkaban, Sirius's mind "snaps" however, due their bond (plus whatever they did to put their personalities into the map) he is able to coexist in Remus's mind. Due to Remus being a werewolf, noone believes him that Sirius is innocent. You can have Dumbledore as a good guy whom couldn't fight the ministry on it or as someone whom dismissed Remus, maybe even sadly thinking the stress has made him delusional. One major point should be Sirius not being free till after book 1 (just so Harry can kinda get the same background). Was also thinking Dumbledore could have used them having their joint skills in one form in order for them to safely hunt Horocruxs(cuz they can't be possesed). Meaning your fic would just be the journey to handle the existing Voldemort spirit and finding a way to exorcise Harry. Anyway, your choice obviously, just seems to be a fun premise. And explains how literally anyone could be functioning 10 years into Azkaban.
