I want to get into writing fanfiction and was wondering if anyone has any tips or prompt ideas or just basically anything that'll help me on my first story ever thanks


** Write the stuff you want to read. Likelihood is someone else wants to read it too.

If someone messages you to join a competition/forum do it. Best decision I've ever made was joining a writing comp. Great craic, great people, really good fun.

Prompts are fantastic. Wherever you find them. Sometimes you have an idea but can't get the words out, a prompt gives you an anchor to work around.

Don't get disheartened if the comments aren't flying in. That's life. Write anyway. I love getting comments from my "regulars", even if it's the same few people. It's nice to see their names come back.

Have fun. Just have fun. Write for you, not for other people. That's the point of it. Have fun.

** The best advice I can give you is to just write.

It sounds simple, but this is where most people fail, and where most people who write chapter 1 fail. They never finish chapter 2.

You'll learn far more from practice than studying theory, especially if you're starting out.

I'd say the top 3 technical writing tips I cna give which are applicable basically to every genre, story and scenario are

1) Use proper paragraphing. Walls or text are bad and should be avoided like the plague as it makes it difficult for your reader to read.

2) Use said 80% of the time, and relegate adjectives, adverbs and special verb speech tags for emphasis

3) show, don't tell (okay so the actual advice is know when to show and when to tell, but most new writers can't figure out when to show and tell too often)

If you wanna get into a lot of specifics, I've written a lot of writing essays here - [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/writing-advice-thread.37586/#post-1035804]]

** When I started writing my fic, I had a basic premise in my head, and went from there, and I kind of make it up as I go.

It works for me, but it's not a good habit. I would advice you to take the time to roughly outline as many chapters in advance as you can. It will help you maintain focus on the story, and help you discover plot holes.

Be consistent in your characterisation. And if people do change, add proper context, and build up to it. Context is extremely important.

Details are what can make or break stories, but do not get bogged down in excessive details that have little to no relevance to the story and world. Often, less is more. Do not spoon feed your readers. Engage them, and sometimes provide just enough detail for them to form their own images in their heads.

Grammar is very important, and be sure to break up your text in decent paragraphs. Huge blocks of text are hard to read on a phone. Also, be sure to start a new paragraph, whenever a new person starts speaking.

And lastly, write for your own enjoyment. Getting a nice review is nice, but do not depend on them for motivation.

Hope this helps and good luck!

** Write what you want to see in the world over what you think others want to read. One spite fic is good and healthy once in a while but if you're only writing when you're mad about someone else's fics or fan theories you're probably going to be miserable

Remember that even if only one other person in the world likes your stuff, it was worth uploading. Stats can be helpful, but they can also be really easy to obsess over, so you have to find the balance that works for you

Save your favourite feedback and have it on hand, because our brains are naturally predisposed to remember the bad ones way more than we do the good for some reason, and we're often our own worst critic, so it's good to have proof to show your brain ‘look, this person thought your story was awesome and you were able to make a stranger's day!'

There are arseholes out there who think they're a critic for the New York Times or something and act like you should take their criticism with thanks and rewrite your whole story for them and it's stupid. I have found that if you write what kind of feedback you work best with, then people are more likely to do that rather than just meekly taking whatever people want to give. If you want to know how you think you did with a certain character or whether they think that the plot is moving forward well or something then people will respond to that with enthusiasm. I generally don't want concrit because that's just not what I'm here for, so the one time I did expressly ask for it people were happy to really, but if I just ask them to tell me what they liked in the chapter then they'll respond to that as well. I think a big part of it is that peeps are often reading when they're tired or they just can't think of what to put into a comment, so if you given them a prompt or question they're more comfortable replying

Remember you're doing this labour for free and out of love and that's awesome, so don't let people dictate to you. Even if you're filling prompts they shouldn't be entitled brats because you're giving them something that's really valuable for free

** When you write dialogue between characters, try to avoid writing “___ said” every time. Readers will quickly find it annoying and may drop the fic. Not only that, but ‘said' is a pretty sterile word. Use words that will fit the emotion you want to convey. Like an angry character will growl, snap, shout, hiss or roar their dialogue while a depressed character might mumble, murmur, or mutter.

*** This is garbage advice. Said should be the overwhelming majority of your speech tags, and you use specific ones for emphasis of key dialogue.

**** Maybe it's personal preference or a poorly articulated point.

But dialogue like the following gets annoying quickly.

"You're putting too much sugar in the tea." Harry said,

"No I'm not." Ron said.

"You have more sugar than tea in your cup." Harry said.

"You two stop arguing." Hermione said.

***** That's why you mix it up with action, the occasional adverb and said synonym. But that's a step you build off of teaching someone to use said first. Teaching someone not to use it in favor of said synonyms means they don't progress beyond that without needing to unlearn the wrong way lessons.

But you advice as it is would read like this:

"You're putting too much sugar in the tea," Harry pointed out.

"No I'm not," Ron insisted.

"You have more sugar than tea in your cup, " Harry shot back.

"You two stop arguing, " Hermione snapped.

Which is much much worse than a pure said setup. Imagine this buy for an entire chapter and its mentally exhausting to read

****** We'll have to chalk this up to personal preference and agree to disagree.

I find the first example to be rather flat and lifeless and the second to be more lifelike.
