*GENRE:* Action or Adventure

*WORD COUNT:* Bigger is better

*COMPLETED?* Preferably, but I don't mind as long as its a good read

*SHIPS?* Insane!Harry/Luna is my OTP, but I don't really mind as long as its not Snape/(Harry or Hermione) or Dramione

*WRITING QUALITY?* I'd rather read a well written Dramione fic than a crummy Harry/Luna. Puttin' that out there


** linkffn(The Life He Leads) hopefully that works.

It's adventure/drama with Neville as the BWL, and Harry is Dumbledore's apprentice. It's Harry/Fleur with onesided Harry/Tonks.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is a "traditional" adventure, kind of Bildungsroman/Hero's Journey-esque. Very AU, since it was written way back before HBP/DH, but quality writing and it mostly ends on a good spot despite being unfinished. Technically H/G, but it's really a Gen fic, as they spend 95% of the story apart.

** The Coven of Echoes by hwimsey is a good read. Hinny for the pairing. It's on Phoenix Song, completed, an older fic but good. Not sure of word count

They decide to work independently from the Order of the Phoenix, and attempt to take down You-Know-Who from the inside. Will they succeed?
