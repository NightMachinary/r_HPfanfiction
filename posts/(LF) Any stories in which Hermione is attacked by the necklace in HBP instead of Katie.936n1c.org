** Here have one I made just for you: "Harry are you sure Hermione was supposed to meet us here?" asked Ron. He was questioning if Harry really heard Hermione saying she'd be back at the road or he just was busy off goggling off at Ginny to notice Hermione speaking. "She said she'd be here before she ran after Katie," Harry answered shivering in the winter cold. "Katie? Katie Bell?" Harry nodded in reply "yeah I think I saw her in an argument with uh," Ron scratched his head through his hat, "Leanna...Leanne?". Then out of the flurry of snow a scream echoed from the outskirts of Hogsmeade. Ron and Harry looked at each other in horror. It sounded like Hermione. "Katie, please, your not yourself" begged Leanne. She knew something about Katie wasn't right, she was detached and distant as if every emotion was drained of her. Katie held onto her package tighter and attempted to walk away only to be held back by Hermione's grip on her arm. "Katie what is going on with you?" Katie violently shoved Hermione back attempting to free herself from her grip now joined with Leanne's. She thrashed on their grips thrice more and with her quidditch strength freed herself knocking Hermione onto the ground. Katie looked back at them with blank eyes, then Hermione swiftly wipped her wand. "Petrificus Totalus". Katie was out of control, this was the mildest thing she could do to stop her. "Katie, god what happened to you," Leanne whined "you have been so obsessed with this package all day". Katie's petrified hands were clawed deep in the wrapping, so deep in fact that as Leanne pulled the package out of her best friend's hands it ripped. An opal necklace dropped onto the cold ground between Leanne and Hermione. Hermione noted the strange design wondering where it originated. "We need to call a professor, Leanne could you go run back to the Hogwarts gate. I'll stay here with Katie". Leanne looked distraught have being asked to leave her best friend. Hermione looked down at the necklace and picked it up. Upon contact everything turned empty, every sight, every emotion, every memory torn away. Suddenly the emptiness pounced on her, turning on Hermione making every nerve on her body sear and drag her down as if to beat her into hell like a rag doll. "Hermione!" screamed Harry. He saw Leanne grasping on Hermione's ankles desperately trying to pull her down. He saw the glazed look on Katie's face looking back at Ron in horror. However Ron wasn't there, he had already rushed to join Leanne in pulling her down. She kept floating in the same place, arms out, emotionless, and eerily...peaceful. Suddenly Hermione fell out of the sky landing on Ron's now sprawled out body, flattening him on the ground. Harry looked around as to what to do when he heard a familiar "crack". The professors apperated several feet behind Harry staring at Hermione's unmoving body. He could see his best friend tearing up and turning red in anger along with Leanne scooting away from Hermione helplessly in fear. Hermione please don't go, please, thought Harry. To be Continued...(that is if anyone messages me to)
