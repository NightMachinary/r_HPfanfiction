So, the thought struck me as I was thinking about how Hogwarts would handle a transgender student. Remember, this isn't exactly a trivial issue, even if the individual in question doesn't suffer from body dysmorphia; the dorms are warded along gender, or perhaps sex, lines. If Harry feels more like a Harriet... this might be an actual factual /deal/ that the teachers need to come in and do something about.

.

However, in a broader sense, /would/ they? Wizarding Britain is... pretty conservative. Sure, Dumbledore was gay, but that was apparently something no one actually /knew/ until after he was dead. Most of those who knew him just thought he was an eternal bachelor, which is basically the textbook definition of someone who never came out of the closet. Sure, maybe there are potions and charms to let men get pregnant... but even if there are, that doesn't mean those sorts of relationships are publicly accepted. Think back to when Ron warned Hermione about being thought of as a 'Scarlet Woman', and then she was sent letters containing potentially lethal or permanently disfiguring poisons. 'Scarlet Woman' is a fancy way of saying whore or adulterer, someone who works in the redlight district or has a scarlet letter on their chest. That doesn't sound like a progressive society to me; that sounds like a culture stuck in the 1700's... which they are in most respects anyway.

.

So! Let's talk about fics that deal with sex, sexual issues, and gender issues, with depth, nuance, and care. Let's talk about what reasonable assumptions we can make, and why we can make them, and what that means for our characters.

.

Is incest common? What do wizards even consider incest? Consider the Gaunts, where Morphin and Merope where set to be married. Consider the Blacks, where Orion and Walburga were second cousins. Sure these might be outliers, but are they major outliers?

.

Are gay couples socially acceptable? Do most gay people get told they are 'just confused' and quietly bundled off into an arranged marriage? Do they never even realize they might be gay? What about polyamory? Are the wizards throwbacks to Victorian values, or perhaps even further to Roman sexual promiscuity?

.

Are transgendered people socially acceptable? Tonk's metamorphmagus is never shown to extend that far, but it doesn't seem impossible. Some ancient cultures considered trans or hermaphroditic people to be a little bit magic, male and female in one body, etc. Might the wizarding world adopt something like this view?

.

Underage couples; Hogwarts is a mixed-sex boarding school in the ass end of Scotland; magic is good for cleaning up all sorts of messes and 'accidents' (cough-fetus deletus-cough). The movies showed some pretty enthusiastic tonsil hockey going on, and the upper years are certainly getting in the occasional snog. But what about more... energetic activities? What do the wizarding families think about this? Given the fairly strict bloodline keeping practices the purebloods have inheritance is probably very important; are bastards a big problem? More than one fic has postulated something in the vein of 'bloodline theft', where a member (haha) of an important house is seduced in an attempt to generate a claimant to the house's inheritance; this seems perhaps a bit excessive in a reasonable society, but it is totally possible that something like custody exists in Wizarding Britain. Might a pureblood be able to easily sue for custody of any child produced?

.

Remember, no idea is good or bad but that the writer makes it so. It is even theoretically possible that a marriage contract fic could be good! So, what fics do you know that approach such topics from an interesting perspective, or discus the issues in a unique way.

.

For your consideration:

.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7900501][The girl who lived (again)]] - Harry is trans and has trouble with that.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]] - Inheritance is simple and poly-ships are easy to manage if you act sensibly.

.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11634921/1/Itachi-Is-That-A-Baby][Itachi, is that a baby?]] - have to include this for the funny factor; Dumbledore is very emphatic about ensuring Hogwarts is a teen-pregnancy free zone... even if that requires he get right up in his student's faces about it.


** I think that being transgender would not be an issue for magicals; it would probably be easy to permanently change gender. Gay couples, where no partner wishes to change their sex could prove problematic. Given that a large number of characters in HP were permanent bachelors, children might not be the most important thing ever, but gay couples in earlier times may have been taboo if only because it produced no children. Of course, same sex couples may be able to get pregnant, but Mpreg could still be seen as an abomination, because it would be particularly unnatural, compared to women, who already carry all of the equipment needed to carry children to term.

Bloodline theft may be an issue, and I think disgust at Scarlet Women may partially extend from that. However, since we've seen the possibility of being disowned, other than stealing coveted magical traits, I don't think they would let someone born of this theft gain access to the inheritance. Underage sex may be highly frowned upon, if only because it hinders one's ability to get schooling. Or maybe not, given house-elves. But getting back on topic, since magic is so highly prized, an incomplete education could be looked down upon.

Though it's also much easier to manipulate the mind. Coin toss between whether wizards resolve gender dysphoria by "fixing" the body or the mind to match the other. Yes they might have a potion to have biological sex. But equally they just might obliviate the person of their dysphoria.

The latter is a bit of a fridge horror moment as we know from Lockhart's love of signing things post-Obliviation that the spell removes memories and knowledge but not fundamental character traits (which potentially reside in the soul not the mind).

**** But any potion to fix gender dysphoria would still have to massively change the brain, as it's not just memories that cause the dysphoria, but a fundamental difference in brain structure caused by hormonal imbalance. So any obliviate wouldn't fix the underlying problem.

It's not just memories that would need to be changed, but thinking patterns, ways that the brain would handle emotions, everything.

That is actually a very good point!

Well, from another angle, it doesn't look like wizards actually value education that much. Even the really hard jobs only require like, 5 NEWTs? Lily and James and Frank and Alice got married, like, right out of school. Might they not have been getting up to some hankypanky?

Lily and James and Frank and Alice got married right out of school because a war was going on. And OWLs are basically the equivalent of high school graduation, while NEWTs are more akin to college.

For gay couples, I could easily envision it like what you wrote. Assuming there isn't a negative societal connotation to gay couples beyond lack of children, as long as a family got that heir they probably wouldn't care too much.

** I'm not sure there's any evidence in canon that wizarding culture is sexually conservative. Their dating culture seems more or less identical to Muggle culture, and in the first Quidditch match of PS we see the girls changing in the same changing room as the boys - a changing room that we know from PoA has showers.

The only hint of sexual conservatism are the sex-spelled dorms. But A) those spells are over 1000 years old and B) doing so isn't really all that conservative.

Finally, the stigma of women being considered sexually promiscuous aka "a slut" that you touch upon with "Scarlet Woman" doesn't seem to be substantially different between the Muggle and wizarding worlds.

** Regarding incest: except for marriage between siblings (the Gaunt, who everyone think are weirdoes), the nearest we see is between second cousins (Walburga and Orion Black). Before the 20th century, almost no one would have considered marriage between first cousins incest, and even today it's unfrequent but not illegal in Europe and North America, and can be frequent in some places (Arabian Peninsula among others); and I don't think there is a single place in the world where second cousins marriage are considered incestual.

Regarding "Victorian values" : these are originated from 19th century England, the definitve separation between the societies was in the late 17th century, shouldn't these values have had an impact mainly upon muggleborns? Also, the relation to sex and nudity in the 17th and 18th century was absolutely not Victorian (maybe that could be a root for the pureblood supremacist movement : muggleborn in the 19th and most of the 20th century attempting to impose a more victorian view of sexual relationships).

"Itachi, is that a baby" is, in my mind, one of the fanfics where sex is the best represented : it does happen, it's personnal, magic can take care of the problems, pregnancies are Dumbledore's problem if (and only if) they happen at school; parents send their teenage children in a co-ed boarding school for 10 months a year, they should not be surprised (moreover so because they were students at the same school).

  Are transgendered people socially acceptable? Tonk's metamorphmagus is never shown to extend that far, but it doesn't seem impossible. Some ancient cultures considered trans or hermaphroditic people to be a little bit magic, male and female in one body, etc. Might the wizarding world adopt something like this view?
#+end_quote

So this is /really silly/, but after Tonks explained in OotP that metamorphmagi were born rather than made, I adopted a headcanon that the metamorphmagus talent was a kind of (accidental) magical adaptation to being born transgender.

DH was fair evidence against that idea (Teddy was born as a metamorphmagus, too) but gender dysphoria has a heritable component so I don't think it's wholly impossible.

This idea probably has a lot of further-reaching implications that I didn't consider at the time, though...

- If wizards and witches who would be born as transgender instead become metamorphmagi, then the wizarding world almost cannot have a conception of trans issues the same way that the muggle world does. Gender dysphoria wouldn't be associated with pathology but associated with expanded abilities.
- The trans people of the wizarding world would inherently be able to transition just by using their powers, so they wouldn't need any particular treatment (even less ground to be considered pathological) and the wizarding world couldn't keep them from transitioning.
- Presumably their powers would also allow them to change sex "fully" in a way that muggles currently can't (given that their powers are /born/ from the desire to change sex). It's not a far stretch to assume that metamorphmagi might be seen as gender-transcendent, similar to the ideas you mention in your quote.
- On a more global level, what are the implications if childhood circumstances can give rise to longer-term magical abilities? This isn't completely contrary to canon (e.g. Lily's sacrifice protected Harry into his adulthood) but if accidental/childhood magic can give rise to unique, intentional, controlled magic, then there are probably more people with strange inborn talents, rather than just metamorphmagi.
- Possible candidates for these talents might include some of the polyglots we see, Seers, and Parselmouths (Salazar Slytherin, at least, assuming he didn't intentionally create his powers some other way)? Interesting thoughts for AUs, etc.

Anyways, I think /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11862560/1/To-Reach-Without][To Reach Without]]/ is a better example of a trans!Harry story. It plays like a gender bender ("oh no, I was transformed from a man into a woman, whatever will I do!?") but Harry's character development makes it pretty clear that her transformation was accidental magic as /wish fulfillment/ rather than some terribly unfortunate thing thrust upon her.

In that context, it would make /perfect/ sense for trans people to become metamorphmagi. And then Teddy had to ruin it...

Ooh! What if Salazar was Autistic or something? He had trouble talking to anyone else, but he could trust in his pet snake to never betray him or confuse him with complex and incomprehensible societal norms. And then, one day, he discovered he could talk to his little pet snake!

I've actually encountered that idea in fiction before; people changing gender as a joke or a disguise or whatever and then realizing they finally feel complete. It's an interesting premise, even more so because I can imagine a fairly ignorant version of the Wizarding world making it a reasonable thing.

*** I don't necessarily think the metamorphmagus = transgender idea is canon compatible on the basis of what we see from Tonks* (or strictly speaking logical, as you'd think the accidental magic you describe would result in a one-time sex change, not a continuing ability to change appearance), but it's a fun idea for fanon.

Fantastic Beasts also touched upon this, where a child rejecting their own magic results in the creation of an Obscurus.

*For a number of reasons:

1. Tonks loses her metamorphmagus powers in HBP and still looks mostly the same, which suggests that it is not something which is core to her nature or appearance.

2. Tonks generally makes temporary, superficial changes to a relatively constant appearance, again suggesting that it is not used to fundamentally alter your long term physical identity.

3. Given that there's no indication that metamorphmaguses are immortal, it's doubtful that it can be used for "deep" biological changes of the kind you describe, else the world would be full of eternally youuthful immortal metamorphmaguses.

*** I'm not quite buying your metamorphmagi argument. Since studies indicate that a large part of gender dysphoria is caused by hormonal imbalance prebirth, why would magic go through the process of granting powers to the child as opposed to simply fixing the imbalance? While magic seems reactive to a person's desires, a baby, let alone a fetus doesn't seem to have the capability to recognise their dysphoria and want to change it. On the other hand, a parent's desire for a healthy baby would be something it could act upon. Furthermore, Lily's sacrifice didn't create an inborn talent in Harry. Rather, it created a temporary protection against Voldemort that was probably extended and added to by Dumbledore.

Inborn talents arising due to childhood circumstances seems oddly specific. Given the sheer amount of events that children experience and danger that magic can cause, I'd expect far more magical abilities. And why should these abilities be mostly gained by children? Adults are more likely to experience trying circumstances that would merit some ability.

Why does magic go through the process of doing as distressed children want it to, rather than changing children so as not to be distressed any longer? Why can magical children use accidental magic at all?

Because if only for the youth, magic is a wonder-machine of wish-fulfillment.

The Potterverse has souls, ghosts, and life beyond death, so it's not clear that having a functional brain is a prerequisite for being conscious or for being a person; at minimum, it's not clear that you need a functional brain in order to interact with magic. (That has all kinds of far-reaching global implications beyond this argument, so I'm disappointed that it was never explored more in-canon, but...)

There are two problems with the idea that a parent's desire for a healthy baby could literally act upon their child, IMO: first of all, it begs the question and assumes that the wizarding world pathologizes being transgender, seeing it as being unhealthy. (This is plausible, it certainly happens in the muggle world, but it can't be taken for granted and it's part of what we're supposed to be discussing here.)

Second of all, magic that can interfere with the wills and minds of others is /rare/. Legilimency can "read" minds, and Occlumency can protect your mind, but you can't reach out and change what other people want from their lives; even Imperio can't create lasting changes in other people like that. The Imperius curse can only /suppress/ the wills of others, and it's an ongoing effect which masks the underlying nature of the victim. Memory charms can't seem to change what you value on a fundamental and deep level; your belief about what "is" is a memory, while your belief about what "ought to be" is very different. Love potions, like the Imperius curse, are transient suppressions and incomplete.

If parents could change what their children wanted on a fundamental level, while they were /in the womb/, by accidental magic, then we would see a lot more natal brainwashing in the series. I'm more inclined to say that if children take after their parents in the Potterverse, that's /upbringing/ and/or a writing artifact, rather than /literal magic/ removing character agency.

  Furthermore, Lily's sacrifice didn't create an inborn talent in Harry. Rather, it created a temporary protection against Voldemort that was probably extended and added to by Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

He wasn't /born/ with his talent, but it became a part of him as a magical property deeper than any learned spell. Contingent magical circumstances created a talent above the level of ordinary magic learned by rote and theory.

#+begin_quote
  Inborn talents arising due to childhood circumstances seems oddly specific. Given the sheer amount of events that children experience and danger that magic can cause, I'd expect far more magical abilities.
#+end_quote

>If accidental/childhood magic can give rise to unique, intentional, controlled magic, then there are probably more people with strange inborn talents, rather than just metamorphmagi.

#+begin_quote
  And why should these abilities be mostly gained by children? Adults are more likely to experience trying circumstances that would merit some ability.
#+end_quote

Why do adults show little in the way of accidental magic?

***** You're making the assumption that babies and fetuses have consciousnesses that are capable of recognising on a major level (for them at least) that something is wrong. Why would a fetus have such an ability? A functional brain might not be necessary, but some level of consciousness is required for many magics. The existence of souls doesn't change this requirement.

#+end_quote

You're making the assumption that magicals would specifically think of being transgender as unhealthy. Being transgender is an issue of the brain not matching up with the body. I don't need to know how or what the exact effect of the brain not matching up with the body entails, all I have to know (or believe) is that this failure to match up is going to cause my child problems.

Not at all. There's a great deal of evidence that magic that can affect the mind is commonplace. Just confounding someone is affecting the mind, and wizards and witches can do it with ease. Potions, charms, hexes, those that are fairly low-level exist in abundance. From a quick look at a list, the spells that (may) affect the mind:

- Babbling Curse
- Cheering Charms
- Confundus
- Crucio
- Ennervate (depending on its mechanics)
- Expected Patronym
- Fidelius
- Horcruxes (this gets into debates regarding mind and soul)
- Imperio
- Legilimency
- Obliviate
- Occlumency
- Rennerverate
- Muggle-repellant magics
- Stupefy (depending on mechanics)
- Magical vows

I'm sure there are more, and personal variations on common spells could make it far more. Extrapolation suggests that it is likely that there are much more spells (e.g. charms that make you unhappy).

It's not a talent though. A talent is a natural aptitude or skill. It's not even a skill; it's a protective magic. It only goes flesh-deep too, as Voldemort was able to fairly easily overcome it.

"Muggle women where that! Muggle men wear /these/!"

Waves trousers.

"I like a healthy breeze 'round my privates thanks!

None of the wizards were grumbling because they had no idea if a nightgown constituted appropriate muggle attire or not. :/

** Would the wards work if you believed with all your being that you are a woman? Wards are based partly on intent, aren't they?

As for transgender? Wouldn't there be kind of a potion or a ritual for that, to "fix" the person (turn him/her into the other gender...or if that's not possible: Compell them not to be transgender anymore? I mean we are talking about a society here that can read minds and delete memories etc. so why not delete the "wrong gender" feeling? Barbaric? Yeah, maybe but then again: It kind of heals the person, too!)

*** Ugh. I hadn't even thought of that. It wouldn't surprise me if the Wizarding world thought dysmorphia was a disease to be 'cured', America though ladies being butch (not even lesbian) was a mental illness in the 50s.

Something to remember though; not every person who is transgender is really aggressive about totally changing their body, some just want to be addressed by the right pronouns, and some phaladies and vagentlemen are comfortable where they are in their transition.
