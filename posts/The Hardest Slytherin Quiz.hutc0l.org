Hi everybody!!

First of all thanks to all who passed our first [[https://quizlagoon.com/quiz/harry-potter-house-quiz-ravenclaw/][harry potter house quiz - ravenclaw]]

We get a great feedback about our work, so it would be a crime to not prepare another [[https://quizlagoon.com/quiz/harry-potter-house-quiz-slytherin/][harry potter house quiz]]. This time it's Slytherin house.

And again, our editors ensure us that only true potterheads will be able to get 100% result.

Well i feel like this is about this community, so please share your results in comments!


** I got 21 out of 25, but I believe that question #15 is incorrect. It asks "which of the following Blacks was disowned for marrying a muggle" the choices are Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Lucretia, and Phineas. Cassiopeia never married and Lucretia married a Prewitt. Neither was disowned. Phineas was disowned (by his father Phineas Nigellus) for sympathizing with muggles, but we don't know if he ever married. Andromeda was disowned for marrying a Hufflepuff muggleborn, Ted Tonks.

The correct answer for the quiz seems to be Andromeda, so the question should probably say muggleborn instead of muggle.

Not a potterhead.. I havent read the books since Deathly Hallows came out in like 2007.. or Pottermore.

Fanfiction has taught me well

****** Nope he was a muggleborn. I actually totally forgot why we knew that. He fixed Harry up a bit at the start of book 7 and later went on the run. He met up with Dean Thomas and Griphook at one point while Harry eavesdrops on them.
