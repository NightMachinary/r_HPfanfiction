** [[http://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html][The Fire and the Rose]] is a SS/HG body swap fic due to a potions accident. This fic is great, and is my favorite Snape/Hermione by far, though I haven't read many. The ending is also pretty unique. There's a sequel but I read that it wasn't great so I haven't tried it yet.

** try linkffn(A Switched Chance) It' got switched bodies and some interesting speculation on magic/soul/blood/gender. Pretty fluffy, really nice friendship between Harry/Hermione.

  In which Hermione attempts a time-travelling ritual without due preparation and Harry happily goes along for the ride, and both have to cope with living their best friend's life.

**** Thanks, hard to do the links on mobile, and I've been at work all day so I couldn't go fix it.

Hopefully you enjoy, as I said, it's one of my favorites.

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

  Dark Lord Voldemort needed a vacation. He even had the perfect plan so that his followers would not even notice his weeklong spree. Too bad his closest horcrux resided in Harry James Potter, the "Brat-Who-Lived"!

** I've read most but not all of the following:

Two fics by honeybat, one long one short:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8882395/1/Sanity-Restored]]) a favorite that I wished was continued

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8874463/1/A-New-Perspective]]) short but meant to be complete - though I sense lots of room for more and wish it wasn't so shhort

and a few others with Snape and Harry switching with each other:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1650226/1/Walking-In-His-Shoes]]) I remember enjoying this

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1486707/1/Trading-Places]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7435449/1/Praesent-Anima]])

don't know if I've actually read either of these

finally Hermione and Draco, though I haven't read these:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6788093/1/The-Switch]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8434789/1/In-Another-Life]])

I've read at least one fairly long HP/SS switch thats not on this list but I can't place it right now, though I know it was set post war.

I loved Becoming, especially the first half, and enjoyed the previously recommended A Switched Chance and A Dark Lord's Much Needed Vacation.
