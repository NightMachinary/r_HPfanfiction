Like Hogwarts era fics. Doesn't really matter the drama. I just fell in love with his character through a variety of fics and was hoping for more.


** Hadn't come across any before, so I searched ffn.net. The only way I could think of to find stories with Theo as a main character was to pair him. So sorry if you weren't looking for fics with romance! I searched Hermione/Theo and found 23. I read through these two oneshots linkffn(10452667;10370544) and enjoyed them both [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=103&c1=3&c3=2195&pm=1]]

  Instead of Millicent Bullstrode, Hermione chooses to change into Theodore Nott. The transformation goes swimmingly until, of course, Hermione finds herself face to face with the actual Theodore Nott. Getting back out of the dungeons might not be as easy as getting in, and Blaise Zabini definitely isn't helping. / One-shot, bit fluff.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

*** I only read one. It was called isolation. It was originally a drarmione fic and he was a side character but I loved him. I constantly wanted to hug him and tell him he was OK.

For a book 8 would definitely be The Summer After the War. And then the sequel, the winters after the war. I'm also reading 19 years and The Taste of Poison. TTOP seems really promising. Harry is like psychotic. It's so good. I just wish it was already finished. 19 years is well, the 19 years in between the ending and epilogue of DH.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3932315/1/][The Bracelet by AkashaTheKitty]] is a Hogwarts-era Dramione and Theo shines as the story's third major character. His characterization is memorable, somewhat unexpected yet totally plausible, and it's what made me fall in love with him as a character and as a romantic partner for Hermione. (The story is an overall Dramione but the Theo-Hermione part of its Theo-Hermione-Draco love triangle is, in my opinion, way better than the Draco-Hermione part.). I haven't read Isolation so I'm not sure if this Theo is the type of Theo you're looking for, but I highly recommend you give it a try! If you like it, you can check out [[http://akashathekitty.livejournal.com/][AkashaTheKitty's LiveJournal]] for a bonus smutty "missing chapter." Her other stories are great, too, but they're all Dramione and don't feature Theo... sadly.

** linkao3(Fighting The Green by FireFleshAndBlood)

I love this story because the magic system is fantastically developed, and all the characters are vivid. Especially Harry. Theodore Nott becomes best friends with Harry, and he's a very memorable characterization.

  Harry Potter is a Slytherin. Neville is the Boy Who Lived. Both will have to face Voldemort to survive.

      Hello and welcome to another 'Harry Potter is a Slytherin' story\. This story was once posted a million years ago on fanfiction\.net\. Unfortunately, my account there is mysteriously unusable and so, I'm finally finishing this fanfic on AO3\. I started this fanfic years ago and at first it was a slightly awful drabble but due to mysterious reasons it became something of a phenomenon\. I hope the rewrite will eventually bring this story again to people's memories\. It was a lot of fun and I hope you'll have as much fun reading as I have writing it, especially since I'm finally finishing it\.To anyone just starting this story, the pairings show up around fourth year and will be added to the tags as I write them\. I'm also slowly editing this beast myself so please forgive any minor mess ups but if something particularly bothers you, feel free to comment on it\.For those curious about me or when an update will appear leave a comment on my dreamwidth\. Thank\-you and enjoy\.
