I just realized - I've never actually looked for or read any founders fics. This is a glaring failure which must be rectified ASAP.

I prefer gen or minimal romance, but if it's a good enough story I'll read just about anything.

** My favorite founders fic is a crossover containing the movie versions of Thor and Loki:

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/224284][Hogwarts: A (Marvelous) History, or: Thor and Loki's Excellent Adventure]]*

The brothers visit Midgard and, thanks to Loki, they are mistaken for wizards. Under the aliases of Godric Gryffindor (Thor) and Salazar Slytherin (Loki) they each help Helga and Rowena build their dream of a safe school for young magical children.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of a Linear Circle]] by flamethrower has a character from the Founders Era coming to the modern one and romancing Severus Snape. (It seems more resaonable in context.)

I'd recommend reading it for the character and world building, including Founders Era world building, but you could skip to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114?view_full_work=true][Part III]] which is set in the Founders Era (except the first chapter) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13769718/chapters/31647636][Part V - Ravenclaw]], which is some pretty great stand-alone backstory for Rowena.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/swamprat01a.html][Swamprat]]

/Godric Gryffindor has been called too daring for his own good, but even HE is starting to think that charging into a swamp in search of a wizard known only as "Serpent-Tongue" is not the brightest move..../

Fairly short and fun.

([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/MAS01.html][Moon and Stone]] is in the same era, if you like the author.)

** linkffn(basilisk born) has a lot to do with the founders. It doesn't spend too long in their era though. It's a time travel fic with a lot of time skips from the time of Merlin to present day.
