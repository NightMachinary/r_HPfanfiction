** I'd recommend the Albis Potter series by NoahPhantom (linkffn(Albus Potter and the global revelation by NoahPhantom)). It has an interesting perspective on dueling. Also, the author has written a oneshot which is basically a dueling professor telling about professional duels.

Another interesting one is the use of transfiguration in duels in linkffn(the lie I've lived).

The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside).

linkffn(Hp and the Summer of Change by Lorddwar)

linkffn(Starnlicht by Marquis Carabas)

linkffn(the Skitterleap by enembee)

linkffn(to Fight the Coming Darkness by jbern)

In all of these cases there are fights that stick out in my memory as satisfying, even if the parameters described (magical cores, wandless magic equal to wanded) are now 'out of fashion'.

**** Summer of Change is halfway a gung-ho training the prodigy fic so much of it revolves around combat (the rest is Tonks/Harry shippyness with trope icing). The last few chapters get into actual life-and-death battles and operations.

Starnlicht starts with a fight and the main character is basically a 40's-style Private Eye in magical 1590, so there are fights every other chapter.

Skitterleap is too short to bother cherry-picking; the prose is tight so skipping anything would be counter-productive.

It's been too long since I read Jbern's fic. I do remember that the opening has Harry jumping in to help Amelia Bones escape an attack by Voldemort, which was really the fight that stuck with me.

Honorable mention to JBern's Bungle in the Jungle for the last few chapters; between curse-breaking and demon fighting it's a fight-a-palooza, but the magic and opponents are decidedly AU

*** Exhaustion is actually something you should mention. Not necessarily magical exhaustion, but rather physical exhaustion. In a duel, the fighters would definitely want to be dodging, moving, and running around. A moving target, after all, is much harder to hit than a stationary one, and if you're already moving it would be easier to dodge spells.

***** No, dodging is better than just standing still. Sure, you can conjure a shield. But you could also dodge and fire another spell. Also, you can't expect to know every spell and every spell's counter. What if your opponent sends a spell that breaks your shield, or can just blast through a transfigured rock and keep going? Or maybe someone behind your back shoots a spell at you that you don't see. If you're already moving around in more or less random ways, you stand a much higher chance of not being hit by it. Yes, some spells you can and should just use a shield for, but you should also dodge others.

While whether 'mana' or 'magical exhaustion' should or should not be used is a different matter, and it isn't what I'm talking about. Even if an author chooses not to use those concepts, duelists can and should still move around, and as a consequence will get exhausted, at least in drawn out fights.

******* Just because the enemy knows many spells which you don't know how to counter, does not mean that they are too strong for you. One person might just have read a book the other person didn't read. Doesn't mean you've already lost. Also, I'd argue that apparition does count as dodging. True, it probably doesn't exhaust people, but you are still moving out of the spell's way, which is the important part.

#+begin_quote
  Three pebbles into three wildcats, tigers or lions, and the enemy must reply with magic - good luck dodging a several ton animal commanded to maul you.
#+end_quote

I'm not saying you should /always/ dodge. I'm saying that it's often /better/ to dodge. In that case, yes, reply with magic. If your opponent shoots a curse at you, dodge and return fire. If you shield, or conjure a rock, that requires an incantation/thought that could instead be used to shoot a stupefy, or other spell.

Dumbledore and Voldemort against normal people is irrelevant. You're saying that if you're heavily outgunned, that's when you'd dodge. I agree that if you're much weaker than your opponent, you'd definitely want to dodge. But just because you're not weaker, (so, you're mostly equal to your opponent) then you'd still dodge, and it would give you an advantage.

Looking at GoF: Yes, Harry was dodging. But Voldemort was using crucios/AKs. Harry could have transfigured something. Regardless, this isn't a relevant situation. A relevant situation would be Harry vs. Draco. Harry and Draco are probably roughly equal in strength. In this situation though, Harry should still dodge. Draco likely knows many dark spells that Harry has never heard of. While harry can still cast a shield charm, if the spell he doesn't know is one that can go through a shield charm, he's still lost. If he dodges, well, he's also just sent another expelliarmus that Draco must either dodge of block.

Will dodging allow a schoolkid to beat a death eater? Nope, because the DE has much more experience, and probably is already dodging.

Do you think it is a good idea to train how to shoot spells accurately? Yes? Well, think of dodging as the anti-accuracy, if that helps.

Edit: According to [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Duel_in_the_Ministry_Atrium][this HP wiki page]] in the fight in OotP when dumbledore and voldemort fight, BOTH of them apparate around. Why not just block or transfigure rocks to block spells? Because dodging is better.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
