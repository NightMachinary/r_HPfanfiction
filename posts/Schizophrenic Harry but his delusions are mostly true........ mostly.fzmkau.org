*** No, less believing in imaginary creatures and more like believing in imaginary threats that later become real problems. Fore instance he could have the delusion that people are reading his mind so he endeavors to stop them, learns oclumency early and prevent Voldemort from sending him visions. Or maybe in second year he is unfazed by the school turning against him because he already believes they are out to get him.
