Hey guys! I posted in this thread about 6 months ago testing the waters on what people would think/feel about an Ilvermorny based web series. Since then, I've been busy with work and some film projects, but I have been writing and just recently started teaching myself some VFX tricks. I made a practice [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PMPrrhSlCM][apparate]] effect with some test footage and composited [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3nqkFlHPFI][shot]] of the Ilvermorny school. I figured I would come to the experts on their thoughts on how I did/how I can improve it since the look is an important thing. Gonna try and do some spell stuff in the coming weeks and post some of my writings for the show too since that is the real meat and bones. Thanks and have a magical day!


** Wow! This looks /really/ great. (Though the Ilvermorny look will inevitably get jossed in some future /FB/ movie, but that can't be helped.) Well done. I'm definitely looking forward to this. Love the stumbling of the wizard after his Apparation, it's a great and realistic touch.

*** thank you. yeah, that is true, though I have a feeling they may kinda leave it to just subtle references.

** I see you went with the movie style apparition effect. In the book it was described as simply appearing and disappearing accompanied by a "pop" or "bang" of displaced air pressure.

Not really a criticism just an observation. :)

Looking forward to the end product just the same! :D

*** yeah, my goal is to make it visually match it as best we can so it can feel like it fits right in with the movies, but that's an interesting style to use that i may have to try and incorporate.

**** My suggestion is to have experienced or powerful wizards and witches use the simple disappearing effect with little to no noise as they have mastered the art of apparition while new or weak wizards and witches use the "swirling air" effect with a louder noise. Signifying a difference in power. A lot of fics use that system and it's in my headcanon too. :)

Maybe show the newbies stumbling or at least pausing to get their bearings while the pros disapparate mid-step and apparate smoothly, continuing their walk as if they didn't just cross hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye. :D

***** Unless I'm mistaken, canon does say that Dumbledore can Apparate without any noise so it seems to be canon.

*** The book version will probably look cheap and get called out.
