Snarry. Drarry. Or Tomarry/Harrymort.

You can only choose one and give your reasonings.

Mine is Snarry because I like the trope of soulmate Patronus. It fits better than Hinny if that's the case. Besides, though I read the other two slash pairings, Snarry is my favorite.


** None of them, tbh, I think Harry needs a happy person. If we're going to stick to Harry pairings I would pair him with Ron, Cedric or maybe Neville.

If I definitely had to pick one of the above I would choose Drarry. The whole enemies to lovers thing is a fun if cliched romance plot, and it doesn't have the ick factor that the other two have when age is brought into consideration.

*** Makes sense. I like that trope too, haha! On another note, out of three others you names, I think I'd rather Neville. Cedric died and Ron would seem the type to be prejudice over homosexuals.

**** I don't think he would be. Sometimes his initial reaction is one of prejudice because of what he knows, but we consistently see him overcome that - his knee jerk reaction was prejudice against Remus but he very quickly was comfortable again. Besides which we have no indication that wizards care about homosexuality, and, you know it's fanfic you can write a world where homophobia doesn't exist if you want.

***** True. However, Neville is just so sweet. I don't see him doing anything that Ron did in the books either if they ever got together. After all, Ron as some serious jealousy issues, even if he gets over some of them. I can easily see Ron getting jealous over every person that fawns over Harry thinking that he might cheat on him. That's not healthy for a stable relationship.

****** Neville is sweet and I think it's a shame he and Harry were not closer. But Harry definitely needs someone who just properly makes him laugh, and if that's not Ginny it's definitely Ron. (Or maybe one of the twins)

** Sna-

Nope. No way. Back button.

I really hate Malfoy/Harry pairings. I rather pair Harry with Neville or Ron Or Seamus.

Hell, Percy.

The only time I read a Harry/Riddle story is when it's crack like Full Circle and Teaching History is Old News.

Or Athey's works, ignore the pairings, the storyline is worth it.

** I dislike all three. If I were specifically going to look for Harry slash, I'd want Harry with Ron. Or Harry with one of the Weasley twins. Or Cedric, or Seamus or Dean or Neville or even Oliver. You know, someone in his age bracket he likes and who likes him and who doesn't believe he should die.

Voldemort is the biggest no what with having murdered Harry's parents and all.

Snape is the next no--- inadvertently helped Voldemort murder Harry's parents (and when he realized what he'd done only cared about Lily, not James or Harry). He remained obsessed with Harry's mother, which would give his romance with Harry a squickiness I don't enjoy. And when he was an adult in a position of power over the child Harry, he mocked and sabotaged Harry while terrifying and verbally abusing Harry's friends.

I don't like Draco/Harry, but I can at least stomach a fic that involves them, since most of Draco's crimes were committed under pressure from a bigger bully, and he was himself a child who could have evolved into a worthy partner for Harry. (Though I don't think 90% of Drarry fic actually bothers with a redemption arc, instead choosing to start with Draco having a completely different personality while vilifying the likes of Ron.) So that's my choice given these three options.

** Harry/Tom around the same age (time travel or alternate universe.)

I just like the dynamic in a lot of these fics. There's obsession that isn't healthy but is interesting to read. They challenge and frustrate each other. They have "strange likenesses" but make very different choices. I like Harry's overall characterization in these fics: He's capable but not OP. He's not a genius but he adjusts quickly and believably ups his game with the looming threat of Tom (without becoming a sudden bookworm). I like to read Tom and Harry in both slash and platonic relationships. But, again, I like time travel and au. I've read some canon-based Harry/Voldemort, but that's a different level of dark and twisty. I prefer the more even relationship that exists when they're about the same age.

I've never liked Drarry or Snarry. I guess I have just never been that interested in the dynamic between them. To Snape, Harry is just a product of other people and other relationships and Harry is one getting the baggage heaped on him. I always saw Draco as something problematic Harry just had to endure/deal with while his problems were consistently bigger.

The slash pairing I wish there was a whole lot more of is Harry/Dean. Dean's awesome. He showed up to fight a battle without even a wand, just deciding he'd nick one from somewhere. He grew up in the muggle world with apparently a big and loving family. He likes Quidditch as well as muggle sports. He also believed in Harry in OotP and DH when others were doubting him.

** The only one that works for me is Drarry. Draco was a horrible kid but I can buy him becoming an adult who is a decent person.

And I don't mind the enemies turned lovers trope, as Draco isn't unredeemable the way Voldemort kind of is in the books here.

And Draco didn't kill Harry's parents or wasn't in love with one of them, so there's that.

** Drarry because neither of them really need a relationship where one is older than the other. I find relationships where one character is older tend to involve some sort of power exchange, whether conscious or not and I don't think Harry (or Draco) really needs that in a romantic relationship.

I find Snarry awkward because Snape loved Harry's mum and the natural progression from there would not usually be â€˜I can't have the woman I love, so I'll have her son' that would be a pretty messed up person psychologically if they automatically came to that conclusion.

Harrymort... yeah, no. I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole.

Back to Drarry, I also love to see Draco's character delved into more. I don't think he would be an inherently shitty person, rather, he was raised that way - be it by his parents, grandparents, or his parents' friends. It does, after all, take a village to raise a child. I also just think they're cute together. They come from totally different backgrounds and have been raised totally different, but still have enough similarities to get along as friends and a couple.

This is just my opinion. Personally, while I like to see Drarry as a side-ship, it's not my main ship. I'm more into m/f, m/m/f, or m/f/f, which I think has something to do with me being a bi girl.

** Snarry, since it has been my OTP for many years. I like reading about an intense and sometimes twisted relationship of two strong people who are very similar in some aspects while being nothing alike in others.

Although I read a lot of Drarry too, and sometimes Tomarry fics as well (I'm very VERY picky about the latter, though)
