Title says it all.

I heard about those, but never read one myself. I intent to close that gap and wanted to ask if you know something that escapes the infamously bad reputation of these fics.

Thanks in advance.

***** I was fearing the story's on its way to repeating the original storyline, as many TT fics tend to do. Luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Though the characters' reasoning and solution with Sirius situation is still kinda idiotic.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.
