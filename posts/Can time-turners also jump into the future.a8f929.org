I was thinking about it, if somebody accidentally time travels into the past, but doesn't want to change anything, could that person travel back to his/her time using a time-turner? I'm suspecting that it doesn't work that way because the future they want to go to does not yet exist, it doesn't work both ways. What do you think?


** I kind of doubt it, purely based on the user interface. The hourglass takes you back an hour for every time you turn it. How would you even turn it forward? Presumably it's symmetrical.

I would be willing to be convinced if someone needed it to for fic writing purposes, though.

*** To escape a tight spot, for one thing. Let's imagine Harry had a Time-Turner at the Graveyard Confrontation, for example --- and assume Voldemort doesn't know this --- he can just quickly turn it under his robes the moment things are going awry. He arrives six hours later, by daylight, and Voldemort has long stormed off looking wherever the damnable boy has Apparated.

**** What I understood about canon time travel was that the characters have to experience time once in order to jump through it. So if Harry were to try and jump to time B from time A, his consciousness would be catapulted into time B, but there would be a version of him in time A.

** Okay first of all you have to stop thinking of time as spatial dimensions. Going to the past isn't like going to a different stage and then returning to the original stage set in the present. You'd just advance time until you're at the time where you left.

Fundamentally time travel to the future is simpler than time travel to the past. We don't see any such devices in HP, but if they can travel to the past I have no idea why they wouldn't be able to travel to the future as well (one is breaking physics as we know it, the other does not... even mere muggles on the ISS can [[https://i.imgur.com/Nyc1YP2.png][time travel]]). Normal time turners only allow you to go back 5 hours, so if you travel too far into the future you won't be able to get back.

If you were to consider to the many combinations of actions that determine the future, time travel into the future would be infinitely more complicated than that into the past. The past is set in stone, whereas the future can vary depending on the choices/decisions taken by people.

**** Ok, theoretically, maybe, but if Harry's standing around with a Time-Turner around his neck, and he turns it forward, from the perspective of Ron standing next to him he would just disappear and reappear an hour later. Everyone who was making decisions during that time period would make them without his input, as normal.

There is no multiple timelines here. This isn't divination, where knowing the future ahead of time can alter it, because you /don't/ know the future ahead of time. You have to get there to see it.

****** Ah, I see what the problem is. I misunderstood the question. The issue is whether "his time" would still exist in any meaningful way.

If we use PoA as a guide, then as long as the time-traveller follows Dumbledore's directive of "you must not be seen" in spirit, then it should be possible to jump forward effectively back to where you came from. So, like, if Harry went back 20 years and enrolled back in school as a foreign exchange student in his parents' class, and they met him and thought he was a random weirdo, but it didn't ultimately change anything about established historical fact, then he should be able to skip ahead back to the same future he came from. And it would turn out that his parents had always had an exchange student weirdo in their class. Just as in PoA, Harry and Hermione could have jumped forward for little bits when they were waiting around doing nothing, instead of hiding in the bushes or whatever.

When I was writing my time-travel HP fic, I postulated that it would actually be impossible to change the past and "split the timeline" in HP, but people still avoided trying to do so because it gave really unpredictable results. So, like, if you travel back in time to try to kill your own father before you were conceived, maybe it would turn out he wasn't your real father after all, but your mom used the opportunity his disappearance offered to convince her real secret lover, who happened to be on the run from the law, to steal his identity and live out the rest of his life under polyjuice. (Oh, you think, that's why Dad always carried around that hip flask. Maybe he wasn't an alcoholic after all.) Or maybe you just happen to get hit on the head by a meteorite and die in a ditch before you can get around to any patricide. See? Time-travel is dangerous and unpredictable. I mostly went with this interpretation because it's the most hilarious.

In sci-fi fandoms that kind of thing really bothers me, though. If you travel back in time through scientific means and cross your father's path before you were conceived, and he misses a step before he gets his stride back, what are the chances that the /exact same sperm/ is going to fertilize your mother's /exact same egg/ to create you? If you were to travel back to the future at that point, you would just be traveling forward in the split timeline where you never travelled back in time because your mother's only child is the opposite gender. They may or may not have travelled back in time themselves, creating a third timeline. I leave the question of whether that would still be "you" to the theologists.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my TED Talk. I have a lot of thoughts about time-travel. :)

******* Thank you, but that's exactly what I want to talk about.

My theory is that in any given moment, there are a billion of possible outcomes resulting from any number of possible choices and accidents that are happening in or after that moment. Therefore I would think that going back in time should be logically possible but going forward you would never find your own timeline again.

******** Okay, I would be completely willing to buy this. You're just going with more of the usual sci-fi explanation. But that means you wouldn't ever be able to get back to "your present" the long way around, either, by just waiting it out. It doesn't really have anything to do with travelling forward in time, which is where I think some people on this post are getting confused.

And if you /were/ to travel forward in time, you would still just be skipping ahead on the same split timeline you created by travelling back in time in the first place. There's not really any "finding" involved, unless you're talking about dimension-travel, which is a different thing altogether.

********* Nah I don't know about it. I think it depends on how you define dimensions. I think we can accept that anything that happens may create a different outcome and thus a different future. For someone who looks back into the past, exactly the things that have happened are true and so is his world and timeline. But for somebody who looks forward to the future, there is an infinite amount of possibilities, are these "dimensions?" or are they not? I don't know.

What I'm thinking is that once you have traveled back in time, it should theoretically be possible, if you kept yourself out of any event with any relevance (that you cannot possibly know about), that things play out exactly at they did in the timeline you came from. It should theoretically be possible to arrive at where you came from. But that would only be one of an infinite amount of possibilities, making it virtually impossible to find it, should you possess the means to jump forward in time, or wait for it by trying to be as nonexistent as possible in the meantime.

********** So by "finding" you mean literally causing it, or manipulating events in such a way that your original future still happens. I agree that that prospect is daunting to the point of impossibility if we're not relying on magic to inherently get us there.

I would argue, though, that if you were to look into the future, without that being able to actually affect the future, then exactly /one/ course of events would be true, because causality is a thing. You would just never know what it was or be able to predict it, because it involves all those minute cascading changes.

So time-travel forward would still be possible, you just wouldn't ever know what you would get.

I think we agree, mostly?

*********** Yes I think so XD

I imagine time like countless lines that start at the same point, and every line again splits into countless lines at countless points. Going back a line should be easy if you have magic but going forward to where you came from once you've walked back far enough just seems impossible.

********* If I think about it, I believe that it might be necessary to accept the different timelines existing parallel to each other. Because if it is impossible for a person to get back where he came from once he traveled back in time, does the place where he came from disappear? I don't think so, I'd rather think that to his friends and family, he had disappeared, but everything else would be unchanged. Does that equal dimemsional travel? I'm not sure.

You see I've gotten so frustrated with the lack of good time travel fics that I started to write something on my own, even though I know I couldn't write to save my life. I thought I could maybe just write a little bit for myself to get it out of my system. But almost as soon as I started I got into this problem XD My idea is that Harry accidentally travels back to his parents' last year in the body of himself after the end of the war, maybe 3 years later, and in the beginning he tries to find out what happened and how to get back before trying to change the world completely from 1977. Then I realized that it's probably impossible anyway.

********** Hey, time-travel is wholesale impossible in real life, but nothing is impossible in fiction. Parallel timelines existing simultaneously is not a novel concept, whether Harry can get back there or not. I'm not sure I see the problem. You should totally write it.

*** Nah my idea is more on the lines of what if somebody accidentally time travels a long way back? The sensible reaction would be to try and get back to your time before you change anything instead of altering the past left and right. But how? There might not even be a possibility.

**** Well canonically (excluding Cursed Child or other fanfics) you cannot change the past through time travel so that wouldn't even be an issue.

And considering the terrible outcomes of the books I don't understand why anyone would be worried about changing the past in the first place.

I don't know about terrible outcomes, I mean they won, most ppl survived, the trio grew up to have multiple children, jobs they like, stayed friends. Sometimes people grow to accept what had happened in the past and move on to live their lives, you know, and I'm not sure every one would want to give up everything they now had, after having fought so hard for it, just for the very slim chance that the many things that went wrong decades ago could all be changed so that life might even be better.

That's a terrible standard of success you have there "oh, only some people have died (Dumbledore, Snape, Fred, Amelia Bones, Sirius, Remus, Nymphadora, Ted, Lavender, Colin, numerous order members)". We can do way better than that: Voldemort was only resurrected because everyone was a bumbling fool and institutions failed at every level.

It's super easy that no one has to die, especially with hindsight.

******* Nah I don't think time travel is "super easy", I think it's more like change one thing and a cascade of events you did not expect will happen that changes a lot of other things you cannot forsee and suddenly things are much more complicated and with just the tiny bit of bad luck it'll turn out worse than it did.
