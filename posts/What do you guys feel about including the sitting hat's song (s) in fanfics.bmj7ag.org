I usually skip them and the original ones (that I've read at least) don't tend to be that good. I don't know if this discussion has already happened here but I wanted to know your opinions.


** Unless you're injecting some kind of plot related thing into it, they're probably unnecessary and I would personally prefer them to be skimmed over or left out. I have written five or six hat songs myself for a site ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/9dxrcv/ec_september_serenade/][and one for Reddit]]), but they served a purpose and I've been writing lyrics for years. Which may be a part of why I cringe at most of those I come across in fictions.

** It depends on if they have an impact on the plot or story. In fact, this even applies to canon. In PS, the sorting song is there to tell the reader (and Harry) what's going on: students are sorted into /these/ houses for /these/ reasons. In COS and POA, there would have been no impact so the song is missed and not heard. In GOF things are getting darker (and JKR couldn't come up with a reason for Harry to miss it this year) so it's heard and generally brightens things up a wee bit. For OOTP the song explicitly warns the school that 'shits about to go down, work together or get screwed over'. I think GOF having a song also sort of got the readers to expect a happier song for OOTP, which made the darker song a bit more surprising.

HBP and DH both lack songs because they wouldn't really have any purpose, as the warning was given in OOTP and really needs no reinforcing.

If they are included, I generally feel they should therefore have two main attributes: A) they should be reasonably well written (that is to say, they should bloody well rhyme at least as well as the canon songs do) and B) they should have some impact or purpose beyond just being there, as the canon songs did.

** True, the Sorting Hat's songs are rarely any good, but... that's the point. That's the joke. He's a hat that sings... poorly. The Hat has a bit of an ego, as is well-known (¨cough¨ "I totally did the right thing by putting Pettigrew in Gryffindor" ¨cough cough¨), and it is utterly hilarious, to me at least, that it has for a thousand years remained confident that among its many talents is that of singing and songwriting, even though it's actually terrible at it, simply because it's become such a hallowed tradition that no one dares point out that its singing is awful and its rhymes forced.

Pettigrew as a beginning first year had bravery that needed to be cultivated, so the Hat put him in Gryffindor. Unfortunately, he did not end up becoming brave(r).

I do not see this as the Hat's fault. It's not like it can predict everything, just make a probabilistic judgement about what house would help the sortee (?) the most.

Well, that's what the /Hat/ says. It's certainly possible. But Rowling deliberately leaves it ambiguous whether the Hat is just refusing to accept that he made a mistake to mar his spotless track record, or if Pettigrew did indeed once have /some/ courage which he failed to cultivate.

Oh, sure, you can't blame it for having made a mistake; but you /can/ blame it for refusing, even in hindsight, to accept that it made the wrong call.

***** I'm not even sure I would call it "mistakes". The hat judge 11 years old and saying he failed by not putting Pettigrew into Slytherin also play the card "Slytherin are evil".

As Dumbledore say in CoS, " It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are". Pettigrew chose Gryffindor (I guess since he was supposedely a hat stale with Slytherin), and years later he also chose to betray his friends.

And considering he spent 7 happy years at school, part of a larger group, I guess he truly was suited for Gryffindor.

How is being a part of a happy group a Gryffindor sort of trait? By that logic, I feel like Peter would have been much better suited to Hufflepuff. This may seem counterintuitive considering he's best-known as a traitor, but /there/ it's a matter of choice, in a way whether or not one is born courageous isn't. Peter was an extremely social boy who /thrived/ in a group of merry companions. He wasn't brave, or ambitious; and while not stupid, he was hardly what you'd call clever (or studious). But friendly that he was.

What I'm saying is that you can't even consider the Pettigrew sorting to have been a mistake.

There's a persistent belief that the Hat somehow has *all the information necessary for 100% perfect sortings.*

This is not the case. The Sorting Hat can /only/ make decisions that depend in part on chance and/or human decisions.

Thus, the Hat may have decided that there was a good - say, 85%, enough to justify the decision - chance that Peter would benefit from Gryffindor. It decided this based on all the information it had at the time, and there is /no reason/ to think it was wrong.

When the event with the smaller chance of occuring did end up occuring, could it be said that the Hat had made a mistake? If I made a bet on an event that I /knew/ had an 85% chance of going in my favour, and it ended up not doing so, could it be said that my decision was mistaken?

So that's why I think the Hat may be justified in not admitting a mistake here.

** Depends to be honest, I do it because I think it can add to the feeling if it's first year. I would do it as well if it was fifth year, as that song rings very true and could easily be written to a plot.

I don't really care either way though, if you add it... that's fine. If not... that's cool too.
