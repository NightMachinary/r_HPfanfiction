A virus has killed every wizard and left all muggles alone, as a one-time thing. Muggle-borns start cropping up. Does their accidental magic develop at all? Do they learn to control it? How? To what extent?

I'm imagining that extreme emotions are required for accidental magic. So happy kids don't even notice. Some kids have bones that should have broken be weirdly fine and never get the cold when everyone else does, but that's within the realm of ordinary human experience so they don't think much of it. Eventually they get reamed out at work and their boss turns into a balloon and floats up to the ceiling, and they can't do anything about it. Their boss spends the rest of their life in a hospital being fed intravenously, where medical students gape and write papers until one day they're accidentally knocked outside and they freeze to death 3 km in the air.

Kids growing up in shitty conditions are different. A boy with a heroin addict mom finds her skin becomes impervious to needles when he's watching, and by observing what it feels like to do that gains the ability to enchant other people or maybe even objects to be impervious. Eventually he just has low-grade invulnerability running all the time.

A girl finding herself chased by bullies over and over to find herself on rooftops figures out that recalling that feeling of needing to get away allows her to magically appear somewhere random, then if she can hold that feeling and visualize a place, she can go there on purpose. After years of practice, she can apparate better than most wizards in canon with barely a thought.

Ideas?


** I hate to be picky (not really), but if a virus killed every wizard (and I assume you mean witches too), would it also target magical creatures? Would it be a magic-devouring virus?

If not, well, so much for the Statute of Secrecy with no Obliviators.

Anyway, in canon there's Tom Riddle; he managed to learn how to telekinetically manipulate objects, confound and/or control others, and even inflict curses or other magical injuries. I wonder how many muggleborns would experiment the same way?...Perhaps not quite the same way, since Tom Riddle frequently preyed on the other orphans.

Actually, now I just had a thought. I remember a fic idea I had ages ago, one based on Draco664's stuff with a future dystopia where magic has been wiped out; what if, if a muggleborn appears in a time period with no wizards or witches available, someone comes to pick them up from the past (pre-wizard-extinction)? And places like Atlantis and other mythical locations are actually made up of present-day/future-era magical humans?

*** Tom is definitely an interesting case. That's so different from Harry I wonder if Harry is actually uniquely suppressed and normal wizarding children do intentional wandless magic all the time.

I think Lily Evans did some intentional wandless magic before Hogwarts, although she had Snape who presumably gave her some guidance there.

**** Personally, I would have to say that the requirements for their safety was different to each of them. Tom realized he was different and used it to get what he wanted. Harry's life was pretty averagely awful but worse when he did magic because the dursleys were aware of what was happening. Which poses the issue of harry not being an obscurial once more but eh.

Also, why limit extreme emotions to negative? Younger kids especially would have less limits and control over their emotions. How it be affected by people who experience manic highs or lows?

My 2 cents, happy kids would notice. All emotions are big for little kids, so there is no middle ground. A happy kid will still want things they can't reach (or are told they can't have), and will summon the thing to themselves. Or they will be tired, get irrationally angry about what's for dinner and suddenly the broccoli turns into Mac n Cheese.

You get the idea.

**** It's not something that you would even nessisarily remember. Part of being a kid is learning what emotions are, and how to properly handle and express them. We don't remember what it was like at 5 years old to have our friends decide to play a game we didn't want to play. And its moments like that which can lead to accidental magic, when the kid is feeling something major for them -- even if as "grown ups" we don't see it that way anymore.

** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11836594/6/Red-Mage-Looking-For-Group][Red Mage, Looking for Group by Nemesis13]] there's a chapter that has an excerpt of a history book from 2025 explaining the rise of the new generation of wizards.

#+begin_quote
  When Star Wars was released in 1977, it showed an entire generation the wonders of what the future could hold, of magical powers, and epic battles against evil in the stars that no one could truly fathom, and as time progressed the story became part of our culture. This single movie series brought fantasy and science fiction together in a way that kindled the imaginations of millions, and when some of those young minds were immensely powerful witches and wizards who were by and large ignored by their in the know peers, well...what did anyone expect to happen?

  Why did the magicals born to muggle parents from the late 1970's on become some the most powerful, unmatched wizards and witches in history? Simple really, Star Wars told them they could do it, and there was no one there to tell them no, they could not.
#+end_quote

I think it would be something like the advent of superheroes. People with supernatural abilities start appearing, and there's a culture that forms around it.

Maybe scientist start researching it, and soon it becomes just another branch of science. Entire new job markets would probably form around the phenomena, new technologies possible with the advent of magical techniques that make previously impossible industrial processes possible.

The discovery of Ley Line taps, taking the magic directly from the environment, reduces the need for mages in factories.

New advances in aeronautics and aerospace thanks to magic-forged metamaterials lead to the creation of the first space elevator and orbital platform. The discovery of the first extra-terrestrial thaumic field. Colonizing and terraforming planets becomes a reality thanks to large scale transfiguration and alchemy.

Depending on your interpretation of HP magic, there's basically no limit to where things can go.

** Aren't there muggles in on the know? Like the government, and various family members/spouses.

Also, I'm assuming that there will still be things left behind, like, items, locations, books.etc... civilizations don't just disappear without a trace, there's always some reminder that they were there.

I'm sure a lot of knowledge would be lost, but there would be enough vague knowledge either passed down through hear say and stories or kept by various governments to start rebuilding some sort of magical society, one which the Muggle world would probably take full advantage of, since they would be in a position of power over a minority of people who won't understand the full scope of their powers.

** This reminds me of the book series/show called The Magicians. Where it turns out the main character had actually been performing real magic doing his "magic" sleight of hand coin tricks. And there was a half-god who didn't know he was one, and as an adult he became a politician and was running for president. But it turns out his charisma was actually magical and swaying people to vote for his bills or to vote for him. So I think it could be something like that, something subtle. Maybe someone really has a green thumb and plants grow faster around them. Or a cancer doctor has patients who make full recoveries after being in his care. Or a detective has a knack for finding missing kids.

*** I think Dumbledore says in HBP that Toms' case was rare. Tom was muggle raised, but the fact that he not only noticed that he had these abilities, but learned to deliberately do things, to the point where he could create reliable, consistent results, that was something rare and exceptional. Going off that, and witch or wizard who had magical talent leaking out their ears would display such talent as a child, by doing a few wandless things.

I think the majority of muggleborns would slip under the radar. They might get a few comments throughout their life that odd things seem to happen around them, but these odd things might not occur in such a way that the muggleborn, or anyone close to the muggleborn, might realize that they did it. For example, think of Harrys' teachers' wig turning blue. Harry did it in such a way that he had no idea that he had done it. Now, I don't actually know the circumstances of the wig changing colors. But if it happened in a crowded place, with dozens of onlookers, then no one would have been able to point to any particular child.

Now Harry is pretty talented. But not everyone is going to be that talented, whether muggleborn, half-blood, or pure-blood. Think of Neville, raised with the knowledge of his magic, closely monitored by wizarding relatives, yet he could barely muster up enough magic to save his life. No doubt he was trying really hard as a kid to make something magical happen.

The majority of muggleborns will experience a few disparate incidents scattered throughout their lifetime, but drawing a connection between themselves and the mysterious vanished magical subculture would take a serious, concerted effort.

** My headcanon has this go 2 ways, depending on whether or not a person learns to master it. Harry, who never really understood what was going on until he was introduced to the Wizarding World, would've still kept doing accidental magic over time when emotions run high. This turns into a danger both to himself and others once he enters puberty and he's unlikely to survive puberty. Should he make it, accidental magic will remain a constant danger. Inevitably, even if he never learns about the Magical World, he'll realize that "strong emotions = weird stuff" and learn to control it to some extent as an adult, so things get better even if the accidental magic will never go away. I believe people like these are what made Muggles so afraid of magic and willing to persecute them.

The other direction would be someone who learns how to master it -- like Tom (using it for cruel purposes) and Lily (using it for personal amusement). Even before the latter met Severus (and thus was introduced to the Wizarding World), both of them had a strong control of their magic and was consciously using it. This reduces accidental magic and greatly dimishes the danger from never entering the Magical World to control its usage. People like these are the ones who will eventually group together to create a new wizarding society.

** It would be extremely marginal. Most muggleborn kids would simply be unable to seriously harness their abilities piecing together a few parlor tricks depending on their focus and magical disposition. The exceptions would have to have an innate magical aptitude comparable to Harry's mother and even so the toolkit would be limited. Accordingly most would disappear into muggle life, while those with serious talent would be able to achieve a superior depth of capability at the cost of radically impoverished breadth. A fair number of those would ultimately get themselves killed over the course of harebrained experimentation. (As we know from Luna's mother, magical experimentation is not without it's risks and the natural magical world still exists, with its own, now unmapped hazards.) Those that make it through that would keep their abilities close to their chests while aggressively trying to parley their abilities into worldly success. After about three generations of this, you have 50/50 odds that enough of them are able to get together long enough for coherent practices to emerge yet again.

Alternatively society collapses (for largely unrelated reasons) into an occasionally magically-tinged techno-barbarism and their descendants ultimately become the lords of the (waste)land(s) through a similar process.

He apparates onto the roof of his school, shrinks an embarrassing sweater, turns a teacher's hair blue, blows up his aunt, grows a full head of hair overnight, and vanishes a pane of glass. It's not too hard to think a more mature brain that started doing things like that would figure out how to do something intentional.

​

Squibs would be a treasure trove of information. Same with the parents/siblings of those who had magic previously, but they wouldn't be as knowledgable. The squibs also may be unwilling to part with their information, but the clever ones might realize they could rebuild magical society in a way so that squibs are not isolated.

It would be incredibly hard to start gathering muggle borns until they find the hogwarts quill and book by cracking the gargoyle password.

There are still a lot of Qs, like how to isolate and avoid the virus, it is likely the virus will still be there. The society would rebuild but in a completely different way in around a few decades.

I think they would make a modified vaccine to deal with the virus, as there are probably a lot of similarities AND differences between magical and non magical viruses.

**** Probably because lots of muggles, such as the Dursleys, would be concerned at a child exhibiting such "dangerous and peculiar tendencies." And if there's one thing people don't like, it's someone who is different. People will regard those with special abilities as dangerous, and likely persecute, torment, incarcerate, or send those with magical abilities to mental institutions. You don't need to have state mandated executions to torment people, or force them to violently suppress their abilities or who they are? I mean, look at gay people historically. Even when they weren't strictly outlawed, lots of gay people violently suppressed their sexualities to avoid social isolation, being hurt/rejected by their families, etc. Sorry, if that was a bit heavy.
