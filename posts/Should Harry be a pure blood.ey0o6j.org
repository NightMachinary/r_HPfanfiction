** No from every metric Harry is considered a Half blood because,of his muggleborn mother. If muggleborns aren't considered respectable why should their children.

The most logical assumption is that to be a Pureblood you have to have 4 wanded grandparents. Remember Purebloods care about purity, nothing about Lily was 'pure' so why would her son be pure?

*** I don't believe JKR has specifically said, but has heavily implied that a pureblood witch or wizard has to have four magical grandparents.

** I think blood status is kind of like being considered black in the US in the 50s. Depends on how racist the person you're talking to is.

** His mother is Muggleborn so like the Nazis, Harry's great great great grandchildren, if there is always marrying into pure lines, will be pureblood...maybe.

It's the 'one drop' bs idea/mindset.

*** Harry's children have all magical grandparents, but with Lily Potter being Muggle-Born, most purists would exclude them. But if his children married a pure blood or a half blood in the same situation as them, then the child would be pure blood in all but the most strict blood purist mind.

Seeing that Harry defeats Voldemort and shuts down the blood purist movement, I wouldn't think there would be many that would consider even Harry's kids if not grandchildren under those circumstances pure blood.

** JKR gave an official definition on Pottermore, IIRC. Purebloods have four magical grandparents, none of them Muggleborns. So Harry is half-blooded, as are his children. If his children married either purebloods or half-bloods with distant enough Muggle relatives (like themselves) then Harry's resulting grandchildren would be purebloods.

** To be a pure blood you need to have 4 magical grandparents, and since Lily is muggleborn her parents are muggles, therefore harry only have 2/4 magical grandparents

** Harry not being a pureblood is actually plot relevant.

When Voldemort heard the first part of the prophesy, he had two options - pureblood Neville or halfblood Harry. Being halfblood himself, he saw Harry as the greater threat.

*** I know that that is said in canon, but isn't it more logical that Voldemort came after Harry first because it was just more convenient? I mean, he literally had the Potters' secret keeper serving him, so it was simply easier for him to get to Harry (as opposed to the Longbottoms who assumingly were protected differently)

Also, I always thought that it is a bit out of character for Voldemort to "choose" the halfblood.

** While canon never gave a clear number, I remember being heavily implied that, to be considered a pureblood, a witch or a wizard must not have any muggle relatives, during at least 3 generations (though the worst family would probably ask for more).

So, in the case of Harry, he is a half blood since he only has one generation of magical ancestor. His children are also half blood (2 generations of ancestor). And assuming his children marry pureblood (or halfblood of the same "level" as them), only Harry's grandchildren would be Pure blooded.
