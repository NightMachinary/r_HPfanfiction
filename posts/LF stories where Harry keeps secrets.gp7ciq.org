It can be anything really, the prophecy for example. I never really got why Harry immediately told his about it because Ron and Hermione didn't know occlumency so it would be kinda dangerous imo but hey.


** Well, Harry didn't really know occlumency either, despite taking some "lessons".

That said, the first that comes to mind of Harry keeping secrets is linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense).

*** True and that's why it was already a risk telling Harry so i don't get why Dumbledore didn't tell Harry that he couldn't tell anyone.

Thanks for the suggestion btw!

**** Because Harry is not Tom, and his friends are his friends, not his subordinates or his followers. He is not a general ordering around troops who don't have the security clearance to know why they've been ordered to do any particular thing.

Nor is he a particularly good planner, so he needs his friends to know what he knows, so that they could work together on that.

And, last but not least, Harry knows that it is not unlikely that he will get killed before his friends are---and if that were to happen, his friends would need to know enough to continue the fight.

**** Because the reason he wanted Harry to learn occulemency is because he was scared Voldemort could read Harry's mind through their link. If he had easy access to his mind, he could just take the prophecy from them. Since it's unlikely Voldemort would try to read Ron or Hermiones mind, as they wouldn't face him directly with Harry there, they're not the security risk Harry is.

** I never understood why it was such a big deal to keep the prophecy a secret in the first place, the only part Voldemort didn't know was the mark him as his equal, and that had already happened by then.

***** yeah i don't really get why they put a guard there because the only one who was gonna get it was voldemort because harry didn't know about it. so if voldemort did decide to just get it himself that one guard would've been useless anyway so.

****** I don't think he was necessarily going to stop him, but he would be able to sound the alarm (or his lack of checking in would be an alarm in itself) that Voldemort knows, and they can plan accordingly.
