Okay, it's time to shamelessly self-promote.

In a Parallel Universe Remus and Sirius had a daughter and son, respectively, around the same time Harry was born. Harry has a chance at a somewhat happy childhood with Rhea Lupin and Leo Black. During the annual summer adventure before Fourth Year, they found some interesting artefact in Grimmauld Place. Unexpectedly, Rhea and Leo are sent in a world in which they were never born, with a very different Sirius and Remus. Will they manage to go back or will they have to stay in a world filled with strangers?
