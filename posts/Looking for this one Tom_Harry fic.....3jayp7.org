I read it on AO3. Tom and Harry are alone in a room for the first time, and a magical force compels them to sleep together, much to both their disgust. Harry ends up pregnant and withdraws from the war. Everyone thinks it's just some random death eater's kid, not Voldy himself. Dumbledore sticks him in a safehouse somewhere in the suburbs. Harry has a daughter. For some twisted reason he names her Wynter. Hermione and Ron come by occasionally to play with her. Somehow Tom shows back up and finds out he has a daughter and eventually becomes a part of their life. Tom and Harry still can't be alone in one room together without magic making them tear each others' clothes off. Eventually they vaguely grow to like each other. Some of Tom's death eaters find out the location of Harry's safe house. They light up the place up. Tom gets there before the Order and daringly rescues Harry and Wynter from the flames. He whisks them away to hide them at his mansion because obviously no one can keep them safe like he can. That's pretty much as far as it was updated.

I forgot to save this fic and I've tried every combination of search terms I can think of and I just can't find it at all. I'd begin to worry I hallucinated it if I had such faith in my imagination skills.

Does anyone know what fic it is? Have you at least /heard/ of it, so we know I'm not crazy?
