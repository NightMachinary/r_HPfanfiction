I don't mean this in a rude way, but I simply do not understand the pairing at all, they are both good friends obviously, but to me they make an absolutely awful couple. Hermonie is not someone Harry would want to be with romantically at all, he's said in canon that while he loves Hermonie, spending all his time with her is boring. I just can't see them together at all

But I've been seeing some fics that I would be interested in except for that pairing, and I thought that maybe if I asked why other people like it I could understand it more


** For me it's not more complicated than I like Harry and I like Hermione. Friendship to lovers is a very easy step to take. They aren't perfect for each other, but no one is. Having different interests and personality than your romantic partner can be an opportunity for growth.

** Sometimes the best relationships are born out of close friendship. That's my reasoning as to why. Harry and Hermione are different from each other, but they are best friends. If you add in attraction, you get a relationship. Sure, Hermione can't be everything Harry might want, she doesn't like Quidditch, and Harry can't provide the kind of academia, etc., etc., but that's not really necessary for a good relationship. All you need to do is tweak Harry from, 'loves her as a sister,' to, 'wants to be with her romantically,' and you end up with an interesting fic. Does that help? Or is there anything else?

I can't help with the soulbond and true love people, I find them weird.

The idea that she's actually supposed to be short, but makes herself taller explains her clumsiness. But you know what would be great? Her actual height is like 1.89m, and she makes herself shorter.

But when it turns into, 'let me show you my true form,' kind of stuff I want to hard pass. It just doesn't make that much sense.

******* Ah, I suppose I should clarify that by 'True Form Tonks', I specifically mean the part where Tonks hates being used for her abilities. She's always been seen as an object, and then all of a sudden when Harry asks to see her true form, Tonks goes gaga over him, etc.

In my headcanon regarding Honks, Tonks is perfectly fine in using her abilities however and whenever, as she sees it as being who she is. Being a Metamorphmagus is her identity (however ironic that may sound), so she likely won't get angsty when people mostly see her for that.

******** I can see Tonks not wanting to date someone who wants her to ALWAYS fit into their ideal of beauty, but the "true form" bit always makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit. It's such a shame because it takes a tiny bit of work to turn it into something good. For example, metamorphs have no "true form". Instead, they have a constantly-shifting case of body dismorphia. Tonks, having spent years dealing with people who want her to always meet their standards of beauty, wants to date someone who won't reject her for being herself when she doesn't meet their desires.

At a most fundamental level, i think people believe, Harry is the male protagonist character, Hermione is the female protagonist character, therefore they have to end up together. If not that they haven't read the books, and only watched the movies, in which Ginny is almost non existent, and they can't fathom Harry being with Ginny.

Also, there's an article that counters ypurs and shows comparatively that Harry has glowing words for both.

*** Well idk I guess I just disagree. Harry was panicking after what he did to Draco and Hermonie's attitude wasn't helping, so Ginny stepped in to back him up. I don't think Ginny only loved him because he was famous Harry Potter, that's why she crushed on him when she was like 11 but she grew out of that and dated other people, only going back to Harry cuz she loved him.

Here's my problem, the most important part of a relationship is the ability to spend lots of time together alone and still enjoy the company of each other. But when Harry and Hermonie do that, in book4 when Ron is gone and in book7 when Ron is gone, Harry just doesn't enjoy himself. He still gets along with Hermonie but he doesn't have that fun with her that he has with Ron or Ginny. They aren't interested in the same things for fun

I think you're being unfair. Harry not enjoying himself in the middle of a dangerous tournament or in the middle of a warzone seems par for course to me. I've always read that as less about him not enjoying Hermione's presence and more about Ron's absence aggravating already dire circumstances.

And he does have fun with her. As we see in their library conversation about Filch and Madam Pince where they both laugh themselves silly. It is true that Hermione and Harry do not enjoy the same things, but I think it misrepresents their relationship to state that "he doesn't have fun with her as he has with Ron and Ginny".

Ron already knew that Hermione is more intelligent than him. He never feel insecure about it in the whole ass 7 books. He compliments her intelligence and brains many times even more than Harry. He quit his dream auror job to support his wife and children so that Hermione could persue her dreams. When you made some claim at least back it up.

She could have been in the corner and turned towards both boys. And even if she did turns towards Harry, how the f*uck it's romantic. She and Harry were the only one in the wedding with muggle background. It's the first time they were attending a wizards wedding and it's quite possible that she is overwhelmed with emotions. Turned towards Harry like are you overwhelmed too.

#+begin_quote
  The reason can be found in book 6 after Harry used Sectumsempra on Draco: While Hermione tries to talk some sense into Harry's head, Ginny feels the need to attack Hermione. Because Ginny is a fangirl to whom everything Harry does is right, even nearly murdering Draco. So while Hermione tries her best to keep Harry's feet on the ground, Ginny actually thinks it's OK when Harry shows the world what he's like at his worst.
#+end_quote

Ginny doesn't think it's okay. Harry was already beating himself about this and he needs someone to say it's not entirely his fault instead of Hermione's told you so attitude. That's why he was grateful when Ginny defended him.

  which in fact is the ONLY reason why Ginny loves him, making her a total mismatch

** My two knuts: Harry/Hermione could have worked out well if one or preferably both of them were a bit better. If Harry stepped up his work ethic and better appreciated Hermione's dedication to study. If Hermione learned to listen more sympathetically. If Harry embraced a bit more Slytherin cunning and worked through existing channels and authority figures more often, instead of striking out to fix problems himself. If Hermione loosened up to laugh more.

So I think it's a popular pairing partially because if you see the characters make mistakes and wish that they could do better, then you're wishing for a world where Harry/Hermione is feasible.

** I've written about this before. Here you go:

Harmione is my guilty pleasure ship because it's such a trainwreck. They are codependent and poorly matched, and yet still so desperately trying to love the other in the only ways they know how. They can't communicate for shit, and they want drastically different things, but it's always been Hermione who stayed and Harry she chose, so they step into a relationship even if everything feels wrong.

Anyway, in my daydreams, I love concocting ways wherein Harry finally learns to freaking appreciate Hermione, and Hermione at long last gets that she matters just as much as everyone else she's been trying to take care of. I've no doubt that it'll take a near tragedy to get them to anywhere close to healthy, but I desperately want it anyway. I have no clue if I even ship them romantically, but in my head, they are and will always be each other's ONE.

  But does Harry need to have romantic feelings for Hermione or to constantly think about how great she is in order for us to know that he genuinely appreciates her?
#+end_quote

Full disclosure: I'm aroace - I fall in the school of attraction isn't necessary for anything. My fascination had always been more in line with the intensity of their emotional connection as opposed to any attraction they might feel for each other (this is usually the argument of the canon shippers - that they have never expressed attraction to each other). SO to answer the first part of your question, I do believe that romantic feelings is wholly unnecessary.

(And before this confuses anyone, I'm just going to go on record and say that I /don't/ necessarily envision their relationship to be romantic - just that it's their singularly /most important relationship/.)

For the second part, the thing about Harry and Hermione is that, in canon, they have a largely unequal relationship. Harry had, by and large, preferred people like Ron and Ginny over Hermione. He prefers to have fun and often resents how she asks him to focus on the mission or asks him to be cautious. For as much as Harry represents duty to Hermione, Hermione represents the mission to Harry as well. The difference between them is that Hermione embraces her duty wholeheartedly while Harry resents it even as he moves to fulfill it. He loves her but doesn't fully appreciate the way she's been keeping her alive - at least not in the same way he appreciates the way Ron and Ginny bring levity into his life,

So for the second part of the question, yes, I do believe that Harry has to do some serious introspection about Hermione's place in his life and their relationship. More than that, I need him to /act/ on that introspection. It's only then that I'll be satisfied that he appreciates her enough.

#+begin_quote
  The ones who had a crush on Emma Watson are straightforward but I've also seen many who seem to relate to Hermione on a personal level and resent Harry for falling for the sexy Cool Girl instead.
#+end_quote

First and foremost, I'm going to admit that I'm pretty new to the fandom and have missed most of the ship wars. I only know the very surface of the prevailing arguments for both sides. More than that, I can't speak for other Harmione shippers. All the opinions you see here are mine and mine alone. (If anything, I suspect my particular reading for Harmione would be pretty unpopular in most Harmione spaces.)

That said, I actually fall in neither camp. First, again I'm aroace. Second, I don't actually dislike Harry/Ginny as a ship. The ship is cute if poorly written and underdeveloped. Harry and Ginny are quite attracted to each other, but other than that, we don't actually see much of their relationship. As someone incredibly unimpressed with attraction, the relationship just doesn't suit my tastes or my needs.

Contrast to Harry and Hermione's relationship. Godric's Hallow is arguably one of the most emotionally intense and intimate scenes of the entire series. It's the two of them against the world, and they have no one else to turn to for comfort except each other. Harry comes /home/, and he stands in front of his parents' graves for the very first time with nothing to offer them but his grief and desperation. And it's Hermione who shares that moment with him. It's Hermione who gives him something to offer. In that moment of despair, it's Hermione who is Harry's reprieve and safe harbor.

When it comes to emotional intimacy, I've found that no other pairing matches Harry and Hermione when it comes to intensity. When it comes to [[https://www.thoughtco.com/romanticism-definition-4777449][romanticism]], Harry and Hermione's relationship beats nearly every pairing by a mile. Their relationship is characterized by grief, duty, and desperation. There is an immensely complicated love between them - one they both have difficulty conveying and yet desperately trying to anyway. Their relationship is a tense dance because they are incredibly different people - and yet they never fail to come together when it matters most. Because that's what their love does.

I've said this already in the grandparent post, but I think it bears repeating. Harry and Hermione's relationship is a trainwreck. I don't deny that. But it is precisely /because/ they are a trainwreck that I love them so.

(I hope this clarifies things for you!)

Either way, Harry doesn't appreciate a lot of the ways Hermione expresses her love (especially since it's less fun and more of the life-saving kind), and he takes her help and presence for granted. But I suppose we'll just have to agree to disagree here.

It's just a matter of preference. *shrug*
