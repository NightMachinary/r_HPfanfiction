Has there ever been a fic done that had multi-compartment houses like they do with trunks? I can imagine several interesting reasons to do so, apartments for instance, each compartment could be a different house. The whole multi-compartment thing seems like there has been a severe lack of imagination put into it in the fiction world, its pretty much only trunks that I've seen.


** Once read a fic where Grimmuald Place had like multiple rooms in storage. Armory, ballroom, etc. And Kreacher could add and removed rooms, and restructure the entire house based on Sirius's orders. Every head of the House of Black had the house configured differently. Thought that was a neat concept.

***** Mischief's Heir series (where Harry and diary Tom start a wizarding space program) has a Grimmauld Place with stored, changeable rooms, if I'm remembering correctly.
