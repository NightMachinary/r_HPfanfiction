Inspired by linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2265983]])

I'd love to hear about fics where a witch or wizard has a natural affinity for a specific type of magic, be it individual or family-based.

I do want fics where *any* witch or wizard can have a natural affinity. I know there's a few with family-based affinities that essentially devolve into "purebloods are awesome, it's those non-assimilating mudbloods with no respect for our culture that ruin everything" and I want to avoid that. If there's going to be a family-based affinity for something, let it be something anyone could develop, with a muggleborn just being a family of 1 in that case.


** I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative by Vichan]]. It goes into that dark/light affinity story without (in my opinion) becoming obnoxious. There is a bit of that secretly good Slytherin idea if you're not into that (honestly imo this fic actually keeps them assholes in a way but allows us to see on their side and be aware of the circumstances that shaped them etc... the important thing is they're not all death eaters).

** linkffn(7971405) is a really good one.

Very unique take on magic in general, and Harry is pretty much the only one who can harness magic in his way. Sadly its been abandoned but I think its a good read regardless.

  Magic is everywhere. It is the energy that makes up all life and controls the very elements themselves. Magic is alive, a creature untamed, a savage beast. Well, we know what they say about beasts and music.
