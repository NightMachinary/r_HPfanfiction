I can see magic people have forgotten about would have uses because if it's a transportation spell that anti apparition spells can't stop or a curse that needs a specific counter to it that nobody else or few people know about but I read a fic recently for instance where someone said that first years in founders era learned everything hogwarts teaches.


** This is a literary trope that goes far beyond /Harry Potter/ and is present in all sorts of media and narratives. TVTropes calls it [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter][Older is Better]].

** There's a lot of shit hanging around in canon that magical people presumably made in the past that it is unclear they could replicate in the present. For example: consider The Room of Requirement. It's crazy and overpowered and bizzare ability to do anything makes it actually beat out Time Machines as the most overpowered canon plot device. It looks convenient and useful as fuck. A bunch of wizards created it a long time ago, and nowadays people /don't/ buy a wizarding tent or house or whatever with all of the Room of Requirement enchantments built into them as a matter of standard practice. If you /could/ replicate a Room of Requirement with modern magical knowledge then Malfoys would have one or more in their manor, as would all the other super-wealthy, and knowledge of what a Room of Requirement is and how it worked would not be a super vital secret nearly lost entirely to history in 1990, but instead a part of standard society that everyone would know about.

It makes more sense to me that the ability to enchant Rooms of Requirement was lost, rather than the idea that actually they can enchant them and no-one nowadays does so. It's not like anyone reacts to the Room with "Oh yeah, our Room of Requirement at home is a newer version with the upgraded runes that let it supply books in order of utility rather than by alphabetical order, the newer ones are way better than this old piece of shit from medieval times!"

Frankly there's a lot of forbidden lost lore and knowledge in Harry Potter canon. The art of making Philosopher's Stones, the location and nature of the Chamber of Secrets & assoc. monster, the Deathly Hallows, the Horcrux ritual, etc. A lot of things are created and then knowledge of them suppressed rather than spread and innovated upon.

*** Equally, there are modern artefacts like the deluminator that ancient wizards didn't create. I think it's more accurate to say that each wizard (ancient and modern) possesses non-replicable unique skills which die with them, rather than there being a trend of magic progressing or declining. Magical objects are more like pieces of art or the result of craftsmanship than they are like technology.

*** I've always thought it was able to do that because of all the kids there. Hogwarts is a school full of kids that, as we see with Harry, can still perform accidental magic. I think that when kids cast spells they are less efficient than an adult because their magic is still developing, their control is still developing. If we look at it like that, the hundreds of kids living there most of the year provide a great deal of power, especially in a room that isn't used all the time.

** in-universe, i'd say it would come from "misplaced nostalgia" combined with "rose-tinted glasses" ('everything was better in the old days...'), "parrot-tier belief" ('...because my father said so!'), and a hint of "ancestor worship", possibly with a few additions of "magical artifacts that gain power over time instead of lose it"

out-of-universe? no clue. they didn't have many resources back then either, my best guess is "the past is exotic, unknown, and MYSTERIOUS! the grass must have been greener!"

granted, the four founders probably TAUGHT many subjects, but that would be because there weren't anywhere near as many teachers nor students at the time (both due to just starting out and due to much higher death rates).

in fact, the high death rates in general, and all the systems in place even in the magical world to prevent those in the modern day, kind of get glossed over.

** I think it has to do with the type of magic---the magic of the old days was plagues of insects and tornadoes of fire, etc, in most worlds. Flashy, powerful stuff that wasn't highly focused. The highly focused magic of Harry Potter, for example, doesn't compare. The idea of a stunning spell, or a curse that only kills what it hits, and can be cast with nothing more than a wave of a wand and a few words is probably the highly technologically advanced version, and is also probably a significant improvement. But it's not flashy. It's not “destroy a whole town in a display of solo power and might (and a three hour chant in a made up language or some stone circles or some runes).”

** A logical reason for this, if it's actually true, would be that the Statute of Secrecy, isolating Wizards from people without magic, lead to stagnation due to communities becoming much smaller so the idea exchange pool is much smaller. It doesn't really explain why Founder-era would have better magic, however.

Personally, while I can definitely see certain things as being lost to time, I don't think modern magic is overall /worse/. Perhaps something that would be truly extraordinary in current Wizarding Britain (maybe means of controlling Lycanthropy to a better extent than current Wolfsbane, or even curing it, for example), but overall I think magic has improved.

** Bashing is nearly universal in bad fanfiction. Bashing of the wizarding world, or the ministry, is no different than bashing a character. What you described has absolutely no biases in canon. It is a literary trope that is frustratingly common in fantasy though. So it's a bit understandable when people would try applying it to HP, even if it is stupid.

** It's a pretty common trope in fantasy in general to have historical super wizards that no one in present day can live up to. Agamoto from the Doctor Strange comics, Magnus from The Elder Scrolls, the Wizard King Guy (can't remember his name or title, but it might've just been the wizard king) from Ni No Kuni, probably others I can't think of right now . . . I think it's just a fun, badass trope to be able to talk about ancient magic that's been lost in the modem day.

Hell, there's even a bit of it in canon with the implicit reverence for Merlin and the Peverell brothers creating enchanted objects that, as far as we know, nobody has ever been able to replicate. Harry's cloak is in perfect condition after centuries of use, and we literally never even hear a hint of anybody being able to do anything like what the Resurrection Stone does intentionally. (Granted, Priori Incantatem does something similar, but it's not something that can be triggered intentionally, and it's definitely not as simple as dicking around with a little rock for a bit.)

*** Could it be that the cost was considered too high and people did what they could to hide their existence/how they came to be? Maybe it requires sacrificing hundreds or thousands to give it the power, maybe the ring brings illusions that say what the wielder expects them to say or in one fic I've read, it leads them to death, maybe the wand is more easily used by many wizards that is enchanted somehow or maybe more an amplifier than a true wand. So a truly skilled wizard would have his power amplified but he has to shape the magic more himself.

** Considering that Harry, Dumbledore and Voldemort are all half bloods there's a good chance that half bloods are actually superior (more different parents equals more different traits instead of the same traits twice which means more powerful magic). As such all the "toujours pur" behavior has been crippling the old families that hoard all the knowledge about the most powerful magic that they themselves are too weak to wield while the half bloods who have actually strong magic don't have access to the most powerful knowledge, with Voldemort and Dumbledore being exceptions.

** So a couple of ways I take it.

The younger Earth was more magical, just all around. Races like the Fey and others walked freely.

Then over time magic was reduced as non-magical humans found ways to rise above it. IE iron and steel, the means by which to kill vampire and demons, etc.

Additionally, especially in the HPverse you have the statue. The statue requires that big flashy magic no longer by openly practiced. Over time things are forgotten or lost.

​

Also if human sacrifice, a common theme in less developed societies of history, is a major component of powerful magics, then a more enlightened world where such is banned will have less powerful magics worked.

Horocruxes are immortality after all. A twisted form of it sure, but immortality none the less. For all we know the philosopher stone required the death of millions, using the plague as a catalyst then capturing the souls/lives of the dying to create it, a la Full Metal Alchemist.

​

The degree to which this is truth can be taken with a grain of salt, but if the magical world is obsessed with hiding itself then magic is slowly going to be regulated to death and extinction. Especially since the Ministries mandate to govern is based on maintaining the Statute.

*** I agree and I was thinking the long time to cast or sacrifices were required for the major flashy magic. Maybe a lot of casters as well. I feel like modern magic is more efficient whether in cost, effect, cast time, or purpose. Why kill a hundred people if your trying to kill one. I feel like magic designed to kill hundreds or thousands at whatever cost is at least frowned upon, maybe restricted.

** Is it ever stated that magic is improved as time goes on? I know it's fanon that even simple curses like Petrificus Totalus were once a death sentence, and that spell innovations like Snape's are canon, but I cannot for the life of me recall that it was ever said definitively that magic progressed. If anything, wizardkind has a negative attitude towards change that is best exemplified by the purebloods.

I would imagine that famous wizarding figures tend to be lionized like real historical people, and that's the main reason why they are often seen as being more powerful than modern witches and wizards. Moreover, the Founders created Hogwarts and put enchantments on the castle that last until the present day, so they're clearly no slouches in the magical power/skill department, and there are no feats of similar note in canon as far as I can recall.

** well, one common theme in a lot of fics i've read essentially blame it on wands. and usually the romans (who introduced said wands in most such stories).

​

basically having most other forms of magic being put aside and gradually forgotten, not because wands were superior, but because they were /faster./ and easier to use.

​

usually also includes the trope that staves require far more raw power to use than wands.

*** If it is only a matter of speed, I doubt it would be a thing. We see a lot of people with superiority complexes. We also see a lot of people with wands, who has a stave? My view has always been staffs release more powerful spells but they have horrible control. Wand magic is more malleable. In order to conquer someone, you have to be superior in some way. If something was superior to your own, wouldn't you want to make it yours?

******* My thoughts regarding Staffs vs Wands was that Staffs allow for far more powerful spells and shields with some very important caveats. For shielding, the staff must have one end in contact with the ground, thus stopping the user from being able to relocate while shielding (mobility problems). For casting spells, the staff is used as a rifle (magical power build-up needed to /fire/ the spell) or swung to /sling/ the spell. The first method is longer-ranged than wands, but takes time and effort to build up the launching magical pulse while the second is, by its nature, only moderately accurate.

In combat, the sheer power available to a staff-user is countered by the mobility and faster rate of spellfire available to wand-users, plus staff-users require more space to work in, thus in crowded environments (indoors, forests etc), the advantage flips fully to the Wand.

On the other hand, should a Wand user come up against something immune to magic, they are in trouble. A staff user has several feet of reinforced wood to hit it with until it goes away.

Cursebreakers probably use Staffs to take down Wards and shield against traps. Those who work with Dragons probably appreciate shields strong enough to deflect dragonfire and probably dragons themselves.

*** This is actually a super old concept. We only talked about it once in class for like 5 mins so apologies if I'm butchering the sentiment but there was a Confucion concept of that the past was always better and that younger generations will never achieve the greatness of our ancestors. Which pointed out the fact that this concept has been around since practically the beginning of time. Ever since that class I think about generational history a little differently. It's probably an element of the historical idealization trope.

** I feel like wizarding innovation is guided more by convenience. Every witch and wizard is crazy powerful and don't need a lot of things in order to thrive. Leisure items can be conjured and the only really life-threatening things are also magical in nature. If you take the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie as an example you get to watch a handful of American magicians calmly walking about waving their wands and requilding a city. Newt even rebuilds an entire building himself with one utterance of the repairing spell. Maybe insanely powerful artifacts and structures fell out of style with the development and understanding of even more powerful wands? they are certainly more convenient.

In the past wizards and witches were more prosecuted, possibly more prominent in society, and maybe more prone to infighting. I like the idea that the Statute of Secrecy has stagnated wizarding society, and why wouldn't it? Immoral as it may have been, past magical folk would be more free to exercise their abilities. If there were more magicals in the past there would also be more innovation. later on, in the time period of Harry, perhaps magic is more strictly corralled and regulated.

Another thought I have is that Wizarding culture is closely linked with the whole master/apprentice ideal. Personal achievements in magic would be closely and jealousy held. Many families would teach on a familial level and few institutions of magical learning would exist. I imagine that after Hogwarts, most young magicals would spend the next several years training under a specific branch or craft of magic.

Back to my original point, in the "modern" wizarding day, most live in an insular society without much to worry about other than the occasional dark wizard, thus, their lives would be governed less by hardship and more by convenience. Magic shouldn't be easy to learn and most have all they will ever need in life with only a basic understanding.
