  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

** In /A Long Journey Home/ fem!Harry gets sent back 5000 years in time. The only way home? To live. The story alternates between arcs describing her adventures in the past and her current struggles of reconnecting with Ron and Hermione after so much time apart, while they have to deal with the fact that their best friend seemingly became a whole new person over night. The story is absolutely amazing and probably my current favorite in all of fanfiction.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

***** I remember there being some different words that the author doesn't consistently spell the same way. Unfortunately since I'm at work I don't remember exactly which words those are. Some of those words were magic related and others weren't.

You have a good point about making allowances for non-native English speakers, and for lack of practice with writing.

Different readers have different story flaws that, for them, are deal breakers. For me, terrible spelling and grammar is one such flaw, though I am happy to overlook a reasonable amount if the plot is good enough or if the author mentions they aren't a native English speaker. In the specific case of inconsistent spelling, that indicates the author didn't use spell check.

** linkffn(Kaleidoscope of Magic)

The beginning is filled with cliches but you asked for a stupidly op MC and in those stories there are often some cliches. It does get better and it is somewhat explained. The early angst is dealt with and the insanity is actually rather interesting.

It's a merge with Dresden Files and it does it rather well. The Naruto elements (Sharingan and Mokuton are the only things) are important but they are explained in a fitting manner and there is no "jutsu, kunai, rasengan" BS happening.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.
