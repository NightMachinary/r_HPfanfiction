I'm curious if it's just my specific rarepair, or if a lot of other people have noticed formally complete (or long-abandoned) favorites being deleted and slowly re-posted by their respective authors?

(I confess, Charlie/Hermione isn't the most common favorite to begin with, but there are only a handful of Really Good Stories that have disappeared over lockdown, only for some of them to be slowly reappearing again.)

Is this common across FFN/Ao3 and I never noticed? Are more people sorting by “update date” because ... it's 2020, and authors are capitalizing on the hits? Is this this A Thing beyond my personal saved search?

My “old reliables” are gone (for now?) and I'm sad...


** No, not a common thing at all. Never happened to any of my favorites in the last 18 years.

At least if we are talking reposting with no changes/improvements. The only thing that does happen a bit more often is authors taking down their older fics. Either for good because they aren't happy with the quality from that long ago or to repost them after they polished them up to their current standards.
