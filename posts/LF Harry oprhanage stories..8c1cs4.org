Looking for any good stories where the Dursleys put our young hero in an orphange or even abandon him. I don't care if they are dark light slash or not as long as they are good and if slash or not, do not suddenly become porn when the romance starts. I am ok if there is no romance either or even if Harry dies at the end or destroys all life. I just need quality reading.


** I'm currently editing a story where Harry is sent to an orphanage before eventually ending up at Durmstrang, but I'm pretty busy right now moving, so I don't know when it'll actually get posted.

*** This is such an annoying trope since there are no orphanages in the time period. It's a small thing, but one that is hard to get over.

***** Britain got rid of orphanages in the 60s or 70s. By the time Harry was born there were no more of them around. If Harry was left with nowhere to go he'd be in foster care.

******* Afaik social services will work out a foster home for the kid pretty quickly - foster parents are basically on call 24/7 if there's an emergency. I believe there /are/ group foster homes, however you probably wouldn't be able to just dump a kid on their front steps since they sort of have to be secure and even if you could an eighteen month old toddler wouldn't stay there. But they certainly aren't /called/ orphanages.

******** I wrote part of a story once where Harry was in a group home. His accidental magic growing up freaked people out so he kept getting bounced around until he got dumped with a group of kid deemed implacable. It was my take on the whole orphanage trope since it's always bothered me. My story had a BWL Neville, and the premise is without the blood protection thing Petunia didn't feel it necessary to keep Harry.

******* They're called residential childrens' care homes now, and they're for when fostering doesn't work for the child concerned. Every local authority at the county or unitary level has at least one, most have several. One of the ones in Surrey, which closed in the late 80s/early 90s (I forget which) became the subject of serious historic sex abuse investigations, and if memory serves at least one of the staff ended up with a stiff prison sentence.

Harry, one suspects, would probably go straight in to foster care and since the worst we see out of him pre-Hogwarts is the occasional smartarse remark, he'd not end up in a home.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7 fulfills the criteria I think. It's a very well written fic; only thing is it's VERY heavy on the angst. Since the topic of the thread is being in an orphanage I don't think it's a spoiler to say he winds up there in chapter 7.

**** Just to add to what had been said, the story revolves around Harry's angst. It is a revenge story which is based off the hated and abandonment spawned in a young child which then grew and never faded. There are about 15 chalets so to be written and more than that which have yet to be uploaded.
