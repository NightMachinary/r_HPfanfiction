***** Though it might be an interesting idea, could be a basis of a depressed!Harry or NoMorals!Harry. I dunno, hopefully someone knows of a fic

****** I have a feeling linkffn(The Red Knight by Demon Eyes Laharl) might be similar, but with Ron instead. Along with a couple other twists.

******** Normally I'm the same, but this fic is interesting. I'm not sure I'd call it good, but it is definitely entertaining.

  When Ron Weasley realized he was reborn to the world with his memories mostly intact, he felt it was a second chance to do better. However, he slowly realizes that this world was different from his own. Making new friends and earning new enemies, he has to use his experience from his previous life not only to reach his goals, but also to survive. AU

  Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children.
