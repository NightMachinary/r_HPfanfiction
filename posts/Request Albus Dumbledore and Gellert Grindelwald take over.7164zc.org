Looking for any stories however AU they are doesn't matter where Albus and Gellert take over the Wizarding World and maybe Muggle World. (Can be permanent or not).

Any rating is fine would rather it be completed but a bunch of chapters is fine. Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash.


** linkffn(6957439) is the one I can think of off the top of my head. Fred and George muck up the timeline, and come back to this. Unfortunately, it's not finished.

I've definitely read another one with almost the same premise and different characters, but I can't remember it right now.

*** Bah! Why do they always make Grindelwald a pureblood supremacist? It was always about wizard supremacy over Muggles, dammit!

**** My gripe too.

Magical supremacy is NOT THE SAME as Pureblood supremacy.

Grindelwald might very well heavily promote EQUAL RIGHTS for all Magicals, and that would hold immense appeal to Muggleborns who were discriminated by the Pureblood establishment and disillusioned with the Muggle world (WW1, Great Depression, and continued religious persecution).

My head canon says that Muggleborns made up a huge portion of Grindelwald's followers, and atrocities committed by them were a major contributing factor to Voldemort's hate of them.

Dumbledore's own mother was Muggleborn, and it was not certain Grindelwald was a Pureblood. If they had treated Muggleborns like in that story, that would have been the equivalent of Dumbledore digging up his own mother's body and pissing on her remains. Chances were, if these two had won, they would have massacred the Pureblood establishment who had insisted on separating the two worlds.

Furthermore, both Dumbledore and Grindelwald spoke nothing of 'enslaving' Muggles, but more of ruling Muggles for their own good. Given how badly the Muggle world was messed up after WW1 and the Great Depression, I'm even of the opinion that millions of Muggles would find great appeals in benevolent tyrant with superpowers. After all, how many joined the likes of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, KKK, Mao Zedong, and Japanese militarists during the 1930s?

I'm outlining the era of my story after Voldemort/Grindelwald win(big AU), and I have a number of Grindelwald's oldest followers(I'm talking 80+ years old) being pure-blooded. Pure-blooded followers are a minority in his organization, but many of them have been around so long that I can't see my Grindelwald killing them. His own right hand man is a somewhat liberal-ish pureblood who likes Voldemort about as much as canon Harry does.

My headcanon is that Grindelwald just doesn't give a shit about blood status. Actions always have a purpose, and from what we know, Grindelwald wasn't batshit crazy, so I don't see massacring the pure-blood establishment providing any benefit to him. If anything, I could see him directing any anger he has towards the establishment towards any unfortunate muggles that cross his path.

I've thought of many characterizations of Grindelwald over the past few months, though. One of them was fairly similar to yours, although I threw that idea away fairly quickly. My Grindelwald and Voldemort (at best) would rather ignore each other, but work together anyways. Massacring the establishment would alienate allies as well.

I really like how, as of now, JK has left Grindelwald fairly open to interpretation. It allows for the potential to give him many different personalities and values. I am looking forward to what new information we get from Fantastic Beasts, though.

****** A Dark Lord would always massacre the faction or the group that opposed him.

My take was that Pureblood establishment was the most resolute faction opposing him, and many villains of the Blood War later (Lestranges, Malfoys) were actually heroes in the Grindelwald War.

Pureblood establishment DOESN'T MEAN all Purebloods. In fact, most Purebloods were NOT part of the establishment. Many disadvantaged Purebloods were perfectly happy to join a powerful Dark Lord to massacre those who were rich and occupied positions of power. Greed and envy were powerful motivators.

Tom Riddle in 1940s was just a student, and he wasn't even Voldemort until 1943. If Grindelwald had won, Tom's career path would have been a lot more different. Tom offering his service to Grindelwald with the goal of replacing him later was certainly possible.

My liberal pureblood(also OC) I mentioned is Black/Malfoy level rich. He's more motivated by the promise of magical equality. What makes him tricky to outline is that he's not only a Grindelwald follower, but he's also a Death Eater who later grew to regret joining. His impression as a younger man was that Voldemort wanted to pick up the magical supremacy fight again. Voldemort used this to manipulate him, as well as some of the parents of canon Death Eaters. My Voldemort is essentially a saner version of his canon self. I imagine the Death Eaters as a melting pot of war heroes that fought against Grindelwald, and ex-Grindelwald followers who joined for various other reasons, or were manipulated into doing so.

Canon Voldemort killed muggles. One could twist that into him wanting a magical utopia as well - although when concerning canon, Voldemort wanted a /pure-blood/ utopia.

I think a utopia for wizards/witches as a whole is a powerful motivator as well. If I were in a wizard's place, I'd much prefer magical rule over the world. I wouldn't voluntarily hide from muggles.

I can definitely see this happening. After my Voldemort/Grindelwald win, I do forsee conflict arising. Although how so I still haven't given thought to. Both had some similar beliefs, but their core ideals were very different.

Concerning this scenario as per the canon world, what belief system would Tom fight for? In that kind of an alternate universe, I can't see him fighting for blood supremacy, being a half-blood himself. He's additionally not Voldemort as we know it. Is he fighting purely because of selfish desire for power, or is there another underlying motive?

******** What's Dumbledore's role in your story?

I assume he was in league with Grindelwald, and these two guys working together would have profound impact on Magical Europe early on. Tom, if the very lucky events leading to his birth still happened, might not end up in Muggle orphanage at all.

********* Spoiler alert.

So Voldemort kills Harry's parents, but kidnaps Harry instead of raising him. A few months later, a bunch of people, mostly OCs(led by the father of Rodolphus/Rasbastan Lestrange, and OC Arcturus Sweeney, former right hand man of Grindelwald, and Voldemort's reluctant second in command), break Grindelwald out of prison.

Dumbledore is a bit more of a manipulator than in canon, although unlike pretty much every manipulative Dumbledore story, he recognizes this, but accepts that he's really the only person who can stand up to Voldemort or Grindelwald both politically and in a duel. He does harbor some sympathies to certain facets of Grindelwald's belief system, but my Dumbledore isn't going to join him.

Voldemort and Grindelwald don't like each other at all, and Grindelwald, after winning back all of continental Europe by the time Harry starts Hogwarts, will actually start plotting against him with a small group of his followers and Death Eaters. Grindelwald is a magic supremacist in the story. Voldemort is in kind of a limbo in his beliefs, although his belief in pure-blood supremacy will likely win out eventually.

I do think Voldemort and Grindelwald will fight in a potential sequel. Where their followers lie in this I haven't given thought to yet.

  Fred and George end up back in time, break up the fight that would've killed Ariana Dumbledore, then watch Albus and Grindelwald leave without realizing just how much they've changed until they return to a twisted future. More detailed summary inside.
