looking for these fanfics. I'll write as much as I can remember.

1: Harry comes back to school after the war, Daphne, Astoria and Tracey find him asleep in a compartment. He names Ginny a Potter (calls her his sister), talks about what he did with his wealth over the summer (think he buys a plane) the summer. Daphne admits to fancying him and falls asleep in his arms. When they get to school Ron is a complete dick.

2: Happens over a summer in the later years (pretty sure Sirius is dead). Daphne's dad abused her and after they fall in love he approaches her about a marriage contract. Dumbledore is a dick and tries to get in the property with Fawkes only to fail. I think they employ Dobby AND Winky.

Thanks you :)

  Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG
