If I read about Marauders, I want them to make it past war. So is there a Marauder fic where they stay alive and happy? Maybe AU where they discovered Peter was Death Eater early on, or maybe stories where there was no prophecy, etc. I would prefer post-Hogwarts stories or at least 6-7th year, but if not, also fine. And please, no slash or hardcore Snape bashing.

*** I've read this one before, I remember it was quite good, but nothing else much. For some reason I've only read the first part, maybe I should give it another go. Thank you for the recommendation.

** linkffn(8809533) is Lily-centric, but there's plenty of Marauders in it.

linkao3(1577144) is the first part (or prequel, maybe) of a series that is a pretty interesting canon retelling -- just with James, Lily, Sirius, and Remus all there and very present! Very stations-of-canon, but that's sort of the selling point -- how do these people react to these things?

  Godric's Hollow, October 31, 1981. The fated night for the Potters.Peter thought he'd make a short trip to James' and Lily's. After all, he was the only person who knew where they were hiding (as far as they knew). They'd be alone. No Sirius to come muck everything up. Not even Remus could drop in for a visit. They'd be ever so happy to see little old Peter. Lily would probably make him tea and cakes, and then he'd be on his way with neither of them the wiser.Oh, he'd finally have gotten his laugh. After all those years.A prequel to the Everyone Lives series.

** I'm not 100% sure about the etiquette about how to recommend stories here, being relatively new, so apologies if I do something wrong. But if you look up the author Daily-Chan, they have a good series called "A bond of Family". It is in lots of separate parts so can't really link it properly. Them stories show an alternate history version of what the Marauders were like, focusing a lot on them looking after each other through their problems. The main series is canon compliant, but if you read up until Halloween 1981, you get the backing story to read the alternative shoot off stories that they wrote about them surviving etc. Though I would recommend reading the whole Bond of Family series, it has quite a few feel-good moments.

This is a decent example of the alternative 1981 onwards stories: linkffn(12212875)

** At this point linkao3(10057010) is without a doubt my favorite Marauders fic.

It didn't turn me into a wolfstar shipper - but I do read quality fics that are wolfstar now because of it. It's AU in that Remus grew up an orphan in a boy's home knowing he was a werewolf but not knowing he was a wizard. But otherwise it's pretty spot on and includes the few events we know occurred in canon (the boys becoming animagi, the map, the post OWLs argument with Snape/Lily, Sirius sending Snape to the Whomping Willow). It's so realistic that half of me wants to believe it's what actually happened!

It's so well written and it's ongoing and updated regularly (at least once a week). We haven't gotten to 1981 yet, so I can't tell you what's on the horizon, but I highly recommend it. I think it's an incredible read and I'm very attached to the series, I'm so scared for what's going to unfold (aka how AU is she going to go?)

  VERY LONG fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges.Eventual wolfstar, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! On the plus side, I do update very often (sometimes twice a week, sometimes daily).First Year - Sixth Year complete, Seventh Year in full swing - AND THE FIC IS NOW OFFICIALLY WOLFSTAR!!!!***WINNER of the 2017 Marauder Medal, 'Best Work in Progress' by the Shrieking Shack Society!***

**** Up until, let's say their 6th year - there's no Sirius/Remus goings-on. And then it does become a part of the story, but again it's not central beyond one or two storylines that happen later on (it's a very lengthy fic, so it'll take you a while to get there!) Honestly by the time you arrive at any wolfstar, I found myself being like just KISS ALREADY YOU FOOLS! But I've always been pretty lax in my shipping anyway.

I really do highly recommend it. And the story is definitely about their friendship from a very unique POV: Remus's. And a Remus who is about as self-assured as a PoA Remus. I also sometimes think it paints a more accurate portrayal of the Marauder's friendship - Sirius and James being especially close. Peter always a teensy bit of an outsider (perhaps because of Sirius more than anyone), but always included and a bit more than just a dough-faced tag-a-long. And a Remus (who again sans family makes this a bit AU) who is intelligent and a bit scarred and tentative about the friendship he fosters with them, but nonetheless a true friend all the same.

I hope you enjoy it if you try and let me know what you think :)

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.
