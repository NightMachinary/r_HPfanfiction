Hey guys! I'm kind of sad because I think I've read all the good fics out there so could anyone recommend some well-written, multi-chapter Sirius Black fics? I'm particularly interested in SiriusxOC (kudos if it's fem!Harry) but I'm open to other suggestions. Oh, and preferably no slash:)


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11781616/1/Twisting-Time][Twisting Time]] by the-writer1988 is an interesting Sirius centric fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

*** Hey, checking in 12 days later to tell you that Foreshadowing Demise is awesome and I can't wait til it updates! Thanks for the recommendation! I really didn't think I'd become so invested in Young Sirius and Regulus when the fic started. It's such an engaging read.

  Sirius and Regulus did not get along. They were Gryffindor-Slytherin, fire-ice...but what about Regulus and padfoot?

  Sirius never stopped to think that his brother may not have joined the Death Eaters of his own free will. Or just how thorough a tragedy his death was. Oh the secrets a diary reveals and the unique opportunities a deadly veil offers.

** When I asked for recs for something along these lines a while back, I got pretty much no response, so I don't think there's much out there - it doesn't seem to be a very popular theme. So I will link mine. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10841322/1/Dark-Birthright]] . It seems to meet most of your criteria and it's part of a series. It's not completely awful but I am working on a rewrite, though that won't be fiished for some time.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12489418/1/Hourglass][Hourglass]] is my longest fic. It's a time-travel fic with Hermione/Sirius as the main pairing.

During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, a poorly aimed spell hits Hermione, sending her hurtling into the cabinet of time-turners, and thereby launching her through time. Will she find a way back to her own time? Or will the past become her present? AU- Time-travel.
