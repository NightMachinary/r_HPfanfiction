** Harry blinked. Twice. "You mean I /don't/ have to scrounge through the dumpsters for food? I can just... eat it?" Harry asked bemusedly; Vernon had always claimed that orphanages only served gruel, and that even "a scrawny little freak like you" would surely starve on such pathetic victuals. The Mother Superior, Sister Mary, raised an eyebrow. "Yes, of course! It's hardly 5 star worthy, but we'd never allow a child to starve.".

"Oh... my Uncle Vernon always said differently, but the counselor said he lied to me about a lot, so..." Harry trailed off. Sister Mary resisted the urge to frown, stiffen, or otherwise react physically at all to that information. "Harry... why don't you tell me what else your Uncle "told you" about orphanages. I may be able to clear up some of his... misconceptions about what we do." she said neutrally. It was only supposed to be an introductory meeting before she handed him off to one of the sisters to be assigned a room, but it seemed that more important issues had just extended their meeting. Harry nodded unwillingly, but began to talk.

"...that's not true either." she finally managed to say to the latest bit of misinformation. Harry smiled hesitantly, glad that Uncle Vernon had been wrong all along. He said so. "Indeed. Well, Harry, I hope that's cleared up a few things for you. Now, let's see about getting you a room, and some clothes that fit... yes, we do that too." the Mother Superior headed off his predictable question as she rose. It would be a very different Harry Potter that headed off to Hogwarts in 5 years time.

*** Really cute drabble!

Makes me think, considering that in canon blood wards doesnt exist. And the explanation of Dumbledore about the whole thing is that the love of Lilly created protection for him while he remained in his home with his familly... Wouldnt that give Harry protection in any posible place he went while he considered it "home" and the people there his "family"?

I mean, we talk about fucking magic! It cant be something so rigid as "Blood-related family or no love proteccion for you, kiddo"!

Its have been a while since I read the novels, but did the wards were adressed as useful in canon at least one?

****** We can't know for sure if the protection was "activated" during Harry childhood. But what we know is that, while Harry did meet some witches and wizards during his childhood, none of them was a threat and most just wanted to see him or thanks him.

But, in PS, it's thanks to this protection that Quirrell could not stand Harry's touch, which saved his life during their confrontation. And these events lead played a major role in Voldemort decision to use Harry's blood for his resurrection, which lead to the whole "connection" and gave Harry a slim chance to survive the Scarcruxe destruction.

So Death Eater attack or not, the wards where definitively usefull in canon.

******** Technically yes, but Dumbledore didn't know that. All he does know is that somehow, Voldemort got the secret from Sirius, whom he has known for a long time.

So from his perspective, it was one of three things:

1. Voldemort found a way to break the enchantment on the secret keeper and forcefully extracted the secret

2. Voldemort knows a spell to make people loyal to him beyond the criteria the Fidelius deems "freely".

3. Voldemort is capable of converting a person like Sirius, and can train a person like Sirius to lie effortlessly and decieve his best friends.

Either way, the charm is unsafe. Not to mention, if Harry were to grow up under one, he would be exposed to its magic for 11 years, and could not leave this house for the same time, except for under heavy guard.

If the Durselys weren't such despicable wastes of existence, Harry would have grown up a normal teenager. Dumbledore doesn't believe that Family can truly hate eachother, /and/ he was born in the 19th century. The way he understands raising a child conflicts severely with what we consider it to be today.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

** I'm curious if Harry Potter would want to go to the wizarding world if his home life was better even if it's in a orphanage. Was him going tied to not wanting to be with the Dursleys or wanting to know about magic? What if during his first trip to the bank he states I want all my money turned into muggle currency and just goes back to his foster family or the orphanage? Basically helping fund the orphanage now. How much would this effect the wizarding world? I'd figure they'll try to find out why.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.
