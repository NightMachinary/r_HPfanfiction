What are some of the "best practices" for summaries? There's a saying that when you write a blog post, you should spend half your time on the post and half your time crafting the title, the picture, and the intro text that readers see before they click on the actual post. I think the same thing applies to fanfic.

We've all seen a few summaries that read something like "Harry runs into his relatives unexpectedly. Sorry lol I'm bad at summaries. Don't own."

People need to be able to find fics they're looking for. If someone goes on ff.net and searches for Dursley-related fics, a fic with a summary like "Harry has an unexpected encounter with his relatives" might slip through.

This is one of the main problems with using a story quote or something very simple and understated as a hook is that you might miss out on all of the relevant keywords. But then again, you also want to leave the reader interested. And I think that a fic with a lot of "tags" like Harry has an unexpected encounter with his relatives. Post DH. Canon pairings. Mentions of past abuse" can kind of clog up the summary and make it less intriguing.

What do you think makes for an eye-catching but effective summary? What are the best practices here?


** I'm of the opinion that 99% of readers have quite specific preferences and are just looking for a base match with those preferences i.e. it meets their minimum requirements. They're desperate for fanfic to read, so they're going to open your fic if they believe it is within that basic requirement.

All the summary has to do, therefore, is concisely communicate the information readers require to determine if it falls within the category of fics they /might/ like. Whether they actually like it will be determined by the first chapter. It's not like original fiction where you have the capture the reader's interest. The reader is /already interested/ and salivating for more fanfic--but only fanfic within their (probably narrow) preferences.

Because of this, I think the best summaries are those which talk directly at the reader and bluntly say what the story includes. Beating around the bush, being poetic etc, is just obstructing the reader's desire to determine with minimal effort if your fic is within their favoured class.

** Here's an example of a summary I really liked and immediately bookmarked for reading:

#+begin_quote
  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir.
#+end_quote

(One Hundred and Sixty Nine by Mrs J's Soup)

It tells me when it takes place (and we can assume it starts after graduation with what's given), we know who it centers around, we can guess that she'll be contacting Sirius, no pairings are listed, and you're made curious about the whole murder thing. And you start reading the story with a bunch of questions triggered by the summary.

To me a good summary will have enough information to orient you in the appropriate part of canon if necessary, tell you at the very least who is involved, and have just enough details to make you curious and want to read the first chapter. Then the first chapter is make or break. If I'm not reeled in or made more curious, there's a chance I'll drop it.

** I agree with Taure about 50% of the time. That is, about half the time I decide to go looking for a new story, I have a specific idea of what I'm looking for. Generally I find the preset "tags" to be enough for me - my tastes aren't /incredibly/ specific. So, I can set filters to characters Harry and Katie Bell, 60K+ words, genre: Romance, and then read summaries from there. So, for those stories, that kind of Lego-block tagging in the summary can actually be helpful.

The other half of the time, I find that kind of mechanical "tagging" of summaries ("post-OotP AU, smart!Harry, political!Harry, cannibal!Harry, Luna bashing/eating") to be offputting. I'm not ordering a meal; I'm looking for a /story./

So, mostly when it comes to summaries, I'm looking for a mind at work. I'm looking for a way of phrasing things, a confidence, a /voice/ that tells me I'm in good hands if I click on it. It doesn't have to be flowery or poetic or clever, it just needs to have that spark.

Writing a good hook in just a few sentences is /hard/. Hell, I've gone through three versions in my own fic, and I'm still not satisfied with mine. That's why the ones that have a good one just really stand out.

** I really wish ffn would have a setting that allowed me to filter slash. I just dont enjoy it and if fics were classified as slash, het, and no pairing from the start it would make it a lot easier for readers to filter through what they want to read.

**** Okay, what's so important about knowing whether a story contains slash or not? TV-shows and cartoon don't have warnings 'the main character and the girl will enter into a hetero relationship'. Every single show on television is assumed to have non-slash romance, or no romance at all, unless you get towards very specific kind of shows.

I'm sorry, but it's a pet peeve of mine. Finally there's a medium where a decent number of stories contain same-sex pairings, and it has become convention to make it possible for most readers to filter those stories out and continue living in a mostly non-slash exclusive media landscape.

***** I don't have a problem with slash, but I don't want to read Harry Draco pairing or same with snape. But there are good fics with those characters and the only way at present is to exclude them from a search

*** It exists in fanfics, and I'd rather know up front if the writer is planning on including it.

The really funny thing is that the mpreg stuff usually /isn't/ gross, as it is categorically unlike real pregnancies.

** IMO it can be summed up in 2 words: brutal honesty.

If a fic has bashing, label it as such. Multiple pairings? List each one. Is it an AU? Don't go into detail, but make sure you let the reader know it's AU. I'm no tumblrina, but fics labeling noncon/sexual-assault in big bold letters are great, b/c I'd rather not waste my time on a fic with objectionable (to me) content.
