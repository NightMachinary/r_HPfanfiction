I'm not thinking of any specific one, but have wondered about this in the past, and even considered writing one. I'd like to discover what is out there first, but haven't come across anything on my own.


** Growing Up Black by Elvendork Nigellus is excellent. Very long and very good.

** I have an AU called Lords of Magic, the AU element being that wizards discovered how to make themselves eternally youthful around the year 1000. Thus a large number of Potters exist. The fic begins with Harry's great-grandfather collecting him from the Dursleys.
