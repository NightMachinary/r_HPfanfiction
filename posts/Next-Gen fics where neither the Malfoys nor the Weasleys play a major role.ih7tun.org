Basically next-gen fics without canon pairings as background, or at least without Weasley family dinners (and the horde of children which usually accompany such scenes).

Malfoys may appear as antagonists, but after CC I will never touch a fic where Scorpius or AS are good and/or prominent characters.


** A next gen fic without any of the known next gen characters? That's a bit of a tall order. Alexandra Quick qualifies, but I think you're looking mostly for Hogwarts.

The only one I can think of is linkffn(Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake), which is all OCs. It's set about halfway between DH and the epilogue, iirc. It's quite good in some ways, but personally I find the characters annoying a lot of the time.

*** Teddy would be fine, I guess Victorie as well since Fleur is an established character on her own and not just a name tag like Angelina or a complete strangers like Percy's wife (and we don't see Bill at the Burrow too often, nevermind how Fleur was treated there).

** Hogwarts House Divided is good. It's main character is Teddy so you do have Harry as part of it but not the focus
