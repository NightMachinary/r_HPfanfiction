** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12324284/1/][A Dramatic Reading]], linkffn(12324284), is a brilliant and hilarious implementation of the 'read the Books' trope by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/5339762/][White Squirrel]]. Its sequel, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12473842/1/][A Sensational Story]], linkffn(12473842), is written by a different author, but still very good.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425), originated from an idea on this very sub: what would happen if Harry had red hairs.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998), is a new Harry to the 70s time travel. Unlike in "Delenda Est", this Harry began kicking asses immediately. Writing is really really good.

I concur that "Divided and Entwined" is an excellent story, especially in politics and battle scenes.

#+begin_quote
  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

**** It's fairly decent, but it's also finished, which is major points for it. Personally, I would have wished that Harry munchkined a bit when he figured out that he went back in time - i.e. killed himself to reset and try again, or at least figure out the rules of his time travel a bit better. It just kind of goes "Oh? I know how to defeat Voldemort now? Let me off him as fast as humanly possible rather than exploit this ability to defy time for a bit first." The ending feels like the author just kind of wanted it done and simply checked off all the last items on his list as fast as possible.

I'm not saying that you shouldn't read it, I'm just saying that it ends a little weakly.

***** The whole sequence from when Harry reaches the ministry to the end feels super rushed. I would've liked another death or two.

That said the Great Hall scene to the end (the last few chapters, I'm being vague to avoid spoilers) is actually a good way to wrap things up.

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!

  Not a lot of things could affect Harry's mundane life in the house of his abusive relatives. But then, you don't need extraordinary things to obtain extraordinary results.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
