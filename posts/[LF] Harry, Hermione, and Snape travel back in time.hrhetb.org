:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey all, I'm looking for a time travel fic that involves Harry, Hermione, and Snape all go back into their younger bodies? In the beginning they meet Death's granddaughter (this might have been a disc world crossover??) and she tells them that Harry has died prematurely X amount of times and this time can go back with his memories. Also Harry and Hermione we're soulmates and Hermione wasn't actually a muggleborn? Snape gets sent back too and his soulmate ends up being Sirius' squib sister who died in the original timeline? That's all I remember. Please help find this? I feel like it's pretty popular but I just can't for the life of me find it.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

*** And Hermione is a Muggleborn, her family just knew about magic from the moment of her first accidental magic (because they befriended group of wizards and witches), and she is also honest-to-God true noblewoman (like the friends of their family Finch-Fletchelys are).
