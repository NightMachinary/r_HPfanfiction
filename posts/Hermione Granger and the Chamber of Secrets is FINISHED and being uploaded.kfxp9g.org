Hi Everyone!

Not sure if anyone remembers me from last year, but I'm the idiot who got drunk and decided it was a BRILLIANT idea to re-write all 7 books from Hermione's perspective for my friends and family... who, in turn, convinced me to post it on the interwebs.

Last year, I posted Hermione Granger and the Philosopher's Stone on these things called Fanfiction sites. I had no idea what fanfiction was before all of this... It was an INSANE ride. I got thousands of comments, emails, tweets, dms, and straight-up snail mail (which is creepy, don't do that), all asking me when I was going to write the second book.

Well, here it is. 80k words. A chapter by chapter re-write of the whole book from Hermione's perspective. I've tried to stay as close to canon as possible. I'm sure I messed one or two things up, but no one is perfect!

As with the last one, my sister and friend are editing it for me (because I am NOT a writer by trade - I actually do a bit of graphic design, hence the "book covers"... again, this was a drunken idea that kind of spiraled into a much bigger thing) and I am posting the chapters as they are edited.

I'll probably post again when it's completely uploaded, but I hope you enjoy the first 3 chapters for now (with chapter 4+ on its way!).

** I have just read something similar about the third year and I was surprised how quite shitty her third year was ... either she was dying from overload of work, or more than half-a-year Ron and Harry didn't talk with her (whole “eating of Scabbers” was around Christmas and they were not really talking still when they run towards saving the hippogriff, and before that was the “checking Harry's new broomstick” fiasco).

**** I guess there was something completely different we were not told. For example, because she is a girl, and boys have never learnt about it?

**** Also (not probably for the third year, possibly later), I still cannot stop thinking about that hex Hermione sent against Fenrir Greyback during The Battle of Hogwarts. He was always described as well above-average large man half-beast, and yet Hermione's hex sent him flying over whole large hall. I am not sure whether I sign up for the magic-is-intent-based theory, but if yes, there had to be a lot of intent behind that hex. It seems that there had to be some relationship between all three Gryffindor girls in the Harry's year (despite the disaster of Ron-Lavender relationship). Also, when Hermione went to the Yule Ball in her fourth year, she was very well dressed up ... seems like somebody had to help her with that.

Is it possible that there was some girls-only adventure, which boys were never told about?

** So this is the canon story exactly just told from Hermione's perspective? Not a different version of the story where Hermione is the most important protagonist?

** This is so interesting! Congrats to you for having the patience to write all that out, I'm really impressed. I've got a question- it's plausible that Hermione did things that weren't in the books because Harry didn't notice it (e.g. in third year he was ignoring Hermione a lot), so are you writing anything in that wasn't specifically canon in the books, but could have happened? Could be something small, like sneaking into the restricted section in order to find the Sneak curse she uses with Marietta.

*** Absolutely! For example, in the first book, the first 4 chapters are totally made up (but sticks with known canon). It tells the story of how Hermione learned she was a witch and her first trip to Diagon Alley before meeting Harry, Ron, and everyone else.

Book 3 is going to be absolutely insane. Just writing the words "Time Turner" made me do a shot of fireball.

** I've never read fan fiction before but I've just started your Philosophers Stone version before I start this one and it's excellent.

All the little things I never thought about like the whole Gringotts money exchange

** A question, but is this fic Ron-bashing, exalted Hermione-wank?

If it isn't I'll give it a go, but I am sick and tired of bashing.

*** ...I honestly have no idea what that means...? LOL I just rewrote the book from Hermione's perspective, Chapter for Chapter. Like everything that happens in CoS happens in this book, but Hermione is the main character, not Ron.
