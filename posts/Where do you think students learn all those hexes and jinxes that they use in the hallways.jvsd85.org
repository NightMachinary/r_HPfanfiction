From the way Hogwarts is portrayed it doesn't seem like it would have a curriculum oriented towards teaching many hexes, jinxes and curses. Some would make sense to be taught in DADA such as the knockback jinx or the tickling curse because they can be used for defensive purposes. However others such the teeth-increasing one, the furunculus or Ron's slug spitting one seem to be meant only for harming others and I don't think they would be taught in any class.


** I can't think of the name of the fic right now but in one Sirius criticizes Harry for his grades saying if he only uses the hogwarts library for the specific assignment he is missing out. Hogwarts only gives you the bare bones it's up to you to use the library and really learn magic. Eg. Hogwarts teaches you how a specific type of magic works. It then is up to you to learn all the ways that type of magic can be used.

** Maybe that's why Hogwarts is a boarding school instead of a school where you get to go home after classes. The students are supposed to learn from each other. Those that rely on just what the teachers teach are not getting the full learning experience.

In the first book, Harry encountered a book called /Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the *Latest* Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more)./ That book was not in the curriculum and Hagrid dissuaded Harry from buying it. But anybody else could have grabbed a copy.

I would like to imagine that there are people who devote their lives to creating new spells and publishing them in books like these, which get read by various witches and wizards, who teach them to their relatives who are still students at Hogwarts. And since the students are trapped in the school together for most of the year, they can't help but learn stuff from their peers.

** probably the same way that students used to get various toys and games when they only had classes in how to make boxes and do joints. Older students teaching them, reading books/a student's section of the prophet, etc.

** Did we forget the book of curses from first year? Also it's a school, only one kid needs to know how to do it for that kid to teach others. Don't you remember in school finding out you could do a trick or flip and instantly wanting to tell your friends and show them how to do it?

** I'd like to know where Snape learned all his jinxes and curses. He knew many more than the average student when he arrived at Hogwarts. He lived in a Muggle neighborhood and had a Muggle father, so those are unlikely avenues. Possible but unlikely that he had other magical friends, the way he reacted to meeting Lily.

His mother may have taught him, but I'm not sure if a woman who married a Muggle would do that. He may have had magical relatives, but then again, the magical side may have disowned him for being a half-blood. The most likely source to me is books. His mother may have squirreled away some books that Snape found. We know for sure that he used secondhand books at school. He knew how to create his own spells, but he needed a starting point.

*** I know I recommend this fic a lot so please don't hate me for overdoing it but there is the fic "A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles" and it had a really interesting idea of his muggle great-great uncle on his dad's side who was a sailor and was really fascinated by the occult. So from his travels he brought a lot of artefacts, some actually magical and some less. Among them, there was a book of curses. He then practices them together with his mom who does an astrological review for him and is worried that the stars show he'll be in Slytherin even though he is not pureblood.

** Well, Hermione is described as knowing the most jinxes and hexes out of all of the DA (including the seventh years and Harry), so they probably just learned it from reading books.
