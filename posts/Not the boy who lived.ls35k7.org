Are there any fics where Harry isn't the bwl, and it's either Neville or a twin sibling. And I'm not looking ones where everyone thinks its not him and it actually is. But ones where either everyone thinks it's Harry, and it isn't, or everyone knows it isn't Harry, and they're right


** Linkffn(Too Young to Die) warning: one of the best dark and definitely evil!Harry I've ever read. If you are looking for a Harry enjoying his life with his friends while someone else takes the fall then keep looking, he doesn't get tangled with what happens in cannon, but he is definitely /not/ chill. PS.: I know this bothers a lot of people, but there is a explanation for the neglect at the end.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** TheSanti's Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/]]

Arguably the best in its genre, but fair warning it is abandoned.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
