There are rumors about something that can kill ghosts in the school and maybe it is even liked with the chamber.

I mean ghosts can go through walls, roofs, and floors. Why wouldn't they search for the chamber, but when they find it, they are turned to stone like Nick down there


** I actually have a theory that the chamber is unplottable, in the sense that space is folded up in such a way that it's not really there unless you enter it through the entrance. We already know that TARDIS-like spaces exist, so it's not a stretch to think that the chamber could be actually really small and really well hidden from the outside, but is big and cavernous if you go in down the pipe.

Somewhat unrelated to the original prompt, I actually wrote (but never posted) something off of this idea, where the endless amount of unused classrooms in the castle were at first added in by other students and staff over time. As the castle's magic grew used to getting spaces added, it started adding them on its own to be helpful. Now there's an entire labyrinth of strange, randomly generated hallways and rooms filled with a mishmash of furniture and "art" that are outside of the normal areas that students go; it's a place where students can get lost forever, spiraling deeper and deeper into spaces that don't really exist... (Or so Fred and George claim.)

** Seems likely that it is both possible to enchant walls to not allow ghosts to pass, and that Salazar did it.
