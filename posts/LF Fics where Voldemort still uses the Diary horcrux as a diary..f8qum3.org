I hate it when Voldemort just forgets about his diary after creating it. It is a sentient entity with equal rights to the personhood of Lord Voldemort as the snake-faced monstrosity. I don't know if the other horcruxes carry the personality of Lord Voldemort or if they just possess enough wit to defend itself.


** Voldemort likely doesnt give a single care to things like rights of an individual and sees the diary as a tool and means of furthering himself.

*** Still, the diary is also Voldemort in a manner of speaking.

**** Nah, the diary is "tough luck you bastard, seems like you're stuck in this diary not me. Have fun for eternity being my soul anchor".

Remember, Horcruxes are the darkest of the dark, requiring cold-blooded murder without a single shred of empathy or justification. Regret is the only way to voluntarily destroy one, too.

And Tom continued making them, one after another.

This is Voldemort we're talking about. He isn't a misunderstood little boy, or a tragic villain, he is pure evil.

** I always wondered if the diary was really his first Horcrux or if it was, if it was really created with Myrtles murder. The diary knows things that happened after her death after all (Tom framing Hagrid for example). If he still used it as a diary or maybe put some memories into it (like a pensieve) after it became a Horcrux, it would explain this knowledge...
