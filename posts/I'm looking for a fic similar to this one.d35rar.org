I really like how linkffn(I See The Moon by hctiB-notsoB) is written and the concept and everything, and I'd like to read something with a similar Harry? Or Luna I suppose. If it's Luna/Harry then it's just perfect :p


** There aren't any fics like that, from what I know. There are some that are fairly similar.

The one I would recommend is: Accidental Hero (aka The Absentminded Revenclaw) linkffn(4669348)

Which is more of a collection of one-shots, rather than a story. But has fairly similar themes, just humour not drama.

  ABANDONED. Freaky connections aside, does anyone else think it strange that Harry survived a Killing Curse with little more damage than a scar? Well, what if he hadn't come through so unscathed? And what if the other damage was more mental than physical?
