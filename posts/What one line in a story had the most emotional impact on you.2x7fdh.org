That whole one-shot is emotionally manipulative as hell, but just because you recognize what's going on doesn't make it any less effective.

** I was about to write the same as you, OP. That one line of the Firebird Trilogy came down on me like a sledgehammer.

  "Rather later, she would attempt to pinpoint an exact moment when it happened, and she never had much luck with that - maybe it was months earlier, when he appeared on her front porch in his stupid hat, or on the platform on that wretched September 1st, or maybe it was long ago, in some unrecognizable, ever-changing form, but whenever she thought about the matter in months and years to come, she knew with absolute certainty that it happened no later than this moment. Possibly Lily did not fall in love with James Potter /that night/, but, she would later conclude, there was no time after it that she did not love him."

From Chapter 36 ("Soldiers") of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times]] by Jewels5. Yes, it hasn't be updated in a year and a half. Yes, it sometimes reads like a dramatic soap opera...but if I never get to read another chapter of that story ever again, this line will have made it all worth it. This story is full of great lines, so it was definitely hard to pinpoint my favorite.

** The Hermione and Molly exchange at the end of Pers's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/3/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] is creepy.

  [T]here was nothing he could do.

  The thought made him go cold, whispering through his mind. It echoed and twisted and caressed and sliced, sinking to his core. It soothed and pried and hurt, and it triggered everything that made him who he was, and everything that he hated. It was noon, hiding in the bushes from a gang of bullies, knowing there was no such thing as safety. It was midnight, curled in a cupboard, desperately hungry and cold. It was Christmas morning, watching a world of bright glitter and colour from the outside; and it was Quirrell last year, shrieking as he burned. It was the knowledge that, in the end, there are no heroes, and there are no saviours, and magic doesn't mean miracles, and maybe never did. It was desperation and despair and knowledge, and his grief turned into something colder, his rage to something brighter, something harsher, and in that arctic fire came a familiar resolve.
