:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a pretty popular fic and I've read it several times, I just cant for the life of me remember the name or find it again.

Susan Bones runs out of the Great Hall and calls her aunt Amelia to come. Harry collapses and the horcrux comes out of his head and collides with Quirrell. I think the next chapter is a few days earlier where Harry finds out about his heritage and meets with the Longbottoms, Bones' and Greengrasses.

Thanks in advance!

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

*** Is this fic one of /”those”/?

You know, the independent many titled totally way too smart to be a believable 11 year old?

**** Yea, it is. It was recced to me because i asked for fics where Harry's childhood and how he was treated by the Dursleys came to light at the start of first year. Preferably in a public setting. While the fic totally fits that request, I could not take it anmore after like 4 chapters. I think the author forgot that he is not writing a time-travel fic where a 30 year old Harry is inside his 11 ear old self. Because he sure acts like he is 30.

But I have a few guilty pleasure fics that are like this too. Probably even more so :D
