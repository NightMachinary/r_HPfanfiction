It would be interesting to see an attempt to blend the way magic is viewed and performed in both universes, though im not sure if it can be done well. Unfortunately I have yet to find any, as the Earthsea books aren't very popular in the world of fanfiction.


** So I think its very unlikely you'll find any... I asked here a few weeks ago, and also looked ffn... IIRC there were literally 0 crossovers, with like 5 fics in general for Earthsea.
