Any length, any ship. Preferably good. In all my time reading hpfanfiction, I can only think of three off the top of my head, and only one of which I can remember the title of (Daphne Greengrass, Side Character). Was I looking for these kinds of fics before? No. Hence, this post.

Thanks in advance!

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH. Not your usual Daphne.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

** Probably my favorite next gen fic. Lessons Learned by loveadubdub is just bloody brilliant. Main POV is Rose Weasley.

Don't know why, but the author deleted his/her page from fnn. Took me some time, but I found the working link. If you are on mobile scroll down a bit, you'll see a download option. Enjoy!

**** The fic is in english, it's just a website is in russian. But you can translate the page if you are using google chrome browser.

Anyway, you just scroll down and press on download link.
