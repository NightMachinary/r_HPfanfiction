** Yes, without a bloody doubt.

The greatest example of this for me would be Unspeakable Things by Darth Marrs. Its a fun fic with a unique premise and decent character development all round which in the final chapter, throws out an entire fic worth of character development for one of the characters just to make a not at all funny penis size joke. It comes right out of left field, isn't funny and to this day that fic remains possibly the only one that I remember for how much it genuinely pissed me off.

A bad ending can ruin anything though. Just look at How I Met Your Mother.

*** There's another fic, I can't remember what it was called with a bad ending that completely ruined the story for me.

It was a WBWL fic, with James, Lily and the brother being extremely hateable. Harry went through trials and stuff to destroy Voldemort's horcruxes, with an interesting theme of 'one being ends up sacrificed per horcrux destroyed'. The brother is not just useless, but inadvertently actively sabotaging the horcrux hunt when he gives the Locket to Hermione so that she would start seeing him instead of Harry (as she is his only friend due to everyone being poisoned against him by his family).

So after a somewhat decent adventure of finding and destroying the horcruxes, becoming a basilisk animagus in a non-shit and non-useless manner, Voldemort is destroyed, and everyone realises that Harry was the true BWL all along and that he just fixed all their shit.

And then the shit ending happens that completely ruins the fic.

It starts by explaining away Harry's neglect by his family as the horcrux in his scar causing them to view him negatively. Okay, so you just gave an excuse for parents to be utter shits to their child. It would still have been semi-decent if that was where it ended. But no, in the final scene, Harry's brother (and for the life of me I can't remember what he's called - nor do I care) straight up fucking /murders/ him out of jealousy. Then there's a scene where Harry gets to go back and redo it all but with only half his memories or some such shit, obviously setting up for a nonexistent sequel.

The entire fic was ruined for me b y that ending. A character designed to be as repulsive, disgusting and hateable as possible, who you want to see get his just desserts at the end, fucking /wins/. We don't see any repercussions for him. We don't see any punishment, absolutely nothing against him for his disgusting and sometimes date-rapey actions. Harry gets to start all over again for the most bullshit reason possible. That fic went from 'fairly decent and enjoyable, something I'll reread at some point' straight to my shitlist of 'never touching that stupid fucking fic again'.

**** What's even worse is that the author is completely unrepentant about the terrible ending they wrote. Basically they try to wiggle any criticism of the ending into "well that's what I was trying to go for." No, you wrote a decent story and then gave your readers an abomination of an ending. What's worse was that it was intentionally crafted for a sequel story that just had a ridiculous plot. The fact that the convoluted sequel was abandoned came as no surprise.

I'm okay with a bad ending, if an author looks back on it by going, "yeah I screwed up." While I will wish a story had ended better, that at least leaves me with less of a bad taste in my mouth. It's when authors are completely unrepentant about the terrible ending to their story that readers revolt against (a great real life example is /How I Met Your Mother/) that I feel a good story is well, and truly ruined.

A bad guys win fic could be done well. A lot of real fiction is based on this (Brave New World, 1984, and the Great Gatsby come to mind).

That said, the author is usually trying ti make some philosphical point or has been hintinf towards it thr whole time. Out of the blue endings never (edit: rarely) work.

*** Indeed, look at original works like "Lost" (shame on you J.J. Abrams, people should have realized that you are an overrated director back then!) and "Battlestar Galactica" (the new version...damned: "God is real, god did it!" is such a shitty cop-out that I want to scream and whack those directors with something...how they could think that this was a satisfactory or even decent (or dare I say it: Good!) a ending is really beyond me and it's not because I am an Atheist, I know believers who agree with me!)...or if you are into games: Mass Effect 3 (damned, that game is weakest part of the trillogy, no bombastic ending (or endings, after all the games made player choices important - but ME3 shits all over that!), too on rails (this is supposed to be an RPG, but they don't let you deviate from the core mission-schedule (no, you can decide to do additional missions, but that's it!), unlike say Dragon Age: Origins where you could decide who to recruit first (yes doing it a certain way made more sense, but over all? You could do it your way and it didn't hurt the story at all!)...no ME3 is so on rails that you don't have any freedom at all!) etc.)...hell, it happens in books, too like say in the "Hunger Games" books (damned, the tough girl who needs no man ends up with the boring asshole and becomes a fucking housewife...same for the "Black Magicians" books by Trudi Canavan (if I remember this right), where Sonea the badass girl ends up pregnant and under town-arrest (she can't leave the city!) oh and her lover the badass mage-leader dies, well just because...I noticed that this seems a pattern with female writers (maybe girls like this kind of thing, but I am not a girl, so I wouldn't know!) and it fucking pisses me off how they can screw over their female heroes like that (it's like they brainwash them to fit some kind of stupid and boring narrative!)

So my answer would be: Yes, of course it does! I'd rather have WIP-Story (or a story that someone else finishes!) than a weak contrived and cobbled together ending that either makes no sense or is otherwise dissapointing (for example: Changing the main character (Harry) into a researcher and in the end he still becomes an auror (instead of sticking to the passion the writer gave him!) flunky for the ministry and marries Ginny (instead of going after another girl and/or not marrying at all!))

** Absolutely. A bad ending can totally ruin an otherwise good story. That's not just the case with fanfics, but even with published stories. It's happened lots of times with me; I've read a story that I've really enjoyed and then I get to the ending and it all falls apart, and afterwards I can't enjoy the story anymore.

If it's a multi-part series, say a trilogy, and it's only the last book in the series that has a bad ending, then I might still love the first two books and just hate the third one.

** Yes, even with Original Fiction. I'll use my favourite series of books as an example, The Magicians.

The main character grows from the first book, he matures, and he becomes a much better Magic-User for it, we start really getting into the meat and potatoes of Magic with interesting spells and revelations I didn't see coming. Then, suddenly, it all goes to shit in Book 3. From the rushed ending to the completely regressive nature of the main character who was a thirty year old at that point. Then Magic lost the 'turtles all the way down' feel in favour of cheap plot devices. It's the perfect example of never shooting a Chekov's Gun too late.

Fanfiction does this quite a bit as well, but it's not something I really don't expect. Forging The Sword was obviously going nowhere, even before the hiatus, the author wrote and wrote and kept trying to go down the rabbit hole, and when he looked around himself by chapter 12, he realised that he had nowhere to move, he had written himself into an odd hole that wouldn't have lasted more than one more chapter or two.

I definitely remember Unsung Hero when I read it, and that left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. Simply because it left a lot of inconsistency and contradiction in its wake. If we ever got the inkling that such an ending was possible, we would not have been as surprised or revolted as we were, but, nope, completely unrealistic moves turned into a shit fest.

Then there was Prisoner's Cipher with the same trope of "Harry reaches his goal but the ending is ambiguous to whether he lives or dies". Otherwise, it was an insanely good fic that could have had a much greater premise and maybe even potential for a sequel.

** Does Wind Sheer really have a bad ending? Bad in comparison to what? If you compare it to the rest of the fic, then it's par for the course. You know how sometimes a story starts off good, and then goes down hill? Like, you can say that about Delende Est, as there are some definitive points where that happens. Wind Sheer just started at the bottom of that hill and made no attempt to climb it. It's a bad fic that has a bad ending, and it doesn't surprise me.

** Yes!

I read /the Pureblood Princess/ (linkffn(The Pureblood Princess)) and loved it. The character seemed realistic and the cast in character. I loved the take on magic lessons, and the relationship was compelling. It felt like real teenagers with real emotions. There was sex, but it wasn't the focus of the fic. There was plot, too, although it wasn't huge. I couldn't stop reading! I finished the whole thing in under a week.

The ending broke all that. It made no sense... It demonized at least one character badly... It made Harry act out of character... And it completely changed the genre of the story with the barest of explanations. The whole thing made the story go from one of my absolute favorites to a bad memory. :(

EDIT: (Attempted to) put in a link for the story.

There's no way I can discount a story with 90%+ of amazing content because of some plot decision I didn't agree with towards the end.

I can both recognize that the ending was shite and that the rest of a story was really amazing and still have appreciation for the 90% I loved.

Hmm, how would ruining something automatically equate to hating it? Listen, I'll be honest, I think Rowling is an incredibly terrible writer when it comes to making characters, and all of her plot points feel contrived and generally forced down your throat. It's not Harry that gets himself into anything, it's the other way around, trouble finds him. It all felt inconsequential, there was no worry, there was no real danger. But the world she built was interesting and it made an interesting point on the Magic Genre, it wasn't unique, it wasn't even the first of its time, but it was something that meshed a lot of tropes together into one world and made it all work. For that, I give it credit. But I will never allow a good world to put a wall over my eyes for bad characters.

Maybe I have a different definition of "ruined," but to me, a bad ending ruining an otherwise good story means you don't like the story as a whole because the ending was bad.

In a similar way, if somebody thought a story was ruined because an author uses single quotes for dialogue (As in common in some place) instead of double quotes, that would mean they dislike a story because the author used single quotes.

My position is that the ending of HP was bad, but I liked the story as a whole. So yes, I agree that you can acknowledge the good and bad aspects of a fic and still either like or dislike it. To the OP's prompt, the ending of a story is one aspect that can be done poorly and not automatically make me dislike a piece.

These are the exception to the rule, not the norm. Obviously a well technically written piece will likely sell better than one that isn't well written, but there are diminishing returns once you get to the point that no average 10 year old will be able to recognize that George Orwell used fewer adverbs than JK Rowling.

I have to assume you are being intentionally dense, but I'll spell it out for you.

You know how I said "Familiar situations, fictional and fantastic world." The familiar situation would be overcoming adversity and learning to better yourself. The fictional and fantastic part is putting those situations into a different context.

That is the most general way of saying someone can relate to something. Once again, you could easily force the parallels on your own and say they exist. Adversity is extremely subjective to the person.

Why not? According to your definition of what makes a book a best-seller, it's relation to the reader, what's more relatable than loving someone and them not reciprocating/you not being capable of being together due to constraints. According to you, that's what makes a good story.

Once more, relation doesn't make good characters. If you're a vain person and you try to find similarities in other vain people does that automatically make the character good? I don't understand the rationale.

If you want me to get more specific:

Draco - Class Bully

Crabbe/Goyle - Bully's lackies

Binns - Boring teacher

Snape - Mean teacher

The list can go on and on. These are exaggerations of familiar people in people's lives. That's one of the most attractive parts about fiction. A fictional story can exaggerate familiar situations so that the emotional impact is enhanced. Obviously the more outrageous the scenario the more generic the familiar association, but it's always there.

Relatability was one example of character creation that Rowling did well, and in fact I think it was one of the things she did best. I can list a couple other things.

Another area of character writing that Rowling did well was giving each character their own voice. Another aspect is that the main protagonists were multidimensional with positive and negative personality traits that are, for the most part, believable within the context of her fictional world.

These are just 3 things I think Rowling did well. I don't like the direction she went with some of her characters as the plot developed, but that doesn't mean it was done poorly.

Certainly she isn't perfect. The villains in the series tend to be pretty one dimensional without many (if any) redeeming qualities until very late into the series.

I just don't think "incredibly terrible" is an accurate description of her character creation.

A let down every once and then is healthy. Puts it into perspective how good something is that it can so easily be made to displease. You have to learn to reconcile the bad with the good just like any relationship. While I certainly blame JK Rowling for her shitty (IMO) decisions for DH (and to some extent HBP), it makes me love the rest of the series so much more for what she accomplished.

The bad taste in your mouth just allows you to contrast it with how refreshing and beautiful the first sip was.

** Kinda, yeah. A lot depends on how good the story was before that and how much good there is compared to how much bad. If it's a mediocre story overall with a terrible ending, that's bad. If it's amazing before that then I'll just remember the good parts.

And, too, people may disagree on what makes an ending horrible. For instance, there was a story (the author took it down) called "Hit the Ground Running" that had a very abrupt ending where Dumbledore killed Harry when he found out the horcrux in his head had awoken and was influencing him. A LOT of people hated the ending but I thought it was really appropriate and made sense considering everything else that had gone on in the story.

** It depends, for me. While it isn't FanFiction, what abruptly comes to mind is Stephen King's "Under the Dome." Unique premise, an awful, horrible, non-sensical ending. However, it remains my third favorite book of his (behind "The Stand" and "It") mainly because of the story itself and its characters. The developmental process he put each one through was immersive and by the end, I actually didn't want the story to end.

So, if an author can make the reader really care about his/her characterizations (as many characters are not their own creations but usage of the ones JK Rowling cooked up, save for OC's), then a bad ending could put a damper on the story itself, while not having an overall impact on how one views the story from the beginning to the end. Of course, though, everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion.

** In general yes, but I'd like to qualify that statement a bit:

It can be tolerated if the bad ending doesn't undermine/expose the rest of the story. Usually though the bad ending shows that what we considered to be good before wasn't really good and just accidental or - worse - just grandstanding without any planned outcome/resolution. These are the worst of the bad endings, when the reader just goes "Oh... guess all of that stuff that I thought was there was just in my own head".

** For me, it's all about climax/resolution of the story. If the story had a few climaxes then the final bad climax doesn't ruin the whole story. For example, I don't really like the last two books and especially the epilogue of Harry Potter series. But because other books were good and had their own relative endings that I enjoyed, I can't say it ruined the all 7 books. It makes me feel somewhat disappointed but when I'm reminiscing the story, I still remember those good climaxes.

But if the fic had one single climax at it's end and it was bad, then yes. Even if the writing was good, even if first few chaapters, descent, conflict and/or road to climax was good, if the climax was bad, it ruins the story for me.

 

For example, Mass Effect series had many many different sub stories with their own endings in it and even though ending of Mass Effect 3 was really bad, I still can't say it ruined the whole trilogy. It didn't even ruined the third game because there were many sub stories like genophage, quarian/geth conflict etc and they had their own endings. I still say Mass Effect 3 was good.
