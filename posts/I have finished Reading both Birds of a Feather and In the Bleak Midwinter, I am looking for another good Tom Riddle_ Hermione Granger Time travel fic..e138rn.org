I'm looking for a time travel fic set in the 1930/1940s were Hermione Either grows up with Tom Riddle or time travel back To stop him from becoming the dark Lord. Slash is fine it just needs to be well written with some decent world building like in birds of a feather.


** I dont have one, but I just wanted to chime in about Birds of a Feather. Its /fantastic/.

The premise sounds awful and not anything like what I'd usually be interested in, but it's written at a quality level I can only describe as "professional writer."

Seriously, if you care at all about reading wonderfully constructed prose, give it a shot.
