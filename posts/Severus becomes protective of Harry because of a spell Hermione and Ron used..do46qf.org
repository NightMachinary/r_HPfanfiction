It starts in the second year. Ron and Hermione find a spell that they use on Harry were he becomes protective and fatherly to Harry. I just remember Snape using the F-bomb on Lockhart after he vanished Harry's bones.

  Harry unexpectedly finds himself being tutored by Professor Snape. And as if that wasn't weird enough, Snape's actually nice to him. On the other side, Snape cannot fathom why he'd suddenly feel so protective of Harry bloody Potter! What is the reason behind this development and will it last? They'll find out one thing: love truly is a charm.
