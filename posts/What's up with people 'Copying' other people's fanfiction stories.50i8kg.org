So I see this guy whenever I am browsing through and every single one of his story has been copied word for word. I don't see him getting banned and it has been months? What's wrong with the site?

This is in regards to hpfanfic that's why I am asking here. Naming no one because everyone knows who it is on fanfiction.net.

Fanfiction writers spend hours writing and they don't even get paid. All they receive is feedback and gratification. To take that away is despicable.

*** If you're browsing FFN by update rate, if the same author has multiple stories that updated in a row, as if they were all posted at the same time, could be a plagiarist. Check the titles and summaries through the power of Google to see if it is an older story being copied. And you can check the reviews, they generally have at least one person calling them out, or wondering if it is the original author putting it on a new account.

It is easy to confuse this with an author moving from one site to another. Several authors moved from HPFF to fanfiction.net in the last couple of months as it looks like HPFF can go down any day now, and they posted all their works at once.

** There was a test case in 2013/2014 regarding plagiarism and fan fiction. The upshot of it was while yes, fan fiction can be plagiarised only the rights holder of the original/source material can seek a legal remedy. So you write a HP fic and it gets stolen only JKR can sue or issue a cease and desist notice.

On that basis there is no legal requirement for the person doing the stealing to pay any attention to outraged authors correspondence. There is also no legal obligation for the websites to act - I mean, plagiarism is almost certainly against their site policies and leaves a bad taste in their users mouths so they should react, but often don't.

Oh, and that case I mentioned. It was an /Admin/ from an HP fan fic site stealing fics, rebranding them as original and publishing them for profit. The judge noted 14 out of his 17 novels were wholly or substantially plagiarised.

**** Of note is the fact that if you add original elements (like characters) and write a disclaimer that this-or-that is not yours but those particular elements you'd added are, you actually could achieve something because you do have a claim to at least some of what got plagiarised ... well, unless the one plagiarising it somehow edits that out, but depending on how you write it that may or may not actually change the whole story completely.

But, of course, to have that option one would have to actually write a disclaimer that is more than just a joke, and that you don't see very often.

*** An IPv4 address does not map to one person, and one person does not map to one IP address. We've pretty much run out of IPs at this point, so they're shuffling between people, and we are using tricks to extend the IPv4 lifespan (carrier-grade NAT).

With IPv6, you can do better. IPv4 has four billion addresses, which is why we have this problem; IPv6 has 10^{38} . However, IPv6 has only rolled out to about 13% of the population, going by Google's statistics. If you ban people by IPv6 address, you can actually ban a household, much of the time; however, you've only got a one in eight chance that this option is open to you.

And even if we were all using IPv6, I could take my laptop to a coffee shop and connect to their wifi and get a different IP address.
