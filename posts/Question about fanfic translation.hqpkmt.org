Hey guys.

There are a few fanfics I absolutely love, some are in French and I feel like they should be read by many people. This means they should be translated. I'm all up for doing it but I'm not really sure how to do it.

I've started by translating the chapter titles and stuff here and there but it's quite time consuming. One of the fics is around 800k words.

Has anyone already translated a fic that wasn't theirs ? Can you give me any advice ? Also, if I tried contacting the original author but they haven't answered, is it safe/respectful to post it on ffnet ? Of course giving credit where credit is due [insert â€˜Obviously' Snape gif here]

Thanks !


** I think I would feel weird reading a translated version without the author's consent. Mostly because any reviews and comments should go towards the author and not to the translator.

** Translation /is/ time-consuming as heck The only thing I can recommend is posting it to deepl and see if the translation is good, and then cleaning up the result. But that'll probably not be that good of a translation.

If you want a great translation, you need to understand the pacing and intention of the author, and try to match the style. And that's pretty hard, and as I said: time-consuming.

Which is why there are not a lot of translations out there.

** There have been translations, but think it kinda fell to the wayside when ffnet implemented a translator.

** Open the fic in chrome. There will be a Google translate option on the top right corner. It will translate the whole page to English. Then you can copy paste the text and do the same for next chapters.
