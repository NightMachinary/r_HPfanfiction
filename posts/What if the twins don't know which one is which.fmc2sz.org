It had always been the same. Ever since they could remember their names had always been interchangeable. Some days, one would be Fred, other days, he'd be George and his brother would be Fred. They'd gone a whole week once, keeping the same name, but it had been boring so they never went longer.

This was the key to their mischief, people thought that if only they could find the smallest of differences, they'd be able to remember which twin was which. The truth was that it wouldn't have helped.


** That means George loses part of his identity when Fred dies. Now he is stuck as George for the rest of his life.

*** As I twin I feel absolutely compelled to say this premise, while fun and interesting for a fictional story, does not make sense for real life. The last thing I want is to be is a Debbie Downer, and I always encourage stories and especially fanfiction to be whatever they want, so for that reason, I think this premise is fine, but growing up as a twin can cause many identity issues, and it's usually because the world seems to think we are one person rather than two. What makes me love Fred and George's portrayal in the books, even with them being so similar to each other, is how other characters treat them as two distinct people. Mixing twins up because they look similar and /genuinely treating them as interchangable/ are not the same thing and twins can tell the difference.

**** People think Molly is a bad mother because she can't tell her /identical twin sons/ apart /sometimes?/ That's one I never heard before, but I absolutely believe it. For the record, I'm a twin, and /yes/, definitely, I found it annoying when my parents called me my twin's name, but my older brother was often called the dog's name by mistake, so I was kinda forced to realize it was nothing personal. I think it's really foolish to call Molly a bad mother over this. It is definitely not her fault.

**** Is a name a magical thing? It doesn't have power in HP the way it does in other universes, but it still seems like somthing enchanted onto you at birth, or with some magical connotation. The goblet of fire knew real names from fake ones, and underage names from of-age, even if it was put in by an older student.

You're not just /called/ Molly, you /are/ Molly.

***** I would think though that a person magic would have to accept that name. If Draco Malfoy was called Lucious Malfoy the second at birth but his parent never called him that and he had no idea he was named that at birth I doubt magic would accept that as his name and it would instead use Draco Malfoy as his name. In this case with the twins they have no idea what their original names were, so it's a similar concept and I doubt magic would have a defined name for them and it would either be George or Fred depending on which they were going by that day.

****** No, the map show your birth name. It's a major plot point in Goblet of Fire. Everyone calls Barty Crouch Junior that, he himself accept and think that "Junior" is part of his name, but the Marauder's Map shows his name as just Bartemius Crouch in GOF because he was just called Bartemius Crouch at birth.

If Harry had believed his name was actually Hadrian and not Harry his whole life, he would still appear as Harry on the map because his parents called him Harry, they didn't call him Hadrian. Tough luck for all the Potter-Black lordship fics "His name isn't Harry actually" that get fucked over by this very important plot point.

***** Well, it did have significance in the Goblet of Fire, which needed the name of a competitor /and/ bound them to it, even against their will.

On a related note, the concept of "contracts" in fanfiction really irks me. The Goblet is an ancient, powerful, mysterious artifact that does god knows what and works god knows how. The idea that random pieces of paper can do this same is really stupid.

****** What are we talking about, exactly? because what happened to Cho's friend's face in order of the Phoenix implies that some degree of magically enforced contracts are possible. That's not the same as the goblet of fire, though, which the events of the book of the same name convince me that it works by making people not even seriously consider breaking the contract.

******* Yes, the list in GoF was basically a cursed piece of paper. However, it wasn't a contract. Those are usually used in fanon, with a bunch of finnicky conditions and also stated to be unbreakable. The curses attached are also always extremely devastating, and embedded in the writing instead of cast by someone.

******** Eh I agree that I don't love how the trope is done, but I don't think the text is misused by magical contracts existing. The way the phrase "a binding magical contract" is used seems to me to suggest there could be others, and we certainly know other kinds of binding magical contacts exist, like the Unbreakable Vow. Doesn't seem a huge stretch to me to think that paper ones exist, especially given that Sirius' will is in some ways a binding magical contract (presumably) on paper, as Harry and Kreacher are bound in some way by it.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
