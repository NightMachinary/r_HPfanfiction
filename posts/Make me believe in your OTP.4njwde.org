I like to think that I'm pretty open minded. Even though I obviously have an OTP of my own, I'd love to see the story that finally made you go "ok, this is my OTP."

Make sure to mention the pairing in your post along with the link! :)


** I like Ron/Hermione

Not because of any fic in particular but due to the communities reaction to the canon pairing. I really liked that the flawed guy and the bossy girl were drawn to each other. I liked that Hermione was never drawn in by the fame or destiny that surrounded Harry. I liked that they had to grow up and make mistakes first and even then there is never a sense that Ron and Hermione were destined to be together. It's real.

I blame the movies for presenting Ronald as an arsehole rather than the complex character that he actually is. I resent that they made Hermione conventionally attractive (just look at her hair thought out the series). She didn't need to be pretty to be awesome, she didn't need to be the heroes reward, Ron didn't need to be 'worthy' of her.

Ron and Hermione are a reflection of who /we/ are, not who we wished to be.

*** Ron is one of my favorite characters, aside from Hermione. I find Ron-bashing boring at best. It takes a good person to surround himself with bright, brave people and bring something to the friendship. He isn't Peter Pettigrew by any measure.

** I'm a Harry/Hermione/Ron shipper mostly because to me it just works. Like, the more I think about it either the three of them get together or all three of them find love elsewhere and remain close friends.

Always and forever really sold me on this pairing and made me crave it but it's rough, like really rough. Everyone is sympathetic but also a complete asshole and that's what makes it just brilliant.

*** Are you me? Because that is the exact same story that got me interested in trio shipping too! Do you have any other favs? Many trio fics offer a window into pre-DH or HBP fics, so the contrast is interesting

**** I've actually only read a few trio-fics, the audience for this pairing is limited at best. Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4730078]])

The Wireless has nearly the exact same plot as Always and Forever except it has a happy ending, though the trade off is that it's much less expertly written.

Linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3499913]])

This fic is depressing, I've yet to finish it because it's so hard. Though to me that's what makes it so good, I've worked with people in my community who attempt suicide, I've woken up wondering if my SO has hurt themselves in the bathroom again and I've dealt with the difficulties that being polyamorous can bring to a group dynamic.

On top of all of the above the author knows the character of Harry Potter perfectly and when this author's Bellatrix finally broke harry it was beautiful and terrifying all at once. If you can stomach past the first 10ish chapters (it really gets better after that I promise) I can't recommend this fic enough.

** I really like Neville/Hannah. I don't think there was ever any one story, but the more I thought about them the more I liked them. People tend to hate Hannah because they feel she's just this random background character but if they go back and read the books, she's actually mentioned in every book and seems to have a consistent personality. She seems anxious, prone to getting nervous and breaking down especially during OWLS. She's a little naive, but loyal and brave in later years. Her mum died in HBP and she was pulled from school, only to return for 7th year where she was in the DA and fought. Maybe it's because she's a Hufflepuff, but I tend to think of her as being warm and cheerful. I just see them being well matched and being very understanding of each other.
