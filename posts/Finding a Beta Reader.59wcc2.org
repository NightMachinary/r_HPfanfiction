I've been reading HPfanfiction for quite a while, but I've just only recently started writing some. So I'm wondering how those of you that use a Beta reader have found one? I've sent messages to a few that are listed on Fan fiction.net but I haven't got any responses :/


** I posted my fanfic and then I got some volunteers to edit.

** You can visit the IRC channel/chat room and ask people there. Most of them are writers and they tend to beta each others fics.

** The fanfiction.net beta search is awesome.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/all/book/?&languageid=1&rating=4&ppage=287][Here's]] a link to those who are willing to beta fanfics sorted by how recently they've updated their profile pages (as that makes them more likely to get back to you). Make certain that the person has selected the HP fandom and that they're willing to look over your particular subgenre (romance, suspense, etc).

Good luck!

** A few people just come on here and ask for beta testers.

I'm up to beta if you need it.
