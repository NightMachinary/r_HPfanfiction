#+TITLE: [Miscellaneous] I'm sorry for being very irritable with people in the past 24 hours. I didn't have a very good day yesterday at all, and that made me be mean to people when I'm usually not mean at all. I don't like being mean, so I'm sorry.

Yes it's exactly what the title says. :( I'm sorry for being mean to some people here, and irritated with them this past day. Yesterday I had a really bad day, it was extremely stressful and emotionally challenging, and it put me into a really down in the dumps place. I'm still in it. But that doesn't excuse being irritable and mean to people. :( So I'm sorry for being like that. I don't like being like that! I don't want to be like that. I'm very really sorry, fellow writers and friends! :(

*** Oh, shush. We're a community, of which Alma is a regular user, and if more people made posts like this to apologize after behaving in an uncharacteristically mean fashion to other people in the community, then I think we would all be better off for it.

**** While I agree somewhat, I personally think it's better to take the time to apologize personally to the people you were mean to.

***** Alma could've done that too as well as making a general public apology.
