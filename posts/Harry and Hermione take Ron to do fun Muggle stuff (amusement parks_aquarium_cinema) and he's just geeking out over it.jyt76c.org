** Ronald enjoys muggle cinema quite alot

and over a decade later after retiring from his stint as an auror he joins George at the joke shop and branch's out to create wizarding cinema.

Creating a massive entertainment empire.

His personal favorite work is the adventures of roonil wazlib.

Decades later, people will look back on the life of Ronald Weasley and go holy shit that entertainment Moghul was quite badass
