:END:
I was trying to find a oneshot I remember reading. It was part of an anthology of other oneshot fics. It was the 3rd "chapter" of the three posted fics on fanfiction.net.

It involved a Harry who, after reincarnating into a new dimension, would draw a new "Power He Knows Not" from a deck of cards. In that timeline it was a doll which mimicked a corpse. Can't remember much else beyond a conversation with Dumbledore at the end of it.
