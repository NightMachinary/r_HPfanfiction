I recently read a short fanfiction where Harry accidentally traveled to the past and became the biological father of Hermione. I also read another where he became the biological father of Snape. Another where he was the father of Scorpius. And Another where he was the father of Rose.

I'm looking for stories where he is the father of a canon character, preferably someone around his age or older.

Oh, and none of that blood adoption bullshit.


** What about one where he is his own father?
