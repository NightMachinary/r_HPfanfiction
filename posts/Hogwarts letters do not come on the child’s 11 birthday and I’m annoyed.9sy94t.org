I've been seeing it a lot recently and it frustrates me to no end. Harry got his letter during the start of the summer holidays, waaay before his birthday.

It's annoying not because it disturbs the plot somehow but it's annoying because I feel like they haven't read the source material. It would be okay if it was a meaningful change. But it isn't mostly.

It's like when someone uses stuff that's out of the movies, for example changing that instead of Harry being woken up in GoF during the World Cup cause there's Death Eaters, all the kids get informed of the fact while they're celebrating.

It serves no purpose (mostly) and it always feels childish for some reason.

End of rant.


** It definitely depends on when the birthday is- and perhaps blood status. In Hermione's case, for example, her birthday is 19 September. Which means that if she got her letter on her 11th birthday, it would have been nearly a whole year before she started attending. Could you imagine expecting an 11 year old child to go to muggle school after learning that magic is real? I think it's more likely that she may have been informed early Summer - perhaps around the time that Harry would have been receiving his?

I think that this happens because Harry receiving his letter on his birthday was dramatic and memorable. People kind of gloss over the fact that he'd been receiving letters for weeks, but the Dursleys weren't letting him read them. But think about it from a logistics perspective. The letters aren't just letters of acceptance; they also act as equipment lists for things that must be bought for school; uniforms, books, wands, potions supplies, everything that they might need. Take it to the extreme youngest that a student can be in a year at Hogwarts: turning 11 on 31 August- the day before the school year starts. It'd be unreasonable to expect that such a student purchase their items the same day that they receive their letters, and leave the next day.

****** You can certainly make that your own barometer for determining what's canon but it's ridiculous to imply that's the only method or the correct one. The books also contain contradictions and plot holes that JKR obviously wouldn't have done intentionally but by your standard we have to accept the contradictions and such as canon, no if ands or buts.

****** No, "canon" has no agreed upon definition in the HP fandom. In general it is, to quote Wikipedia

#+begin_quote
  [...] the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story
#+end_quote

And depending on the person what is accepted goes beyond just the book.

For example (in no particular order):

- The biggest Harry Potter wiki accepts Pottermore as canon, and also the movies, Cursed Child, the three additional books (Quidditch through the ages, ...) and much more
- [[/u/Taure]] considers basically everything created by JKR herself (including interviews and tweets) as canon, but in a hirarchial manner, but choses to (for example) ignore the movies.
- The [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/canon/][HP Lexicon]] works pretty similar, with only small differences.

With that, three of the best sources in this fandom *all* opt for "Pottermore is canon". Sure, a lot of fans don't consider it canon - and that shows in my downvotes - but in general, I'll stand by my words that "Written by JKR" is canon by word of god.

Sure, feel free to disagree with me on specifics - but your statement is wrong.

*** It also may depend on the headmaster and when they would prefer to send letters, summer before term is best. It may also depend on the persons birthday and blood-status too. Muggle-borns were supposed to have someone bring their letter and explain the wizarding world.

*** Otherwise, any student would be screwed. The letters aren't just acceptance letters, but also equipment lists. Non muggle borns would know things like needing their uniforms, their wands, cauldron, that sort of thing. But the books may change year to year, and while there are certain assumptions to be made- Book of Spells, for example- it's shown that the book list is completely up to the given professor, as when Lockhart made his entire collection of books mandatory for all years.

**** For sure. I just meant that at least students who have parents who went to Hogwarts would at least have some guidance even if they didn't have their letter yet, whereas muggleborn students not only need that equipment list but also need time to accept that there's this whole other world that they're a part of. No decent parent would get a letter saying “hey, accept that your kid is this thing you've never believed in and send them to a boarding school literally tomorrow” and go “yeah okay, sounds reasonable.”

But yes, the birthday-letter setup would have been horribly thought out if that was the case in canon. As it stands, it's just a coincidence that Harry's letter coincided with his birth month.

** It was one week before his birthday, but yes. And some years, the letters didn't come until August because the book lists weren't finalized. In second year, it was about a week after Harry's birthday, and in fifth year, the letters didn't come until August 31 because there was no Defence Professor until Umbridge was appointed, and /everyone/ had to scramble at the last minute. It has nothing to do with birthdays.

Unfortunately, as [[/u/m777z][u/m777z]] pointed out, JKR made a couple of statements about letters coming on people's birthdays, apparently by mistake, and it stuck.

There is no such person in canon. There is no such office as Chief Attendant of Witchcraft Provisions in canon. Having her sign the equipment list first year screams 'I copied the letter off the Wiki and haven't reread canon'.

The source for that person/office/signature is the now defunct harrypotter.warnerbros.org and since the page in question is no longer available even via the wayback machine, I have no idea why it was created. So basically it's bullshit which the Wiki has decided to use as a source for reasons beyond my ken.

I had to check the thing, and WTF? This one is worse on the canon scale than Cursed Child, as Rowling did not declare Warner Bros's fanfic ideas to be canon.

They have a history of doing that. If you check the compiled history part of the page for basically anything that if referenced in some weird way by some rather non-canon thing (such as the video games), you'll find that on that one particular wiki it does not make a difference and they just throw it all into the blender. It's the one reason why people concerned about making stuff canon recommend not ever looking at it and instead using the lexicon.
