Hi Everybody!

​

I'm looking for a fics that place their emphasis on politics. I would prefer fics where if Harry is engaging in politics, it's when he's older. Preferably 6th year +. Post war political pics would be incredibly intriguing as well.

I would also like to see any fics where adults are trying to actively take on the problem without Harry even being involved as well.

Fics where Harry goes to past - alone - and using politics rather than violence while being mentally sound to fix the issue would also be great.

​

I would like to please stay away from any angst, marriage law, & graphically violent fics. I noticed some fics can get super emotionally soapy and it turns me off from the fic. If they do have romance, I'd much prefer non-cannon pairings. Preferably when the characters are also 16+.

​

Thank you very much for your help!

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
