How come if in a story Harry is immortal 9 times out of 10 it's because he's Master of Death. I rarely see immortality by way of Horcrux, philosopher's stone, vampirism, or any other method. Is it because MOD is easy to "stumble into" where the others would be more deliberate? Thoughts on this matter?


** Probably because in canon he had a real chance of becoming the master of death and while we don't actually know what comes with being MOD, it granting you immortality kind of makes sense, even though thats not rly Rowlings style. She was all about accepting death and what not, and she wrote Harry accordingly, so hes not really the character to chase immortality.

Personally i think that epilogue where Harry goes back to the forest to pick up the stone would have been way cooler than Albus Severus.

*** Are you questioning the GREATER GOOD.....? Finally after decades of scheming the perfect LIGHT UTOPIA has been achieved....! All with Albus Severus being the heir of light magic!

*** How does becoming immortal by being the MoD make any sense? The moral of that story was all about welcoming death when your time comes, which is exactly what Harry did at the end. Immortality seems to be the exact opposite of being the MoD. I don't think the title is really anything more than symbolic. Anything else feels kind of cheesy.

**** Yeah, thats how Rowling intended it, but a fanfic author could easily and plausibly make that bit AU

  and a Philosophers Stone wouldn't be easy to make.

OP Indy!Harry could steal the stone before Quirrell made an attempt to do so.

Other ways of making him get a stone include.

1. Stealing it as I stated.

2. Being friends with the Flamels - and getting special /perks/.

3. Killing the Flamels for it.

**** Still, I like the interpretation common to a lot of fics that the stone kept at Hogwarts wasn't real.

If the Flamels are ancient, there's no particular reason/benefit to them giving the perks to just another add-on who tries to appeal to them.

The last one works, but is obviously a very different type of story.

***** I like that interpretation too.

I've seen many Manipulative Dumbledore stories where the Hogwarts Stone was actually a fake, and that the Flamels went into hiding once the "fake" was either destroyed or taken by Dumbledore.

***** Many of those though have the whole stone being a scam to hide the real reason behind their immortality. A story that I usually prefer as the stone gives me the creeps since I read FMA.

**** I remember one where Harry "borrowed" it during the year and studied the stone under microscope and other stuff, then he returned it. He was able to eventually replicate it using science and magic.

***** He should have just kept it. If Nicholas was fool enough to give original P.S to Dumbledore for scheming and orchestration of deadly game in castle, he is foolish enough to believe a half ass claim such as 'It was destroyed' by Harry.

  Harry could decide that since he retrived the stone before Quirrell made an attempt to do so, and had to kill Quirrell he deserved to keep it.

** I think the authors are just more interested in exploring the results of the immortality rather than the causes, so they use the easy option.

Same reason so many Harry-centric time-travel fics start when he dies at the Battle of Hogwarts. Or Sirius-centric ones start with the fall through the Veil.

Phoenix animagus? I've seen that used for immortality once or twice. Only in a crack-fic, though...

** Vampirism would actually bring an interesting aspect to the story tbh. I feel like Vamps have their own separate world/culture. Though I suppose the Master of Death route is used more often then not because it really just simply is the most convenient one to use. Kinda a "safe option" honestly
