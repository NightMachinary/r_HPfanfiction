Because 90-95% of the Harry Potter Percy Jackson Crossovers are "Our heroes go to Hogwarts" fics and around 100% of them seem to be Look how much better half goods are than wizards/ Wizards are incompetent so let the Halfgoods handle it, fics when reading through the description I'm asking you like a Harry Potter first Percy Jackson Second fan if there are any good fics in the aspect described in the title.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24272845?view_full_work=true]]) This is a HP, PJO and BBC Merlin crossover. It's amazing but some knowledge of the BBC show is required to fully enjoy the fic.

  Percy and Annabeth are at Hogwarts as a favor to Hecate. It was supposed to be simple: go, check on her champion, get out. Of course, Percy wouldn't be Percy if he didn't get a detention. Now it's Dolores Umbridge's quill against Achille's curse, and only one can come out alive.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry Potter defeats Lord Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts arcane magic combines with the Deathly Hallows to an unforeseen consequence. Trying to raise Teddy and deal with those consequences as best as possible while desperately wishing his Saving People Thing wasn't quite so strong, Harry grudgingly involves himself in another war when he hears the Great Prophecy and realises people are expecting children to save the world again. Dragging Merlin along with him, Harry tries to keep his godson safe while his unexpected interference throws the Fates into an unknown future. Can he keep everyone safe in the end?

*** How Merlin-fandom-blind-safe is the second one? I think it looks interesting, but I know nothing about Merlin (beyond what the show might have taken from the normal legends, I guess). I don't care about being spoiled, I just don't want to be confused or spend a bunch of time reading about characters I don't really care about.

I know it's no excuse but I was having a bad day and that made me view your comment in a less than positive sense and that affected my reply to you. I'm sorry about that. You were well within your rights and absolutely correct to point out the Merlin part to me, I'll make sure to keep that in mind in the future. I edited the main comment to point it out. Thank you for beinging it to my attention and again, I'm sorry for my reply. On a lighter note, I hope you are doing great!

****** Merlin's a major part of the story but I don't think that one needs to have watched the show to understand the fic.. Of course, it will help for character (& magic) visualisation and all but the events of BBC show are not mentioned, one only needs to know the legend to read it.. But yeah, I suppose you do have a point, Merlin's a major part in the fic

  “Prophecy about saving the world?” Percy says, leaning back in his seat, leg folded, casual as he throws around weighty words. “Completed it, mate.”And Harry throws his head back, laughing and laughing, because here's someone who has gone through everything he has and they've both made it through the other side. This is someone who gets it. harry and percy meet and realise they've lived the same life

  Love is strange. It does not care for secrets, or things untold. It binds you, and tears at you until nothing is the same anymore. Poseidon is so very tired of repeating the same motions over and over again. He's almost given up hope, until he meets a woman with fiery hair and emerald eyes. Fem!Harry/Poseidon, drabble format

** Harry is still too young for Hogwarts in linkffn(Harry Potter, Squatter) and he is very OP in it, but so far other demigods don't appear to be. If anything, Harry is showing up and solving all of their problems. And despite how OP he is, it's one of the best PJO xovers I've read.

*** It wouldn't be a HP/PJO request thread if someone didn't mention Squatter.

But I really don't think it fits the request very well. Marduk has made it very clear that the Magical World's version of magic is awful. And if he ever really gets there, Harry will definitely walk all over the Magical World with everything he's picked up from being a demigod, even if the other demigods don't. I guess you could argue that that is just a side effect of Harry being a Mary Sue and not of the Magical World being incompetent, but the result is still the same.

**** To some extent I agree, but it's also very different from “we're sending Camp-Half Blood to Hogwarts on a year long field trip and they're going to fix all of the magical world's problems in 6 months” which is what I felt like OP was railing against so much

And yeah, it gets recc'd in every PJO thread here, but that's because it is so much better written (even if Harry is a Mary Sue) than 99% of crossovers
