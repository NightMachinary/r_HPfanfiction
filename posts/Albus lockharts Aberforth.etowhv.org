It was Aberforth who did most of the great things that Albus is accredited for but each time he did something important Albus would show up and one obliviate later "I defeated Grindelwald!"

His real name is Albus Percival Wulfric Dumbledore but he added Brian in there so that when he made magical oaths he wasn't held to them because he wasn't giving his true name. People trust him so implicitly that they never bothered to give him a truth potion.

That's why Aberforth runs the inn in Hogsmeade so that when Albus needs some advice he can trot on over, get some help, obliviate! "Look at me i'm so smart I did it all myself! Worship me!"

That's why Albus' handling of Tom Riddle and Harry Potter was so atrocious because those were entirely his plans without any advice from Aberforth.


** LOLLLLLLLLLL. Someone should totally do this. And Aberforth regains some of his memories and convinces Albus to hire Lockhart, so that MAYBE someone will figure out that the same thing was happening to him, but Albie figures it out

** Hmm, have you tried linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3355032/1/The-Indirect-Approach]])

Aberforth is the one of the two brothers to perform the great deeds but he uses Albus to draw the attention away from him, it's cracky but decent enough
