I officially declare May 5th 2016 to be forever known as "Not my day". On top of college work being an absolute shitfest, today I found myself in a debate with a retarded Draco fangirl who seems to think she slaughtered me, after I said that I was leaving this argument. Also, she refers to herself as Tom Felton's wife. Clearly, I'm in the wrong here and should hang myself like a true lord of the faggits.

So yeah. Need fics that'll make me feel better about that.

*** For anyone wanting to download something from fictionhunt just use the following command.

#+begin_example
  curl -O http://fictionhunt.com/read/8210699/[1-62]
#+end_example

Exchange the 1-62 for the number of chapters in the story and obviously the story ID itself. cURL will need to be installed of course.

It will spit out 62 HTML formatted files containing the story in the current folder. With a tiny bit of effort you can automatically name the files and add the .html extension but I'm extremely lazy.

  Hey, wouldn't it be cool if someone took as many fanfic cliches as possible and stuffed them all into one story? No? Well, I went ahead and did it anyway. Multi-chapter Mockfic. This summary is actually a lot better than I originally thought.

** Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) covers the 7 years of canon messing with tropes along the way and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is at the end of year 2 and sort of twists the tropes you expect into something different.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

  If you believe that Calypso, at age twelve, was capable of that ridiculous level of manipulation, you might as well believe in soul bonds, magical cores, or that the American government is trying to blend muggle technology with magic.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
