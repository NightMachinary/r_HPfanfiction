:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a dramione 8th year fic on fanfiction.net about 2 years ago and I can't seem to find it. Unfortunately I don't remember the author or title, but I do remover that the story was from multiple characters' perspectives, and that each change in perspective was marked by a sentence starting with the characters name. The author had many other stories as well, but I don't remember those either. I understand that this is almost nothing to go off of, but any help would be appreciated!
