Do you know any fics where Powerful Harry is calm, collected and cunning instead of being angry and vengeful all the time. Would also like fics where he is detached from his emotions like Saitama from One Punch Man is most of the time


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

Having a dark lord in your head who can torture you for any misstep is a powerful motivator....

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Well, that's a Harry I'm trying to portray here: linkffn(13047893)

He's an adult in this one - don't know if you are looking for that. IMHO, there's no such thing as a calm and collected teenager.

  "I'm going to make you immortal, Harry. The least you can do in exchange is to stay civil." - in which Voldemort learns the truth behind Harry's scar and the world changes greatly for it. AU from the Battle of Hogwarts. Powerful!Harry. Mature, too. Well, from time to time. PS: No one jumps through any veils in this story.

** For Love of Magic fits your descriptions. Although I don't know if you will like this fic or not. It's understandably controversial just like Harry Potter and the Method of Rationality (HPMoR).

*** From what I remember reading For Love of Magic, it certainly isn't what I want. I was hoping for fics with Harry being detached from his emotions .... Something like Worthy of Magic. linkffn(12800980)

I just realised worthy of magic doesn't have a calm Harry .... Harry in that story is quite the opposite of calm. I didn't realize what fic I wanted I guess...

***** Unless you're a red-pill jerk, you should just give it a pass. It's on the same level of creepiness as Princess of Black, except imo it's a bit worse because at least in that one you got the impression that the author was trying to offend you. In For the Love of Magic, it felt like the author was just jerking himself off writing it as a self-insert and being unrepentantly racist/sexist/creepy. I was pretty disappointed actually, because it was rather well written in terms of dialogue and imagery. But I was getting creeped out by the "sex scenes" in the story and was skipping over them, but there are a lot.

****** i was talking about Worthy of Magic lol. For Love of Magic was really good imo, even though sex scenes and rather strong racism were used more than necessary. I agree that it was really well written, and it had a lot of aspects that i look for in a fic.

Now Worthy of Magic follows a /complete psychopath/ of a child. It is interesting and he is really powerful, but he is absolutely crazy and it's scary lol.

******* Worthy of Magic was just fucking perfect. That one was a fuckin hit, I mean that shit hit straight to the bones yo. Best part is that it gets better and it does so in a manner that makes sense in a weird way. Best part is that it doesn't try to sweeten it's utter fucking madness, it revels in it and how horrible it is and that comrades makes it one of the best fics in the fandom and a goddamn must read.
