I'm about halfway through this fic, so maybe the whole thing ends on a satisfying note or something, but... has anyone else read this? Want to reassure me that 40 more chapters won't be the death of me? Want to commiserate on how depressing the entire thing is if it doesn't ever get any more fulfilling?

I'm usually one of the first people to say James Potter was a real asshole and I sort of kind of wonder how he landed Lily after 7 years of shitty behavior, HOWEVER this fic makes me /wish/ Lily would see sense and just not date at all. Is it just me or is Snape written as the most undesirable human being on the entire planet in this fic?

Lily seems more like his pet than his love interest; someone to be kept, managed, and maintained rather than a person to be respected and allowed to flourish. The possessive, affectionless, humorless, petty Snape written into this story makes it really hard for me to see how or why Lily would fall for him, plus enthusiastically tout how amazing he is when really he just seems to leave her unfulfilled in every possible way relationship-wise.

Am I judging too soon? Does this get any better or will I continue to be sad for Lily making bad choices in life? üòÖ


** Definitely feels like a 38 year old man clinging to an 18 year old stuck in the past as of chapter 38, but I like how realistic both of their motives are for choosing the relationship. Shape's desperate for his first and only love he'll take whatever he can get and can't bear to play noble and Lily appreciates his mysterious maturity spurt. The writing delving into their perspectives is something I can enjoy. Also James doesn't get bashed in this fic and reacts maturely.

I agree that the pacing is agonizingly slow, almost feels like each chapter is a week or something.

*** Maybe that's what it is, maybe the pacing is just killing me a little. Still, Severus Snape in this fic is just the worst person. I don't even think I could consider trying to be friends with him, he has the personality of a vengeful ghost with a grudge against the living. I say all of this, but I know I won't stop until I've finished the whole thing lol.

***** Well, I'm on chapter 58 of 83 now, and all I can feel is that Snape gets more controlling, disrespectful, unforgiving, and just sour in general. Lily's life just seems so bleak, and any time it's written that she "can't believe how lucky she is to be married to Severus" I just feel like she's got to be delusional and deep into the awful end of emotional abuse to be so convinced by a man who can hardly ever even spare her a smile or lighten up for half a second to let her joke around with him. üò©

****** yeesh I don't feel bad about staying in my Tomione lane now. Snape sounds like the typical time-traveller-being-controlling/right protaganists, which is as bad as time-travel Hermione turns into Bellatrix 2.0. If Lily turns against Snape I want to know. Is it still tormentingly slow each chapter? I'll laugh if they're still in the same year.

******* It's definitely one of the slowest paced things ever. I think they're still 18 by this point? Graduated already, but they've been outlining so much daily life, internal angst (that has become extremely repetitive by this point), and the occasional Snape glowering at people other than Lily.

Also, James Potter has been hands down a real nice guy to Snape and had more than once admitted his wrongdoing and apologized, and yet Snape is still stuck on his hatred for James and can't stand him despite them fighting on the same side.

I'll finish this for the both of us üòÇ and I promise I'll tell you if anything actually changes for the better lol

******** The only way this fic can convince me to revisit is if it forces Snape to realize that he hasn't changed at all or helped the future because he's still the same bitter and misguided jealous old man by tethering Lily to him as a permanent reminder of his small-mindedness. That would be a decent ending. If he dies after some stupid ‚Äúself-sacrifice‚Äù as a poor excuse of redemption, I'd pass.

Also Lily seems a bit too blind puppy-esque, she'll need to grow up soon unless the whole point of the story is that she has no unique thought other than to follow Severus around.

James is a bit too perfect for me but surprisingly still the most tolerable of the three.

********* Remember that after Severus' arrival in the past, the first big thing Lily saw him doing was unifying his House and steering them away from Voldemort.

She's been missing her childhood friend for years, trying to make excuses and defend him, until she had to give up when he was throwing his lot in with people who would endanger her - but now she finds out that he's turned around, he's standing against the darkness and making a difference, even redeeming some who she thought were likewise too far gone. It's only natural for her to be thrilled about that and latch onto her old friend again.

And then she has to keep defending him, because people keep mistrusting him, but this time she's more confident, this time she's sure that he and she will be vindicated in time. And thanks in part to his future knowledge, and in part to his talent and a lot of hard work, he delivers, achieving things that make the world better, in large and small ways.

With that going on, is it any wonder that she slips back into old thought patterns of the two of them facing the world together, the way they started out?

It's certainly a harder road for her than canon, if you don't count her untimely death, which Severus might be able to avoid. James would have been easy-going, clubbable, and without financial strain. He's altogether mentally healthier than Severus and likely physically healthier too. But choosing Severus is a very plausible response to her situation. And for all his shortcomings, for all that they'll have to build up from scratch, he does have prospects.

******** I just caught up to the current chapter. Snape is healing /slowly/; Lily just makes him too happy (quietly) not to gradually soften. He never could resist her, after all. But he has reached a tentative first-name basis with James, and attended his wedding to Marlene.

Before you get too upset at Snape for holding grudges, just remember that he successfully used his grudge-holding skills to fight Voldemort for over a decade in circumstances that would have crushed or killed lesser men. The fact that he's able to change at all is a testament to that power of love business that Dumbledore is so fond of.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

He wouldn't win first place. He'll win no beauty contests and isn't the life of parties, but he is dependable, diligent, patient in reaching his goals, and highly intelligent.

#+end_quote

I understand where you're coming from, but his obsession with her wellbeing extends to ensuring that she's only with him because she wants to be. And the management and maintenance goes both ways; he helps her to keep to a schedule, perhaps, but she helps him to remain connected to life and to people. I'd agree that he has an unhealthy level of co-dependence, but he's doing the best he knows how with the pile of lemon rinds he was given.

#+end_quote

I can only really half agree with each of these. Toward James Potter, yes, Severus is possessive of Lily. But if Lily wanted to leave, you can bet that Severus would lay his body down on hot coals to make a path for her to walk out. He would sooner cut off his own wand hand than hurt her. He is not casually or easily affectionate, but he does show affection to Lily; that's something he gets better at over time. His sense of humour is often biting and sarcastic, including self-deprecating, and not shown to the world, but it's very real. Pettiness - well, that one is mostly true (although he can also be very reasonable), but slooowly improving, and he actually has understandable reasons for where he started.

He's a complex character! That's what I really enjoyed about the story.

*** The writing is fairly well done, though there are a few words that consistently get used wrong which kind of bugs me, but I'm also good at ignoring that kind of thing for the sake of the greater story. I do see some real growth from Snape as a character, 73 chapters in, which to me is painful to muddle through for so long.

It could be a matter of perception, but I feel like a lot of the fic is Lily acquiescing to his wants, or disliking them but then finding a way to justify his demands (often accompanied or spurred on by ample amounts of guilt, self blame, or self doubt), or being worn down to doing things his way. To me, that rings of emotional manipulation and abuse for the sake of his own peace of mind, and sometimes the author writes things that make me wonder if she intended it to be that way; like certain moments of annoyance or helplessness that are felt by Lily and worked through silently (because she sure as heck doesn't much have anyone to talk to about her personal concerns aside from the man himself considering the circumstances of Severus' second chance at living). It all smacks of unhealthy relationship to me, but again, as I said, maybe that's a personal perception. As someone who has lived through emotional abuse and manipulation it can be something that is hard to miss when there are hints of it.

Maybe I'm wrong though. I think his personal growth is so slow and minimal, and yes he is a complicated character. If anything, I'd say it's probably a pretty realistic representation of who this fic's Snape would be, when you factor in the fact that he's never seen a healthy relationship in his life and spent an entire lifetime literally obsessing over one person so much that his soul was so affected by it. He would be used to being the one calling all the shots and being obeyed or else (professor for an entire lifetime can do that), would have no idea how to conduct a close relationship since he would never actually have seen one up close, and would be possessive of the thing he lost once before.

Still, I wish Lily would go be an independent woman and live a life that is more rewarding than just living to say "That's my husband! He's amazing!"

I'm still reading and I haven't quite gotten to the part that you mentioned in your hidden spoiler, but I'm interested to see how it goes!

Her skills are actually instrumental in Dumbledore's plans as of the latest chapter, a project that he believes she can do better than him.

Although even before that, she's working as a teacher's aide, helping Remus with his monthly visitor, caring for a husband with a serious disability, and plans to become a mother in the not too distant future. Those are all pretty important contributions to the world.

***** Well, it's good to hear that I can potentially look forward to her playing more of a role than just the wife.

Yeah, I will agree that she is highly capable and has natural abilities that are rare among magical people, but I feel like so much of it gets lost in the shuffle of other things in the story. Being capable does not necessarily equal being independent. There's a LOT of codependency in this fic and that's really not my jam.

However, it's good to hear from someone who is a staunch supporter of the story, because it gives me a reason to put my misgivings on hold and keep reading.

** Many times, Snape has had people invest in him. Lucius Malfoy sponsored him, giving him funds and etiquette training and so forth, in preparation to present him to Tom. Tom, in turn, invested time and effort into him, after seeing his skills. In the new timeline, Professor Dumbledore invests in him, giving him alchemy training and hiring him as a professor straight from graduation and letting him stay in the empty Dumbledore family home.

Lily is, in a way, making her own investment. He doesn't have much to offer up front, certainly much less than James Potter. But she trusts that they can build a very special future together.
