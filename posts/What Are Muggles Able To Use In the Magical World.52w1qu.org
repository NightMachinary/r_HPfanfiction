** It's vague enough in the books that I'd probably go along with whatever the fic writer wants to do. If they say no mugle floo-ing, that doesn't contradict canon.

After all, they need to throw the Floo powder, which may be a magical act by itself.

*** But Mrs. Figg has a Floo accessible fireplace. Why would a squib need one if she couldn't use it? I know Dumbledore needs her to keep an eye on Harry and all but I'm sure it takes more than that to get a floo hooked up.

**** You are assuming squibs=muggles; this is likely not the case (though of course we can't know for sure). It seems plausible that squibs may not be entirely devoid of magic (Filch has pamphlets on how to improve himself in book 2) so it likely goes Wizards>Squibs>Muggles, where Muggles can't interact with magic in any meaningful way, including but not limited to using/making potions, squibs can't cast magic but can benefit from it via potions and things like the floo, and of course wizards can do all of that.

I would think that most enchanted objects would still function for muggles, but a broom for instance wouldn't be able to read the muggle's 'intent' to direct it from anything but a hover, or whatever. A muggle in a magically expanded space is not a dead muggle, is what Im saying.

**** In this case, I'd be willing to go with squib =/= muggle - squibs have /some/ magical ability, just not enough to cast spells or use a wand.

** My go to assumption is that muggles can use everything that has inherit magic, from portkey and floo to enchanted objects.

The party's over when the object requires magic from the user such as a broom or wand.

*** I agree, to an extent. In book 4, when the Weasley's are looking for the Portkey to the World Cup, they say it's disguised as a boot so it doesn't accidentally get picked up by muggles. One could assume that that's because they don't want them to accidentally activate it (or, perhaps they simply don't want it moved away and lost - though it's possible and animal could still do that). We also hear of muggles activating biting teacups and things like that, so it's definitely possible for a muggle to trigger a charmed item.

My guess for the Floo is that they can't use it. Perhaps calling out a destination if you're a muggle simple wouldn't work. Or maybe they would jump in the enchanted fire and it wouldn't take you anywhere. Just feels weird to me.

**** In once wrote a short story that had a muggle use a portkey. While the wizards traveling with him were fine, the muggle was splinched in several places and nearly unconscious.

If I'd write a scene with a muggle using the Floo, I'd make it just as if you rub your skin on brick with extreme speed. Mr.Granger using the Floo, for example, would end up having his skin ground to the bone at several places and some heavy internal trauma.

Like, it technically works, but muggles have no magic that protects them from the forces at work. That would be my piece of headcanon extended.

***** I really like that idea actually. It's really smart thinking. It makes perfect sense too because we know wandless magic protects wizards when they are in danger and so much about magic is dangerous.

Would it change if Hermione is with Mr. Granger? Like, would her magic protect him cause he's her father?

****** Not in the Floo, since as far as I understood, the Floo is one-person at a time only.

I also don't think it would with the portkey. Magic, especially accidental one, isn't that concerned about others, but is more a expression of your own emotions. Should Hermione not know about the effects of a portkey to a muggle, the emotions that would trigger accidental magic would kick in after the fact. Should she know of the effects, magic wouldn't kick in either, as knowledge of something takes away the depth of emotion required for accidental magic. Protecting Mr.Granger in that situation would require a conscious effort.

** I imagine that anything that doesn't require magic on the side of the user a Muggle or Squib (ignoring the possibility that there are degrees of Squibness) can use it. So probably a bunch of enchanted objects, potions, Floo and so on. I don't think Muggles can /make/ potions, but I imagine the less Squibby Squibs probably could. Brooms? Probably depends on the make and model, honestly.

**** [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/potions]]

It is often asked whether a Muggle could create a magic potion, given a Potions book and the right ingredients. The answer, unfortunately, is no. There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup).

******* I've heard the headcanon that intent is a major part in potionmaking. It adds to the potency or lack thereof. You can make a decent healing potion, but only someone who has the desire to /help/ can make a great one. On the other side, most people can brew a poison that will make you severely sick and possibly kill you without medical intervention, but only those who truly desire to harm others can make a guaranteed-lethal poison.

******** From HBP:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at non-verbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, “Specialis revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.

It was. And I think you're right:

  “... which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion's ingredients by Scarpin's Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in a of themselves, but to find that added component which will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements ---”

** The thing is that Muggles can't see anything location based due to magic (wards, most likely) and certain things like dementors. Other-wise, I think that magical transport and items require a magical core to be used, which is why a squib can use them. (I see squibs as people with a smaller core than non-squibs.) However, if muggles come from a line of squibs, they might be born with a small enough core that they can use these things.

I don't remember if it's canon but I've always assumed that muggleborns are born to a long line of squibs when the magic core manifests stronger in the child.
