Either comics or movie is fine. Though its probably a little soon for a movie based one, but maybe someone has started one already. Scarlet Witch crossovers would also be appreciated.


** linkffn(Child of the Storm) has Dr. Strange and the Scarlet Witch in somewhat minor roles. It's kind of a "everyone but the kitchen sink" kind of crossover fic. Dr. Strange was the doctor who delivered Harry and Scarlet Witch is his godmother. They don't show up until like halfway through the story.

It's mostly a HP/Avengers crossover with Dresden Files, Constantine, X-Men, Stargate, and some others thrown in as well. I really enjoyed the story. It's a very long read at over 800,000 words.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  Harry was abandoned by his parents at the Dursleys only for them to abandon him in New York a few years later. Luckily, Harry met a strange magician under circumstances only Harry could consider normal. How would the Marvel Universe and the Harry Potter world change now that he's being raised by Dr. Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme? Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived. Harry/harem. ABANDONED!

  Marvel/HP cross. Fudge expells Harry Potter, so he takes his life into his own hands and heads elsewhere to learn magic under Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme. After he learns he returns to a war infested United Kingdom and kicks butt. Some DD bashing.

** I haven't seen one for the new movie yet, but I would definitely read one! I was actually thinking about Doctor Strange and Loki the other day, because I figure that their 'magic' has to have the same source within the MCU. Harry's magic would be mind-bogglingly strange to them since their magic is really just energy and power taken from other universes, whereas Harry's power comes from the magic within himself.

Plus there's so much potential for squibs to learn MCU magic and kick ass, which sounds like a good old fashion revenge fic to me :D

*** It's hilarious but the first thing I thought of when I got out of Doctor Strange is that...the wizards in the Harry Potter world wouldn't stand a chance

** This one has some Dr Strange at the very end. It's largely Avengers/Harry Potter crossover. Slash is the main pairing, but it's honestly well done I think :) No smut or gratuitous sex, just a nicely developed relationship in the midst of an engaging action/fantasy plot. Highly recommend!
