I posted a thread few days ago asking for fics that have Ron stay with Lavender Brown. (here's the link: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g3nug9/ron_stays_with_lavender_brown/]] ) And one person gave me this suggestion.

linkffn(Girl Talk by sprinter1988)

WTF? I know some stuff is very hard to find. But if you can't find it, at least don't suggest the EXACT OPPOSITE THING!

Has something like this ever happened to you? What are some of the worst replies you've seen?


** I think some people just don't read any part of a request-post other than the title. Especially if you request a specific pairing, they will just post anything that claims to have that pairing regardless of anything else you asked for.

** Yeah or someone tells you your ship is shit and you should feel bad about it. Like give me a good suggestion or beat it Queen. Or if you are a hgss shipper and you request a good story and everyone and their dog suggests Pet Project. No. I've tried five times to read that story and I'm not into it ðŸ˜…

** Its not really a reply but I check my profile and the things I post. I found out that someone downvoted my post without saying why. I know because if I click for an upvote, it wont do anything. When you post, it automatically upvotes. Its not like I posted something rude. I was looking for a fic. Tgis happened twice now.

  (Story starts with the "Girl Talk" scene in Descendants 2) Carlos started this girl talk in order to help Mal gain the courage to go to the Royal Cotillion and give Ben another chance at love. But the result from this talk was not what he had in mind. Mal's unexpected response made this talk unforgettable for both herself and Carlos... for good reasons, or bad ones?
