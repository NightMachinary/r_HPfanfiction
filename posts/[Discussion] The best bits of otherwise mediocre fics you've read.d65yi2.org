So, I read Faery Heroes long ago, and it definitely gets credit for being intelligible, but it was essentially a 250k word bash-fic. But the Slughorn plot was superb and refreshing in an otherwise eh fic.

Do you guys have fic moments like that?


** I read a fic where an OC from our world who'd read the books wound up meeting Snape in a pub in his world and becoming his girlfriend, because he's just so sweet and kind and basically perfect boyfriend material, and also seemed to have completely forgotten about Lily for some reason. Some, possibly all of the fic's humor was intentional, as the OC spoke in a stereotypical American southern dialect full of colorful metaphors, and called Remus “Moonpie.”

****** Actually, that's interesting to think about. Hermione started off taking all 12 classes, and she had to use a time-turner and it almost killed her. But multiple of Ron's brothers were able to take 12 OWLs. Is Hermione just not as good at school as them? But I would think that Ron would find Hermione less impressive then, since his older brothers were doing even more than she was. Or maybe they didn't take all 12 OWLs their 5th year, maybe did them later as electives or something.

I guess it's probably a mistake that JKR overlooked, as it seems to make Hermione look pretty bad.
