A completely rewritten story where harry is smarter, stronger, faster, or just better. A HPGW pairing would be nice to go with it.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.
