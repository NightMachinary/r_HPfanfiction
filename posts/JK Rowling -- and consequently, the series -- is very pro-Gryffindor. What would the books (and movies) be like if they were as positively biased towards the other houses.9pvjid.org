For example, in a pro-Slytherin HP series, traits like cunning, resourcefulness, ambition, and brotherhood are the main defining characteristics. In this AU, Gryffindor (or some other house) is considered the "evil" house -- with Gryffindor being portrayed as hot-blooded, reckless knight templars.

What about events? How would things differ with, e.g. Hufflepuff!Harry and his friends?


** From any other POV, Gryffindors will seem like hot heads who never think before acting. They are cult like in their inability to see grey--- everything is either good or evil. Harry's choices in OOTP would be skewed as way more idiotic and prideful.

*** The thing about how Harry's thought process has become by age 15 is hanging around Ron, an impulsive Weasley who has a lot to prove being the youngest boy, and Hermione, a planner who tries to do the right thing but got dragged along into terrible situations.

If we replace them with characters from other Houses that don't just become stand-ins for the pair, we don't know how Harry would turn out. If we put Draco and Pansy as Harry's friends if he was in Slytherin, then he might become more conniving and arrogant. If he had Ravenclaw friends, better study habits would form since he's literally surrounded by those that seek knowledge. I'm not sure about Hufflepuff but he'd at least have friends who wouldn't turn on him at the drop of a hat.

One of the few Hufflepuffs we see Harry interact with positively with is Cedric. I think Cedric would bring out different traits in Harry that could have set him up to handle issues like Umbridge and Occlumency with a bit more tenacity and patience.

You're right about Cedric being a positive influence to help Harry deal with Umbridge and Occlumency. I think Snape might not have been as much of an asshole to Harry if the Boy-Who-Lived wasn't in Gryffindor. Severus'd still be a prick, but probably not as big of one.

That's why she ended up being petrified the next year (alone in library to do research on Slytherin's Monster), chasing after Ron under the Whomping Willow to the Shrieking Shack the year after, can't say anything about Fourth Year as that was on Krum but also a bit on Potter as Dumbledore knew Harry would also want to save Hermione in case Krum was too late, followed Harry to the DoM in Fifth Year, don't remember much of Sixth Year, and skipped out on her final year of Hogwarts to go on the hunt for 4-5 Dark Magic objects that could have realistically been anything.

#+end_quote

This is a very broad question since it requires a lot of assumptions. Many stories usually have Harry befriend Susan Bones, who then becomes a plot device to get Harry in touch with her aunt (even though a close relationship between them is pure fanon).

It really depends on what the author wants to write. Hufflepuff can be the staging ground for an army of loyal minions, or be simply a place where Harry gets a more consistent backing (fewer people turn on him whenever the weather changes). It leads to a few other possibilities like him getting in touch with Nymphadora Tonks (who could share one year with him if she is born in the second half of 1973) or Hestia Jones (whose exact age or house is unknown).

Same goes for any other house. It's up to the author how things go. The Slytherins might very well murder Harry in his sleep during his first week there, making for a very short-lived and miserable story. Ravenclaw can leave Harry better prepared for the war, or an outcast like Luna.

Not something about politics and house-alliances and pure blood and whatever (whose idea was it to make 'pure-blood' the password, anyway?!), those have gotten cliche and boring.

I'm more thinking something along the lighter side of ambition; entrepreneurship, leaping on new ideas, making mistakes and learning from them. A Harry who stumbles along, constantly trying new things; his plans and ideas never go off perfectly, but sometimes they go right all the same, and he always learns something for next time. Always willing to lend a hand to see where it goes, seeing potential in every new thing, et-cetera.

Consequently, Slytherin has been ostracized, most of its members either imprisoned or dead; while Gryffindor is at its pinnacle, with members that often hold the worst qualities.

** I have read two pro-Raven fic, it was not mentioned directly but I can sense the subtle bias toward smart and rational people. Linkffn(harry potter and the boy who lived), this fic has an einstein Harry who is a former Ravenclaw, he is disgusted with lazy and stupid ppl. He also has the cunning trail of Sly but seem to choose knowledge over anything else. Linkffn(when in doubt obliviate) is a fic where Lockhart adopted Harry, and he himself is a Ravenclaw which made him really smart and careful when approaching problem, which made him solves everything in a less messy way than Gryffindor. To write a pro-Raven one you must be so smart to imitate their sharp and rational mind.

Going into stupid battles again and again for the right reasons. In the forbidden forest with the spider. At the whomping willow with his broken leg.

I think people think Ron isn't brave because the movie actor looked so scared all the time. But the definition of bravery is really being scared and /doing it anyway/. So even if the movies are your canon Ron is a brave character.

****** Ron didn't believe Harry because Ron has a massive inferiority complex from having 5 older brothers who are massively successful in their given fields, and he's the second youngest behind Ginny, who happens to be the only girl in the family, which makes her special and unique. He's got one best friend who is touted as the most brilliantly talented witch of her age. He's also got a best friend who, before becoming part of the Tri-wizard Tournament, has defeated Voldemort 3 times, and has won the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor for the first time in years.

Remember how in first year, he looks at the Mirror of Erised and sees himself as Head Boy, with the Quidditch Cup and House Cup? That's him, desperately wishing he could outdo all his brothers and be the best of them all, because if he could outdo his awesome brothers, then that would make him even /more/ awesome.

Now, Ron's not always the best thinker. He finds out about the tournament. He dreams about everlasting glory and Fame and 1000 Galleons, and he looks wistfully at the Cup, and says, "Man, if only...." Thinking he'd be the bee's knees if he won all that money and fame.

But, wait...Harry's name came out of the Goblet. What? He didn't, but....

Harry enters the back chamber where Dumbledore calmly asks Harry if he entered his name.

Ron, however, is sitting with Hermione, listening as the Gryffindors are all super pumped for Harry and can't wait to see what he can do. It makes Ron feel like it could have been him up there instead, getting a chance to shine. Harry got his name in there, why didn't he tell me how? Am I really that worthless, that useless that my best friend won't tell me this? Maybe he'll tell me once we're alone how he did it. Yeah, that's it. But why didn't he tell me he did it beforehand? Harry's done a bunch of cool stuff already. Couldn't he have let me take this one? He says he didn't enter, but why wouldn't he? With all the glory and Fame and money, well maybe not the money since he's rich, but he's used to the Fame and glory so maybe it makes him feels good? I don't know. That doesn't /sound/ like Harry, but....

Meanwhile, Hermione is losing her mind out of worry. Ron doesn't realize it himself, but he does get a pang of jealousy, not because Harry's getting attention, but specifically because he's getting /Hermione's/ attention.

That's when his mood shifts and he reckon's he probably did it, mainly because literally everyone in the school besides Hermione, thinks that Harry did it. Hermione's not always right, right?

So yeah, Ron gets caught up in his own insecurities and can't see past himself, until he sees Harry fighting a dragon and Ron thinks, " Holy fuck. Harry could die here. What are these people thinking? Harry's fighting for his life out there and...oh. Wow. Well, I'm a right prick, aren't I?"

So Ron, after realizing his own insecurities blinded him, comes to his senses on his own and goes to apologize immediately. Remember Percy later on? It took Voldemort showing up in the middle of the ministry of magic to realize he was being a prick, and even then it took him two fucking years to man up and apologize to his family.

Ron? He realized he was being a dumb prick after 3 weeks.

So 1 year goes by. Ron still hasn't told anybody how fucking worthless he feels, but that's okay, because he starts making a name for himself. He wins the Quidditch Cup, although he is miffed that Harry and Hermione snuck off to the Forest because Hagrid somehow has been hiding his half-brother giant in there. Yeah, sure, okay...do you think they...? No. NO. Harry and Hermione aren't like that. They wouldn't lie to me. Would they? Stop it, Ron.

Ron has many of those moments in his years at Hogwarts, when his insecurities pop up when he sees Harry and Hermione alone, and his respect for Hermione turns into affection and finally love. But he keeps it down, because he believes in his friends and he realizes he's better than that.

So then, fast forward 2 years, and Ron is tired and hungry He got splinched, so he's hurt and can't use his arm.

No horcruxes, Dumbledore didn't tell Harry shite, he's tired, he's hungry, Harry and Hermione are all happy and perky without this fucking stupid Horcrux on their shoulders.

God, he misses his mom's cooking. And his mom and dad, and the twins, and Ginny, and Bill and Fleur, and Charlie, and even Percy even if he is a massive prick

Look at them... So happy...Harry doesn't have anyone to worry about at home, and he's undesirable number 1. He has no place to go. Hermione doesn't have it much better. /Her/ parents are out in Australia, out of the way and safe. And since she's Muggleborn, she can't really abandon Harry either, since she'd be taken out in chains to the Ministry the moment she pops her head out in wizard society.

But Ron...he has a chance at living a normal life still. He can go back to his family. And be in his own bed, and eat his mom's cooking...

Wait...fuck, Ron. Stop. This is the locket getting to you. Stop it now. Okay, 3 more hours with it on. I can do this. I can do this. Then it's Harry's turn to be miserable, and /Ron/ can be happy with Hermione... Wait, stop!

This happens for /weeks/, Ron constantly in a battle for his own wits as the Horcrux picks at everyone single one of his insecurities until it all boils over into the fight we see in the books.

So Ron takes off the Horcrux, leaves the tent and Apparates immediately in a fucking rage.

Then, after he gets away from the situation and that fucking Horcrux, he cools off. He immediately is filled with regret and guilt , but before he can Apparate back to Harry, he runs into a band of Snatchers and barely gets away. By the time he apparates back to the Forest, it's too late. Harry and Hermione have moved on.

You know the twisted thing? All Hermione and Harry had to do was say Ron's name, just once, and Ron would have been able to find them. But they don't, because Hermione wants to act like Ron never existed.

But no, Ron has to sit tight and just wait, not knowing if they're dead or alive, all because of his one moment of weakness. God, if he had one chance to make of for everything, he'd take it in a heartbeat.

And he fucking takes it. The moment he hears his friends say his name (after months, I might add), because of Dumbledore's deluminator, he fucking /jumps/ at it, and apparates because some little bit of magic told him it could take him to Harry and Hermione. It's stupid and rash and only offered a sliver of hope, but Ron did it in a heartbeat, despite all the comforts of his brother's home, because he would do anything for his friends.

And the fucking destruction of the Horcrux. All of those insecurities given physical form, taunting him, and belittling him after /years/ of him trying to repress them. All that, and Ron doesn't crumple or lash out at Harry. He demolishes those insecurities once and for all.

Ron's loyal as fuck, and he has the most character development out of the trio. It's a fucking shame everyone can't see past his faults and look at his strengths. He went with Harry on every adventure without question, each time knowing that last time he was beaten unconscious, or almost mauled by a colony of giant fucking spiders, almost lost his memory, or broke his leg, or got attacked by fucking brains and death eaters.

Is he bloody perfect? No. But that's what makes Ron awesome.

****** Yeah, when he was 14. Because pubescent boys are berks at that age. If you can sit here and tell me you never did shit like that, you're lying. Also, that 'Bloodsport', was the world famous competition that everyone was trying to enter, and offered fame and fortune as a prize.

It only took a few weeks for him to tell Harry what the first task was.

******* I'm not claiming that I was an angel or didn't fuck social situations up, but I never betrayed a friend like that. And especially not in a life or death situation like the one in canon.

Because that left Harry much time to prepare and he didn't have to stay up with Hermione until 2 in the morning on the day of the task.

******** Also, what life or death betrayal? Never happened. Ron literally offered his life for Harry in first year, and in third year, just a few months before this 'betrayal', he became a human shield for harry, despite standing on a broken leg, in front of a mass murdering death eater.
