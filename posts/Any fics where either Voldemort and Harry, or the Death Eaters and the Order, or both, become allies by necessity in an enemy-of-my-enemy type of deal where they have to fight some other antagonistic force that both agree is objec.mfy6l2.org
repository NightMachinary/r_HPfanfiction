** The dementors sort of function like this in The Hush of War by zeitgeistic, but they're not exactly the reason for the alliance. In general, I think dementors fill that kind of role nicely.

*** An idea popped into my mind where the mutual enemy could be the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry more broadly.

The DoM and the Ministry could for example spy on citizens and kill political opponents or some such, or create and experiment with unthinkable magic.

Or try and bind powerful mages with Ministry jobs. This one I've seen before.

**** That's a good idea! I always liked when the Ministry were the villains more than I did Voldemort and the Death Eaters. I think the Ministry's surveillance abilities were really understated in canon, like the idea of the trace implied to me that they know when magic occurs anywhere.

The Ministry is also a joint enemy in The Hush of War. From what I remember, Harry makes a mutual non-destruction pact with Voldemort around the time of Order of the Phoenix, which I think has more to do with his own personal burnout, but then there's something going on with a huge breeding of dementors that he and Voldemort fully team up to stop them and simultaneously the Ministry is trying to make the Wizarding World increasingly insular, which makes Hermione worry that she might get cut off from her muggle parents. The best part for me is when a muggle-born dies, and you see the Ministry Obliviating him from his parents' memories so they don't remember anything about wizards. Voldemort opposes the Ministry in the sense that he's not anti-muggle-borns themselves but rather thinks wizards should be raised surrounded by wizards, so he and the Death Eaters form an initiative to adopt newborn muggle-borns and give them to pure-blood parents. It's the only gray Harry concept I've ever enjoyed.

Are you designing a fanfiction? I like the idea! Feel free to DM me if you want to bounce ideas off someone.

****** If you think this sounds cool, I cannot recommend zeitgeistic enough! Shibboleths has the most creative plot I've ever read, and she pulls it off beautifully, and The Hush of War, Azoth, and Antediluvia are also brilliant (as are all of her other works like she's a writer who does some serious fckin research and planning but then doesn't rub it in your face). You can have yourself a very fun month if you haven't gotten into her stuff yet. It is all drarry, and I do enjoy reading drarry so I can't say for sure, but I bet it's gripping even without an interest in the ship.

******** Fair enough- I don't write drarry or ship them in canon, but it's so popular that it's attracted some really great writers. Out of curiosity, do you mean you only read gen and canon ships, or you're fine with fanon ships as long as characters aren't interpreted as gay? I've just never heard anyone phrase it like that. I hundo p understand the flaws with drarry itself, but are you not into ships simply because they're slash?
