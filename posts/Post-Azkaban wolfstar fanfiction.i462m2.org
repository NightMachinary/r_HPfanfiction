I would be very grateful if someone can suggest some fanfiction about wolfstar after Sirius escapes Azkaban. It would be great if people could suggest a fanfiction where probably, they were dating before Sirius goes to Azkaban, so it's more of a continuation of their long time relationships or smth. Have anybody read this kind of story?
