  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.

** If you don't mind self recs and female Harry, my series starts with a selectively mute female Harry (she's selectively mute for the first fic in the series and works on speaking more in the second fic).

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  He comes every Wednesday for the Wednesday special, stands at the same machine all the way until closing time, and never says a word. It takes Tom four months to find out the kid's actually a famous rhythm game champion, another month to get his name, and (embarrassingly) another month to figure it out. Harry---with his green eyes and messy hair and round, clunky glasses---is completely, utterly mute.

** Okay. I'm picturing Harry as the newest reincarnated Link as Voldemort is Ganon or Ganondorf (your pick I guess) and Zelda is let's say, Angelina Johnson or Alicia Spinet. The Master Sword is deep in Hogwarts waiting for Harry to pull it out.

** Hazel (aka FemHarry) is mute in linkffn(Spells in Silence). So far, it hasn't reached the Hogwarts era yet, but if you like soft worldbuilding and a kid protagonist that acts like a kid, you might like it.

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft
