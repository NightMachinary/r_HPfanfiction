Look. I dont like snape most of the time. But I'm sick of seeing snape being a sneering idiot who goes around legilemencing people left and right.

Is there any fics with a competent multi dimensional snape? One who looks out for the students in his care?

This is a man who stood between a werewolf and students he didnt particularly like.

** Here are some of my favorite Snape stories where he is portrayed pretty well, I think - though I will also admit that most of these are not strictly student centered.

​

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were and rekindle a love they never thought possible.

Ten years after Voldemort's demise, Severus Snape, thought by all to be dead, lives out his days in solitude. Ginny Potter, meanwhile, juggles a high-profile career, three children and a workaholic husband. What happens to change their lives forever?

** Linkffn(13053868) has one of the best interpretations of Snape that I've ever seen. Snape is still very much an asshole in this story, but he also understands -- quite possibly more than anyone else -- the psychological trauma that Harry has endured in the story. Also, it's referenced in this story that he's helped multiple students get out of abusive situations before.

Everything stated above pretty much goes for linkffn(7508449) as well, although Snape is a parental figure rather than mentor. Actually, the author of this story also has several other decent Snape stories, including this one-shot linkffn(12574231).

** I think hes shown fairly favourably in most fics where the mc is slytherin. Im gonna rec linkffn(6919395) and linkffn(11191235) because theyre two of my favourites that have a competent snape, but snape isnt a main character in either. The concept of legilimency might be interesting to you in the changeling, snape says something like "to take is to keep" about memories and thats why he avoids using it unless necessary.

If you want more snape centric stuff try searching for mentor snape, but the only fic i read of that type was forgettable and way too sweet for my taste.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again.

** /I'm trying, dude./ It's so hard to write Snape well.

I don't tend to write that he's a blithering idiot just going around rummaging through people's brains and abusing kids; I just don't think that's it.

On the other hand, his position between light and dark is so precarious. He can't just go around being a hero all the time. In the books, he didn't jump between the kids and a werewolf, but I do actually prefer that they put it in the movie as him doing so. I think he was able to do it, though, because there was nobody else around. There was no one to go and dob to Voldy that Snape protected Harry Potter, a blood traitor and a Muggleborn. His protection of Hogwarts and its inhabitants has to be far more subtle than that /most/ of the time.

As for how I write him, I try to portray him as intelligent, complex and talented. He has a difficult background, including a troubled upbringing, and his Hogwarts years weren't a walk in the park either. He has friends, in his own way, and people that care about him. He does what he can to keep Hogwarts safe without blowing his cover, which is vital to him continuing to keep Hogwarts safe. Due to to nature of my fic, he is also a Dom, which I feel suits him because he already has two ‘masters.' He doesn't need a Dom too, he needs a way to relax, to feel in control of his actions and, more importantly, his life. He needs to nurture as he is not allowed to nurture in his day-to-day life, and he needs to care without consequence, without the effect on his daily life that caring romantically for someone would have. By being a Dom, he can separate how they are towards each other in private from how they behave in public and I think that difference is really important for him. People are, quite often, the opposite in BDSM of what they are day-to-day. It's all about having what your daily life takes away.

Anyway, if you ever read my work, you'll have a bit more of an insight into my Snape than most people do.
