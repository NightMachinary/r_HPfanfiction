I'm looking for fics that have decent representations of polyamory, so relationships of more than 2 people but with good communication and an actual romance? Like pls none of the "harry goes and fucks these 10 women and I'm calling that polyam" fics if there isn't relationship building between harry and his partners as well as at least friendship between those partners. Don't care about pairings (does not need to feature harry, that was just an example, I'm quite fond of the ones centered on Hermione) , just want to read good polyam relationships that don't just read as orgies, and not limited to straight fics either slash and femslash welcome

by the end, poly, things don't quite work perfectly. Probably a more realistic portrayal of poly dynamics.

** Recommending you some fics that feature Harry/Hermione/Ron, or Triofic. A pity that many of these fics have been lost to the ether as they were on alternative fan websites that have since been shut down. Nonetheless a good portion still remains and are worth browsing, that will take some time and effort to track down. Google Harry/Hermione/Ron or Triofic will lead you down a long rabbit path with solid poly fics about this relationship that has gone on since even before the 5th book was released

First, there is probably the original OG fic by the OG author Calliope [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/calliope/triquetra01a.html]]

Then there is the livejournal of Simons' Flower, who i think is another solid writer of triofics that sadly passed away many years ago. Thankfully, her work is still online at [[https://fics-by-flower.livejournal.com/tag/hp%3Aship%3Aharry%2Fron%2Fhermione]]. It is all mostly one-shots and smutty. Very little plot, but a lot of feelings and character interactions

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6807742/1/Just-The-Three-of-Them]] is another fic that is recommended around here whenever. As it stands, this is one of those short fics that i wished could have been expanded to a longer one, just to see the character interactions. Nonetheless, what is there is solid.

[[https://hptriquetra.livejournal.com/]].

Sadly incomplete, but an excellent example of Harry/Hermione/Ron having to deal with kids and jobs, while plot is lurking at the back. Not to mention, the various authors give space for interactions between any two characters within the trio, focusing on the relationships between them.

Lastly, another one that I would like to recommend linkao3(19801915)

#+begin_quote
  Harry brought flowers.

  “I'm sorry,” Ron said politely, “you must have me confused with Neville Longbottom, the only male friend we have in common who would be happier to get a bunch of forget-me-nots than a bottle of booze.”

  “Shut up,” Harry said, stepping inside and shaking off raindrops. “They're for Hermione, to apologise for what she's going to find in the morning and sympathise with her for having such an insensitive prick for a husband.”
#+end_quote

Any fic that can capture Ron and Harry exchanging some witty banter is gold in my eyes

** There are none. Best one I can think of is a band AU where Fleur is polyamorous, but that one is just a oneshot and only mentions her other relationship in passing. Every single one I have read with Harry is either some Lord Potter bullshit where the girls are interchangeable and lack character outside of their interactions with Harry or are just Harry fucking around. Maybe "What's a little death between friends" will become one, but so far the other relationships are only hinted upon.

** Besides A Third Path to the Future which is the best polyamory fic of those that have already been linked, linkffn(12130882) is a pretty good Harry/Draco/Hermione from what I remember which is high praise from me since I normally don't like Harry/Draco or Draco/Hermione.

As far as I can tell, most HP fics with more than one person in a relationship end up actually being harems and not polyamory which is a shame since polyamory seems more interesting to me. Some fics claim to be multi-relationships but they mostly just focus on Harry's relationships with the various women and doesn't expand on any of the relationships between the women besides the fact that they fool around with each other when Harry is preoccupied with one of the other ladies. Like I expect some scenes that explore how the relationship between the ladies works without Harry there. Maybe A Third Path has just set my expectations too high? I don't know.

Some other fandoms might have more polyamory fics. Like I know I have read some good polyamory MCU fics with Steve/Bucky/female Tony and Steve/Bucky/Darcy. And Pitch Perfect has some good Aubrey/Beca/Chloe fics as well. I'm not gonna link those here though. I just wish HP had more polyamory that, like you said, doesn't descend into a non-stop orgy.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12562072/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Daft-Morons][Harry Potter and the Daft Morons]] by Sinyk, while falling into the trope for including Fleur, even if the "how" may have been a bit different, takes an interesting twist for including Daphne, as it wasn't (within the story) intended to really become a relationship, but more of a way to protect Daphne. Contracts get mentioned a lot and Harry isn't the only wizard with a couple girls. Harry also has some quirks and is more mature than typical of a 14-15yo, even if it takes a while to explain it within the story (the author actually says it early on in the A/Ns, somewhat). Also goes to show that just because the girls share Harry doesn't mean they are all bisexual: Hermione about bites Fleur's head off for trying to give her hand while with Harry. linkffn(12562072)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path]] by Temporal Knight, another where more than just Harry has more than one girl, though it takes a long while to get there (story starts when he's 10, and iirc the romance doesn't start until closer to 14 or 15) but that helps to build up the foundation for the relationships instead of a couple weeks/months within a single school year that you typically see in 4th year or later version of events (like Daft Morons). linkffn(11898648)

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.
