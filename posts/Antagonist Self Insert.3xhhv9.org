Reading a Self Insert earlier this morning I realized I never read a SI where the protagonist becomes an antagonist. Exists something like this?


** Well, it's hard to imagine a story where the SI isn't the protagonist, since it's his point of view were following. Unless you simply mean "SI where the main character opposes the canon heroes".

*** Something I've been looking for, and haven't found yet, is an "SI" or Peggy Sue story where the POV is another character trying to figure out what happened.

Like... Hermione trying to solve the mystery of why Harry suddenly acts differently, or why Draco is suddenly nicer, and only acts like a douche canoe when he remembers he's supposed to be one.

** It's a tall order. I think that linkffn(In Bad Faith by Slayer Anderson) might fit the bill, though I haven't had a chance to start it.

  I never pretended to know what I was doing in my last life. Why should I pretend to know anything about this one? Well, the other option is a horrific and bloody death, so...I better start learning how to be a witch. OC Self-Insert/Draco's Younger Sister. [DEAD]

*** It is a great fic, but the it's an SI stuck in a young child's body, not really an antagonist. The SI is in the Malfoy family though, which makes things interesting

** Only one chapter right now, but one where a SI fuses with the diary, or at least that's what I think is happening. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/magic-and-mayhem-a-harry-potter-story-about-tom-riddles-diary-eating-an-si-of-sorts.368704/][On SB]] There's a post about it already but still, it works.

** So, I don't know if you're ever going to find a fic where the SI is an antagonist (because they're the protagonist, and that's kind of contradictory), but I've read one story for where they're kind of not on the good side of things. For an SI story, I don't think it's bad.

  You get those Self Insert stories that see your heroine land in a well known, pure-blood family, or hell, even a half-blood family. Not me. I ended up a muggle-born circus performer with a habit of knowing the future. A habit Tom Riddle is more than happy to abuse.

** I found an amazing evil/sociopathic self insert that feels very similar to seventh horcrux/ yes i am harry's brother but its not in the harrypotter fandom, it's in buffy the vampire slayer, however its still enjoyable even if you've never seen the show.

** Most SIs I've read side with the 'good guys' even if they then turn around and act a lot like the bad guys. Like in that Lockhart SI where he murders the Dursleys.

I don't think I've ever seen an SI that actively sides with Voldemort and the death eaters. Most likely because unless you insert AS Voldemort, you really ought to know better than to trust him enough to work with/for him.

The only openly antagonistic SI I've ever read involved a detour through the wringer that is Warhammer and the psychotic result running amok in Buffy... And it was... Not my cup of tea.

**** Well, that really depends on the type of story.

Most SI stories turn you into a witch or wizard as part of the transition. You'd probably be a muggleborn unless you're doing a possession style SI where you replace the mind of an existing pureblood.

Actually, that would be one way to do it... Self insert "accidentally" into the body of an already established death eater with a war record that means changing teams is a death sentence.

****** This assumes that you've landed in canon as you've interpreted it.

Would you bet YOUR OWN life on that?

I'd have to do a lot of careful investigation to make sure the world matched my recollection of the books before I risked reaching out to anyone. Even though I agree that canon Dumbledore would be a reasonably good person to turn states evidence to... I can't be sure that I'm right about the Dumbledore in the world I landed in.
