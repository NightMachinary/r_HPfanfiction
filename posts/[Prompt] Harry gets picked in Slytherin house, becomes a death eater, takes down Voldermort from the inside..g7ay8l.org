** But you know how the death mark kinda ruins your chances of fighting tom

Maybe he fakes it?

But it's gonna take a freaking genius to pull something like that on voldemort and if he can do that why not just kill him?

Maybe to find out all of the soul anchors of voldemort?

Tbh I thought it's impossible but now I can see it!

I thought that part was fandom and in canon, the mark was only a way to call them or see the Dark Lord status? Otherwise, Snape and Regulus would be screwed from the get go.

***** I can't recall anything like that happening in the books, the only time it caused pain or discomfort was when he used it to call them, and he needed to touch one with his wand. Other times were indications he was regaining his strenght.

We never saw it being able to cause enough pain for them to curl up and scream, only surprised them.
