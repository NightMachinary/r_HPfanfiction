:END:
I read a fic years ago about a female Harry Potter actually being Morgan Le Fay. The story starts in the desert somewhere and certain magical things happen. As a result, Harry is sent thousands of years back in time as an immortal. The rest of the story is her journey through time, traveling the world, learning more magic as she progress through time. I think at one point, she meets Merlin as well. It was such a well-written story, but it was incomplete at the time. And it was around four years ago that I stopped waiting for updates. Does anyone know what this story is? I've been looking all over but can't seem to find it! Please help!


** It's a Long Journey Home.
