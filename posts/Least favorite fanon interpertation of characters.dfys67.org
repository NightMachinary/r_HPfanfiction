Fanon often likes interpreting characters or depicting characters in a way thats not like book canon. Which isn't necessarily bad by default but some particular characterizations are eye roll worthy.

Which ones are the ones that frustrate you the most? If a character in book canon just frustrates you it doesnt count. It has to be the fanon characterization that bothers you. Also Dumbass asshole Ron and perfect, hyper competent Hermione also doesnt count. Its just too ovbious sorry. Everything else is fine Also has to be characterization can't be like I hate x character in y ship or x character in b type stories. You can point out if a particular characterization is more common with some ships than others or some types of stories than others in your experience.


** - whipped/crybaby/perfect Harry. He's a sarcastic little asshole who typically does what he has his heart set on.
- stupid Dumbledore/Draco/Snape/Marauders/Lily
- goddess Hermione/Lily. They're written damn near the same and it's super annoying.
- best friend Neville/Dobby. I grew to hate both midway through this decade. They were everywhere at one point.
- bad boy Draco. He's more of a "dapper" white nationalist.
- forgiving Lily, I suppose. There are quite a few stories where James dies and she reacquaints herself with Snape
- subservient Fleur/Gabrielle. I hate the veela slave thing

He is a drama queen image obsessed fop I can remeber. Bunch of times where they joke about how he spends "hours" on his hair.

That version of fanon Draco is closer and feels right.

** Off the top of my head:

- *Bellatrix* was just "mislead" as a child/teenager. If this were the case, one would suspect most of Voldemort's other Death Eaters (particularly those in Azkaban between the wars) would be just as frothing-at-the-mouth dedicated as her.
- *Snape* as either 1) a mislead child with a lot of ability but with a tragic backstory or 2) a Death Eater because Lily "turned" on him. Look, Snape is complicated. Perhaps the most complicated character in HP (though that is admittedly not a high bar). He is a petty, spiteful, vindictive man with an abrasive personality to say the least. He is also seemingly loyal to his word, was an abused child who suffered from serious Muggle abuse (possibly worse than Harry), was extremely talented and intelligent, and fervently dedicated to his love/obsession no matter the personal cost. In many ways, that was the point of his character: like Harry and Dumbledore, by the end it was impossible to see these halfbloods (appropriate) as truly black or white, but that its all shades of gray.
- *Sirius* as a real ladies' man. We get some hints of this from Snape's memories - maybe - and possibly his reckless behavior, but at best a post-Azkaban Sirius, if exonerated, would probably be using women like he did alcohol in OOTP. As an escape.
- *Dumbledore* and the whole "Greater Good." Same deal as Snape, since honestly when you think about it their characters are very similar (hence why the only people Snape ever really respected are Dumbledore and Voldemort). Yes he made mistakes. Yes he had a /general/ plan in many circumstances. But he was guessing, and assuming malice or incompetence when we cannot say what the alternative would be is strikingly juvenile.
- *Hermione* as rule obsessed. This is a fundamental mischaracterization. Hermione is not obsessed with rules, rather with the authority. Her most striking character moments (such as in PoA with Buckbeak and the Ministry) are when her perception of authority is shattered. When this happens, she is willing to break any rules that do not conflict with /other/ authorities (ex. McGonagall, Dumbledore).

*** Most of the Bellatrix/Harry shipping in this sub uses some form of Fanon Bellatrix to justify how and why Harry would ever be interested with her, as opposed to girls his own age, who haven't committed horrific crimes. It goes anywhere from making her a woobie with a sad, abusive backstory (because abuse survivors love bonding over their abuse) to full on whitewashing (because Frank and Alice Longbottom were agents of a corrupt ministry).

I wish people would just admit they like Bellatrix in Leather Pants, instead of trying to think up elaborate rationalisations. The Draco shippers did that years ago.

**** I mean at least Draco you see regretting his choice and lying about Harry's identity so theres....something.

Lucius was never exactly the most loyal. Narcissa was loyal to her family over Voldemort clearly. Regulus tried his best to destroy a horcrux, Barty Crouch jr was minipulative asshole who helped torture the longbottoms but genuinely sold the i was dragged into this act and his father was a cunt who send at least 1 innocent person to prison with no trial.

If you wanted to give anyone a sad backstory and and make them more sympathetic or redemption arcs or both all of these people work better than Bellatrix honestly.

Hell you could make Greyback more sympathetic by having him justifably pissed off at the bad treatment of werewolves and then have his bitterness warp him into a monster.

Maybe its just me. To me Bellatrix is like the Joker. I love the character for being psychotically sadistic, shes a great villain. I dont wanna see her wobbiefied. And any arc i could do with a sympathetic Bella i'd rather see with Narcissa or Andromeda or Lucius or Regulus tbh.

*** All of this seriously i have no idea where the Sirius is a ladies man comes from. He never shows any interest in women at all. Not in flashbacks, not in Harry's time. Im pretty sure its just that hes attractive but has no romantic history. But ...i mean he went to Azkaban at 21 and had a war to fight before. Pretty sure he just didnt get much of a chance to date to be honest.

Bellatrix being misled is eyeroll worthy like dont get me wrong. Im not against redemption arcs or the idea of Slytherins being pressured into being death eaters. But really Bellatrix? Lucius being misled makes more sense to me.

Snape...i mean he is an interesting character but tbh Rowling did him no favors by acting like he was redeemed by loving a woman who didnt like him back and not really giving any indication that he would have rejected Voldemorts bigotry if he hadnt killed Lilly. Kinda makes him seem like a magical incel not a good look and i dont think was the point. He just wasnt done the best in my opinion.

Dumbledore...i mean given how cartoonishly evil Voldemort is it makes me kinda wish Dumbledore was the chessmaster archetype so he could be a better antagonist. But...ya he really didnt have it all together either.

Hermione...well ok ill give people a pass because the books do make such a big deal about her rule breaking being out of character which is really eyeroll worthy cuz she does do it every year and ...i do wish that she just got to the point where its just assumed shes going to question authority by default.

**** In Rowling's [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin][backstory for Remus]] on Pottermore (now renamed Wizarding World), Remus and Tonks have this little exchange:

Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (‘He's still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?'). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend (‘He always got the women.')

I think we can assume that they were talking about Sirius (although I suppose technically they could have been talking about Hagrid.) Anyway, it's canon that Remus's old friend, formerly of Azkaban, always got the women.

Stuff that she came out with long after they ended can be a whole mess. And at times seems unnecessary or like hasty revisions.

Though even if i were to accept that and say he had feelings for Tonks and Sirius was a ladies man that would mean that Remus would consider it typical that Tonks fell for her uncle?

And even if he had a crush he needs alot of pressure on him to start that relationship ( having a crush doesnt make that any less uncomfortable) and has a kid in less than a year so it does little to make this relationship seem less fucked up.

We see Sirius as getting stares and vaguely flirtatious in Snape's memories; his general demeanor is somewhat reckless and outgoing; Remus and others commentaries on the Marauders characters might fit with that perception. And in fairness, he could have dated in Hogwarts or between 1978 and whenever he went into hiding as well. Its just not believable post-Azkaban.

Thats the point. His purpose in the story is to be the continual red herring. By having Harry dislike him, he serves as a distraction from the true culprit in each book. Storywise, he would never have been successful as a double-agent unless people hated his guts and were willing to believe the worst in him. See the contrast with Pettigrew for instance. My point is, don't try to boil him down to good or bad - that was never the goal of his storyline.

Dumbledore is not evil. Not by a longshot. He is a person, just like everyone else. He has successes, and he has failures. He succeeded more than he failed, and the war was only won because of his efforts. But humans have a tendency to judge others by their seeming failures and /speculations/ on what would have been a better choice. Dumbledore is an optimist, a contrast to Voldemort's pessimism - both of which affect their plans and methods of operating and influence Harry's perceptions.

#+end_quote

Narratively, Hermione exists to be an exposition character for Harry (Dumbledore is the explanation character for the mystery in each story). This means we don't have to hear about him learning all this on his own, and that Rowling can just have an answer come out of nowhere for a problem. In story, Hermione has a character personality that is fixated on the idea of right and wrong per se. Contrast this I think with Harry who is obsessed with good and evil, and Ron arguably being between the two archetypes. This affects how each deals with/perceives the situations they find themselves in.

I mean I can't say I don't get the appeal of this. But usially there is something there to sympathize with.

Riddle had a horrible childhood and was growing up in WW2 and trying to convince Dumbledore to let him stay at hogwarts when London was being firebombed.

Draco regretted joining the Death eaters and chose to not give Harry up despite being really freaked out about being caught and then married someone progressive and went against his parents wishes.

Snape also had a horrible childhood and then was bullied alot.

They arent excusable but they have sympathetic qualities. Moments that make you wonder what if things had gone differently and maybe even some redeeming qualities. So the what if they werent assholes fics make sense.

But...you dont really get those moments for Bellatrix which makes woobiefying her a little more confusing to me.

Well I mean thats true but I do think he was meant to be sympathetic and redeemed in the end in at least Harry's eyes. Hell Harry names a kid after him. But it feels uncomfortable when you never really see him go against Voldy's beliefs, make it clear he rejected them. So it makes it seem like Harry sees him as redeemed for being attracted to his mother and only for that. I get what Rowling was trying to do and I appreciate the idea. But personally I think the execution is flawed.

******** I think Harry's reaction is a result of 3 things: firstly, the similarities between Snape's childhood and his own. He had his own set of bullying "Marauders" before he joined Hogwarts (Dudley and his friends). What if Harry himself had grown up friendless? Yes, Snape had Lily as a friend, but it's obvious that more than once in his memories, Lily believes the Marauders' explanations over Severus' and they were growing apart even before Mudblood (the main thing that comes to mind is werewolf prank aftermath -- Lily didn't even try to listen to Severus' explanation on events before calling him ungrateful because he wasn't thankful to a bully).

Secondly, the only truly heinous act in Snape's memories is his sharing of the prophecy -- which was rather vague in first place. His memories doesn't show any significant flaws in Snape's person beyond this one act.

Thirdly, Snape at this point is dead. Over time, it's easy to forget everything Snape did that caused Harry's dislike for him in first place while remembering the good things he did. Dead people can't show character flaws. Harry has never shown any good ability in seeing a person as neither strictly good or strictly bad.

** I hate the character Sirius turns into in pro-Slytherin fics, especially if Snape either adopts or mentors Harry. Sirius' most defining characteristic is that he loved James and he loves Harry. He does not constantly confuse Harry for James. The few times he does that, he's genuinely confused about when and where he is due to persistent trauma for most of his adult life. He tries so very hard to be a consistent and consistently adult presence in Harry's life that it breaks my heart when everyone else is an utter wanker to him.

He's unreasonable about Snape, but his first encounter with Snape as an adult is someone who's trying to feed him to dementors despite knowing that he was innocent, and last he knew Snape was a Death Eater, one who led his brother from another mother to his death. Plus it's usually him responding to Snape needling him or picking fights with him.

He's far more nuanced in his outlook when he tells Harry that there's more to the world than good people and Death Eaters.

Sirius Black is messed up, sure, but he's also smart and loyal beyond reason and brave and quite, quite witty.

What he isn't is someone who'd reject Harry for being Slytherin, or someone who'd abandon him at Dumbledore's say so. He's not a follower. He's not stupid.

**** Luna's father is definitely a conspiracy theorist, but I don't think of Luna as mentally ill. She's no seer but she's not a schizophrenic either.

She lost her mother when she was 9 years old which made her become more dependent on her dad. Maybe he had some sort of mental breakdown when he lost his wife, writing strange articles in the Quibbler as a coping mechanism. She accepted what he said as truth because she didn't want to distance herself from the only family she had left. She gets angry when someone insults the Quibbler, but that's because they're directly insulting her father's work. If you take the movies as canon then in half blood prince she finds Harry on the train under his invisibility cloak by seeing the wrackspurts in his head, giving evidence that she's seeing something actually there. If you don't take the movies as canon and only use the books then she's still far from unstable. She doesn't pay attention to conversations that bore her, but isn't afraid to say uncomfortable truths.

Some claims, like gnome saliva being beneficial in some way, might actually hold some truth. The list of magical substances is massive, and potion makers still haven't discovered every effect of every single one. In a world where being stung by a billywig causes uncontrollable levitation and gillyweed literally transforms your body to let you breathe underwater, is it really so hard to believe that dirigible plums do enhance your perception of the world around you or gnome saliva does enhance creativity?

As far as dressing in eccentric and weird clothes, keep in mind that wizards in the books often have no idea how to dress like a muggle, and even Dumbledore would dress in weird clothes at Hogwarts. She may have just assumed that dressing in clashing colors and wearing strange outfits was just a part of wizard culture.

So while she isn't a seer in canon, she's really not this mentally ill conspiracy theorist that you think she is.

** - Lily being depicted as forgiving Snape. Because how could she /possibly/ take issue with a man who claims to love her abusing the son she gave her life to protect in her name while also disparaging the memory of her husband, who also gave his life to protect her and their son? Particularly when said man willingly joined a terrorist organisation that murdered people of Lily's birth with no apparent understanding of why that's bad.

- It ties in with that, but whitewashed Death Eaters, Malfoys very much included. I just really wish that this community would stop rationalising, excusing, and even outright condoning fictional racism.

- Bellatrix as being conspicuously "crazy." People treat her like she's a less self-aware version of [[https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Krombopulos_Michael][Krombopulos Michael]] (at least when they aren't presenting her as having been tricked or forced into joining the Death Eaters; Prince of Slytherin does both and I hate it), which doesn't make for a particularly compelling villain.

- Dumbledore. Hoo boy. I firmly believe that most of the bashing he gets is a direct result of people applying Watsonian logic to questions whose Doyalist answers are almost always either "because otherwise there wouldn't be a story" or "it makes for better pacing," but even with that in mind, his treatment from the fandom often just feels mean spirited.

- I know you said that Ron and Hermione are low hanging fruit in a discussion like this, and I agree with that, I really do, but it'd keep me up at night if I didn't at least mention that, yeah, their fanon portrayals, particularly Ron's, are egregiously terrible, and again, it feels mean spirited.

Edit: can't believe I forgot this, but Luna: in canon, she's too credulous for her own good and has no real social skills, but she's observant enough to recognise Harry based on his mannerisms while he's disguised, which somehow morphed into, depending on the fic, either Obfuscating Stupidity (usually accompanied by a "Luna is too hard to write so I'm changing everything about her character" AN) or "she's actually a seer" with no justification given for this massive leap in logic save, presumably, for its once again simplifying her character to something easily understandable.

*** re: Bellatrix. I think people are generally aware of how the movies changed a number of key characters (Ron, Hermione, and Snape getting the most discussion around here, but also conspicuously aging up the entire marauder generation by about fifteen years or so), but I think Bellatrix is actually one of the characters whose fanon interpretation is most influenced by how she was played in the movies. In the books, she's regal, cunning, and extremely dangerous; in the movies, she is unkempt, insane, and relatively weaker as a fighter. I think there was a little something lost there.

Seen this in Wolfstar fics where Sirius and Remus raise Harry and give him a fun childhood full of pranks, goofy hijinks, "why so Sirius" bad puns, and "Prongslet"/"Cub" nicknaming. Remus Lupin is a lone wolf, and is too filled up with guilt, complexes, and cowardice, to be a role model to an impressionable young kid. Maybe if he hadn't been bitten by werewolf.

- Petunia Dursley with a secret heart of gold. I've seen this show up in fanfic where Petunia steps in to stop Vernon beating Harry, then files for divorce and becomes a good mum overnight. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/df8slp/are_there_any_plot_turns_or_moments_in_the_canon/f32cm3a/][In a recent thread]], I was told that Petunia taking Harry into her house was a sign that she truly loved Lily, after all this time (/insert Snape voice/ Always.). In the actual canon, Petunia never demonstrates love or affection towards either Lily or Harry.

    "Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be."

    "I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!"

    "Aunt Petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before. Her large, pale eyes (so unlike her sister's) were not narrowed in dislike or anger, they were wide and fearful."

*** For the weaselys i guess it depends what they being bashed for they definetly have a mean streak but alot of bashing things ive seen are like slytherin good griffindor bad. And so having a slight sneaky vindictive streak might go more in their favor.

But if its just calling out flaws in the weaselys in general they for sure have flaws to be called out and do get a pass when others dont.

Remus...mmmh i could go either way. I definetly think he wouldnt jump at the chance to be a parent.

But he was hessitant about starting a relationship with Tonks from the start, agrees to do so after a funeral while being pressured in public and then ends up having a kid less than a year after the start of a questionable relationship. Point is it kinda makes it seem hes hessitating about having a kid in a relationship he wasnt sure he wanted in the first place. And then taking responsibility because he feels like an ass for not.

So you could also argue that hed be a better parent if he felt he had more of a choice to be one in a relationship he was more comfortable with ( i mean i doubt Sirius would be the easiest to live with after Azkaban but didnt seem like he had a issue with it in canon). It really depends on how you interpret canon Remus.

Petunia I 100% agree with everything you said. I think the fandom goes too easy on her.

** I have to say that mine is usually Voldemort. It's usually because it's just him being a manipulated child that was pushed into the role of dark lord or he wasn't in control of his body. He doesn't try and do this fib to redeem himself, but it just "He was manipulated, so all his murders are justified"

** Hermione as the stupid mudblood who isn't really smart but just works harder than anyone, mindlessly believes in books and authorities, yet always misses the truth about the Wizarding World.

I loathe that kind of misogynist, Death Eater apologist drivel.

** *Ron the Death Eater. Who calls Hermione a mudblood, and thinks she is ugly but easy. Who betrays Harry for the first, Skeeter, Voldy, Malfoy, other bashed characters, and so. I want to remark that when Ron was very angry with Harry:

a) don't sold ant stories from Harry to Skeeter while their fight in fourth year. Don't use any "Potter sucks" badges. Don't badmouth Harry to his peers. Only spent time with Dean, Seamus and his twin brothers .

b) during Deathly Hallows, he didn't sold Harry and Hermione to the Snatchers. He didn't went to his parents house, for the shame of having left his friends.

*Amelia Bones being a wunderkind, and a justice server/solver. She is part of the super very very corrupt dark government. She could be better of the most, but... if it was true, i suppose that she hasn't a lot of power.

** Ginny. The movies already didn't do her justice and while I sometimes like to read a good bashing, i feel like she is often depicted as an unlikeable character... As I wrote this I realized that I mostly read Drarry and other ships and that my opinion probably is caused by that. Be that as it is, the movie still didn't do her justice.

*** To be fair alot of ships with Harry that arent with Ginny do this.

I sort of get it because there is a tendency to show why the canon romance didnt happen when going with a different romance.

But Ginny Harry as a romance wasnt the best established nor did it have the biggest impact on the plot. So it does feel unnecessary to go out of the way to dismiss her relationship with Harry when you could just...not have Harry like her. It feels more necessary for say James/Lilly to give a reason why they wouldnt be together.

** Thorfinn Rowle. Mostly what bugs me about his fanon persona is that people write him as a student with the Lightning Era gang, when he was actually most likely put in Azkaban after the first war and “escaped” with Bella and co.

*** I think that's only a few authors' personal headcanons rather than being widespread fanon. At least, I've only seen this from a small circle of authors within the same writing community who consistently write in the romance subgenre and use the same sets of characters, themes, and ideas.
