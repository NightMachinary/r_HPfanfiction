** What, with the time turner? Seems obvious: assuming she didn't only use it during waking hours, it was Asleep!Hermione and Awake!Hermione.

It is also possible for two people to both sleep in even a twin-size bed. Can even do it comfortably if the people are small enough.

*** I thought the whole point was she was getting more and more stressed and fatigued because she /wasn't/ sleeping more than 1 days worth, while doing almost 2x the schoolwork, so was effectively awake for 32 hours in a 40 hour day, instead of 16 and 24?

**** Well, yeah. But she could've gotten more sleep with it the way I described. She just didn't.

*** But one of the rules of time travel is that you can't let your past self see you.

**** Bill and Ted disagree. So does Austin Powers.

I think I remember Dumbledore telling Hermione to make sure she and Harry didn't see themselves while saving Sirius, but I don't know if that's just a Ministry regulation, a "you could unravel the space/time continuum" warning, or what. And since Harry did see himself and it was ultimately beneficial, I don't know if that rule applies.

***** It's a "you shouldn't let yourself see you because you could kill yourself" thing.

Harry sees himself while a few seconds away from being kissed and thinks he's seeing his father.

***** Still, even if it's just a Ministry regulation, Hermione is not one to disregard the rules, especially when McGonnagal (Idk how to spell) probably gave her a big preemptive lecture on responsibilities before letting her touch the time turner.

** I think it was because there wasn't more than one of her at night. She used the time turner for class but stopped using it once the day was over. There would be no reason for there to be more than one Hermione wandering around at night.

**** I'm actually not sure if you're joking, but there would not be more than one. Think about when Hermione and Harry travel back in time. They go back three hours, and when they get back to present time, they replace the old Harry and Hermione. On a typical day, let's say Hermione uses the time turner for a class. She'll go to one class (say Arithmancy) then turn back time and go to the other (say Divination) During that hour, there is one Hermione in Arithmancy and one in Divination. But when the hour is over the Hermione that was in Arithmancy has used the time turner so she IS the same Hermione that's in Divination. That's why Ron and Harry notice her disappearing sometimes. Once the window of time travel is over there is ONE Hermione. Not two.

** Wasn't the whole point of it for the user to arrive at the same location where they had used the time turner in the past just as their past self was about to travel in the past in order not to mess up the timeline? I would think she wasn't using it at night.
