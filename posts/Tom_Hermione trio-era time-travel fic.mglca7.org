:END:
I read this months ago, and I can't remember enough of the tags to find it again. I think it was on FF.net, but it could have been elsewhere.

Tom steps forward to Hermione's seventh year, when she's head girl. As he disappeared from 1945, he never became Voldemort and the war never happened, but he still wants to become Voldemort. He starts over recruiting Death Eaters from his new classmates.

The Tom/Hermione is a BDSM relationship: I remember that they get into it without communicating well, have a mishap, and then learn how to negotiate what they're doing.

I remember that Regulus Black was still alive (no Voldemort) and has a daughter, who gets paired with Neville. Dumbledore can see what is happening but is impotent. Ginny is a rubbish spy.

I remember that the new Death Eaters end up making horcruxes, and spend a lot of time making a Welsh castle habitable, and that Hermione's horcrux is the locket, and it gets destroyed during the battle of Hogwarts.


** linkffn(Pygmalion by Colubrina). I cannot understand how this is considered the Holy Grail of Tomiones with the bashing and extremely OOC characters, but to each their own I guess.

*** Thank you! I like it for the multilayered treatment of kink - it's a D/s relationship within a fantasy D/s context, in that Tom and Hermione have a D/s relationship both informed by /and/ independent of their relationship as Dark Lord and Death Eater. I found it really fascinating the first time I read it.

You are right that the characters are hella OOC, though. It's a very different story from canon.

  When Tom Riddle walked through a doorway one fall afternoon everything changed and he found himself in a world wholly unprepared for him. "Something about you makes my brain itch," Hermione Granger said. "As if an earthquake had shifted everything sharply two feet to the left and then back again and it didn't all fit back quite right." Tomione. AU. COMPLETE.
