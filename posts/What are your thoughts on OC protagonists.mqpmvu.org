** OC stories are fine by me, if there's a reason for them existing (and, obviously, if they're written well). However, they do struggle a bit more with, well, seeming integrated into the world. That's why you'll find many authors doing pseudo-OCs, by taking a canon character and either creating a personality for them (eg, Daphne Greengrass) or adjusting their personality to match what they want. This accomplishes the main goal of an OC in many situations, while still having a bit of the grounding in canon that lets some stomach it easier.

So, is there any specific reason why an OC is the best choice for that character?

** Write the story /you/ want to write. That is what will make your story interesting and what will keep you writing past the first few chapters. You are never going to please the entire fanbase, so try not to get caught up in writing what seems more popular. There are a lot of people out there who LOVE stories with well-written original characters. The fic I am working on is focused very heavily on OCs, to the point where their plot lines are driving the story, and I have a great group of dedicated readers who love them. I also have people who have peace'd out of my fic as soon as they see that the OCs will be the main protagonists, and I totally understand that, too. Everyone likes something different.

I think a lot of OCs suffer from the issues you mentioned, but I've come across so many good stories that feature OCs and that work to expand the HP world. It is critical to make your OCs stand on their own. They should not be another version of a canon character ("Just like Ron! Only mine is a girl.") or take the place of a canon character. Why is the OC there? What are they doing that a canon character can't accomplish? What void are they filling? It sounds like you have thought a lot of this through, so your OC should be good to go! Just make sure they are there to tell their own story and aren't just another mouthpiece or POV to develop the canon characters.

You got this.

** Do you have a reason for your OC to exist? I for example have no problem with an OC if there is a (plot-)reason for them. I do only have a problem with OCs when they don't contribute anything and just go on the ride in the stations of canon.

If there was a legitimate reason for the OC and they did have a well-thought character I usually did quite enjoy them. And I know many people think similar. What nobody wants to read is a fourth member to the trio. Because most of the time they are like you said, self-inserts, Mary-Gary-Sue etc.

*** Im curious: Would you say a fourth member to the trio is disliked because the characters themselves are crap? Or because they're difficult to integrate due to (for example) the trio being a complete set of characters? (Ie, their strengths and weaknesses complement/complete each other)

**** I think it's a combination of all of those.

The trio is pretty well balanced. There isn't much reason to add on a fourth member. It also doesn't help that most of the time such characters are crappy self-inserts. There are good self-insert storys out there - sometimes I read them, but hardly if the self-insert is a fourth member of the trio.

Another reason is that most of the time they don't really change anything. So many fanfics with a fourth OC are just a canon-rehash with a crappy written fourth character. I know that there are maybe exceptions to that rule out there - but with all the bad fanfics existing I don't bother find them when I know 99% will be exactly like that.

Edit: Sometimes an OC is used to bash characters - that is even something I can stand less than a forth member. For example when Ron or Hermione are replaced by a more flawless version of them. Nothing is less exciting than a flawless, bland character.

**** The Golden Trio, canonly, wouldn't take on a 4th member. They are well balanced as a trio. And, they do have other friends outside of each other in canon, but you realize that they never integrate any of them in their trio, not even Ginny, who is Hermione's best friend, Ron's little sister, AND Harry's friend/crush/girlfriend. I don't have a problem making the OC character friends with the trio but they wouldn't make the trio a quartet because they would constantly feel left out (accidentally, of course).

**** I think Harry, Hermione and Ron are so bonded after the troll incident (a life or death experience would do that) and then after that everything that happens at the end of POS, it's very hard for someone new to be introduced into that dynamic and simply vibe with the three of them. What they go through together pretty much from the get-go binds them and also insulates them to a great extent.

** I just realized I dislike OC's in Harry Potter more than other fandoms - I think it's because I was into HP fic when the 'Mary Sue self insert OC' really took off and now I always assume the worst.

Anyway, unfortunately yes, for some the 'mere presence of an OC' will turn them away (at first). I think this issue is why many writers choose a lesser known background character, use the name and then apply the backstory/characterisation/plot that was planned for the OC.

But I also agree with some of the other comments here, you should write the story you want to write - if you are happy with your OC go for it!

There will still be an audience and a high quality fic will overcome that knee-jerk bias against OC's - especially once people start to rec it.

** As long as they don't take over the plot I'm okay with them. I've seen lots of stories where an OC takes over the whole story and canon characters get bashed or ignored.

I like my OC's to be the support Harry should have had in canon, someone who will listen to his problems, and counter Snape's assholishness. I like to replace McGonagall as head of Gryfindor house, only OC actually does the job properly.

** I like OCs, but I never seem to find good stories with a OC main character. What I end up doing, is reading stories with canon characters that are written completely different, maybe because they are in a different house or because their parents didn't die (Harry). So I think that if the OC is written well and they add to the plot, I wouldn't be opposed to reading it.

I'd be more willing to read say, an OC attending Hogwarts before or after the books, where it's their own story. However, even then in general if I want to read a new story, I'll read non-fanfiction.

** For me I like OCs when they're done right. In fact the Alexandra Quick series is one of my favorite fics. Alexandra has her own world and villains while it is set in the HP universe. None of the characters from the original series show up. You only hear about them but never see them. To me a OC has to have flaws, make mistakes, personality, identity, and other stuff.

PS. I also think Alexandra Quick works because its set in America and not Britain at least to me.

** If you like your story then there's no reason for you to chance it just because more people would read it (that is if you don't wish to have as many reads, likes and comments as possible - this is absolutely a proper reason to have even though some may not like the sound of it).

As for me personally, I don't read fanfictions with OC's because that's not what I look for in fanfictions (I don't care if they aren't a main character). It's not because I don't like them (they are written quite well actually if you know what you are doing and not just putting your character into a story and make the world spin around them) but when I read about already canon characters, I know how they are altered from the original and that's what brings me the greatest joy when I'm reading a fanfiction. And, at least that's what I think, this reason applies to many people as well. There's a huge difference between an altered story and a different story (again, I see it that way and you may not see it like that because altered and different is especially a same thing in fanfiction, but hey, I don't know the exact definition of these words and just view them and feel them as drastically different words to begin with).

The conclusion is that if you keep our story as it is, OC included, then there will be still many people who will read it and like it. You won't really notice a difference because it's your first fanfiction you want to publish. So, as I said in the beginning if you are satisfied with it, leave it as it is.

** I enjoy (and prefer) reading about OCs, even as part of Harry's group, as long as it's not a canon rehash where everything happens in the exact same way as it did in canon. It really just comes down to personal preference and what type of stories people like to read about. I'd rather read AUs and canon divergent stories than canon-compliant stories because I think they're more interesting, and that often comes with OCs or canon characters who are so out of character that they may as well be an OC.

** Focus on the story you want to write and don't worry about anything else. I feel like the HP fandom is a sometimes less tolerant of OCs, but I also think that stems from the fact that there is an endless list of characters to choose from, from multiple decades of HP lore and A LOT of these characters are blank slates that you can use for your purposes by tweaking or frankly just creating histories for them that fit into your story's narrative.

Like fanon's treatment of Marlene McKinnon. She was an Order member who died in the First War and apparently gruesomely so, that's all we know about her. But she has been repurposed in fanon for all sorts of plot reasons.

So if you think about it, you can take a blank slate canon character and use them however you wish. I mean look at what Daphne Greengrass has been turned into. In canon, the most significant Slytherin female is Pansy Parkinson, yet Daphne has emerged from the pack in fanon and pretty much has a lore of her own now.

** There must be a reason for OC (and she cannot be the Harry's sister): see “Ten More Minutes” by Litfreak89 linkffn(9566537), “Behind Blue Eyes” by elmembrila linkffn(2095661), “Grow Young with Me” by Taliesin19 linkao3(16405130), or “A Muggle in Magical Britain” by Tegildess linkffn(3743602) (BTW, all of them are excellent stories). There is a distinct lack of decent Muggle girls in the Canon, so if you want to write a Harry/Muggle story, you just have to have OC. There is a plot-driven reason for their existence. If you have your typical fourth-member-of-Trio slightly clumsy otherwise awesome girl, who doesn't have any role in the story than to exist (and the plot is super-strict The Stations of the Canon, so there is no place for her), that's what readers hate. Are there plot-driven reasons for OC to exist?

He doesn't have to be the protagonist, but if an OC is that protagonist AND not interacting with the canon characters, then to me that's not a Harry Potter fanfic at all and I have no interest in reading it.

** Yes. And if the story actually revolves around something that's not in the books, that's good with me as well (and always gets my attention).

Example: the life and times of a witch that lives together with Muggles. And starts a stunk when death eaters threaten 'her' muggles. The story of a dragon tamer who's friends with Charles Wesley. He'd a bit of a weird one because he can understand dragons. A Wizard Scam Artist who targets the freshly arrived muggle borns but falls in love with a Muggle woman. He also is really disgruntled with his fellow wizards for looking down on muggles, because while they're still his marks to exploit, he sees them as the humans that they are. (going for a r a wholesome vibe with those ideas, one could easily turn them Dark And Gritty).

** I rarely read them. They'd have to be done in a very exacting manner, such as not usurping any canon character's role. Too many authors just insert their OC straight into the canon plotline, so I'd pretty much never read about an OC student unless they had very little to do with Harry & co.
