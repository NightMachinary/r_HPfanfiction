** DobbyElfLord's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] should also fit your bill. Theres even a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6808016/1/The-Sniper-II-Babylonian-Nights][sequel]].

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]] Bears some similarity to Ender's Game(as the title implies) and it's pretty good reading. Unfortunately it doesn't update as often as I'd like

  At a young age, Harry becomes one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The young Pale Rider must reunite the Horsemen but first he must overcome his own trials and reclaim his artifacts all while still at Hogwarts. Features an Independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, a realistic Dumbledore, and a bunch more magic involved.

*** Just read it.

The fight scene is a bit dragged out.

And he seems to have lots of things fall into his lap at a young age

**** Yeah, the fight scene was a bit ... off. Especially the conversations in the middle.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][The Skitterleap]] is a severe AU, but fits the ball well, IMO.
