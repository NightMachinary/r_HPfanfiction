As the title says, I'm looking for fics based on prompts written in this subreddit. I'm curious how many prompts actually get picked up, or how many fall into the void. I'm also looking for more stuff to add to my 'to-read' list. :D

Have you written a fic based on a prompt written by someone here? If so, post it!

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.
