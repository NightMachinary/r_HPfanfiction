  lavender and ron's relationship has a knock-on effect “Lavender feels I haven't been spending enough time with her,” and then she tilts her head over to their best friends look as though they're struggling to breathe. Parvati's kissed a couple of people, she's not sure it's supposed to be quite like that, at least not at half eight in the morning. But she's not judging; she's being a good friend. Harry laughs. Parvati gets a sharp kick to the shin at that. Lavender's always been good at multi-tasking. “I hope you feel ashamed.”

  And here was Parvati Patil, asking him about it, with wide, curious eyes. With a brilliant golden-brown shine to her skin only a few shades darker than his own, unearthing parts of himself he had forgotten about. It feels right.OoTP-era Harry/Parvati in the Room of Requirement.

  Classmates' relatives are being brutally murdered and the most evil dark wizard of all time is on the rise but in secret corridors behind tapestries she never knew existed she has the boy who's destined to save them all's mouth on her neck and his hands on her thighs and it's tragic what's happening outside these walls, disgustingly evil, but she's sixteen and this boy is making her feel like nothing is wrong at all.

  It's not until Saturday morning that Harry wanders back into her mind. Contrary to what Hermione may think, Parvati hasn't been thinking solely of Harry for the past few years. Yes, she was sad when it ended with a hurried kiss and a promise of later but then there was a summer full of fear and fog and then there was Snape as Headmaster and Dean on the run and half of her classmates gone and torture at the hands of teachers and when all of this is happening it's hard to focus on the sort of relationship she used to have with the boy at the centre of this whole thing. parvati and hermione have a coffee and talk about their lives. they talk about harry and harryandparvati but it's more than that. this is parvati's life after the war and how she got to this point

  Padma didn't have a soulmark. Which was fine, even if it did complicate certain traditions, like the tradition of being set up on dates in hopes of meeting her soulmate.She didn't realize she had already her soulmate.

*** I feel your pain. I can't get it to work for adult-fanfiction.org but as far as fanfiction.net, hpfanficarchive, and archive of our own it's easier as it can accept either the fic name, or the story id number.

Also be aware it takes some time to respond so I find i have to leave that post and come back in after fanfictionbot tells me it respond.

So here's 3 of your recommendations through the bot I'll leave you the last two. Also I seem to find that editing a post/comment to use the bot doesn't work for me so i have to make a new comment to make it work.
