:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey y'all! I've been looking for this fic forever but I can't seem to find it, so I hope someone can help me.

Basically what happens is that being parseltongue starts consuming Harry's mind and he needs to be committed to saint mungos because of it and Draco ends up breaking him out and helping him deal with this new power.

I don't really remember a lot of details, but I know at some point Harry starts hallucinating snakes all around his hospital bed and also that Pansy Parkinson was in it.


** I believe you're looking for Deconversion by Lomonaaeren. I really like imagery of the dark and light paths leading to specialisation in those types of magic.

  They were right, those old wizards who thought Parseltongue was a Dark gift. As Harry begins his slide down, fighting desperately all the way, Draco is more than happy to take advantage of the Hero's fall from the Light.
