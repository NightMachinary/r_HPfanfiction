** You don't necessarily have to change anything to make it "realistic" because everyone reacts to trauma differently. Some people luck out on the genetic lottery and have awesome brain chemistry with incredible resilience that allows them to, for example, fight in a war and come back without PTSD while other not so lucky people get PTSD from watching CCTV.

Personally I'm fine with Harry's characterization because he's already very much affected - the lack of trust in authority figures and the consequent saving people thing, his problems with emotion regulation - the anger issues and his struggles with dealing with interpersonal conflict, latching onto parental figures etc.

Depending on how you imagine his childhood to be ( were the things mentioned in the books unusually bad in the grand scheme? was he actually starved as a child like in CoS or just not allowed to overeat like Dudley? Was he actually locked in the cupboard or just sent there?) you could give him issues with food, give him claustrophobia and/or arachnophobia, have him act out in class, give him more anger issues, make him more violent or verbally abusive, have him bullying others, make him a confrol-freak, make him struggle with/not wanting romantic intimacy.. the list is practically endless

** There are no concrete ways in which we can say - everyone will react to trauma like what Harry grew through differently, so we can't apply a singular blanket consequence.

I think [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/gmyt58/overdoing_the_dursleys_abuse_when_is_it_too_much/][this thread]] from a few months ago might be interesting to read through, as well as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/grp43e/if_you_write_a_fic_that_deals_with_the/][this one]].

Abuse/trauma is a tricky subject to treat with the gravity it deserves, as well.

*** Also, for me personally the worst effects of said trauma slowly developed once I left childhood.

I have another friend who suffered similar things, and he is insanely driven and focused.

** Uh, I guess he would be more like Tom? And I don't mean this thing from canon, that he and Harry are supposed to be similar because they are both orphans and both half-bloods.
