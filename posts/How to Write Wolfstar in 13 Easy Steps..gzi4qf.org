I've been reading a lot of Wolfstar slash fics lately and I think I've figured out *How to Write Wolfstar in 13 Easy Steps.* It doesn't matter if they are single or already in a relationship if you follow my guide you can't go wrong.

1.  Remus is soooooo in LOVE with Sirius and HE KNOWS that Sirius doesn't LOVE him.
2.  Remus PINES for Sirius.
3.  Remus ANGSTS over how much he loves SIRIUS.
4.  Remus throw a PITY PARTY because HE KNOWS Sirius doesn't LOVE him.
5.  Sirius makes a ROMANTIC MOVE on Remus.
6.  Remus REJECTS Sirius because HE KNOWS that Sirius could never LOVE him.
7.  Remus PINES and ANGSTS and throws a PITY PARTY.
8.  Sirius makes another ROMANTIC MOVE and CONFESSES his LOVE to Remus.
9.  Remus REJECTS Sirius again because HE KNOWS 1000% that Sirius could never LOVE him.
10. Remus PINES and ANGSTS at his PITY PARTY and almost PINES and ANGSTS himself to death.
11. Sirius BARES HIS SOUL and BEGS FORGIVENESS because it's ALL HIS FAULT.
12. Remus is a SAINT and FORGIVES Sirius and allows Sirius to MAKE WORSHIPFUL LOVE to him.
13. They live HAPPILY EVER AFTER. (Until the author writes a sequel then back to STEP 1)

P.S. - Although I call this the guide to writing WOLFSTAR I'm pretty sure it fits just about any ROMANTIC fic or PAIRING that I've read in the last 20 years.

P.P.S. - Please don't take this SIRIUSLY it's just a bit of fun.

P.P.P.S. - If you think I've missed a step please let me know in the comments.


** I don't read Wolfstar but I mean this is basically Remus in canon with Tonks. Love the guy to death but his self-pity complex would get infuriating after a while.

*** I remember one fanfic had a bit part with people voluntarily obliviating eachother, because they went looking for Remus and discovered him at a certain club, and suggested that Tonks find someone else because Remus had a "Punishment complex that would violate her Auror oaths to satisfy"

** You're missing the but where Remus see Sirius go out with someone else, and uses that as proof. And then we get sirius' viewpoint and it turns out he's imagining its Remus in his arms the whole time, and then he gets angsty.

** I never understood the appeal of Wolfstar honestly, if you want to see a slah fiction with Sirius as the main pairing, just write one with Sirius/James pairing during the Marauders Era, Seeing the full worship that Sirius had for James during canon, I wouldn't be surprised that he considered James to be more than just a brother. It makes far more sense that him being with Remus.

And for the problem of respecting canon( if you want your story to respect canon) then you can write a story with a lot of ANGST where James is slowly falling in love with Lilly while Sirius is ANGSTY ANGSTY because his brother, more than just a brother, is slowly abandoning him for a woman.

*** The only Paring i've ever seen that I enjoyed with Sirius and James together was a fic that had Sirius/James/Lily as the pairing. it was cute

** Replace Remus with anyone known for inevitable emotional pining and self-doubt and Sirius with anyone that can be realistically portrayed as a "saint" and you have every romance fic in the history of ever with those kind of personalities. While postwar SSHG isn't really a pairing I particularly like, I find it decent enough (I avoid the more typical teacher/student version of that ship), but man, that ship can get stale at times for basically this exact reason. Replace Remus with Severus and Sirius and Hermione and there you have the SSHG version of it.

While my favorite Severus pairing (Snily) doesn't really follow this scheme, that doesn't make it free from issues either: authors of the ship really love their Peggy Sue, and while I like the trope, it can get a bit old at times when that's 90% of what that ship seem to entail fic-wise.

I've come to the conclusion that all ships have their own idiosyncrasies and if you can't stand the common tropes, you're unlikely to enjoy looking for fics with the ship, despite any theoretical liking of it. For example, while I really like the idea of Harry with Nymphadora Tonks, I detest the most common tropes associated with it -- particularly the "true form" clich√©, so I no longer bother looking for fics with the ship. Really, what I like the idea of is a fic where Harry gets paired with her in Auror duty (with her surviving the war) and getting closer with her as a result, ultimately leading to a romance. But I've never seen a fic like that.

*** You're right. I don't have a loyalty to any particular ship and will read just about any pairing as long as it features characters I like. Unfortunately, as you said, ships can be dominated by one particular trope or fanon and if you aren't a fan you're out of luck.

**** Basically what ruined Daphne and Susan for me. Daphne is a Slytherin, but GOOD and Susan is a nice rack which gets Harry in touch with her aunt, who solves the plot.

It would be much more interesting to have a story where those do not get along with their families.
