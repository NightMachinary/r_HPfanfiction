Its one of the top HP fics on FF in terms of favorites and follows. For me, I don't like it. It adheres to a lot of tropes, especially the bashing. The bashing feels so unbearable. Plus there's all sorts of bizarre shit, and not in a good way.

Dont even get me started on the attempted rape scenes. Id like to remind that there are THREE of them. Why though?! It just seems like unnecessary shock value. How does it contribute to the main plot?

I dont understand how its so popular.


** The only attempted rape scene I've read was the one on Fleur and it seems like a plot device to cement the relationship between her and Harry. Don't forget that in canon Fleur was rather disdainful of anything that had to do with the 'rosbifs' until she met Bill and until Harry saved her sister she pretty much treated Harry like crap. Considering how smitten Roger Davies is with her and how easily he accepts the way she shit on Hogwarts during the Yule Ball, she was probably used to just getting by without having to put in any effort. The Runestone Path scene was an easy way to make her open up to Harry earlier on.

With that being said, I think that the story, while having some cool ideas, is garbage. No matter what a character that the author doesn't like says, Harry acts like a bitch so often times I wondered whether that was a parody. The particular scene that sticks with me was when Ron invites Harry to play a game of chess and Harry just goes down on him as if he had invited him to torture puppies and kill babies.

I also think it's a power fantasy of a virgin guy (not shaming anyone but I do remember I was like that in my early teens when I was attempting to get laid just to get the whole thing out of the way) who tends to ignore male friends and only focuses on girls but he inevitably ends up friendzoned by all of them, yet in this power fantasy they somehow fall in love with him. I mean, for fuck sake, the only male friend Harry has is Neville which is the outcast of the class in canon and he only surrounds himself with beautiful women (and Hermione). That's no way a healthy boy teenager will develop in life especially if they don't have a father figure. And while being nice to the social outcast and saving a girl from potential gang rape might earn you some brownie points, acting like the stereotypical fedora wearing nice guy (bar calling them ugly bitches when they reject you because the Harry in this story never gets rejected) won't get you a harem.

Anyways I've been meaning to rant about this story for a long while but never found such a good opportunity. It has some cool ideas but overall is a power fantasy of some person who has no clue how social interactions work.

#+end_quote

There's plenty of healthy teenage boys raised by single mothers. Better than raised by fathers, even. And the same is true for single dads raising healthy daughters! Unless you subscribe to sexist stereotypes and gender restrictions, there's nothing a father figure could do that a mother couldn't also do for their son, and vice versa about dads and daughters.

**** But those teenage boys befriend other teenage boys so they learn to function as boys. Same goes for daughters raised by fathers I think but I wouldn't know since I am a perfectly functional guy raised by a single mother.

******* I have met several boys who had mostly girls as friends(some by circumstance others by option) and they are pretty normal.

And girls can also do "boy stuff" AFAIK, having just one close friend is also quite common.

I would agree the fic has weird social interactions regarding Harry and the girls but him having only one close male friend is quite normal.

******** I'm not going to fight anymore on the topic because I know reddit doesn't typically take my side on the matter... however the balance of doing things traditionally associated with the other sex are tipped in women's favor. A girl with many male friends and with tomboyish will been seen as cool, while a guy with preferences for the feminine is considered as weak and walked all over and even his girl friends mock him for it. I know redditors like to say that this is a non issue and flaunt their progressiveness but the examples I saw in real life indicate that world outside reddit is not yet ready to be so open minded about this stuff. I won't deny that there are some flamboyant guys that do the feminine things with style to the point they are perceived as charming or awesome but the Harry in that particular story is not one of them.

The 'balance being tipped in women's favour', as you call it, is due to sexism. Girl stuff = bad, boy stuff = good. It doesn't matter if it's a girl doing the girl stuff, it's still looked down upon.

You do realise that the 'I'm not like other girls' crap is just as harmful as a your asinine statement about 'preferences for the feminine'? Right? One is internalised misogyny, the other is just misogyny.

I absolutely do still have some internalised misogyny baggage, though not nearly as much as teenage me. Pretty sure everyone does no matter how hard we try to stamp it out.

No, sorry. We're pretty much damned if we do, damned if we don't. Just look at makeup! The "No-Makeup!" models that are clearly wearing several products (not that you dudes can spot it lol), and that whole swim on the first date shit. The idea that make-up is only worn for men, rather than for ourselves. And on, and on.

************ Yeah but that's a completely different topic. I will be the first one to admit I don't understand the plight of women, nor do I know how they feel when they get shamed for doing feminine stuff (which kind of sounds odd to me because women coming from cultures that encourage them to act feminine are quite sought after - see the case of Eastern European or East Asian women). The whole argument started out from the fact that I said I don't think that a guy who only has feminine influences in his life can develop as a functional man in the way society expects one to do. Just like they cannot with only masculine influences either to add to my initial statement. Research shows that children coming from single parent families are typically less socially developed than those coming from two-parent families. And no matter what we do, men who act feminine are usually perceived as weaker than those acting more masculine in most cultures of the world, while there is no such bias against women (albeit there might be a bias against women overall which is undeniable).

Sorry, no. Our society is inherently biased against women, as feminine traits and hobbies and careers are perceived to have less value than masculine ones in the western world. And that's not even touching the issues I've faced as a women with a 'traditionally male' career.

Here's some food for thought, courtesy of Jessica Valenti:

#+begin_quote
  What's the worst possible thing you can call a woman? Don't hold back, now. You're probably thinking of words like slut, whore, bitch, cunt (I told you not to hold back!), skank. Okay, now, what are the worst things you can call a guy? Fag, girl, bitch, pussy. I've even heard the term “mangina.”

  Notice anything? The worst thing you can call a girl is a girl. The worst thing you can call a guy is a girl. Being a woman is the ultimate insult. Now tell me that's not royally fucked up.

Yes. I don't know how East Asia is but my mom is a Easern European woman and she always says that, for all the crimes communism did, it still brought sexes on the same level compared to the US. I go there and women, when it comes to work, are actually treated as men's equals. So yes... I absolutely know what I'm talking about.

So what? Women also make comments about wanting a rich/stable/powerful/masculine guy. I personally think there's nothing wrong with that desire, just like there's nothing wrong with guys wanting a feminine woman.

** It's a lot of people's 'starter fic' for more 'powerful!Harry' type tropes. Same with Robst. It's not about whether it's good or bad, it's just well-known and pops up often, so people encounter it easily and go "Oooh, powerful Harry" and read it.

And generally, when you're starting out, you'll favourite and follow what you read simply because you haven't read a lot yet and everything is still new and fresh and interesting to you. When you've experienced a trope a lot and get tired of it, it becomes a cliché. Until then, it's just a trope. It's not good, it's not bad, it's just a part of a story.

And honestly, any fic that's 'shippy', sufficiently long, and completed will inevitably get a tonne of likes or comments or whatever else. It's just a pattern of the fandom.
