** Hmm...I don't know any of the sort, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/13/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][the first snippet in this chapter may interest you]].

It relies a little on having a jackass!Dumbledore, but sets up the concept that Voldemort isn't Tom Riddle at all, but is rather Abraxas Malfoy; the real Tom Riddle left Britain for a topless beach years ago, but comes back upon learning that his pseudonym is being dragged through the mud.

It wouldn't be all that ridiculous for such a snippet to continue by Tom helping to train Harry to defeat his imposter.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  AU, fifth year. A man isn't meant to see what his life would be like if he chose a different path. One man gets that chance but the horror of his choice can never be erased from his memory. Now he must decide if he is to try everything to return, or attempt to fix the universe he ended up in, even if that means killing his counterpart. Very slow divergence from canon.

** If you count the 16 year old Tom M. Riddle of the Diary as a Voldemort (I usually call him Voldebook since saying Diary!Riddle out loud apparently sounds enough like diarrhea that it made my friend giggle uncontrollably) then there's two incomplete stories out there... Given Harry's age at the time, it's less 'training to kill Voldemort' and more generalized training as of their current end chapters.

Counterfeit Cousin felt like it was headed that way before going on hiatus/being abandoned? (Tsume Yuki has a severe case of story ADD)

linkffn(10170838)

My own Magic and Mayhem is an "SI" but the 'self' part is eaten by the diary leaving a very confused Tom Riddle with my memories of the series and absolutely no interest in following the plan. It's being written in bursts whenever I burn out on my BTVS fic but it is ongoing.
