This is literally just a thought I had. I'm not really asking for it to be written, but if anyone happens to know of a story which follows a similar concept, feel free to call the bot to action.

-- EDITED because being character-agnostic made everything super confusing --

I was trying to be character-agnostic in my explanation, so maybe this will help.

Most of us are probably familiar with stories where Harry Potter is reincarnated as either a major character or the child of two major characters in another universe - this is a common entry point for fantasy-based crossovers, such as Game of Thrones.

My thought was, essentially, "Why just Harry?"

What if this form of reincarnation is something that actually happens fairly often, but anyone who freaks out and starts claiming to be from another universe is just shunned for being crazy. Perhaps because they were an insignificant character (let's use Lily Moon for this example) that no one remembers.

In this vein, what would happen if Lily Moon, knowing that perhaps being shunned as crazy is the reason people don't speak out more, claims to be someone that no one from her universe would be able to ignore: Harry Potter.

So Lily Moon claims to be the reincarnation of Harry Potter. When, in this new universe, a bunch of people come out of the woodwork in recognition of who she has claimed to be, the story begins. Do these people quickly realize she was lying (but are now exposed for also being reincarnates) or does she continue to fake it, using what limited knowledge she likely has of his life and personality?


** I have a vague idea of what you might be trying to say, but it still reads like gibberish.

*** Yeah, it's not a very easy idea to put into words.

**** I recommend taking another shot at it. Maybe it's just me, but I can't quite grasp the idea.

** Well, I assume you are looking for a reincarnation story. I have one in mind that might be interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221773/1/Unlocking-Doors][Unlocking Doors]] by LaRadium. I absolutely love this story. The concept is just so original. Basically if Regulus Black is reborn as a Weasley. In fact he is Ron's twin brother in this story. Definitely worth the read.

  Regulus Black knew he had forgotten something in the "Let's Defeat the Dark Lord" plan. Well, at least he's able to go back to the land of the living after making an agreement with the god of the underworld. But maybe he'll end up wishing he had never agreed, especially with the wild ride. [Cover image from @upthehillart]

*** Yes. The question is if anyone else has ever had this idea and written about it.

Some people mistake requests for wanting the story to be written, which I clarified at the top I wasn't necessarily asking for.
