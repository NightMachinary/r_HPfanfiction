We all know these stories where Snape learns of Harry's sad life and suddenly makes 180 turnaround, adopts Harry, forgets his hatred of James, sees only Lily's eyes in him, lot of hurt/comfort cry baby shit and somewhere there are pink unicorns and rainbows.

I am looking for a story where Snape finds out, but doesn't give a shit. He still hates Harry, he is still an ass, still belligerent, still mocks, taunts and abuses him.

For example imagine a scene where he sees Harry living in a cupboard (because he is the one to deliver the letter) and Vernon sputters how it is temporary and boy is just being punished and of course he has a room, but Snape retorts in reply how a room would be a waste of space on a good for nothing little shit like him and if he is anything like his father then a bit of humility would serve him well. And then walks off without a care in the world (and no he doesn't report his findings of abuse to Dumbledore/Molly/Merlin/Founders/Flamels/etc.)

Anything like that?


** Snape in canon did know and he seemed to be a bit amused by it. This is also one thing that ruins fics for me, it's hard to stomach Snape not being his horrid self.

i mean, the context of that is after years of negative interactions, including PoA. it's not unlikely that he'd react differently if his /first/ impression of harry was with the dursleys. coupled with his dislike of petunia, it could change their dynamic, which is what that genre of fic. explores

*** What? You want Snape to be a horrid piece of human trash that needs to die horribly?

Note: I don't like canon Snape (I think he's a brilliant character and a genius at potions, defense and probably at dark arts, too (ok: Not at Riddle's level, but still pretty badass), but I surely don't like him! I pity him sometimes, but I still do not like him!)

  Snape is Harry's father. No one is happy to hear it. [R due to colorful language, dark themes, and nongraphic violence.]

** ...so the fic. is just snape being a dick to harry? or one scene? then it'll just go like canon, with the addition of that scene. snape finds out, is indifferent, is a jerk to harry when he's at hogwarts, dies in 7th year, harry names his kid after him, etc.

******* Nothing wrong with an one-shot.

But I also think there might be room for a story here. Imagine if Harry's first contact with wizarding world wasn't warm and friendly Hagrid who put Dursleys in their place, but rather cold, hateful and cruel Snape. First impressions are everything after all. Imagine a forced shopping trip with Snape ...
