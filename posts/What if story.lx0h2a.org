When regulus black puts the sorting hat on, he hopes to be sorted into slytherin. Yet the sorting hat whispers "slytherin are you sure? Like your brother you have plenty of courage if you only showed it and griffendor would give you the chance to show that courage." Not sure if it should be a one shot that shows what happened with Regulus's sorting or an au where regulus is sorted into Griffendor.


** Walburga would have a heart attack, what with both of her sons in Griffendor

** Given that Regulus was much more willing to follow his parents' example, and Sirius apparently despised him for it, this would be /very/ interesting to see how their dynamic changes.

** Then Regulus might have the unfortunate circumstance of being a massive asshole just like his brother. That or he could be another friend for Snape who helps him against the marassholes

*** Well anything I think it was james potter that was the jerk and please no one don't "everyone in the books said he was a great man" that's a load of manure the only people to say good things about james potter were his friends, not exactly the most neutral opinions. All we know about Harry's dad is that he was a show off that like picking on slytherin and he fought against voldemort but got killed. Now does this mean he's a hero no more than relatives of heroes that die and put them on their path to being a hero.a

**** Dude I agree with all of this. I regard the books as extremely biased and fallible regarding James because the people talking about him are his best friends and they are talking to his son. Generally speaking people aren't going to talk shit about someone's dead father to their face

***** i think regulus And sirius are inherently assholes, i mean think about how they were raised. sirius definitely had to break the habit of referring to muggleborns as 'mudbloods' and his mom probably consistently mailed to him making sure he has only pureblooded friends. he probably wasn't open about it because james would shut him up but he def had racist sentiments, and probably did until the end just bc\\
of his family.

if regulus were a gryffindor he probably would be a little prick and want to be resorted, maybe even go to durmstrang bc he's closer to their parents, and walburga probably ends up accepting it solely bc they both get good grades and say they aren't friends with 'filthy mudbloods and blood traitors'.

idk why fanon make regulus so ~soft~ and ~babey~, he's like... that kid who has straight As and no real friends and when you ask his opinion about a mundane topic he says something incredibly offensive and you're like 'what the fuck this good guy is an actual nazi?? what the fuck is wrong with him, well, at least he isn't that open about it, and he's kind of cute'
