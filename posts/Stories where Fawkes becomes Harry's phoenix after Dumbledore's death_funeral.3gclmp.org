** hmm there's one where Dumbledore makes Harry the leader of the Order after his death that was all right... It was a founder mentor fic if I recall so somewhat super harry... lemme see if i can dig it up

Edit: Fair warning, this is a Super Harry fic with a lot of the sane cliches of those, however from what I remember from reading this a LONG time ago it wasn't a bad read and doesn't spend too much time and emphasis on those tropes. However I might not be remembering correctly so read at your own risk.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]] has Fawkes becoming Harry's. I won't spoiler as to why, but I will say it's late in the story. H/G(/L)

** My novella [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]] has Fawkes becoming Harry's (after a fashion). Harry's ability to command Phoenixes is the "power he knows not" and the secret to destroying Voldemort.

(Warning: somewhat squicky Harry/Molly soul bond fic.)

*** But that would be pretty neat. Or at least if Fawkes himself, or Phoenix song had came to them while they were out and about hunting horcruxes. But through that part of the story Harry doubted Dumbledore too much for Fawkes to come to their aid I think.

*** Not really, I know I've seen a couple of these, the problem is it's not usually a main plot point so it's hard to remember which ones they came from.

In HPMOR, Harry keeps asking Fawkes why he sticks with Dumbledore (when Harry is clearly morally superior because transhumanism). In the Resonance/Revolution/Resolution trilogy, after DD's death Harry blackmails Fawkes into doing stuff for him like giving him another feather for a wand and transporting McGonagall around like he used to do Dumbledore, but eh, that's all I can think of right off.

**** Transhumanism has /nothing/ to do with morality. EY at no single point portrays it as a /morally/ superior view.

Harry asks that of Fawkes because he doesn't trust Dumbledore at all - he believes Dumbledore to be the bad guy.
