Recently I've had this idea in my mind and I can't seem to let it go. Does anybody know of a fanfic where Harry, after going to the Chamber of Secrets, decides he wants to make a dramatic entrance in the Great Hall, or something similar? I don't want fanfics where there is one, but one where Harry is vain and tries to look as heroic as possible, carrying sword on his back, puffing his chest and stroking Fawkes kind of thing. Even better if Dumbledore or Snape know what he's doing.
