*** Well, if the anti-Patronus attracts Dementors, then it might actually be a useful way of luring them to somewhere they can be contained/destroyed, and away from potential victims.

Theory: A massive Dementor attraction spell was cast on Azkaban, drawing them all there. However, at some point the Dementors' need to feed will outweigh the spell's influence, so that's why they occassionally toss them a prisoner.

  After the fall of Voldemort, the students whose 7th year was so heavily impacted by the war and the Death Eater-takeover at Hogwarts have been called back to retake their last year of school. The power balances in the wizarding world are shifting, but at Hogwarts, the old alliances remain unchanged. The animosity between Slytherin and Gryffindor is as strong as ever, and while Draco is trying to restore some of the lost power and influence of House Malfoy, everyone is trying to come to terms with what happened during the war and who they are now. Voldemort may be gone, but it would be a lie to say that all is well.

** Hermione couldn't get over the fear the end of second year. It had struck her hard and with a swiftness.

Nearly every girl had been attracted for some reason toward the git Gilderoy. Someone who seemed to have a talent towards mind magic.

Someone who freely erased and changed memories to get what he wanted.

How many witches had he played with over the years? How many others did the same still?

She could honestly see Malfoy using such spells after having his fun with some unwilling girl in a few years.

She had been reading and rereading her books, anything she could get her hands on. Trying to find some form of safety in those many tomes.

Then she did, if not an island refuge it at least was a life vest in the ocean of fear.

It was theorized that all spells had counter spells. Something to reverse them or stop them in their tracks.

She wracked her mind for a bit trying to thing why that sounded familiar.

Yes, that was it! Carl Sagan had talked about wavefronts who could cancel each other out.

The exact details didn't matter as she had an idea. Perhaps she could fine the shape of the magic and invert it? Well something along those lines, she had a start.

It was her fourth year, and Harry was trapped in that horrible tournament. He had to fight a Dragon!

Not anymore, she had theoretically found a way to create a complete breakdown of a magics makeup and then could invert it to cancel it.

She borrowed Harry's cloak that night and set to work. It was at nearly 2 in the morning she finally cracked it!

Casting the spell that would invert the base enchantment holding the whole magical device together should collapse the whole thing!

Rushing off to bed she wanted to do so in the morning.

If everyone saw it breakdown then everyone would know it was over.

Harry was smarter than most gave him credit for and Hermione found herself blushing as he kissed her on the cheek that afternoon.

The tournament was canceled and he knew she had been the cause of the goblet setting fire somehow.

They had been walking hand in hand down Hogsmeade when they found themselves accosted by Professor Moody suddenly traveling to a creepy graveyard.

"Kill the spare!"

Harry screamed in defiance as a green curse sped towards Hermione, leaping into the spell to protect her.

"Wormtail you fool! CRUCIO!"

Ignoring what was happening around her she cast her diagnostic spell and read the residue of the spell.

Okay, okay, she had this come on.

There, base wave!

Inverted would be... gotcha!

"INRI"

A red light reminiscent of blood came from her wand, her desperation to save Harry far outwieghing her other thoughts.

Harry gasped and sat up, his scar bubbling as he breathed life once again.

Seeing wormtail and a demon child he cast the strongest set of stunner he could.

He wasn't sure what was going on but Hermione would explain. She was great like that.
