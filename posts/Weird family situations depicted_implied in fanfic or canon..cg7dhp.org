I'm just filling out the Ravenclaw class of '99 and I want some throwaway detail, I thought it'd be fun to have them have interesting family situations.

1) One has a half sibling from a different mom because their dad was left with two family names and had to take two wives to carry them both (v. common way to get Harry two wives in fanfic)

2) One has parents with a 100 year age difference because it's possible to stay fertile/attractive indefinitely using magic.

3) One grew up in the muggle world without knowledge of magic because both of her parents were muggleborns who responded to the first blood war by just giving up their wizarding identities as much as they could, but has gotten weird advantages in life they didn't really get were impossible such as having their bones instantly healed or having teachers strategically confunded to give them special treatment. 4) Two parents have a soul bond of the "can read each other's minds" variety so they just grew up thinking married couples can do that and have the assumption if one parent knows something the other does too. Maybe they can't date well because the bar is way too high. 5) One was the product of imperius rape of a muggle and their father was remorseful when he found out his kid went to hogwarts and is trying to be a parent now. The situation is complicated by the mom now understanding it was rape but being left with a memory of a pleasant, consensual, if out of character one night stand.

Any others?


** OH! MPREG! ONE OF THEM HAS TWO DADS AND IS PRODUCT OF MPREG

Actually this would be fun to also be the one who grew up in the muggle world. Supposedly adopted but a weirdly good match to both of his dads
