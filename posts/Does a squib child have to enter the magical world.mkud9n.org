is that a given or could they live most of their lives unaware that One or more of their parents were magical assuming they lived muggle lifestyles ?


** I think they would know their parents are magical as they would live with them for almost 2 decades.

They can and most probably do spend all of their adult lives outside the magical world. As seen in OotP, they're not worthy of notice anyway.

** Squibs are IN the magical world, because it's defined as a non-magical person born into a magical family. The question is, do squibs have to STAY in the magical world, and the answer is, "Of course not."

If they don't know they have a magical parent, they would never even know they are a squib (if they even are, as opposed to a muggle). My headcanon is that a squib is not the same as a muggle: a squib is somebody who HAS magic but can't USE it for some reason.

Squibs MUST have some magic --- or Filch could never work at the school. The muggle-repelling spells wouldn't allow him to stay. Mrs. Figg is also allowed to raise part-kneazles, which muggles would not be allowed (unless this is a bashing fic where Dumbledore doesn't care if she's breaking the law because he's her patron).

*** Well that's what I was thinking if you had half blood or muggle born parents they might not stay in the wizardihg world

** They certainly don't need to. I mean if their situation is, for example, similar to Tom Riddle who ended up in the orphanage then they wouldn't even know that one of their parents was/is a wizard (or both, but that's the same situation). They would, preferably, got adopted and it would end with that. No magical world what so ever.

As a squib they also wouldn't receive their letter to Hogwarts (if we are talking about this particular school, of course) because the quill and book, or whatever it is, write the letters only to children who are confirmed wizards (case with Neville where it wasn't sure if he was a wizard or a squib so it waited until it actually wrote the letter for him).

It's also fully up to they parents if they decide to tell him or not. They may decide to live a “normal” life without much magic if they wish so. They could, for example, think that it would be quite saddening for their child.

The only situation that comes to my mind where the child would need to interact with the magical world is a legal reason. Otherwise, the wizards simply wouldn't care about some random squib in a muggle world who doesn't even know about their existence.
