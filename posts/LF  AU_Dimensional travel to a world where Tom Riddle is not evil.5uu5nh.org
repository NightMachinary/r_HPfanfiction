Hi ! I just came across the summary of A Riddled Universe, linkffn(8678567), and I'm gonna start it soon, but the premise of it really intrigued me and made me want to look for other similar stories. Do you know of any fic where Tom Riddle did not grow into the evil Dark Lord we all know, but followed a different and lighter path (not that he must be some Paragon, he can just be a regular but smart guy) ? I'd prefer completed stories (or maybe regularly-updated ones), but apart from that, I'm fairly open to any genre. If you personally read it and liked it, and can explain why you enjoyed it (and what may have disturbed you), I would very much like to hear your thoughts :) Thank you :)


** Linkffn(rectifier by niger aquila) is the opposite- professor Riddle travels into the canon HP universe. Incomplete.

*** It's too bad that it's not complete, but it still seems interesting. I'll look into it, thanks !

**** Rectifier is great and definitely worth the read. The slow reveal on Professor Riddle's relationship with his own Dumbledore is great. Shame it ended so soon though.

  Born of a drunken one night stand rather than a love potion, Tom Riddle grew up a little differently. Family. Job. And absolutely no insane take-over-the-world attempts. Which all changes when he gets thrown into a world where apparently he grew up to be some sort of mad Dark Lord with a complex and he doesn't have any hair... Or a nose...

** Linkffn(Altered Destinies by DobbyElfLord)

This is a complete story. The author also began work on a sequel, but has not updated in almost 7 years. The first story is definitely a good enough read to stand on its own.

** Dreams and Darkness Collide has a Minister Riddle. Though I cannot say if he's lighter in this one, because I've never finished it. Just didn't have the time, not because it was not good, it's by Epic Solemnity after all. linkffn(6996054)

Also, a Riddled Universe is truly amazing!

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.
