** Here's one (gen): [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/586020]]

All Hallow's Eve - New York by WhisperingDarkness

Summary: Harry Potter had never really managed a normal, peaceful Halloween, so he really shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly displaced from the grocery store and found himself in front of a maniacally cackling man in a very dramatic outfit.

  Harry Potter is a good guy, really, but there are some lines that should never be crossed, and Nick Fury has just crossed them.

*** Heroes Assemble lost me because they started bringing in 6 million different minor characters and plotlines from the Marvel Extended Universe rather than sticking to either a comic plot or to the movies. After a few hours of trying to make sense of everything as I went along, I closed the tab in frustration and never went back. I'm sure it's good for more knowledgable folks though.

*** Heroes Assemble is decent... but only just. Just take an adult Harry Potter, plop him in the MCU, and then slavishly adhere to MCU canon BUT add a bunch of random marvel comic characters in as well. It's all right enough - it updates fast and reads well.

I want to see a Dumbledore-or-Voldemort-or-fanon!powerful!Harry dropped into the MCU-fic and watch them break it.

***** Break the whole power order of the MCU maybe?

HP magic is powerful enough to make the powers that the Scarlet Witch wields look like peanuts (she broke an Infinity stone!). The HP universe never really focuses as much on combat as the MCU so we never really see the true power of HP magic as compared to the MCU (books vs comics, basically).

Fiendfyre and the Unforgivables are just the common examples, HP magic can break conservation of energy. You can conjure, transfigure, destroy or charm things out of the way. IMO it is plausible that Dumbledore is easily on the power level of Thanos (in combat, not in the destroying half of all life area), with more experience to boot.

#+end_quote

I think the fan theory is that it's only because her power /comes/ from an Infinity Stone that she's capable of that. Similar to how Loki's scepter was able to pierce the barrier of the Tesseract in Avengers 1.

Wow, is that with or without, well, any of the Infinity Stones? I would assume without any of them, right?

  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Encompasses MCU movies & TV, some others along the way.
