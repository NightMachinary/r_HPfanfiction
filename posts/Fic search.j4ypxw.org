:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I'm looking for a good fic i read a while back. It is a dark harry and ginny fic, but he occasionally, with permission from ginny, is paired with hermione, who is also dark. i remember that at some point harry dies but not really,and ginny is sent to azkaban. i also remember a specific scene where hermione was experimenting on a cat? if anyone could find this fic it would be appreciated.
