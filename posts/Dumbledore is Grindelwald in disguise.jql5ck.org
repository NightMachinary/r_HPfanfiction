Back in 1945 Grindelwald had the elder-wand, so he could not be beaten.

But he did realize he was losing the war. So in the middle of the duel he decided to go a completely new approach.

So he killed his old friend and took over his identity. Ever since pretending to be Albus Dumbledore, leader of the light, he sets himself up in the most influential positions of society; Hogwarts, Wizengamot, ICW, and manipulates events and society from the shadows towards his greater good.

Unfortunately, in his scheming to remove the young upstart Tom Riddle (too powerful a wizard, can't allow any potential rivals!) the boy found out, and thus started a rebellion against Grindelwalds regime. Voldemorts war is not about power or rulership or anything, it's solely about destroying Gellert Dumbledore and everything he has built over the decades at any cost.

*** you could have it

that Tom was OG dumbledores student. and when grindal dumbledore won against og dumbledore

he realised riddle could be a threat so using the fact Riddle trusted og dumbledore he used his magic to slowly warp his mind after all Riddle had no reason to have his defences up with his trusted mentor

** Did you read The Black Prism recently? Because this has serious Gavin/Dazen Guile vibes.

That said, if I was to do a fic like this, that would probably be a really strong influence.
