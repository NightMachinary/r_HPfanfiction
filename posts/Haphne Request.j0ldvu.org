So I was browsing this subreddit, looking for recommendations for fics that I could read instead of doing my assignments, when I realized that the last Haphne request thread was four days ago. FOUR DAYS. Do you realize how long four days is? Four days is the amount of time a fully charged Nintendo 3DS in sleep mode stays on. Four days is the amount of time it takes for me to go from being relatively confident in my ability to not fuck up this semester to feeling like having a breakdown because having an online semester is actually terrible for my mental wellbeing AND my grade. So when I saw that it had been FOUR DAYS since the last Haphne request post I knew I had to take action.

​

Yeah so basically this post is just another Haphne request thread.

  Harry successfully manages his animagus transformation. And that's about all he's able to manage. Daphne's insistent attention seems entirely unmanageable for him and his poor heart. Slight AU.

Daphne Greengrass at a ministry party tells that famous half-blood about her immanent engagement and marriage to the new head of the house of Black, Draco Malfoy. Harry is confused.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

  James and Lily live in 1981. Harry is the real BWL but everybody thinks it's his twin, Daniel Potter. Abandoned by his parents, raised by his grandparents, he will prove they were wrong to leave him. Grey Harry. Certain Weasley bashing, Dumbledore bashing, Hermione bashing, Potter bashing. Neutral Snape. Redemption arcs to come. Harry/Daphne
