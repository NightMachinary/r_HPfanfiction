** Like... tons of them. Are you looking for one in particular?

Ride the Lightning, The Horocrux Scheme, and Forest of Dean come to mind.

There was also one that ended with Ron helping Hermione give birth during the final battle in the Tunnels under Hogwarts before he bled out while Harry was off fighting. Don't recall its name.

.... And the really sicko one that read like it was written by a 13 year old about Harry raping Hermione as she slept after Ron left in order to "Make her his". I swear, some fics should just be purged from existence.

*** I have two fics in mind when I wrote my question. I read them like at least half a dozen years ago. I can't find them now, probably already deleted. One was called dancing in the dark on ffn, I forget the author, 4 chaps, Hermione had a dead sister whom they named their child after. The other one was on ao3, 1 chap unfinished, forget the title and author, there was a scene where they had sex by the river and end with ron coming back. I've been looking for both of these on and off for years with no avail.

I realize they may not be as rare, but it's hard to look for them among at least a million combined fics on ffn and ao3, not to mention other sites I don't know about. Ffn have more h/hr fics but the search option is not specific enough.

What i have in mind is as simple as my question, preferably well written and unplanned not a ritual pregnancy. I'll appreciate whatever comes to your mind really.

**** Sorry, those don't ring a bell

Ride The Lightning and Forest of Dean are probably your best bet for this. Both are decent writing, complete, and pretty standard "H/HR get randy after Ron leaves". (There is also a one shot also called Forest of Dean with same thing)

Horocrux Scene falls into what I call "Smut Excuse" (Voldemort uses locket Horocrux to drive Harry/Hermione into lust sex, so she will get pregnant, so she will eventually leave Harry's side, so he can kidnap her to lure Harry out. One of those). Still, done better than a lot of similar setups.

(I think I ran into a few "death eater Ron" fics where the Potions run out when he leaves and h/he find out and she ends up pregnant. None of them good.

I think Vanilla was one of the sickly sweet ones that did this?

I tried searching but could not find the one where Ron bleeds out after helping Hermione give birth during the final battle, sorry.
