This could just me becoming more jaded with age. I'm not that old yet, but I am also realistic enough to know that I'm reaching a point where I have a hard time relating to teen angst and the fight to prove oneself.

I'm curious as to where all the whimsy has gone. It seems like the same tropes are searched for over and over. Harry fighting for redemption against an evil Dumbledore, Voldemort, or just society. I'm curious to know if there are any good fics out there that explore a Harry or really any character entering the magical world with aw and wonderment. It seems like lately so many stories have a more mature Harry tackling the world in ways that even most military tacticians would have a hard time following.

I guess this part rant, part query and I know not at all original.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

*** grim

That's it entirely. I'm not saying I want a cheap romance (especially with 11 year olds...eww), but it would be nice to have some not grim story. They yes there is voldemort out there, but so oftent that's all stories right about. The entire series is 1 million words give or take and not even in the ball park of some fics and if you break that down into books it looks really manageable. Rowling is Rowling yes,but she manages to world build with snarky characters (harry especially which is also missed in fics) and a whimsical first few books that slowly build with more adult themes and darker undertones as the series progresses. Yes it has issues and I have read in more times that I can count, but it's still good. Some writers the community do indeed have the skill to match a professional author and it irritates me to see what in my mind is a squandering of potential in nothing but teenage angst or creepy child Romance

** Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone is a bit hard to read, but feels fresher as a consequence. It has darkness and grittiness, and is experimental in some ways, so you might not like it, but there are some creative uses of magic that really highlight how alien and amazing it would be. For example, there's some kind of time-singularity in the castle moat that makes water move more slowly the closer to the center it is, which leads to weird behavior of the fluid. I got very pretty imagery from reading about it.

This is probably a risk, so don't get too excited, but linkffn(Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone) has been very enjoyable to me so far. Please don't bash it if you don't like it, though, different people have different tolerances for attempts at experimental writing.
