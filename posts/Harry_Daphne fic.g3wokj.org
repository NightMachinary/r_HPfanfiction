:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Harry is injured somehow and disapparates to the Greengrass home. Daphne finds him and her and her mom bring a healer in to tend to him. I don't remember what it's called and I can't seem to find it. Any help would be appreciated.

  Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG
