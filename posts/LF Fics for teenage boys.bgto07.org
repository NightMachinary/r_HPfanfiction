My teenager loves Harry Potter (probably has read the books about 20 times) and I want to introduce him to well written fan-fiction which (for now) does not include slash or smut. Looking for recommendations of fanfic with good world building, exploration of magic and adventure. No M rated fics! Thanks in advance for your help!

EDIT 25-Apr: Thanks a lot for the recommendations! Much Appreciated!


** Before I get onto the recs, I'd like to say something- /you people need to chill the fuck out./ OP said "For now." I don't know why he's stating no slash, but I can hazard a few guesses. Homosexuality is something that many young teen boys aren't fully comfortable with- /EVEN WITHOUT BEING HOMOPHOBES-/ and he may be thoughtlessly trying to help his kid avoid that discomfort. Alternatively, slash has a /slightly/ exaggerated reputation for being heavily associated with porn or borderline porn, and he may have mentally lumped the two together. Everybody chill the fuck out, stop attacking OP with barely-grounded accusations and strawmen, and let him live his life. I'll be the first to say that idgaf who you fuck or what you identify as, but it's unfair to assume that just bc other ppl don't want to read about it is bc they're homophobes. I'm ace and aro- I don't enjoy reading romance in general- does that make me a heterophobe, as well as a homophobe?

That done, the recommendations. To be blunt, I am not impressed with many of the other recs on this thread- and yes, I've read (or at least started) a fair number of them, so that's not a blind judgment. So here's three novel length, /professional quality/ series that meet your criteria- world building and exploration of magic and adventure, no smut.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]]

This one is, frankly, the lowest quality of the three. The OC is more than a little bit of a mary sue, the "Harry spends 2 years training in a time locked area" is indulged, etc etc. So why am i recommending it? Because it's /fun./ It's a good, mindless action story with great characterization and a passable plot. Harry and his gf take the war to the death eaters, and train up the other Hogwarts students to do the same. Now, it's not /100%/ clean- it's got a few mentions of cleavage, and sex is /mentioned./ But there's never anything explicit, nothing involving minors, and frankly, if the mention of cleavage is enough to put you off the story, we need to have a talk about your standards.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591125/1/The-Definition-of-Normal]]

The Perfectly Normal series is, to be blunt, the /single/ best written Harry Potter fic on the net. At least among the hundreds that I've encountered. It's a /masterfully/ written piece of worldbuilding, exploring the ideas and elements of canon- without ever leaving out a /single/ unsavory or unfortunate detail- in a realistic way, that explores the concept that the Wizarding World is literally an entire alien civilization, hidden from view. It explores the idea of their religious beliefs, their political allegiances, and their seeming independence from British government, but it also explores ideas like /why/ Muggleborns are discriminated against, or /why/ Voldemort led a rebellion in the first place, and why it was so successful. On that note, it also has /fantastic/ characterization- Voldemort is transformed from an evil, incompetent, caricature to a realistic, believable human being with reasonable goals, driven mad by his abuse of dark magic and his continued failure to accomplish those goals.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings]]

This one is a bit dark, and has a /very/ slow start, but that slow start is necessary for what I'd regard as the second best world building project in the Harry Potter fandom. The premise is, at its core, that muggles /notice/ the thousands of children vanishing every year, and a small handful of them realize there's a conspiracy. They form an organization called the Hounds- paranoid individuals dedicated to seeking wizards and figuring out what's happening. They're the teacher who noticed that little Billy never came back for sixth grade, they're the doctor who noticed that little Susan never had an appointment after she turned eleven, the next door neighbor who realized that she's not seen Franklin in six months and his parents start getting evasive whenever they're asked about him. They're the CIA agent who notices that their superiors seem unconcerned by a global kidnapping ring, the cop who notices their partner seems to be acting funny after he responded to a domestic disturbance, or the KGB member who looked a little too far into an "accidental" death. Nobody knows how old the organization is- nobody can remember. Nobody knows how many members there are- they don't tell each other. And no one member knows enough to be a threat to the whole, but they write /everything/ down. And Harry Potter, alone and on the streets, winds up being raised by a low ranking member. Yes, I waxed lyrical with this one, bc it's my favorite fanfiction ever written. Sorry if I got a bit verbose.

** I assume what your looking for is a Gen Fic. I understand why you wouldn't want a teenager reading smut fics but I don't really see what the issue of a M/M or F/F relationship would be if it is set at a Teen rating.

Regardless, one gen fic I recommend is "Oh God Not Again!" by Sarah1281

​

Summary: So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

​

I also recommend the James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert. They follow Harry's eldest son on his adventures in Hogwarts, the books are available to download in pdf and ebook format.

** Some listed here don't really say teenage boy to me, so here is my best go. (Note - a lot of these are incomplete, but still worthwhile)

*Top Picks*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] - good world building, exploration of magic and adventure all in one

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/out-of-the-night-by-raining-ink-t.14151/][Out of the Night]] - a personal favourite, removed from author on ffn, available as download/elsewhere

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]] - A Harry brought up well out of the norm but that might strike the mark

*Other good contenders*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] - humour

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection][Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection]] - Everyone needs a Slytherin Harry, there is also They Shook Hands and many others. Top pick On the Way to Greatness is M rated.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] - I would also say Lords of Magic by same author, but it's rated M. I I can't remember what would deserve M content. So perhaps I'm forgetting or a read through by yourself might clear it.

** Jeez people chill out, slash is very rarely age appropriate seeing as it usually devolves into smut of some sort. And no, the 1 in a 1000 slash fics you found, doesn't change this fact.

Changeling by Annerb is a great story to get into, with Ginny as the main character. It's mostly canon compliant with the difference that Ginny is in Slytherin. There's some romance later on, but it's not the main focus of the story.

I have heard this opinion expressed before, and it doesn't really mesh with my experience, so I did some quick research.

Of the 289,339 works tagged "romance" on AO3, 130,842 are also tagged "F/M", and 18,126 of those are explicit. That's about 13.8%.

Of the 140,050 "M/M" romance fics, 29,353 are explicit. That's 20.9%.

So, yes, you're slightly more likely to run into a smutty slash romance than a smutty het romance, but 4/5ths of it is still not going to contain any porn.

** I would hope you're reading these yourself, just to preview and be sure there's not something that crosses your own particular line of what is or is not appropriate for your child to read, since no one else here should be telling you what they can or can't handle. (unspoken bonus would be being able to share these with your son and have things to talk about with them, though I'm just more concerned about reccing something too objectionable for you)

​

Personally, I second the recommendation for Arithmancer already mentioned elsewhere in thread, does a good job of attempting to provide some level of science and explanation to the magic in the world of harry potter. I also heavily recommend the authors other story 'accidental animagus', though the downside here is that the second part (animagus at war) is not finished yet.

​

I'd like to recommend both Moratorium, and 'A Maruders Plan', but with the caveat you should either read them first, or have people who've read them a lot more recently then me double-check and verify they don't venture into unsafe territory. I deeply remember enjoying both, for the unique plots and presentations they had, but it has been a long time since I've read them.

** I'm also wondering why your child shouldn't be reading LGBTQ stories as long as they're age appropriate. Are you worried they'll turn your child gay?

That implied homophobia aside, I have some Hermione centric reqs.

​

The Arithmancer by White Squirrel

Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/]]

Note: eventual Hermione/George but if I recall correctly there's no smut. Romance is not the focus of the story.

​

Keogh by Chelle

An unexpected connection is found between Hermione and Professor Snape, but that's only the start of her headaches. Being her father's daughter is one thing. Being her mother's daughter is something else entirely.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3962879/1]]

Note: Eventual Hermione/Cedric but no smut. I loved this story for its world building which included aspects from a different series of books. The story is unfortunately unfinished.

​

Indigo Autumn: A Novella by JayRain

Hermione has never talked about her life before Hogwarts, or why she was so quick to turn her back on the Muggle world. But one night after 6th year she decides to tell Harry and Ron everything.

** Why not LGBTQ inclusive/focused stories? Have you ever considered the fact that your precious "teenager" might be gay, or bi, or trans, even? There's no issue there; gay people don't make a story "M" rating.

*** Harry Crow is... not great. The characterization is inconsistent and /horribly/ OOC- especially for children- the plot is hackneyed and cliche, most of the characters are flanderized to hell and back, and the romance is frankly garbage. it's /not/ what I'd recommend to getting someone started in fanfiction. Once somebody is established into the hobby and more open minded, sure. People have different tastes and once upon a time I enjoyed that fic too. But starting people off, I try to give them novel quality or higher.
