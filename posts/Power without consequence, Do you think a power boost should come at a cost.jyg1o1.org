** A bit of a complex dilemma. Yes, I think that crazy power boosts without any consequence is horrible for the stakes of the story, but what exactly would you deliver for a downside when it comes to magic? Magical exhaustion could be a thing, but if Harry is already wiping the floor with his opponents before the aftermath can kick in, then is it truly a downside that matters? The same issues arise with something like “lowering their lifespan” or whatnot, it means nothing unless we can see direct consequences. One of the more interesting ideas I've seen is that using dark magic corrupts the mind, which makes sense and has long lasting consequences regarding a character's growth and development, but then you run into the issue of potentially alienating your audience. It's really difficult to introduce real downsides to these power ups, which is why the best thing I can think of is to either not include these boosts at all, or to make it so both sides are gaining power equally. After all, if you give Harry Potter a lightsaber, you have to give Voldemort the Death Star.

*** If Harry can for example use wandless magic then perhaps he has trouble trouble with the more precision based wand magics.

If he becomes a vampire then yes he gains the powers of a vampire like shapeshifting and immense strength but he loses his ability to use active magic.

I don't think Voldemort needs to be made more powerful just less of a cartoon villain like he is in the books, He's still the most powerful wizard of his generation.

**** Agreed on your proposed nerfs, but for let's consider the following for your last point: Voldemort is not the only person Harry has to deal with. Give Harry several titles? Give Lucius the Minister. Bring Sirius back early? Make Bellatrix break free too. While I like the idea that the end confrontation has to be between Harry and Voldemort, there's still plenty of other antagonists that can be used up till that point, all of which can be made more legitimate threats. The only time I'd say Voldemort specifically should be buffed is in time travel fics, where it can be so much more interesting to have Voldemort with memories intact, or bring back a future version to deal with on top of the present day one, which I think was being done in the story I'm Still Here by kathryn518

***** Bellatrix has never been that interesting to me but Lucius as the main antagonist in a political Harry story could be very interesting. Unfortunately most political stories just have Harry using a bunch of BS laws that for some reason only benefit him.

The best way to make voldemort a threat is to make him smarter, Have him back as his former self without the Horcrux based insanity.

** Not necessarily. Could be cost, sure, but if you wanna have problems inbuilt in your magic itself, there are plenty of options like:

- Weaknesses - eg. the spell absolutely requires hand-motions that you can't do if you're tied up or lacking hands.
- Intrinsic Effects - eg. magic is really powerful and power corrupts and being able to change reality on a whim makes you a lazy bastard with no imagination
- Limitations - eg. magic can't make love or can't create anything original.
- Side-effects - eg. you cast too much magic and your body starts to change and mutate.
- Requirements - eg. you have to do the thing at the right time in the right way to make it happen properly.
- Random Consequences - eg. really powerful magic has more of a chance of random shit that you don't intend just sorta happening without your input and outside your control.
- Consequential conflicts with something else - eg. casting the Blood Magic spell opens you up to possession by spirits.
- Understanding and Assumptions being completely wrong - eg. could assume that vanishing sends items into unreality, only to find out its actually turning them into anti-matter and blowing chunks out of the poles which is causing global warming.
- Ethical, Cultural, or Philosophical Limitations where people choose not to do things even if they have the ability to - eg. "I'm a third wave post-radical charms master, I can't go around 'conjuring' all the time like a street magician!"

And definitely a tonne more that I'm forgetting. There's a lot more variety to those problems than just cost. Plus, you can also have your characters undergo personal problems stemming from the magic. eg. If a character has really powerful fire magic and they burn someone alive, they could be understandably hesitant to use that magic again.

But yeah, I'm a big believer in Sanderson's Second Law. The limitations and problems of a system are so much more interesting than the abilities. Yeah, a powerful magic system looks cool in special effects, but it's completely boring in plot and character. Story arises when people can't just do things with a wave of a funky-lookin' stick and have to actually struggle to make things happen. And I'm sure everyone who's ever struggled with something in their lives will tell you that there's a million different ways life makes things a struggle. To cut a long ramble short, yes you should have something to make efforts a struggle, and there's a metric fucktonne of options to use to do that.

** My headcanon is that magical ability is basically the limit of the caster's imagination. Think like 1984 - if the word does not exist, how can you think of rebellion?

We /never/ saw any theory on how magic fundamentally works in the books, all we know is that

- there are some wizards who are prodigies at certain subjects (Potion Master Snape) and some that end up as Dark Lords or otherwise extremely powerful (Dumbledore, Peverell brothers, Merlin, Flamel)
- for a successful cast, wand movement and spell pronounciation (wingardium leviOsa) matter - but only initially for the first years, since wandless and silent magic exist
- the quality of education is... questionable, both in terms of broadness (where's stuff like politics/sociology and biology? why is muggle studies optional?) and quality of the teachers (Snape's favoritism, Binns being a ghost who doesn't even realize that, Lockhart being a totally incompetent fraud, Dolores Motherfucking Umbridge being a Death Eater in mind if not in mark)

What if spells and wand movements are just a tool to help focusing and directing one's magic? What if children are implicitly kept dumb / away from reaching their true full potential so that they can't even think that they essentially carry a portable tiny nuclear bomb in their hands (=the 1984 reference)? What if Dumbledore, Voldemort and Grindelwald are the few Enlightened who discovered that, literally, "the sky is the limit" either by chance or by not being constrained by their parents/teachers in what to believe to be possible (Voldemort is a halfblood, Hermione who's shown to be pretty powerful is Muggleborn and Harry grew up with Muggles)?

** A downside to having immense power could be an inability to control it. Perhaps when Harry's emotions heighten, control over his magical power falters and one of his allies gets caught in the crossfire. Then he would have to undergo rigorous mental training to not let his emotions get the best of him in a heated situation. It would present a interesting dilemma if Harry has the power to defeat Voldemort yet if he becomes emotionally compromised, all bets are off.

** I read a fanfiction where enhancing your strength with a ritual took away your ability to taste sweetness. Another ritual of enhancing your eyesight in one eye made the other severely nearsighted. Perhaps if Harry had too much power, he'd barely be able to control it, so sometimes it comes out a little, and then it explodes. Maybe the magic would take a toll on his body, and his body would be more worn out, so his prime comes sooner, and ends faster, so Harry has to battle aching joints and gets very tired if he uses magic too much. I think it'd make sense.

** If you want harry to be powerful have someone who can match him and exploit his weaknesses making him have to grow to beat his enemies. Could be Voldemort or someone new doesn't really matter just has to be someone strong and smart enough to be able to reliably beat harry. Also another way to make it work is give harry mental problems or something like someone close to him died and he never got passed it or as I mentioned before with someone new. This new person and him where good friends and close as sibling and they betrayed him and tried to kill him. Giving him an emotional problem to over come. Wbwl story's do enough emotional problems for harry as long as the bashing isn't overdone and they see their faults he sees his and they forgive each other. They might not have to like each other just not hate the other.

Story's where hes just powerful from some test the goblins did and Dumbledore's manipulating him and he just beats evryone up is boring

Harry's got to have something to work past could be motional, physical, troubled past, ect. Also he cant recover from it in the the first quarter of the fanfiction.its got to be a recurring problem through out the fic that he may never fully solve but solve enough to get the story done.

** In my fic, Harry is OP! but has a major limitation - he is basically always giving off 'ambient magic', meaning he can't use wands (they explode as soon as he tries to channel magic through them), can't fly a broom (it goes wonky, a la Neville's in their first flying lesson), can't brew potions (giving off magic messes with the brewing process), and sucks at Herbology (magical plants react negatively to him). Basically, all he can do is Transfiguration, and he does it *really really well*, but still is shut out from most other magic.

Having a superpowered protagonist with no limitations can get pretty dull.
