Someone on the Methods of Rationality mentioned a fanfic called Black Pawn, and that it's located on SB, but I have no idea what SB is and I can't find it on google, does anyone have a link?

**** Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity, Anonkun, and Suptg all have some really solid shit. All of them together only have a fraction of what's posted on FFN, but by and large their stories are of a much higher quality than what you usually see. Make sure to check out quests, as well. I've been participating in a few of them for years.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

***** Only up to about chapter 77 or so - on FFN the story is continued as a sequel after that, but I think the author switched to updating only on SB a few months back.
