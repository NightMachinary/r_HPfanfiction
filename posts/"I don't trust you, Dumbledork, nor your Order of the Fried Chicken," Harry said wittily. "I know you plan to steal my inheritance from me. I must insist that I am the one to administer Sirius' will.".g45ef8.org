  "I don't trust you, Dumbledork, nor your Order of the Fried Chicken," Harry said wittily. "I know you plan to steal my inheritance from me. I must insist that I am the one to administer Sirius' will."

  Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "I am glad you are taking such a keen interest, Harry. Now, first we must register Sirus' death with the Ministry. Since you wish to be in control of the process, I leave that to you." He handed Harry a series of forms as thick as Hogwarts: A History.

  "Next, we identify Sirius' assets and debts," Dumbledore continued, pointing Harry towards several boxes full of loose papers. "Alas, Sirius did not keep a very organised system of accounts... it may take some forensic accounting to figure out his exact financial position, but again, I trust you will see to this, Harry."

  "The third step is to calculate the outstanding tax which is due, including inheritance tax, and declare that amount to the Ministry," Dumbledore said. "The calculations are complex, I'm afraid, especially for one who has never studied Arithmancy... but I'm confident in your ability."

  Harry swirled his glass of whisky, raised his eyebrow and smirked. "Maybe I'd have been better at it, if Ron hadn't been ruining my education by making me choose to spend my time having fun instead of studying," he said, completely reasonably.

  Dumbledore merely raised a bushy eyebrow. "No doubt, my boy. In any event, the next step will be to apply to the Wizengamot for a grant of probate, which will cause Sirius' assets to vest in you, giving you control over them. The application is complex and involves quite an onerous oath, but I can see you're committed to doing this."

  Dumbledore handed Harry yet another pack of papers marked /Application for Grant of Probate/. "Now remember, Harry, you must take steps to preserve the value of the estate. If you fail to do so, you are in breach of your duties and can be sued by the beneficiaries of the will for failing to take proper care of the assets."

  "The next step," Dumbledore continued, "is to pay off Sirius' debts, as well as the inheritance tax to the Ministry, which must be done before his assets are distributed. You'll want to investigate whether Sirius had any life insurance to cover his debts, else this could easily eat up a large portion of the estate."

  "Fine," Harry said. "That's it, then?"

  "Indeed," Dumbledore confirmed. "Finally, you may distribute his assets. Of course, you had better hope that the will is absolutely clear, and that you have done all the preceding steps correctly, because if not, those assets can be tied up for decades in legal disputes. I am sure several of Sirius' relatives will be waiting to pounce on the first sign of an error. Well, good luck!"

  Harry stared at the mountains of paperwork in front of him. He was beginning to regret insisting on being the one to control the distribution of Sirius' assets. It would have been so much simpler if he could have just attended Gringotts and have a goblin read out the will, which would take effect immediately. But that would have been ridiculous. The world didn't work like that, and no reasonable person would think it would.

**** If I was going to describe real court proceedings I'd need only one word: tedious.

Even if the subject matter is juicy as all get-out, it's tedious. I mean, sure, I could write an accurate court proceeding fic but no bugger'd want to read it. It's un-canonical anyway, all the court proceedings we see in the actual books are flat-out kangaroo courts. Which are much more fun, provided you're not the defendant.

Probate is even worse: I passed the exams in order to qualify, just like I did for conveyancing, but I'd have gnawed off my own leg to avoid doing either in actual practise. The eight months of it I had to endure as part of my traineeship was bad enough.

** Look, that's why I always go with the part of the Will being made a magical contract that automagically accounts for the goods and properties under the purview of Gringotts(who are contractually and magically obligated to be fair, even if they do their best to get around stuff) due to intent and somatic components that go into magic.

I would love a Solicitor!Harry story, but bureaucratic legal stuff(especially in the UK who outright admits their system can be confusing) would take a long time to explain and would be utterly boring for most people, so the writer would have to focus only on that.

That's one easy way I don't blame a writer taking.

"But why Gringotts? They are /only/ a bank", Look in the milenar history of wizards, they have changed governments and names, but the bank is still the same, and if you can make the Goblins be minimally fair, they are your best hope for a neutral party that can't be bribed or influenced by your rivals.

About taxes, I sincerely doubt a society ruled by a millenary magical aristocracy would pass laws to severely tax their descendants, I see them taxing business and transactions much more while making sure certain parties get a reduction or outright exemption. Canon Ministry for me didn't look to me to have that much power by itself(as in without certain people's support)

** All this demonstrates to me is how horrible bureaucracy is at handling inheritance. Having recently gone through this (five years and going for my mother --- and the will is completely equitable and unchallenged), I can only nod in agreement, that this is how the Ministry would do it.

It is also 98% unnecessary and, by the way, 0% tax should be due in a inheritance. That's not, and never has been the government's money, (and it's all been taxed at least once anyway). Fortunately in fiction, you CAN have the goblins do it. They'd certainly be more fair than any human government.

  "Mr Potter, as executor of Sirius Black's will, do you agree to hand the distribution of his estate to the jurisdiction of Gringotts Bank?"

  Harry smirked at Lucius Malfoy, who had been amusingly silenced by the goblins. "Absolutely," he said. "I'm sure Malfoy here has all sorts of plans to rob me of my inheritance, if I go through the Ministry. Far better to seek Goblin justice."

  Lucius Malfoy could only watch in horror as Harry signed the jurisdiction agreement with the goblins, no doubt thinking of all the schemes Harry had just foiled.

  "Excellent," Griphook said, looking at the signed contract. "Everything seems to be in order. Let us proceed to the distribution of Mr Black's assets."

  Harry nodded, already pleased with his decision. The Ministry would have taken months with this, but the Goblins were proceeding directly to distribute the cash. He'd be rolling in it by dinner.

  "Our records show that Mr Black's estate consists of five million galleons," Griphook continued, looking at a scroll full of numbers. "This gold, as you know, was minted by Gringotts for wizards to use. In accordance with goblin law, following the death of its wizard custodian, it will now revert to the ownership of its creator, Gringotts Bank." He paused, a cruel grin stretching across his lips as he looked at Harry's horrified face. "I believe that concludes our business."

  Harry stared in disbelief as the Goblins left. What had just happened?

  "Potter," Lucius growled, the charm which had been silencing him removed. "You're a fucking idiot."

No, like any person can reach an agreement with anyone anywhere that their dealings will be governed by a set of rules that they mutually agree upon, in this case Goblin law.

In England I can agree with someone that our dealings will be dealt with under United States law and the courts will enforce that. In Singapore people can agree that their dealings with be governed by English law and the Singaporean courts will enforce that.

The idea that people can agree upon the rules governing their relationship is incredibly normal and would not "start a war".

The premise of the above snippet is that Gringotts is within wizarding jurisdiction and is governed by wizard law, not Goblin law (because the Goblins keep losing their rebellions). But that does not preclude an idiot from coming to a private agreement with the Goblins that their individual relationship will be governed by Goblin law rather than wizarding law. That has no impact on any treaty; it's a private agreement and the consequences are the individual's own fault. No precedent is set, and the consequences pose no threat to other wizards.

"Minted coins don't count as 'Goblin-Made items', as they are not unique and bulk casted."

That's how treaties work. Even if I entered Goblin jurisdiction, they would still have to follow that. According to treaty. Doesn't matter if I'm willingly in their jurisdiction.

And seriously, if any Goblin pulled that for Galleons? They would be laughed at. They are literally cheapening the real Goblin-Made artifacts that that whole spiel was really made for.

There's loads of difference between goblin-made items like a sword, or tiara and currency. The sword and tiara are products. Currency is exactly that, currency. And the currency is highly likely to be made *because of a treaty*. That distinction is highly probable to be made there.

It could potentially cripple the economy? There's no way those coins are going back out into circulation. The coinage is literally the currency for the British Wizarding world.

******* Well, physical currency is usually considered to be owned by the state. Keeping money in circulation is probably a function of the treaties between the goblins and the Ministry.

*** This seems like an odd place to complain about the politics of having an estate/inheritance tax - but there are reasons to have such a tax such that saying "It's not the government's money" is a poor argument against it. Not everyone /likes/ having the idea of massive inherited wealth, which an inheritance tax helps to curtail.

For the bureaucracy, it's only a thing because it's been necessary. Sure, in the majority of cases where it's not a problem, it'll seem onerous - but in the cases where it does get disputed? Some families get /nasty/ over things like this. My mom won't speak to a quarter of her extended family partly because of the way that they cared solely about getting the maximum share of their inheritance as possible. I would see that being dialed up to 11 in certain pureblood families. And so you need a process to go through and resolve things in a fair manner, particularly when everyone has portable weapons (ie, wands).

**** “Not everyone likes having the idea of massive inherited wealth, which an inheritance tax helps to curtail.”

What ideas everyone likes or dislikes are irrelevant. If I spend my life earning a fortune or building a business (big or small) and choose to leave it to my children, that is my right as a human being. The government taking even a portion of it is theft, plain and simple. No one will ever convince me otherwise. (And this is not the forum for debating it, as you alluded to.)

As to the “bureaucracy”, I think you mean the probate process. Although calling it bureaucratic in the very worst meaning of the term is not far off. In my case, I am one of seven children, and my mother had a very meager estate, left to the seven of us equally. We are a close family, and no one really argued about anything. And yet the entire process, as I said, has just passed the FIFTH anniversary of my mother's passing, and still isn't finished. There is no possible reason for it to take that long in an uncontested inheritance. I perfectly understand how it is the key to some sort of fairness in a contentious situation, and as you point out, in the case of Sirius's passing you couldn't get a more textbook case of “contentious and disputed”. But in our non-magical reality, it is dispiriting when it's not contentious and yet this long; it's just a case of lawyers getting their pound of flesh.

***** So I work for a lawyer that specializes in estate planning, probate, and trust admin and I am deeply sorry you have such a shitty lawyer, OR that someone is fucking with yall. So the federal estate tax exclusion is $11.58 million this year, and five years ago was still pretty large coming in just over $5 million, so anything that would qualify as meagre is gonna be under that and for an estate under that, an uncontested probate should take about a year tops. The things that drag out probate are things like arguments between heirs, missing heirs (though really, a competent lawyer should be able to handle those within the year anyway), creditors claims, or issues with how the inheritance interacts with disability benefits, stuff like that. If yall are fucking around five years in with none of that going on, yall need to ask the executor/personal representative/whatever your state calls the person handing the estate to fire the hell out of their lawyer and hire someone competent. AND, even if there are complications, a competent lawyer should still have kept yall informed of what the holdup is and unless it's literally something like waiting for a determination of disability where you're on the social security administration's timeline, there's no good reason for an uncontested probate to still be going.
