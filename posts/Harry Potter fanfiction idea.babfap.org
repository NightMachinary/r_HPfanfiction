I'm currently working on a story. I'm a couple of chapters in. It should be a mix of drama, humor, and adventure. The idea is that thanks to the prophecy, Harry and Voldemort are equals powerwise or at least at the final showdown would be. It would go on through the seven years of school, with slightly more character interaction.

Harry, is abused a similar amount as in canon. So no cigarette burns, but is forced to do an inordinate amount of chores, is slightly underfed, and is neglected. No Lordships, economy breaking gringotts vaults, stupid inheritances, or friendly goblins (so many things wrong with that).

The premise is that Harry, once he gets to Hogwarts, shows skill in the wanded subjects similar to a young Tom Riddle. Instead of having just Ron and Hermione as a trio, he'll have more friends with slightly less close relationships. Hermione becomes an academic rival/sounding board. Ron becomes a strategist and more magical talent than canon. Neville becomes a fount of culture knowledge. Dean gets a larger, currently undetermined role.

A Hogwarts that has a higher quality education than canon. Perhaps Mathematics and English as mandatory until OWLs, with correspondence allowed for further education. A few more electives than canon, such as dueling, enchanting, warding, and healing, with ancient runes being a language course and arithmancy being numerical prediction. Magic will either be somewhat quantified, a la core, or simply put as people being better conduits. A power difference will occur. The killing curse will be nerfed.

Horcruxes and Hallows exist, but perhaps aren't the only things of their kind, with the elder wand not being the only "super" wand in existence. Such artefacts can be created. The whole death gave them never sat well, although, curses would seem interesting. I'll try to reference common mythos. I'll also limit the effect of the elder wand. So instead of making a person unbeatable, it simply increases power slightly and decreases cost.

Dumbledore is supportive, but slightly out of touch as a slightly old man. He'll try to manipulate the kids, but in a good way. McGonagall is about as supportive as in canon, but gets a wakeup call. Snape is neutralized early in the series. I'm still undecided on his motivation, but his past remains relatively unchanged. Voldemort is saner. Harry Horcrux will not be resolved with a killing curse to the face.

Pairings will probably be avoided, or at least as ephemeral as most teenage romances are. Hermione isn't some sort of Mary-sue, with her weaknesses being a slight lack in imagination as well as a bossy nature as well as occasional clashes involving grades. Ron will be jealous, but it will be due to something Harry accomplishes rather than a murder attempt. It will help him in the long run. Neville will be shy as well as have a lack of confidence, however, his as well as anyone else's legacy wands will be dealt with. I might try for a couple of nice Slytherins, but for the most part the house will be unpleasant.

I think, part of philosopher's stone as well as the chamber of secrets are relatively immutable, but the other years will involve a foreign exchange program. The triwizard tournament exists but will not be the same. So thoughts?


** If you follow the same stations in canon, I won't be interested, and especially NOT if your smart/powerful Harry still gets stunned by Wormtail in the Graveyard.

Also, if there's ever a repeat of CoS, the Basilisk should kill, instead of the super lucky sequence of 6 petrifications.

Otherwise, your idea looks good, but please use paragraphs whenever necessary.

*** My idea is some events needs to be fixed. The philosophers stone will be in the school first year, the diary will be unleashed second year, the Triwizard is being organized, as all those events are independent of Harry. The way all of them resolve however... The chamber of secrets needs to be done properly. I need to justify why Tom Riddle only killed 1 person for instance 50 years ago. I'm not adverse to killing people though. but there must be a reason why no one suspected a basilisk.

**** Fair enough.

I harbor great dislike for canon CoS plot, because that either assumes Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore or Idiot!UselessAdults!PlotDevice!Dumbledore. Both options are bad. Let's just consider this:

1) Dumbledore was very certain that Hagrid was framed.

2) Dumbledore had to know the ghost of the murder victim, Myrtle Elisabeth Warren, was haunting that particular bathroom.

3) Dumbledore could ask only a few basic questions to identify the true culprit and the entrance to CoS:

#+begin_quote
  "Please tell me Miss Warren, what actually happened before you died?"

  "I heard a boy hissing near that sink, and I went there looking. Then I saw a pairs of big yellow eyes, and I just died."
#+end_quote

This is not some highly sophisticated detective work, this is the most basic common sense. I even heard excuses that because she haunted a girl's bathroom, men could not go in to investigate. LOL, I mean what a fucking moron and negligent shit head do you have to be if you let such triviality impede a MURDER INVESTIGATION?

4) Now if Dumbledore asked and Myrtle absolutely refused to talk, multiple times even, then the canon plot had a little bit more excuse. But not by much, because the monster was called the SLYTHERIN'S MONSTER. What was Slytherin's symbol? A snake. What was Slytherin's specialty? Parselmouth. What was the King of Snake? The Basilisk! And what killed people without trace? The Basilisk!

See, the all wise and super intelligent Albus Dumbledore should at least be able to make this almost basic logic deduction, right?

5) Therefore, if the Dumbledore you are writing is not of the Evil!Manipulative!GreaterGood type, you need to assume he knows it could be a Basilisk down there, and he would take immediate actions after the first attack, such as flooding the castle with roosters.

6) Finally, petrification in Basilisk attacks is the exception, not the norm. To get 5-6 petrifications is either a chain of extremely lucky events or Tom Riddle intentionally avoids killing.

***** That's the issue! It's canon it was luck (also may have been the last time Harry used his brain in canon). Although, I don't know why chamber of the secret fics have a Hagrid that gets exonerated. I like the character, but damn he had a man-eating spider.

****** Pretty sure people forget that part because of how nice hagrid is and because all the trouble came because hagrid was decided to be the heir of Slytherin and the baby acrumantula was apparently his Slytherin monster.

I personally use this one, bullet points can be added with a * , add a space, and then type whatever you need.

** You indicated that that the fic is going to be adventure, so I think you need to outline the plot itself, and not just the ways you would improve Hogwarts and canon in general. You've got your characters covered, but what will actually happen? What is the story going to be about? If you are going to follow stations of canon, having Maths and English and Dueling and Enchanting electives won't save it from being a boring story. You cannot avoid dealing the philosopher's stone, but you can deal with it differently or introduce some completely new conflicts. There's even less reason for CoS plot to stay the same. Maybe Harry is the one who ends up with the diary? Or Malfoy gives it to another Weasley? Or doesn't give it away at all due to some events in the first year? Surprise your readers.

You can introduce absolutely any change you want, but it must serve the story. Even when you are adding a new elective, don't add it just because Hogwarts students need to know warding, for example, but think how you can use it to further you plot or develop your characters.

Having Harry be friends with more people might make it harder for you, because now you have to juggle a bigger cast. Remember that you need to have character arcs for all your important characters, and not only have Neville there so he could provide exposition about wizarding customs.

*** I appreciate the criticism. Barring certain events in canon, I'll try to do it as I go along. I am a bit worried about the relationships between Harry and the crew. Maybe I'll mimic the death eaters with close friends = inner circle.

**** Whatever works for your story. If your Harry is his canon self, only powerful, I think he would still have more or less equal relationships with his friends, but if you are changing his personality as well, inner circle idea certainly has its merits.

Good luck with your fic!

***** Harry in canon leads well despite having leadership thrust upon him. Symbolism and parallels I think are important. That being said, I don't like the canon relationship. Ron leaves and is forgiven, Hermione runs roughshod over the two with good intentions. I like a Hermione that looks out for the reckless behavior, maybe helps a bit with time management, a Ron that lightens the mood, but will always defend Harry, and a Harry that will always help his friends. I want a trio that will compare to Dumbledore, Bellatrix, McGonagall, Voldemort, Snape, etc.

** It actually sounds like a very simple, yet very interesting idea. I would read it. I think it will come down to how you execute it and characterization. I have a huge fan/critic of characterization so it would have to be done correctly, but from the way you seen to actually analyze the characters it seems like you would do well in that aspect.

Can't really say much that hasn't already been said, link the story when you've posted it and I'll give it a read and a review one way or another.
