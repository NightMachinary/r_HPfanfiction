** This is my current fave.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/25/]]

A Marauders Plan. It's really well written and no bashing of Dumbeldore or Weasleys. (There are issues with Dumbeldore, Ginny, Ron and Molly but they're all realistic and canon complient with their characters. You also understand where they're coming from and its dealt with in an adult manner) It is H/Hr but it's all through fourth years so not OTT

** Have you read the Alexandra Quick Series? Its one of the best there is IMHO, and [[http://inverarity.livejournal.com/][Inverarity]] swears that he is still working on the fifth book.

**** It is entirely original series set within the Harry Potter universe (Harry Potter himself is never mentioned in the entire series). It takes place in America and follows Alexandra Quick who is a far more proactive character than Harry is. Inverarity's version of Wizarding America is by far the best developed setting that I have ever encountered in fanfiction. Rowlingesque is the only adjective that I use to describe it. You can find the entire series on fanfiction.net and a couple of other sites, or you can download them as ebooks from the author's website.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Here is a link to the first book]]

#+begin_quote
  The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

*** Started reading Delenda Est off of this recommendation. Holy shit its good. The writing is just so much better than 99.999% of fanfiction, it's refreshing. The authors avoid any character being super powered. I second this recommendation wholeheartedly.

**** Well the author has a certain way of writing and that stays the same throughout the story, but I didn't like the conversations with the vampire much either and enjoyed the story as a whole nevertheless. I'd read a few more chapters to see if you like the interaction between the HP characters and Harry; I preferred those parts to Harry's conversations with OCs.
