I don't really see why he's always negatively portrayed, his main thing is connecting students with great potential to successful alumni and bragging about it.\\
It seems to me like he does a lot of good and potentially could help mend some off the divide between Hogwarts houses. He's definitely more useful than the 1 career counselling meeting Harry gets 2 years after picking his electives.

But every story i read portrays him as a horrible person, either because people think there is something wrong with networking, blaming him for poor little Snape becoming a monster or they make him out to be a horrible person or even a paedophile.

You'd think writers would at least use him to bring in cool new characters/ opportunities

#+end_quote

If you replaced the head of Slytherin with ANY non death eater, the divide would close by a lot. Snape did a lot of damage being an incompetent, unfair, and overtly biased teacher.

You can quote lines and events about how Snape was a good guy until the end of time. He shouldn't have been allowed near kids.

*** honestly, him being Neville 's boggard should clue in even someone like Mcgonnagall.. Also some fics bring this up, but the damage he did to Auror and healer recruitment should get him a death eater employee of the month award in perpetuity.

** I agree with you OP! While he does go for famous people first he also recognizes talent - so Slug club would actually be a great opportunity if you're a talented muggleborn, and networking works.

I would also like to see more about his teaching, which is presumably better than “here are the instructions, make this potion”(though I'm unsure if he was actually that much better than Snape since Harry still outshines everyone with Snape's old book).

Yes he did tell Tom Riddle about Horcruxes, but we know that Tom at school was very charismatic and none of the other teacher noticed he was a little psycho either. It's not like he did it intentionally. His own knowledge of horcruxes shows us that not everyone who knows about them wants to make them - he must just be very knowledgeable and could see the same in his students.

** Only one I can point to is a minor element / single scene of a longer story: The old favorite linkffn(Faery Heroes) has a Slughorn that genuinely cares about his students, and even did what he could to undermine Tom Riddle from behind the scenes (as a true Slytherin would, rather than trying to go after him with a wand like a Gryffindor).

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** In addition to representing the "Old Boys' Club" you could also say he's a "you speak so well" type of racist. He gives off that vibe when Harry first meets him. And, lastly, if the Boy Who Lived is your main character there's only so much he can do for him.

Have never come across this, but this is weird when Tom Riddle is right there. I can see both Slughorn and Dippet turning a blind eye to everything Tom did, but Snape is an odd one.

I can't remember any names but I got the vibe that most marauder era fics have Dumbledore enabling the bullying behaviour of the marauders and Slughorn doing nothing to help Snape (as opposed to other slytherins) because he isn't rich or famous and he already has Lily as his pet minority or something

MOST of the marauders And Lily rank higher than Snape does in Slughorn's hierarchy. Purebloods, good at what they do, friends with all sorts of people, rich. And then you have Snape. The poor as shyte anti-social stalker who reminds you of the Unsubs from Criminal Minds.

I laughed, and then realised I was laughing and felt bad. And then I realised it was true: Intelligent, talented, beautiful, and high chances of being connected to Potter. Tack on the challenge of being a minority based on blood status AND a woman? It makes him look good to the muggleborns, to the halfbloods, to the light families, the neutrals will be alright with it. And the dark families? They will grudgingly accept it because she has use and can contribute.

And voldemort supporting families? They can go bugger themselves. That, and they weren't technically around openly back then.

** It's unfinished with /long/ gaps between updates, and he doesn't appear for a while since the fic starts in fifth year, but linkffn(The Merging) has my personal favourite Slughorn in fanfiction. Granted, the author's kinda changed his character, in an arguably whitewash-y way, but I'd argue that it's more so a response to Rowling's concerted effort to make every Slytherin who appears some degree of bigoted.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
