In evil or manipulative Dumbledore fics McGonagall usually has two opposite stances. She's either one of the first to call him out and actively work against him (openly or without his knowledge) or she is one of his most ardent followers finding every excuse she could for him. Witch option do you prefer/would go with if you were to write such fic/find more plausible and in-character for McGonagall? And what's your opinion on McGonagall in general?


** Canonically speaking, she'd put up an initial fuss, but follow his plan in the end. I imagine she objected to many of his decisions over the years, but, like in the very first chapter, she ultimately followed his lead.

These lines, which are within a page or two of each other, sum it all up.

  “You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter, as quickly as you can!”

  “Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle ---”

  “You're acting on Dumbledore's orders?” she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.

  “We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named while you search for this --- this object.”

** I think she would agree with some of his decisions but definitely not all of them. She does have a very strict sense of what is good and bad. See, canon Snape accepted the idea that Harry had to die in the end, although he was shocked; I really don't think McGonagall would have put up with such a thing. So my answer is closer to the idea that she would confront him...

Argh who cares 'cause manipulative ffction Dumbledore is usually so dumb! I can't wrap my mind around any character that would've sided with him.

*** Here's the thing though: in canon, whether she agreed with Dumbledore or not, she went along with his plan /every time/. From leaving Harry on that doorstep in the beginning, to allowing the students to bully Harry in his 2nd and 4th years, to not opposing Umbridge in any way, to Harry being in the castle while under seige from Voldemort (as noted by Ash_Lestrange), she never stood up to Dumbledore.

It really depends on how the author wrote their particular McGonagall and Dumbledore in question though, no? Either could be believable, but it's the author's job to make it believable. The way I see it, if McGonagall was written to be a headstrong, independent character who follows her ideals, then she could only follow Dumbledore if he also shares (or appears to share) those ideals as well. If she's written to be very doubtful and distrustful of Dumbledore then it would make sense for her to oppose him when he crosses a line.

I see Canon!McGonagall as defying an Evil!Manipulative!Dumbledore when all of his machinations are revealed but I can see her supporting a Misguided!Manipulative!Dumbledore unless his actions cross a particular moral boundary.

** I mean... Sirius tried to use Lupin to kill Snape at worst and get him turned into a werewolf at best. And McGonagall, either on her own or on Dumbledore's orders, let Sirius remain at the school and graduate. Even if it was ultimately Dumbledore's decision, she still chose to stay at the school and work for him. I can definitely see her siding with him, regardless of the circumstances.

** There's two different flavors of McGonagall to manipulative Dumbledore: She was lied to, or drugged to the gills with loyalty potions/oaths and whatnot.

The lied to one is better for me, as the execution of the other flavor is really hard to pull off without seeming so... bad or ass-pully. There was one that was really deliciously evil how Dumbledore pulled it off, he pulled a Pavlov, and programmed them with repeated exposure to the loyalty potions and even without them, they would snap to his orders without fuss until it was pointed out.

My opinion on McGonagall in general is that she is a smaller scale replica of Dumbledore. She has too many jobs: Transfiguration teacher, Head of Gryffindor house, and Deputy Headmistress. And it shows, because she is barely average at any of them, except maybe teaching.

Typical Sinyk story, bashing galore. The Dumbledore finale was hilarious for me though. And they were a bit "Lordy". Some of it was really good though.
