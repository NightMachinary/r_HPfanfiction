Anything like harry's boggart being existential; harry is similar to Voldemort's, or maybe the Big snake he fought in year 2? like how is he not scared of that? Maybe a Vernon one or just voldermort

  Revisiting the concept of boggarts in Snape's Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, Harry was wholly prepared to face the faux dementor. But what stepped out of that darkened space was something else entirely. A handsome boy with a gleaming prefect's badge and a cruel smile.

*** If you don't want to go through the entire fic, it's at the end of Chapter 50.

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked at the boggart which had currently been turned into a clown. Harry wondered what the boggart would turn into, he didn't have any fears that he was aware of. Darkness, water, heights and so on didn't bother him. Harry wasn't scared of any animals either, of course if they attacked him then he'd be scared in the moment but after or before that he would be fine. So what would it be?

  Harry watched as the boggart shifted, it grew wider and taller, and it grew a mustache.

  "Uncle Vernon?" Jet asked in a confused voice. Standing in front of Harry was his Uncle Vernon, face purple with anger, belt wrapped around his hand.

  "Of course," Harry sighed as he closed his eyes. "of course it would be you." Harry said, he opened his eyes and glared at the source of many of his nightmares. Harry raised his wand and aimed it at him. "Riddikulus." Harry said, a beam shot out of his wand and hit the boggart, in front of the whole class it shapeshifted, but they were all rather suprised when it turned into Ron Weasley.

  "Mr Potter?" Professor Lupin spoke in a questioning voice.

  "You said something funny," Harry shrugged. "pathetically funny counts." Harry said before he turned and walked off, once again walking past a red faced Ron Weasley.

For context, it's a Slytherin Harry fic with the kind of bashing you can expect from this author. It's not a bad fic, from what I remember, but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Jet is Harry's snake familiar.

**** It's not the most well written fic in the world, but damn did I laugh my ass off at that scene. Easily one of the most casually savage things written in a fic.

  Harry Potter's life was not a very good one, but then one day that all changed, one day he found a snake in his cupboard. Slytherin Harry, dark/grey. There will be bashing. HarryxDaphne (pairing could change in the future).

** This is a Doctor Who crossover fic based around the Boggart and one of the scariest things in the entire series. The name alone will clue you in, if you're familiar with them...

*** Just got done reading that one a couple weeks ago. Really great presentation of the Weeping Angels theme, and utterly terrifying in a way few horror novels really are. I wonder if Stephen King was consulted when designing the Weeping Angels for the show, back when his stuff was actually scary.
