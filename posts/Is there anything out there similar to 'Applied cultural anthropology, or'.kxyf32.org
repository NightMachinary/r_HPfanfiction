Hey all,

I just finished the last chapter of 'Applied Cultural Anthropology, or' by Jacobk, and was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed it - I almost never read anything without Harry as the main character, but the idea of a dark!Hermione integrated into Slytherin and affected by diary!Tom really caught my attention - is there anything out there in similar tone that you could recommend?

Thanks!


** Check out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]] by Annerb. If you enjoyed Cultural Anthropology, I think you'll love that one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847/chapters/18163144][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] is one of my fave grey! Slytherin! Hermione stories too :)

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch.

  Voldemort won. The last of the war criminals Hermione Granger is about to face public execution. Except - it doesn't work out that way. What would you do if you went back twenty years in time? With nothing to lose, Hermione creates a ruthless deception. She enters Slytherin as pureblood Hermione Black with one thing on her mind: Revenge. Unapologetic trope-abuse.

  Hermione has been looking forward to attending Hogwarts as a student ever since she first heard of it. Being separated from her god, however, is intimidating. At least her Hogwarts years are filled with the sort of chaos that "Loki" loves (though Gabriel really would prefer it if she managed to stay out of danger more often. And he really does not like this 'Voldemort' character. Those twins are alright, at least, even though they're a bit too fond of his priestess for his liking).
