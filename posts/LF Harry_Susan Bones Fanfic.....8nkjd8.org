In this harry was disliked by Susan and Hannah bcoz they thought he killed Cedric.... I think it's a contract fic And Harry ends up saving Amelia from an assassination attempt.

Any decent believable Harry fics where he is very good at something and he USES that skill. Even Flying is ok.


** Can anybody respond to this you know....
