** It's short, has very little punctuation, not a lot of details and spelling mistakes galore. I think you should take it down, revise, and flesh it out more. I'll give you a pass since you're 12-13 (I started writing fanfics at 14, I understand the urge to put something out as soon as you're done writing), but it needs some serious editing.

*** That's a way more respectful comment that I would expect anyone to make about self promoted 200 words long fics. You're a much better person than me.

**** Trust me, most of us have been there. Though in my case, all I got were "good story, plz update" type comments that were admittedly good to read (different fandom) but did not help me improve as a writer. I had to do that on my own and by reading other fics.

  This multi part series follows Harry in an AU where he decides he can make a better school than hogwarts, and does so. Will be updated at least monthly.

  Royal Harry and Holly verse. Heir Draco Malfoy tells himself he loathes the Heir of Potter house but as some say, love and hate are two sides of the same coin. Especially when they drive you to insomnia and obsessive dreams about your target.
