I know you specified 'Harry Potter and the _____', but there's no reason the crossovers couldn't go the other way, right?

** That's ... quite a challenge, actually. In The Hobbit, as is signified by the latter and lesser used part of its title, the most important thing is the journey, and though certain things are of significance in one way or another it is only because of how they fit into the journey. Likewise, The Lord of the Rings, though it does not centre on him, is in a way the story of Mairon, the titular lord of the rings, and there are sub-titles for the three books that serve the same function as the whole title of the Harry Potter series, which means that just combining the titles wouldn't do, and because Harry does have some means that are not available to most of the party we have no guarantees that the significant elements used for the sub-titles would remain the same, especially as any such crossover is likely to focus on just Harry so the third sub-title goes out of the window pretty much instantly.

Hmm ...

“Harry Potter and the Unforeseen Adventure, /or the Story of a Dwarven Quest/” is what I propose for a crossover with The Hobbit. It may not be the most elegant a title, but I believe evoking the feeling that the original title gives is the way to go.

Likewise, for a The Lord of the Rings crossover, I believe that “Harry Potter and the Ring of Mairon” would be apt, with the subtitles for the three books, if there is a need for those, being “The Nine” (signifying the fellowship, but also the Ringwraiths, the plot element that forces the party to move even if the ring is not too immediate a threat), “The One” (signifying that the ring, the One Ring, is now a focus, but also that “each to their own” as this is where the party splits), and “The End” (one way or the other it will be an end, either of an era or of the world as it is known).

** Harry Potter and the Fellowship of the Ring

Harry Potter and the Two Towers

Harry Potter and the Return of the King

Idk I think the titles together fit the HP naming conventions and look fine together.

The Hobbit and the Wizard for a hobbit crossover.

If this is for your female Harry, replace Harry with her name.
