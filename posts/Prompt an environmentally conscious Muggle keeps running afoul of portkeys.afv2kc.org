Wizards often use 'innocuous' Muggle items for their portkeys, and they like to use things that would be considered trash to stop Muggles from picking them up (reasoning from Goblet of Fiyah i believe). They also seem to leave public portkeys out in secluded, but open areas. Again, that's based on the evidence in GoF -- an old boot left on a hill is the portkey for anyone from the general area the Weasleys live in.

But not all Muggles ignore trash.\\
Enter our hero; an environmentally conscious Muggle who doesn't abide trash on the ground. They would also likely be fairly into fitness i imagine, since secluded areas would be preferred by wizards (but not always possible deeper in the city).

The story would be more fluffy/crack than anything since our hero would be tragically obliviated and not really capable of changing much. But a well executed story would have its own charm.\\
Will it be a romantic story where a ministry responder finds a connection with a Muggle that keeps blundering where they don't belong?\\
The plain humour of the ministry dealing with a trash collecting Muggle on a mission?\\
A mystery story of a Muggle who can't quite remember what's going on, but knows something is up?\\
I feel this could make an interesting story however you take it.


** there's also the fact that purebloods who know next to nothing about muggles wouldn't know what muggles considers trash. And accidentally make essential muggle items portkeys

** Err, goes a bit off prompt, maybe.

--------------

Jack saw the can during his morning run. It was a regular thing -- opened, a little rusty ‘round the edges, specked with wet dirt. He had almost missed it, so well it was hidden between the hawthorn and nettles that grew in this part of the park. Most people would have ignored it.

And, really, there was nothing bad about ignoring it, for there was no obligation to pick it up. The people who dropped such things -- who polluted without second thought -- well, they were the real trash of society, but to the everyday citizen, cleaning these messes was not a burden to be idly shouldered.

Such thoughts raced through Jack's head as he paused, jogging in place to keep his heart-rate from dropping. He glanced down at the can. It would be annoying to pick it up. The closest bin was at the end of the path, two miles away, which meant he'd have to carry the can, with its soggy label and rusty, but still sharp lid, in his hand all that way.

Still...

Jack frowned.

The thought of the can just wouldn't let go. It was like an itch at the back of his head. Jack looked around, but saw no one. That was part of the reason he'd picked this path -- solitude. In fact, so often had he come here alone that a part of him felt like it was /his/ path, and seeing it vandalised in such a manner brought an indignant sort of disdain. Letting this go would be impossible.

Jack huffed, venting his irritation through breath, and then leaned down to pick up the can. No selfless act goes unpunished, the old adage goes, and so for his troubles nature saw fit to sting him with nettles. Still, the proud feelings in his chest were a natural salve to this bruise. He'd carry this can the whole two miles. And then he'd throw it away. And then-- Jack's thoughts came to abrupt halt as the world started to spin, something wrenched in his chest, and he disappeared into thin air.

Ten feet away, hidden behind a particularly thick oak trunk, a second figure, dressed in black robes with just a touch of green at the hem, smiled and disappeared as well.

. . . . . . . .

Lou and Nancy were huddled together, pointedly ignoring the work they were supposed to be doing in favor of listening in to the conversation on the other side of the door.

And what a conversation it was.

“Four times!” yelled the obliviator, the sound-dampening charms doing little to stifle his voice. Lou and Nancy had seen him come in: a thin sort of fellow, with a mop of red hair, blowing steam out his ears. That wasn't a metaphor.

“Four times...this muggle...brought into my office! /How/ is that even possible?!”

“Now, see here, Mr--” the bumbling sound of Ellis' voice (Lou and Nancy's boss) was cut short rather quickly.

“No, don't you ‘see here' me, Mr. Ellis! Four times this muggle finds a Ministry-sanctioned portkey and is forced be obliviated! You understand this isn't something we can keep up?! That the human mind has limits -- that five obliviations is the absolute maximum for a muggle?! Four is already pushing it!”

“That's not the purview of my department--” Ellis tried to defend himself, and was, again, interrupted.

“Of course that's not the purview of your department!” the Obliviator shrieked, falling into dulcet tones. “But /your/ department is the reason he's is in /my/ department! /FOUR TIMES/! How is this even possible?! /Four times/ he's found a portkey! Do you just leave them on the ground?!”

“Well...yes...”

The two dozen words that followed brought a staunch blush to both girls' cheeks.

“I will look into this, I swear,” Ellis finally said in an appeasing tone when the outburst was over. “You have my word. There's no need to push this any higher.”

“You better,” growled the Obliviator, and Lou and Nancy scampered back to their desks when they heard him approach the door. “Or else the Minister herself--”

His words cut off, mid-threat, as he opened the door. Deeming his glare enough, he turned and stomped out past the two girls and into the hallway beyond the offices of the Department of Portkey Transport.

Lou and Nancy looked at their boss, Mr. Ellis. A rotund man with pink cheeks, he wasn't particularly competent nor efficient; but he wasn't a bad boss either. He was very hands off, preferring to spend his days out of the office, giving his employees a pleasant level of autonomy.

Which, unfortunately, left him at a complete loss at how to deal with this current situation.

“I, uh...err...” he paused in the doorway. “There's a muggle, apparently,” he suddenly declared. Lou and Nancy raised their eyebrows in a polite gesture of surprise, as if this was completely unexpected news. “Yes, um. He's used our portkeys four times. We should have someone check it out, I think, ask the muggle how's he stumbling on them. Er...” Mr. Ellis paused, glancing between his two employees. “Nancy, you're good at that, right?”

Nancy's eyebrows climbed just a little higher.

“At interrogation?” she asked in a pointedly cold tone. “Why, because I'm a Slytherin?”

Mr. Ellis' cheeks colored a faint red.

“Ugh, no,” he stammered out. “Well, I mean, in a way, but not in a--”

“It's alright, Mr. Ellis,” Nancy suddenly laughed, her lips splitting into a wide and somewhat vulpine grin that looked natural. “I'm having you on. We'll take care of this. Lou should probably question this muggle, though, and I'll cross-reference our portkey placements with the Department of Transport's overall schedule to see what's going on.”

“Yes, that sounds splendid,” Mr. Ellis nodded wisely.“I was just about to suggest...carry on then.” Walking back into his office he looked distinctly relieved, a mountain off his shoulders. Nancy clucked her tongue and then waited till he was gone till she turned to look at her best friend, who was staring at her rather shrewdly.

“So I should check out the muggle then?” Lou asked.

“I think that would be best,” Nancy answered, idly glancing down at her fingernails.

Lou stared at her even harder. “Why do you have that look on your face?”

“What look?”

“You know, /the look/. The same look you had when you charmed Sarah Ecklet's hair off for a whole month--”

“She deserved that!”

“--or when the Gryffindor Quidditch team suddenly found their brooms /moaning with delight/ when anyone sat on them right before the final match--”

“They were spreading those nasty rumors about you.”

“--/or/ when half the food in the Great Hall turned out to be laced with laxatives--”

“We had classes off for a /week!/”

“You /have/ a look,” Lou concluded, sharply crossing her arms under her breasts.

Nancy sighed. “Just go to the muggle,” she said. “Ask the right questions, do your job.”

Lou still stared at her with suspicion. “Alright,” she finally agreed. “But I'm getting to the bottom of this.”

Watching her go, Nancy sighed once more. “You always do.”

*** Lou and Nancy were chums.

They were an odd couple as far as friends go. One a Gryffindor, the other Slytherin to her core. But friends they became, and stuck with each other through thick and thin, from the bullying within their own houses, to the sideways glances the /other/ houses threw when they were seen together.

Truthfully, this was a problem that had lasted the whole seven years -- despite the school's and the Ministry's best efforts, Slytherin was still harshly mistrusted after the war, sentiments that kids learned from their parents and then were only eager to parrot in the arching stone halls.

Children can be cruel, at times.

But Lou and Nancy's friendship persevered the cruelty, and together they graduated, finding adjoining positions in the Ministry, in the Office of Portkey Transport, not a bad affair. Discrimination was also harshly looked down upon by the new Minister -- the first muggleborn ever to be in that position -- and so things were good, for a while.

And then Lou feel in love.

Truthfully, Nancy was only happy for her friend. Which meant she was just as devastated when Lou's beau turned out be a cheat. Lou cried, her heart broken, and Nancy nursed her through it.

A couple years passed.

While Nancy was the sly one in the relationship, Lou was the bold. If Nancy was passive (albeit devious at time), then Lou was the one pushing them forward, always eager to try out new things. And when, still stuck in the grey depressive muck of her post-breakup, Lou suggested they go see the muggle world, Nancy didn't have the heart to say no.

The muggle world was loud and massive. There were crowds of people, machines that spewed exhaust, and streams of pink fluffy candy on sticks that was sold by smiling salesmen in brightly striped carts.

But their trip would have been just a passing novelty if not for one thing. /The man/. Lou saw him, and her broken heart started to pump anew. For the first time in months, Nancy saw a blush appear on her best friend's cheeks. A sparkle in her eyes. But no matter how hard she pushed, Lou refused to do anything about it.

She was scared of having her heart broken once more.

And so came *The Plan*.

If Lou refused to go the man, then the man would be brought to her.

Literally.

Nancy's history as a Slytherin and her position in the Department of Portkey Transport made it all too easy. It was a bit harder to cover up her tracks, but she was fairly confident on that front as well. To an extent, at least.

Because, of course, Lou would see right through her facade.

Nancy looked at the clock and bit her lip.

Now, all there was left to do was wait.

. . . .

“You /cow/,” huffed Lou later that evening, bursting in through the front door of the flat she shared with Nancy. “You /absolute cow/.

Nancy looked up from her seat on the couch, dropping the book in her hands. She hadn't read a word, truthfully. “I take it you've discovered the identity of this muggle man?” she asked with just a slight tremor in her voice.

“Discovered the identity..?!” Lou looked at her like she was crazy. “Yes, I ‘discovered the identity'! And then it took me exactly two seconds to figure out who was behind this whole affair!” Lou stormed around the room, waving her arms like a windmill. “Oh, gods, what did you do?!”

She plopped down on the couch next to Nancy and summoned a bottle of wine from the kitchen. She didn't even bother with a glass, drinking straight from the bottle.

“So...” Nancy said after a minute. “What happened?”

“What happened?” Lou uttered something between a choke and a sob and handed Nancy the bottle. Nancy took a sip. “What happened is I was in there three hours talking to Jack -- the /muggle/, not that you don't know that -- trying to figure out why he's stumbling all over our portkeys! And then I was hustled out of there, and that obliviator fellow with the steam in his ears”-- both girls paused to snicker at the memory --“said they can't afford to obliviate him anymore without risking side-effects! And so he'd be inducted into our world, but they needed someone to keep an eye on him, and since I already seemed to have established a rapport, wouldn't I volunteer?”

“And you said?” Nancy ashed with a hush.

“Well I couldn't exactly bloody say ‘no', could I?!” yelled Lou in exasperation, “If anyone else talks to that man, they'll figure out something shifty's going on, and I know exactly where /that/ trail will lead.”

Lou glared at Nancy, who took another sip from the bottle.

“This was completely reprehensible,” Lou said.

“Yes,” Nancy agreed.

“I don't even know how many laws you broke.”

“A lot.”

“You could get fired.”

“Mhhm.”

“Or go to Azkaban.”

“That's possible.”

Lou glared. The silence between them - interspersed only by sound of a clock in a corner - stretched, growing thinner and thinner, until Lou's eyes finally crinkled, and the words she'd been holding onto burst forth from her lips in that exuberant manner that girls use to tell each other secrets.

“We're going out to a muggle pub tomorrow!”

Nancy turned, squealing from happiness, and threw her arms around her best friend's shoulders. Lou hugged back, sniffling into Nancy's ear.

"Thank you," she whispered.

"Always," was the loyal reply.
