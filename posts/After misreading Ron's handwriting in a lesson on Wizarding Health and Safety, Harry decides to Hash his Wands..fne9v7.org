"HARRY JAMES POTTER IS THAT CANNABIS?!" screamed Hermione. "It's a Wizarding thing, isn't it? For Health and safety" Harry replied, confused. "That's just Ron's awful handwriting! You're supposed to WASH YOUR HANDS" "Oops"


** "Aha, I've done it," said Harry triumphantly. "Thanks for giving me the advice to hash my wand, Ron. Now Voldemort can never hack into it!"

Ron said nothing as he was too busy coughing into his food like the sanitary wizard he was.

"It's still 1995," Hermione said, peering over Harry's shoulders at his work. "SHA-256 hasn't been invented yet. Also you can't encrypt a wand. Also, imagine not using a bloody salt with your hashing function. Does the writer of this comment even care about these plot holes or is he too busy trying to flex his computer science knowledge?"

Harry said nothing as the writer realized that his Jupyter Notebook has finally finished running his cell.

*** Let's face it, it's '95, he could password his wand with "Password1" and 99% of people wouldn't guess it.
