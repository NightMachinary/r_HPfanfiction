#+TITLE: What would you guys think of the Order having their own "Dark Mark"? I've been toying with the idea of it being a White Phoenix for example, and the Order Members cast it when entering Battle or something. And perhaps it lifts people's morale magically, gives them strength?

** Or they could just arrive into battle with "Eye of the Tiger" as a battle cry only changing Tiger for Phoenix

** Something like this occurs in The Return of the Marauders: linkffn(5856625)

However it's not the Order that has the symbol but rather the Marauders which is a faction led by Harry, Sirius, and Lily.

Dumbledore is antagonistic

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** The idea of some sort of banner for the Order to cast when intervening seems cool, if we forget that they're secret vigilantes (the public don't know them) and are acting without any legal jurisdiction, which is why they don't fight massively in canon I think. But still, a sort of magic Phoenix banner has some appeal.

A mark would be too close to Voldemort's one. An enchanted locket like the gallon Hermione made for the DA would make more sense.

** This has been a few times in various Hermione timetravel fics I've read over the years. Unfortunately I can't remember a single one. Pretty sure I've seen it be a Phoenix before. I wanna say it was behind the ear Under hair, as the dark mark Was too obvious
