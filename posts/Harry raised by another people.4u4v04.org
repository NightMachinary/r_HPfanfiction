I checked search in this sub, and to my knowledge there's quite a lot of fics where Harry raised by good people, by bad people, by non-human people... I'm requesting some fanfics with family feels. I mean, where Harry interracts with his parents/adoptive parents etc. a lot, maybe some drama. (It doesn't have to by a main topic.)

The only thing I somehow can remember is linkffn(Death of Today). Preferably long ones, and where Harry is raised from young age. Extra points for Snape and Lily.


** linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has him raised by Hermione's parents.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth.

Anyways, no idea if it's your cuppa tea as the Intro Arc was written primarily from the adults POV, and not all that much attention on Harry in this Arc as I did not feel all that comfortable writing from the POV of a child of six. And the next Arc will jump straight to the summer before first year.

So, maybe you'll like it maybe you won't :) just thought I'd tell.

** The classic "Harry is raised by the Addams Family" story is the Harveste series by kyaru-chan (and if it's not that, it's Perfect Slytherins by jeconais) - but my favorite is [[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/Family_Values/index/][Family Values by Ishtar]].

And I'm not sure it counts, because it's a total crossover and pretty much crack (even more so than the above), but there's always [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-series-of-crazy-random-happenstances-hp-dc.14620/][A Series of Crazy Random Happenstances]] (also known as the crazy random adventures of Clark Joseph Kal Harry El-Potter Kent... he usually just goes by Clark Kent).
