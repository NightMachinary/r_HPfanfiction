:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it months ago, and now I'm trying to find it again. I can't remember if it was completed or not. I think I read it on AO3, but didn't end up saving it to my bookmarks for some reason.

It's a minor cross over fic with Stargate. The Room of requirement leads to an abandoned Space ship. I think it's Lee and the twins that end up finding it first and suggest it as a place to hold the DA meetings in 5th year. It takes some time for Harry and Co to actually realize that the ship is in actual SPACE, at first just thinking it's a really realistic room created by Hogwarts. The group goes on to get the ship up and running, and decide to space travel as their future career going so far as to make an official company and hiring muggleborns.

It was really good and I can't for the life of me remember what it was called. If this sounds familiar to anyone else please help!!
