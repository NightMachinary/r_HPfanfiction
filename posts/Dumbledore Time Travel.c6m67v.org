On the day he travels home from Hogwarts after his Seventh year, Albus Dumbledore wakes up to his last memory being killed by Severus Snape atop tue astronomy tower of Hogwarts. Suddenly close to a hundred years of memories flood into his mind. What happens next?

There are lots of time travel stories for Harry, Hermione, even Snape, but are there any where Dumbledore goes back to his youth/prime and how that might change things?


** You know what, I don't think there are, and it would be interesting indeed, but I don't know if him going to his Seventh-Year would work. It's too early for most of his canon knowledge to be relevant. I mean, there could be an /interesting/ story, but it wouldn't be a time-travel-fic in the usual sense of the term; you could make something out of an attempt by him to nip Grindelwald's evil in the bud, but (unless you write him as making the same mistake again and persuading himself that he's set Grindelwald on the path of good when actually Grindelwald is still just as ruthless as ever) that wouldn't take up too long. Most of what Dumbledore would do after being sent back, realistically, is use his /historical/ foreknowledge to try and avert the World Wars.

Any and everything to do with Tom Riddle and the canon plot at large would be null and void to our time-traveling Dumbledore, because what with the butterfly effect, Riddle will probably never be born to begin with (neither, for that matter, will James Potter). Even if sheer butterfly-effect wasn't enough, surely one of the first things Dumbledore would do is give Merope a decent education and actively avert Voldemort's birth, which is the simplest and most humane way to kill him in his situation.

And besides that, any story with Dumbledore as a protagonist is an OP!Protagonist by definition, what with his being the greatest sorcerer in the world, but sending him a hundred years back in time would triple that. Not only is he a genius and one of the greatest wizards in History, but he'd have a hundred years' magical advancement in mind over the rest of the universe. Whoever the greatest warlock on Earth was in the late 19th century would be outclassed in the same way that a modern-day trained engineer would get Thomas Edison or whomever laughed out of the room if he went back to the early 20th century.

*** Agreed, way to early. Have Dumbledore blank for a moment during sorting, then hear McGonagall say, "Lily Evans."

*** True, but there are options to consider: 1 - his sister alive and family sorta together, his brother not hating him 2 - does he believe these memories or think it all a dream 3- A chance to curb Gellert from the start. But Gellert is no push over 4 - Dumbledore has little to no influence compared to later in life Dumbledore 5 - Unless he goes out of his way to integrate the Gaunts, chances of Tom being born are decent.

*** I don't see this as a problem. Throw all seven books out the window as irrelevant, and there's still plenty of canon to base a story on, from Pottermore and the Fantastic Beasts movies.

Yeah, he's powerful, but I'm sure he'd come up with some scheme so ambitious, accomplishing it would still be iffy.

**** That's why I prefaced all this with "I mean, there could be an /interesting/ story there, but it wouldn't be a time-travel-fic in the usual sense of the term".

** There are a couple fics suggested [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4xpdkt/request_ive_never_heard_of_any_fics_like_this/][here]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3o148k/dumbledore_travels_through_time/][here]].

 

There'd be an enormous amount of butterflies from being sent back at the end of his seventh year, how he chooses to use his future knowledge, and how those actions affect the timeline. Can he do anything to help Ariana? Does he save his mother? Does he go on the Grand Tour with Elphias Doge? How does Dumbledore deal with Grindelwald? How does Dumbledore handle Riddle? Do other Dark Lords rise instead of Grindelwald or Voldemort? What else does he try to change? Are there any unintended consequences? I'd expect a timeline drastically different to the canon one. I'd also expect there to be some changes to future canon characters if a story were to cover that much time. Perhaps a character no longer exists, has a different name, a different personality, etc.
