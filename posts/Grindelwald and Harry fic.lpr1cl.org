In the fic Odd Ideas by Rorschach's blot, theres a chapter where Grindelwald decides to leave Nuremberg, and finds his living relatives, which happens to be Harry, from his mother's side. I think it was either pre Hogwarts, or very early on. Anything similar?


** there is a fic called The Black Heir by FirePhoenix8, and Vindico Atrium on FFN where Grindelwald turns out to be Harry's Grandfather. The series is over 1.5 million words tho so it's not the main point but it is a very interesting read and the relationship between grindelwald and harry is very interesting!
