*** To be honest, I lost interest due to this. It was advertised as Harry/Tonks therefore Harry/Tonks should be inside. If its supposed to be a mystery pairing or a changing one then it should not have been tagged with a ship. The term "false advertising" comes to my mind here. I like all ships the fic dabbled with, but the claim to be one of them only to say "lol nope" is bad form. It's like buying a book about the NYPD where the text on the back says "murder mystery" but it ends up being a romance instead. While not bad, that's not the reason why you got the book.

It also used to be tagged as Harry/Hermione for one or two chapters earlier on (around chapter 5 I think).

***** I don't mind any Harry/female ships, but if something is advertised as X while it is Y, that ain't nice. I am also not a fan of the whole "will they, won't they".
