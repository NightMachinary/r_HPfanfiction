I got really hyped for these two Ulquiorra Harry fics, but then I find out that they either nerfed him severley(with understandable reasons, granted, but still), and the other he didn't have his powers period. I want a fic where Harry being displaced, and the coming/returning to Hogwarts after actually keeps his full power. Instead of writers not being skilled enough to write a good story with a powerful protagonist, stories where they can write a good story around this unique individual, or just have an OP Harry, because there fun as well so can anyone help me find such stories please.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Yes.

Harry is transported forward in time, via accidental magic during the summer after his first year. He comes back several months later, after spending 250+ years as an Inquisitor of the Ordo Malleus, purging the Glorious Imperium of Man of the Xeno, the Mutant, and the Heretic, all in the name of The God Emperor of Mankind. The wizarding world is unprepared for Harry, who knows that in the grim darkness of the future, there is only war...

  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.
