Looking for harry potter fanfic

I've been looking for a harry potter fanfic for an hour and i can't find it.

i either read it on ao3 or wattpad (possibly completed)

harry is raised by sirius (maybe wolfstar i'm not sure)

there was sorta a harry and fred relationship but it was never official but i think one of the tags was possible harry potter and fred weasley relationship

since harry was raised by sirius he actually thinks things through. so in goblet of fire harry assumes that him being successful in the tournament is suspicious. harry and cedric assume that the cup is a trap possibly a port key. they tell sirius and they make a plan of what to do if it a port key.

cedric survives the tournament

cedric is also like a brother to harry

(pretty sure it's not based only on fourth year. i think years before is included but i don't remember)

please help me find this fanfic please!!!


** after applying many filters i've found the fanfic
