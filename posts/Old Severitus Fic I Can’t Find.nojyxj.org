The details I remember of it are: Very young pre-Hogwarts Harry taken in by Snape. He takes a potion that ends up making him look more like Snape and gives him yellow eyes. The Dursley's were abusive. One distinct detail I remember was him being friends with young draco and being peer pressured by him into riding a broom. There was also mention of like a kids safety seat for a broom. He met Neville while at St Mungos. I never got to finish it, and I remember it being quite long. I haven't been able to find it since. I can't recall if it was on FF.net or AO3, but it's either of those.


** I think it might be "Whelp" on FF.net

*** Unfortunately that one isn't it. The one I read was very similar, and I believe I read it around the same time, but I distinctly remember the bits about Harry seeing Neville and Harry starting to look more like Snape early on. Also I think something about being scared of the fire poker.
