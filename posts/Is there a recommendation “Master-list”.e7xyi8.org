I love using this sub-reddit as a way to find/filter out fics that I may have otherwise missed or skipped over the years.

I was just wondering is there somewhere you all look or refer to, to find new fics to read? A master list, as such?

I have no preferences, beyond well-written and thoughtful. Just hoping to find something new!


** I usually go on ffn, search 40k minimum and lists by update date. That way i get all the newest fics at atleast 40k words from newest to oldest. I also check out the favorite lists of authors who have written good stories, they tend to have good taste :) as someone who have read fanfiction for 5 years, i have read all the fics i find interresting on the must read fics. So its mostly just newer fics for me now :(

*** Thank you for the tip, I try that too occasionally :)

I feel you. I discovered FanFiction when I was 14, and it's been my guilty please ever since... so I've read most of the popular ones too. Occasionally I'll find a gem I've missed tho haha

Is as close as you'll get to a master list I guess. Only fics that forum deemed worthy made it on there but it's too their taste not everyone's.

Otherwise Taure put together this list. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwI_z2EfyhOWpxM_68sozXTxFeLHC1bGEGmT5HPEh_4/edit]]

Generally there are lots of ways to find recs but those two are pretty good starts.
