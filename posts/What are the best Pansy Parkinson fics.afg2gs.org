  Pansy Parkinson is an expert in magical houses, and she has been sent to investigate Harrison Estate; a real trickster of a mansion that has been causing its previous owners no small amount of strife. A job like this could be dangerous, so Pansy requests help from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Unfortunately, the Auror they send over is none other than Ron Weasley. More unfortunately, the house then decided to lock them both in...

** I can't say it's the best, certainly, but I'm writing a long fic focused on Hermione and Pansy as main characters. I leave you the link here in case you want to check it out. It's not like there's so many Pansy fics out there. It's also on ao3.

  "The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep on wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen." Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, "And what you don't realize is that we are not playing chess anymore." (Dark)

  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger. "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."

  Pansy told herself to act natural, but she couldn't quite remember how she naturally acted around Harry Potter. She certainly wasn't nice to him, but she didn't think it exactly fit to glare at him when he hadn't done anything wrong yet. Shameless PPHP.

**** Not within a month, that's for sure. I will be publishing the next chapter of No Longer Alone later today, with another one nearly completed. Then Dawn of Darkness is long overdue for an update and there are 3k written for that.

That being said, I had written half of a second chapter but deleted that because it didn't capture the same spirit, so it was back to the drawing board for me.

  When her father wanted to sell Pansy off like cattle, she decided to take matters in her own hands. With unexpected results. A second Chapter will be added eventually.
