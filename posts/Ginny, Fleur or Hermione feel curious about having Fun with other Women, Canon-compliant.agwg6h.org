What i want to know are Fics that have Fleur, Ginny or Hermione being married to their Canon spouses and have their own Family, with CHildren and everything. But at some time, they discover that they feel an "urge" to Kiss a Woman and possibly have sexual experiments/Adventures with her. They still love their Husbands and Children. Maybe its because they enter some sort of Menopause or whatever, maybe its their discovery, that they are Bisexual.

I would accept non-canonical Spouses too, if this fits more the Rec.
