Not Slytherin Harry/Hermione/Ginny (I'm pretty sure I've read most of them anyway)

Not Latet Anguis In Herba (read it)

I don't mind if Slytherin is portrayed as good or evil or something in between, but I want decent characterization.


** Have you read linkffn(the pureblood pretense)? Technically the character that goes to Hogwarts is named harry potter, but she shares next to no backstory or character traits with cannon Harry and it is kind of off the beaten track, fic wise.

Also, linkffn(choices by random-fruitcake04) is a Slytherin Ron fic where Ron is a seer.

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. 2nd chapter for fifth year now here! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

*** I second The Pureblood Pretense. That and its sequels are exceptionally well written and engaging even if the main character is basically an OC

** I did something along the lines of your request ages and ages ago. I'm currently in the process of polishing the ones I've written and finishing the unfinished, before putting them back online.

They all focus on a Slytherin main character, who gets a one-line mention in canon. She is older than the trio - in the twin's year - and a half-blood so has all the foot-in-both-camps baggage.

If you're up for giving honest feedback, I'll happily push them your way.
