Albus Wulfric Percival Brian Dumbledore never planned to be a hero. Indeed, he was only in Germany for tea with Frau Ehre, lovely woman, when someone foisted on him the credit for ending the Grindewald War. They spun it out into a tale of heroism and valor, with a spectacular duel and the triumphant hero saving the masses. In truth, Gellert had slipped and fell. Albus tried to tell the truth, but his words fell on deaf ears and he received one in turn: */Wizarding World would not be denied its Messiah/*.

Over the years, Albus tried anything he could without outright turning evil... To no effect. The title had stuck to him and would not be leaving. It is a tired, worn down and bitter Albus Dumbledore that discovers that one Harry Potter survived an encounter with the most recent Dark Lord, the Dark Lord being banished for a time... He wastes no time crowing about the Boy Who Lived to anyone who'd listen.

//It could be a comedic fic, with Dumbledore trying to escape the weight of the world... Or it could be his slow descent into madness as he fails and the weight starts to smother him.
