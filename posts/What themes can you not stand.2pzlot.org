** I can't stand mpreg stories, to the point where I won't even start reading one if it has a tag for it. I also generally dislike Harry/Draco stories unless they're very much post-Hogwarts (~10 years or so after DH are usually ok for me). The one thing that always irritates me is when the entire HP turns out to be gay. I'm fine with good slash pairings (Lupin/Sirius is one of my favs), but I never understand it when authors make every single relationship a slash relationship.

Ok, I get it, Dumbledore was manipulative, yeah he made some big mistakes, but he wasn't evil he wasn't out to fuck Harry just for the lulz and I think there are excellent reason why he did what he did.

and even if you want Dumbledore to be the villian because you can't undersand that even good people with good intentions can fuck up at least keep close to canon and keep him as a smart and clever wizard and no some Idiotic senile old man that is outsmarted by an eleven year old kid that just discovered the magical world last week.

*Soul bonds* / *Marriage Contracts*

If you are writing a romance and use one these you should feel bad, Soulbonds completely remove any conflict the story may had have and Contracts it's just a lazy cliche to make two characters that otherwise would never get together, get together. It's Lazy, Boring and completely stupid.

****** Yes, like I said, if it's done in the right way it makes a difference what kind of female you write about, but - like you've said - there's a whole lot of crap out there where it doesn't matter.

And the question was which theme I cannot stand, so I named that. ;) I've encountered too many fics where Harry was only turned female because the author wanted to pair him with a guy without writing Slash... which is a bad reason in my opinion. But to each his own, if there are people who enjoy these fics, why not? :)

** I hate stories that try to explain away magic as some sort of exotic physics or something. No magic is not just the manipulation of an exotic energy field or quantum foam (what ever that is).

What usually happens in these stories is that muggles discover the scientific basis for magic and then curbstomp the mean backwards ignorant wizards. Then the Harry in name only character pontificates about how superior muggle culture is and puts dumbles in his place.

Magic should stay magic, forget all that sufficiently advanced technology nonsense.

** Making Snape nice.

Snape is, IMO, one of, if not the best character that Rowling wrote in the Harry Potter series. But he wasn't such a great character because he was super nice and a great person and blah blah blah. He was a great character because of all the shit he went through and had to deal with, and how human he was because he didn't come out of his life unscathed. So many writers decide, however, to treat him like they would a friend, and in doing so, they ruin him. Snape is not supposed to be nice, he is supposed to be bitter and hurt. That's why he is such a great character. I just had it when writers just start making him super nice, or worse, some suave sex god, and so on and so forth.

** Trying to explain magic down to the last detail. Drives me nuts and goes against the very concept of it.

I'm being a little hypocritical as I myself have a halfway decent explanation of "modern magic", but explaining "Magic"-magic just takes a ton of the fun out of it for me.

*** love the pun going on.

I think it's nice because it gives someone a reference back to "reality" (ie canon). Like yeah, Harry might be in Slytherin and raised by Snape and they're not even in England and everything else is just so out there, BUT LOOK, here's a little nod to the Universe that you love so much. It helps readers not get lost

*** I want to see a story where Harry gets a cat (Crookshanks or otherwise) and Hermione gets Hedwig. I mean, why would Harry need/want an owl? He has *no one* to write at the beginning of first year. Hermione does. She would benefit from having an owl. The owl can deliver letters to/from her parents. So why does she get a cat? Ah yes. Plot.

I'm not sure if the Dursleys would be more or less accepting of a cat.
