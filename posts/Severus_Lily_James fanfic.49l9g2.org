Any good ones?


** linkffn(Lily and the Halfblood Prince) -- really recommend this one, told alternatively through Lily and Snape's perspectives from their childhood through the end of their friendship in 5th year. There's an unfinished sequel that isn't as good.

  This story starts from when Severus first met Lily, and the way their friendship evolved during their school years. It is mostly canon, continuing seamlessly from Ch.33 in JKR's book the latter marked in italics .COMPLETE
