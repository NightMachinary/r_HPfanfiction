/Only Enemies/ features Harry/Bella. I haven't read it in a couple years, but I don't remember the age difference being mentioned at all: linkffn(2896398)

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** This one is pretty good - the author regularly updates, harry is powerful, but not the most powerful, and it brings just as many problems for him as it does solutions. It even has good forshadowing and a plot that at east appeara to have already been planned out.

There are sex scenes, explicit ones. Also, harry 'marries' luna, tonks and fleur. He regularly boinks narcissa malfoy and the runes teacher, whatsherface. Its less of a harry with an older woman, and more of a harry with all the woman and a preference for the older ones.
