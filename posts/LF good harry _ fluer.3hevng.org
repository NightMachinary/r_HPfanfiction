** Question, her name has always been Fleur why do so many people write it Fluer???? I can understand the typo, but it's a very, very common one and I don't remenber a lot of stories where "Hrary" "Drcao" and "Sapne" are used.

*** There's a long and a short answer. I'll attempt both.

The long answer: Just sounding it out like an English word, Fluer actually sounds a bit more like how Fleur is pronounced than the proper spelling. Someone without any knowledge of French spelling could make that mistake pretty easily; "eur" is relatively uncommon and really only in words of French derivation (amateur, entrepreneur, etc).

The short answer: people suck at spelling.

***** They're actually two completely different characters.

Fluer is a Veela who just goes around randomly forming magical bonds with boys three years younger than her and fucking their brains out, then accompanies them meekly for the rest of the story, contributing nothing of consequence other than regular sex.

Fleur is a beautiful witch with Veela heritage who is arrogant, rude and a snob, but is also highly talented, sophisticated and essentially good. It's not that her snobbishness is a mask -- she is genuinely a snob who looks down on many things -- but rather that she can look past it if she forms a personal connection with someone. Once that personal connection has formed, she can be remarkably loyal and selfless.

**** Same logic as in Colin Creevy and Rubius Hagrid.

Some of those mistake can be explained and forgiven, because in some language the names are different: in French (due to it sounding better) I first read the characters are Drago Malefoy (and I still pronounced it "Malfwa"), Hedwige (the correct French spelling), Lavande Brown and... Sévérus Rogue (rogue meaning rogue). I'm sure that explain some.
