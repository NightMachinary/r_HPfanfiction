Please recommend me your favorite fics that has Harry time traveling to the marauders era, or dimension travel to any time I'll read anything that you recommend, but if I have to be more specific I'd like for Harry to travel just after the war or when he "dies" in the forest, so we can see how he copes with the aftermath, also the malnutrition he will have for the months in the run, etc. Thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è


** The best one without a doubt in linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) It's an adventure story, it has everything. It's sad and happy and funny and terrifying and tense and brilliant. Just fantastic!!! You definately should read it. The plot is so unique and just wonderful. Its exactly what you say, Harry ends up back in time, goes on the run because he doesn't want to mess up the timeline. Ends up with malnutrition so a weird guy invites him to live with him and Harry gets caught up in the first war in his own way, for his own reasons. It's amazing.

linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) is also good? It's a bit more funny and there's a lot of tension between him and the Marauders makes it interesting.

linkao3(face death in the hope by LullabyKnell) is 63 chapters and unfinished. Not abandoned but updates are sporadic. Harry ends up back and accidently saves Regulus and they end up at Marlene's house. There's a lot of good character introspection into Harry trying to deal with the fact his parents are right there.

linkao3(into the arena with your head held high by LullabyKnell) is my Bonus Suggestion here. It's different, Harry and the most adorable Teddy Lupin end up back at OoTP era. Teddy is a dote and it's a bit of an adventure. Unfinished but different.

*** 10000000x second the recommendation of The Second String. It's got one chapter (I think the epilogue?) left, so it's not quite finished, but I read it anyway even though I hardly ever read WIPs.

Really well done with such an interesting premise.

**** Yes the last chapter is just the epilogue. The story is done now we just have the fun little wrap up to go üòä

Yaaaay more Second String hype üòã

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúIt's a really long story,‚Äù he says finally, almost apologetically, ‚Äúand it's really hard to believe.‚Äù‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

*** I like Worfe's other work, too. There's not all that much of it, but the one-shot of Nightmares of Futures Past was quite emotional, and even the Twilight story was decently written.

** Wind shear by Chilord is a pretty good read. Harry shows no mercy to Voldemort's followers.

Linkffn(12511998)

Stepping Back by TheBlack'sResurgence is also a good Time Travel fic again where Harry shows little mercy to the Deatheaters.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
