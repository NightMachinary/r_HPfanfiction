#+TITLE: I just finished Incorruptible: The Dementors Stigma by Matt Silver and quite enjoyed the mystery and power play. Any similar post-war long fics where there is an actual story and Harry needs to investigate/ponder and not just go full throttle? The Aurors by Floreat Castellum was also great.
