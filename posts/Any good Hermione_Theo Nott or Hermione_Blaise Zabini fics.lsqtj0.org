I love what Fandom has done with Theo and Blaise and Hermione is my favorite character. Dark or grey Hermione is fine, just please no "she's actually a purebred and an heiress" blah blah blah


** This is one of my favorite fics. It's Theo/Hermione and I've read it several times. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11946592/1/Aftermath][Aftermath]]
