Don't know if it exists, but I was wondering if a time-travel story exists where Harry decides to raise his best friend for some reason?


** There's one where Harry and Hermione end up back in time, and she pretty much adopts his child self and he gets to babysit her child self before they find each other again. I don't remember the title though.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.
