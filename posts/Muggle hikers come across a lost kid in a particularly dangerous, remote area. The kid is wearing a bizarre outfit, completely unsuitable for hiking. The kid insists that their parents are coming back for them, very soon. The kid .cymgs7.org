** I think I'd like to read the story of how a couple muggles with no magic deal with an adopted kid with lycanthropy when they don't know about magic yet and they have to 1. wrap their heads around the fact werewolves are real and 2. keep him secret also 3. assuming they survive the first transformation with no injury somehow and google "turning into wolf on full moon" or something

After the first time it happens and they figure out why they would be terrified and consider putting the kid back in the forest. But they're actual decent people and they kind of love him already, so they won't do that. And since it's so soon the kid would still talk about his real parents and how they'll come for him, but now the muggles realize the reason behind their decision to abandon their child and think adults he trusted already failed him once. So that's part of their decision to stand by him.

And after it's a bit of a logistical nightmare, because they can't go to the authorities, since they'll take him away. That would get the MoM involved, but they don't know that, they think he would be experimented on. They know there are other werewolves there, since they connect the bite with the kid's condition, but have no idea how to contact them. Maybe they try the internet again, but being wizards the chances of other werewolves being on the internet are thin. They think about building a cage in the basement, but how strong are werewolves anyway? A bear can squish a thick metal door like it's a soda can, is a werewolf stronger than a bear? Since this is a small one, questions like these aren't as urgent, but are still important for the future.

*~

The biggest and most unbelievable thing is that muggles would escape a werewolf transformation that they didn't see coming without a scratch. So the muggles are like those van dwellers that live in a car and travel all over to explore nature. They kind of live off the grid and work online as contractors.

The kid's parents did a very good job of choosing the most isolated spot they could find to abandon their kid. Chances of kid dying of exposure if he wasn't found: 100%.

So the muggles want to camp somewhere isolated, to reconnect with nature since they were both stuck close to populated areas for a while due to work. They're far away from their car, and their car is far away from civilization, so it would take a while for them to go back.

So they hike for a few days, and they barely set up camp and started cooking something when they find this kid. He appears to be around 5 and he's babbling nonsense. He's probably in a state of shock, they assume, since he maybe already spent some time in the forest.

They immediately pack everything up and start the long way back. This would give them enough time to see he's a shy, sweet, innocent kid and grow attached to him. They get to the car and decide to head to the nearest big city to hand him over. This is when full moon happens, he turns and the muggles think fast enough on their feet to get out of the car and lock him in there. Being such a small werewolf, he can't get out, but he does wreck the inside of the car while they stand outside, in the chilly night. It's probably the scariest night in their entire lives.

BTW, that's a great prompt, OP!

Of course, I'm assuming the kid is under 11 and he doesn't have a wand to do magic with, so the Ministry has no way to know what happened.

****** I don't think that happens very often, canonically. When Harry freed the snake in public and scared a bunch of people the MoM didn't care. They only had to get involved when he blew up Marge because of obvious reasons, but that seemed like an extreme unusual reaction after he was provoked.

Assuming he doesn't turn in public and the muggles would want to keep him hidden anyway, I think we're safe from that.

**** Thank you! I was thinking, okay, this is a werewolf kid put here to run wild during the full moon, but why would he still be bleeding from his original werewolf bite a month later? Are his parents werewolves also? Did they just bite him to make him like them? But wouldn't they have torn him apart? Maybe they weren't werewolves, maybe all three were just camping together and the parents got killed but the kid only got bitten but he's in denial?

Basically I was taking him at his word that the parents were coming back, lol. But there's no way this doesn't end with a ton of dead muggles.

***** Im thinking its a recent attack. Parents probably getting mauled or eaten (do hp!wolves do that?) and the kid got away. Kid in denial.

OR

Either or both of the parents are werewolves, dropped off their kid at some relatives place. Kid probably followed them? (Curiosity killed the cat Timmy)

Either way everyone will probably die soon

*** I meant to imply a situation where a wizarding child had been abandoned to die of exposure and an untreated werewolf bite. The idea that muggles might go through the area did not cross the minds of the wizards who abandoned the child, for one reason or another. So these muggle hikers come along, and here's this lost, oddly dressed, injured kid.

I may have worded things a bit too vaguely, or put things a bit too tersely, in an effort to allow a variety of interpretations on the situation.
