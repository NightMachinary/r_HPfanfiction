I'm hoping to find some more stories similar to Per Ardua Ad Astra by GhostForce1911. It doesn't have to be another Stargate crossover, I'm more interested in it being centered on Harry in the military in some form or fashion.


** I've never read the story in question. I can recommend some stories where Harry is a member of a military force:

The latter half of Kwan Li's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] (the story is basically told as two books; [[/spoiler][in the second, Harry is drafted into and later leads a magical military force]]).

#+begin_quote
  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

DobbyElfLord's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3918135/1/The-Sniper][The Sniper]] and sequel. 12k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  OneShot: Harry is expelled after the hearing in Courtroom 10. His wand snapped, an angry Harry choses his own path forward. First person story focusing on Harry's effort to find his own place.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1227033/Marquis-Black][Marquis Black's]] Harry Potter stories, specifically /Emperor/ (500k+ words, WIP, updated last week) and his /Dark Wars/ series (about 500k words, complete).

If you want to go old school, then Cygnus Crux's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/692645/1/Harry-Potter-s-Existence-after-Life][Existence After Life]] and sequels, written before OOtP. About 600k words in the series, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Everyone lives happily ever after following Voldemort's defeat right? Wrong! Harry found himself shunned by all those he held dear. Now it seems he's out for revenge! The release of OotP means this story is now AU

*** Thanks for the suggestions, but I've read all of those save Existence After Life. It looks interesting, I'll be giving it a try.

** I'm a fan of Rorschach's Blot's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][Old Soldiers Never Die]]

#+begin_quote
  A gift from his uncle Vernon gives Harry a new way to fight the Dark Lord
#+end_quote

It's a little strange of an idea and mainly focuses on a muggle type military group led by none other than Harry Potter. It's about *95k words* and complete.

*** I tried reading that early on when it was still being written, and I couldn't read it for some reason, I can't really remember why.

**** It did get a little far-fetched but I still kinda liked it for what it was worth. Just ended up reading it as more of a war strategy story than a Harry Potter story.
