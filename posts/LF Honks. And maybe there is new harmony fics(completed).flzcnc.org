Perhaps you can save it for the future if you are interested

** Chelseyb wrote the best Honks. Rebel and the Chosen is the ultimate one, idk if you've read it. I don't think she has any of them posted online anymore but Reddit user SilverCookieDust graciously shared a link to download them a while back. You can download them here: [[https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsN2ZmLThIYWJYUVU?usp=drive_open]]

*** The Rebel and the Chosen one was very good and well written, just wish it didn't stick so closely to the stations of canon.

***** Yeah no problem! :) It would have been great if she deviated a bit from Canon but whatever, I'm happy there's Honks to begin with lol
