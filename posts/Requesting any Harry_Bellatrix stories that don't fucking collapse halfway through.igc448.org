Thank you!

Edit: Have read all popular time travel fics and have read Watching over Harry, and the one where they are in Azkaban. And have read almost all one shots


** I take it you mean except the famous ones, like Delenda Est, Wind Shear and Stepping Back?

**** ..honestly haven't actually come across any with that pairing besides the ones I've mentioned that was worth reading. Honestly the easiest way for this ship to work is through time-travel, but time-travel stories are also infamously prone to being abandoned.

Got another couple Harry/Bella fics floating around but they haven't been updated since late last year.

Edit: it is VERY ooc Bella though

  This is an AU story. Sirius asks Bella to help him watch over Harry. Bella takes her responsibility to heart in more ways than one. I've given this story a M rating to be safe.

This one's a classic. I have read this more than a dozen times, and it's still one of my all time favorites.

Basically Harry time travels to the past and gets it on with Bella. Written beautifully AND completed.

The sequel is up too!

*** It is the textbook definiton of collapse halfway through. I would have preferred that it was abandoned in the middle rather than the "return to the future" arc which was a burning mess.

  A month after Dumbledore's death, Harry is depressed and wallowing in grief at Privet Drive. One night, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Fawkes appears in his room, and whisks him away to a hidden stronghold. There, our hero meets the spirit of Godric Gryffindor, who takes Harry as his apprentice. Harry/Multi. Powerful, not godlike. Intelligent Harry. Ch 2 is NOT missing.
