   The chimes of Big Ben pierced through the walls of the orphanage announcing the early hours of the afternoon, but Mrs. Cole lost track of time while trying to force the boys into their bedrooms. Billy Stubbs, who was nine, came down with chickenpox five days before, and the infection spread rapidly among the other children.      
   For staff and children alike, the idea of a week-long quarantine was dreadful; it meant double shifts for the already-overworked caretakers who knew that nothing good would come out of locking hyperactive children for seven days. Tom Riddle, however, was not bothered by this, his room was as shabby and somber as always, and still, he would willingly choose to be left alone in it if given the option.
   Unlike any other eleven-year-old boy, Tom spent most of the time by himself, usually thinking or reading anything he could get his hands on. At a glance, his room appeared empty, except for a small and worn bed, a little side table with a lamp, and a shabby wardrobe in the corner -- but a small mountain of books and newspapers remained hidden from view under his bed.
   Tom was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and lost in thought,  oblivious of the noise and chattering coming from the hallways, as though searching for the answer to an unspoken question. To his side, a pile of newspapers displayed a series of headlines meticulously underlined in red crayon. -- "Is Hitler outsmarting Chamberlain?" -- "Hitler in relentless executions kills off leaders in attempt to suppress the second revolution" -- "Bishop to visit Wool's Orphanage for the annual selection of altar servers" read some of them. 
   A sudden knock on the front door took Tom out of his trance. Awakened and alert, he folded the newspapers, quickly hid them under the bed, and climbed onto the side table to peer through the window down to the open courtyard that fronted the grim building. 
   A tall, thin, and grey-haired man on a plum velvet suit was standing in front of the door when Nora opened it. The man beamed at Nora and said something imperceivable from Tom's window. Bewildered, Nora made an effort to take in the man's unusual appearance discretely.  "MRS. COLE!" bellowed over her shoulder. 
   "For heaven's sake, what is it now?" A woman shouted in response just outside of Tom's room. 
   Nora turned back to the man and invited him in while Mrs. Cole's footsteps faded in the distance. 
   "... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley's oozing all over his sheets -- chickenpox on top of everything else," she shouted from the floor below. 
   Tom leaned on the door, trying to listen, but it was impossible. A few moments later, Mrs. Cole came back, followed by whom Tom assumed was the odd man. Mrs. Cole's office was right across from Tom's bedroom, so it was easy to eavesdrop on her private conversations with staffers and visitors.  
   "I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future," said the man. 
   "Are you family?" asked Mrs. Cole. 
   Tom froze and at that moment, Martha walked by and closed Mrs. Cole's door, making it impossible for Tom to hear the rest of the conversation.
