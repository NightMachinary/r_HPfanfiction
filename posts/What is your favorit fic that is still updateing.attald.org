** Harry potter and the Language of Serpents, sequel to HP and the Power of Potions, just updated! haven't read the new chapter yet, but the first story is probably my favorite fanfiction. I love this author's Harry, and Snape is not white-washed, but a brilliant bastard still.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14164617][An Hour of Wolves]] linkao3(14164617) is fantastic, if you don't mind the triggers (rape, self-harm, PTSD, disordered eating... I promise it's not as melodramatic as that sounds). Currently gen, but heading towards Harry/Ginny with background Ron/Hermione.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

Lol maybe I should add this to the fic description; I keep wondering if perhaps the tags make it look like there's just a bunch of improbable angst devices jammed together for the hell of it. Very easy to believe just looking at it. Still crazy awed and grateful you rec this so much!

**** I think the fic description is fine, because the summary's not melodramatic at all. I just had the thought that those TWs, given in a list devoid of context, could easily be reminiscent of all those super over-the-top whump fics out there.
