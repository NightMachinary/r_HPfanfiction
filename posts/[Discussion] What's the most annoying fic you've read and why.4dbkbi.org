** I have tried several times to read a fic where Harry refuses to play his part. He gets locked away. Luna, whose dad has pimped her out since her mom died, flies a broom into his holding cell. They embark on a private rebellion.

I love the premise but the story has that thing with Luna not to mention Harry with the mad sexy powers, he is wildly supa charged with the sexy magic and Narcissa just can't get enough.. I've never made it past that scene because the full body shudders make it impossible to scroll..

It's annoying because with a different treatment the story could be so great but.. no..

I'm all for a badass Harry/trio/good guys. I want good to triumph and evil to get bitch slapped. So Harry/Marry Sue is right in my wheelhouse but sometimes..the means don't justify the end.

*** I'm pretty sure I know exactly which story you are talking about. I thought the premise was interesting... until it turned into mediocre erotica while trying to claim it wasn't.

Edit: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rejected Path) right?

** I read a fic once where Harry fancied Ginny from the first chapter. But oh no! She has Dean as a boyfriend! Some pretty good stuff happens in between, you know, with Voldemort etc. The adventure part was alright.

Then, Harry believes he must die. So, he says goodbye to Ginny (she'd broken up with Dean months ago, Harry still hasn't asked Ginny out, coward). And he kisses her, so she would understand that poor, misunderstood and shy Harry had always loved her (and he doesn't have to face the consequences if Ginny didn't like it, coward).

So you think after Harry miraculously survives and Ginny catches him alone in his PRIVATE ROOM in St. Mungo's, they'll confess their love, kiss and be happy?

NO!!!!!! They both say something like "let's pretend that kiss never happened. We're just friends." Harry, the fucking coward that he is, thinks "yeah... friends.... fml" BUT HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! I HAD MORE BALLS WHEN I WAS THIRTEEN, HARRY'S SEVENTEEN AT THIS POINT!!!!

That's when I stopped reading.

** linkffn(The Problem With Purity)

I wouldn't have been /so/ irritated with it if it hadn't had so much potential. There were some good ideas and some good writing -

/BUT/ it was completely buried under the usual clich√©s, including OP Hermione Sue, soul mates because destiny and stuff regardless of how they actually treat each other, and Ron and Dumbledore being portrayed badly, if not outright bashed. Oh, and I saw the ending coming from the tenth chapter and kept reading hoping I was wrong. I wasn't. I got /very/ angry. Probably angrier than a bad reading experience warrants.

There were good points. I wouldn't have been invested enough to be /this/ upset, even years after reading it, if the author hadn't done some things well. Somehow, that makes it worse than if I'd just thought the whole thing was crap.

** I usually detect annoying fics on the first chapter and stop reading, so there are very few ones that I have actually read, and I think Stages of Hope is the worst. The wangst, flat characterization, and James bashing really disgusted me, and I only completed it because it gets so many good reviews.

** I'm surprised that /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ hasn't been mentioned yet. I could say so many things about how, and why, I find that fanfiction annoying. The main reasons, however, are the use of the fanfiction as a preachy soapbox, OOC Harry, author-as-Harry, and other factors. Perhaps it is the author who is my main gripe concerning the story, as not only have I heard that he tried to make money off HPMOR, but he acts quite immaturely (and defensively) when it comes to criticism. That, or he tries to invalidate or discredit much of the criticism against his work completely, simply because he seems to take criticism against HPMOR personally. From what I've seen, he also acts quite arrogant, egotistical, conceited, and generally like he's better than everyone else, and I absolutely /hate/ that attitude in authors.
