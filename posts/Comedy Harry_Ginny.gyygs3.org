A fan-fiction where things are absolutely mad and funny but I prefer it to be not too steamy, a few snogs is alright but that's about it... i'll try the others but yeah, Harry/Ginny fan-fiction, maybe they get together in a stupid way , maybe their experiences at Hogwarts go mad, (I saw a post about an Australian fire chicken being Fawkes, things like that) but make sure it has at least some kind of plot

​

Thanks!


** Some came to mind, but when I checked none are rated "K - Kids", so I am assuming it goes further than kissing.

Pretty sure you will have a lot more success if you just look for "gen" fics with no pairings. Looking for a romantic pairing and then insisting that they stop at kissing is kind of a hard to find thing.
