Magical Britain has fallen dark, and silent. A terrible plague sweeps the land in the form of Voldemort and his Death Eaters; with all manner of mind-addling potions, bewitching enchantments, and the Imperius Curse, anyone whom crosses their path ends up being enslaved to Voldemort's will, forced to recruit their friends and family in turn, or else execute them.\\
 \\
The Dark Lord and his followers go unseen, striking from the shadows and vanishing without a trace; common witches and wizards cannot hope to fight such an enemy, so they hide in turn.\\
There are a lot of ways for a magical to hide; hide in an expanded suitcase, become an animagus, use a Fidelius Charm...one by one, witches and wizards vanished, hiding themselves away from their neighbours. An unofficial New Statute of Secrecy developed in Britain, one where those of magical blood hid not just from muggles, but from each other.\\
 \\
But the original Statute of Secrecy still had to be upheld. Magical creatures had to be kept hidden, muggles still had to be kept safe from Voldemort's forces. And few people could stay hidden forever, needing food, clothing, potions, medical care...\\
Someone had to go out. Someone had to prepare goods, someone had to go buy them, someone had to go out and dodge Death Eaters until they came back with what they needed. And someone needed to protect muggles, muggleborn and magical creatures from the Death Eaters.\\
 \\
Enter Albus Dumbledore, with his big white beard, and James Potter with his Invisibility Cloak.\\
Gathering up what school friends and survivors of the Ministry's forces they can, they launch a secret organisation, the Order of the Demiguise, not purely to fight Voldemort but to work under his nose, organising deliveries of supplies for holed away families (Operation Santa Claus?), spiriting away muggleborns before the Death Eaters can get to them, running secret hospitals, secret schools, and ambushing the Death Eaters when the latter get complacent on their hunts.\\
 \\
...What would happen next? Suppose that Harry's birth and Voldemort's defeat at his hands was prophesied once again, how would it play out? Would Peter Pettigrew still betray the Potters, or would the OotD's numerous hidey-holes give him the courage to defy Voldemort?\\
 \\
(Random thought 1: Albus Dumbledore totally looks like a demiguise. He's got the looks, James has the (invisibility) power, and Fawkes likes playing ninja.)\\
(Random thought 2: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4308630][The kids who chose themselves]] has a plot a little like this, where Harry and Neville are killed and the OotP goes underground.)
