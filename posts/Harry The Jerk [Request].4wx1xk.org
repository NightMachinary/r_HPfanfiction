I'm looking for fanfictions that emphasize Harry's negative personality traits (arrogance, pride, selfishness, etc.)


** Read Shezza's Denarian Trilogy then. You'll get all that and a fallen angel.

  Being Master of Death was a curious thing. It did not grant immortality, as some wizards might assume- nor did it make the entity called 'Death' your servant, neither did it grant any special power. No, in truth being 'Master of Death' was more of a curse than a gift. This was something Nicolas Delacour, once known as Harry Potter, can tell you with great enthusiasm. AU, HP/LV,
