** So you want another fic with a dark Harry who wouldn't dare break his friendship with the Goddess Hermione while Ron's friendship isn't important. With the sole twist is being a cross over with Yu Gi Oh ?

**** u/AutumnSouls:

  Also, did you forget that Ron was fully willing to leave Hermione to die at the hands of a mountain troll?
#+end_quote

No, he wasn't. He bit his lip for a second before deciding to agree and go *warn* Hermione, not to go and save her. They weren't under the impression that she was 100% going to be killed if they didn't go to her. He also freaked out with Harry when he realized he had locked Hermione in the bathroom with the troll.

As for the other part, that was the Horcrux messing with his head. He tried going back immediately, but snatchers caught him.

The only thing I can't defend when it comes to Ron is him turning his back on Harry during the Triwizard Tournament, but that doesn't make him evil or useless or anything else extreme.

**** It was less of a misunderstanding and more of an exaggeration. Fics that portray Ron in a bad light while keeping Hermione as a friend generally don't bother to give her many actual character flaws. Hence "goddess", as she's always pretty and perfect in such fics.

As for the challenge... I don't think you'll find many people here willing to do this kind of thing. They might, I honestly don't know, but I haven't seen much evidence in that direction. For the challenge itself, I'm honestly not trying to be offensive when I say that I find this challenge incredibly cliche. I have read entirely too many Dark!Harry fics where the only dark thing about him is his apathy towards emotional connection to other people. Not only is that, you know, extremely unhealthy, it comes across as an unrealistic portrayal of his character. Harry is all about emotion, whether it is toward friends or enemies.

Then there's the whole mind control thing. There are many ways to do mind control, but in my opinion, I don't think a face heel turn three seconds into the fic is one of them. Not to mention that fighting against mind control is one of Harry's strengths. I don't think it would work in this case.

Finally, and relating to my first paragraph, there is this:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione is willing to let the whole world burn so she can continue hanging out with Harry
#+end_quote

Hermione is an extremely passionate and empathetic woman, if not always correctly so. It would be extremely out of character for her to just disregard the entirety of humanity without first being pushed far, far past the breaking point. This would definitely not work.

So, I'm glad you decided to post this challenge here, but I don't think you'll get many positive responses for this. It's just not the kind of thing this sub likes. I wish you luck in finding challenge writers, though! You might try over on [[/r/Fanfiction]] if you haven't already. They are more likely to do challenges, as there are writers of multiple fandoms there. You should probably ask first, though!
