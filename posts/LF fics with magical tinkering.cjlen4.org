I just want to read about people trying to solve problems by tinkering, inventing and combining existing magic. Can be anything from Voldemort inventing magic nukes through Hermione inventing magic lasers to fight Voldemort to the twins inventing pranks or a modern day scenario of a nerd at Hogwarts trying to get to the moon. Anything goes if it has clever ideas and inventions. Already read The Arithmancer.


** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense)

It's an AU world and the tinkering isn't the focus of the fic, but the main character Harriet Potter is a Potions prodigy and comes up with ingenious alterations and combinations of various areas of magic.

Edit: I just thought of another one: linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

Harry gets really, /really/ into transfiguration.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** *Linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) by BajaB*

Harry is absurdly lazy and goes out of his way to figure out how to /not/ do things. He gets his potions to stir themselves, modifies his quills to write his essays, and even figures out a way to force the students to do a Mexican Wave during a quidditch game using runes

*Linkffn(The Second String) by Eider Down*

Harry is pretending he is a squib, so he doesn't have access to many books. He finds an old household charms book and prefects the bread slicing charm as a weapon. Before that, he charms rocks with an accuracy charm combined with a "point me" to use in hunting. Gets built upon later.

*Linkffn(Victoria Potter) by Tuare*

Uses pensieves to make a magical play. Generally fantastic worldbuilding. She stays with a magical family over the summer and that dad repairs magical artifacts. Somehow a water wheel is involved.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.
