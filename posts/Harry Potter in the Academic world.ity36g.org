but to make it relevant to this page... Any body know any Harry Potter Healer/Doctor fics that are any good? I mean using parselmagic healing, potions, skipping out on the wizarding world to be a doc any medical professional Harry??


** “Harry Potter and the Law” [[https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=829344]] . I am a lawyer by education and some constructs by Ms Rowling just took my breath away, and not in the good sense.

I am not sure why there are not more people shouting in consternation how utterly bizarre is this dialogue:

#+begin_quote
  “The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”

  “Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
#+end_quote

Publicly declaring that he is willing to change law to fit desired results is such complete departure from the rule of law, that I don't think even the worst dictators of the twentieth century (Stalin, Hitler, Mao, etc.) ever declared anything publicly. Of course, they did it, all of them, but they would never publicly admitted doing so.

"The Venom Peddler" had some weaknesses but I mostly liked it, and parts were excellent.
