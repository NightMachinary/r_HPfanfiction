Pretty simple question. I'm wanting some well-crafted words.

Edit: well I've certainly got a larger backlog now! Thanks, everyone! Edit II: Wow, my first ever award! Thank you very much!


** Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux

Harry Potter and the Greatest Show (also Harry Potter and the Peanut Gallery - pov of different characters)

The Nightmare Man and its prequel Birth of a Nightmare Man (the prequel is the sole reason why I truly fell in love with time traveling fanfictions)

**** I don't really remember how much dark themes and gore was there because I read it quite a long time ago.

But what I do remember is that fic called Evil Be Thou My Good (Harry Potter and Hellrazer au) is quite gory in some parts. The end scenes were especially brutal... But it was nicely written and even through I didn't know a thing about Hellblazer, except few characters' appearance, it was very enjoyable.

​

All very different but my god I do love them all. I have read and re read these. Only point to note is Stay Standing... make sure you read with a bloody large box of tissues and a water bottle filled with water. You need to stay hydrated. I cried so much and every chapter almost, exceptionally well written. All three are.

  The battle was fought, the war is won. All is well. Why, then, does Harry Potter have the eerie feeling it's not truly over? Hogwarts stands half-broken, its ghosts missing. The Auror program is not what Harry expected. Dementors are fighting for their territory, and Harry thinks someone might be trying to kill him. Is it all in his head, or does the Boy Who Lived have more to do?

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1036611][The Black Sheep Dog]] series by Izzythehutt, definitely.

Starts off with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721/chapters/34243049][In the Black]], followed by its ongoing sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15457248/chapters/35881359][Black Mask]], a fix-it fic in which Sirius is gradually reunited with his family. A very in-depth story with multiple sub-plots and superb character development. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did/am :)

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** linkffn(The Aurors)

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

Both are post-hogwarts fics that mostly follow canon (Hinny and all that).

The Aurors (It's the first book of a trilogy- the last book is abandoned for the time being) is focused on Harry's life as an auror and the mysteries he solve with his trainee, Theia Higglesworth.

Strangers at Drakeshaugh is told from a muggle's perspective about how they see Harry and Ginny's family with their three children. I just loved how it has both a overall plot of a mystery and little scenes that are so normal and "mundane".

**** I couldn't agree more. I'm always so frustrated at how the HP fanfic community tends to adore angsty, thrilling, and adventure fics- and I'm not saying it's bad. Just that it'd be nice to have some more fics that handle more delicate emotions. BTW I really enjoyed Little0bird's the first day as well. It's a post-hogwarts fic on recovering from the war and again, the delicate yet dynamic emotions are conveyed amazingly.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi - probably the father of the WBWL genre, but, you know, actually very very good.

Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos by ACI100 - another one of the "good" WBWL stories, the first 5 to 7 chapters are somewhat cliché but it gets better, trust me.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** Starfox5's Democracy definitely needs to be up here. The way to story is set up and unravels itself is beautiful, along with the manner in which the underlying message is incorporated. Goosebumps.

Definitely a story you can read a hundred times over and not get bored.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  Oneshot, Abused!Harry. Before Hedwig the owl, there was Alastair the spider. In an unforgiving household, 10-year-old Harry has no one else who cares whether he lives or dies. He'll need every ounce of vigilance if he is to survive. Warning: descriptions of physical child abuse.

** Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.
