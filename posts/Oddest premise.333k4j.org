So a few days ago, someone posted a question about requests that made you think "Who the heck is searching for that". Im not sure if this has been discusses recently (grad school has been a beast), but what is the weirdest premise you've ever seen for a fic?


** Ginny dies in the chamber of secrets in CoS, but Harry's soul gets stretched along the horcrux connection to inhabit her now-vacant body.

Harry now controls two bodies simultaneously.

** Without a doubt the honour of 'Oddest Premise' has to go to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325173/1/A-Little-Static-Fling][A Little Static Fling]]. There's a sequel. Both are very NSFW.

The summary: Dobby spends a steamy night with the sock that bought his freedom and won his love.

Kudos to the attentive redditor who first supplied this link.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5528392/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-Beneath][Harry Potter and the World Beneath]] is pretty strange- Harry runs away from the Dursleys and finds this Pellucidar-like world full of Dinosaurs and the like. Also, there's an appearance from Bill "Indiana" Weasley. And Harry gatecrashes the First Task riding on an Allosaurus.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2725514][The Lamentable Comedy of Severus, Half-Blood Prince of Denmark]] in which a young Severus Snape finds himself stuck in the middle of Shakespeare's Hamlet due to an experimental plothole fixing potion.

*** The first one is truly bizarre.

The second...well, it was rather entertaining, even if the premise was clearly thought up whilst...well, whilst in some /altered/ state of mind. We all get the urge to fix plotholes sometimes, I suppose, though usually we don't use characters from another universe to investigate them.

***** I think "inspired by a dream" is the excuse Aphex Twin used when someone asked if the music he wrote was inspired by drugs. In a later interview, he said "don't be stupid, of course it's fucking drugs" or something in that line.
