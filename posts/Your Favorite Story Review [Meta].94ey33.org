Dunno if anyone else has a favorite review they've seen or written yourself but sometimes people have fun with them so they stick out in my head. Just the other day I came across a terrible one-shot and replied:

  I'm glad you gave this the crime genre. It's a crime against literature.

  Ah the infamous alignment of Eccentric Evil, where Evil while not intended is generally the side effect of ones actions.

One review I have for several of my stories always posts reviews like this that I tend to find highly amusing. I always enjoy reading those.

I always like reviews that actually pick apart a chapter and look at motivations and reasoning behind it.

As far as insane rants go though...

  Why does night have to be so evil? I find night to be a peaceful time and very pretty depending on circumstances. I'm a weather fan too so I love it when there is interesting atmospheric effects and Great Britain sits smack dab in between air masses so is fascinating to follow weather patterns. Plus their weather people are smarter then ours here in America.

  Ours in America have been dumbed down to almost cartoon like graphics made for mobile phones barely giving you correct info where as when we all had PC's it was getting more advanced with experimental 10 day casts. Now it's all hidden away. It's there but you won't see it on mobile and on a computer you have to hunt for it.

I...what? What the hell does my story have to do with weather, weather apps, or how the American Media is conspiring to dumb down forecasting for the ignorant masses?

  Seriously, who hit your head when you were little? Who rejected you? Why all your stories so depressing?
#+end_quote

Well at least I did something right :)

It sure as hell beats the countless other reviews that say "Please Update" or "Good job". Hell freaking [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8200620/1/James-Potter-Was-Sad][James Potter was Sad]] gets better reviews than my work sometimes.

** My favorite was on my own story by a guest

#+begin_quote
  Please write the next chapter already. Thank you very much. I really appreciated it and like it a lot. Please have Harry take a potion to look like a girl and then have him get raped by a boy. Thank you in advance.

This was on my Harry Potter/Sherlock crossover where NOTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENED LIKE WTF
