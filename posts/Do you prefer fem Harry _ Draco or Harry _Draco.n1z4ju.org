I've planned out this mega long fanfic series which is a rewrite of Harry's hogwarts era, with plenty of opportunities for sequels and prequels and spinoffs of the series. Frankly, I'm quite excited to begin writing. The thing is, I'm unsure whether I want it to be a fem! Harry story or not. It is drarry endgame, very eventual with their romance beginning sort of 5th year. Do you prefer fem! Harry / Draco or Harry /Draco?

(Fem Harry's name would be Ivy James Potter. Ivy because Lily wanted to continue her family's tradition of botanical names and James as her middle name because on the birth certificate James accidentally wrote his name absentmindedly instead of Jane. Lily was not amused.)


** By pure curiosity, I you are ready to gender bend one of the character, why isn't fem! Draco on the table?

Concerning the favoured pairing, I think I prefer Harry/ Draco? I'm not a big fan of slash, but for some reason the girl ending up with the guy that abused years (or tried to) for years leaves a bad taste in the mouth , which is also one of the reason why I don't really like Hermione/ Draco). There is probably some unconscious sexism involved since a man experiencing the same thing bother me less but whatever.

*** Quite honestly, I've never actually considered writing female draco. I think perhaps it's because of a lack of fics with that ship? But now you've brought it up my mind is definitely whirring lol.

And yes, I do agree with you. It's why I hate any harry/Snape slash or dramione. I like any drarry slash, including gender bends, but I won't read it if it isn't eventual! Slash because again, like you said, suddenly falling in love with someone who was nasty to you for years is just icky.

Thank you for replying! You've definitely awoken that dusty fem!draco corner of my brain lol :)

  Dumbledore arrives on Harry's parents' doorstep on the evening of his seventeenth birthday and reveals to him that Voldemort is not really dead. There is a Prophecy, and he believes Harry is the subject. But there is more to the Prophecy than even Dumbledore knows, and the Girl Who Lived, Iana Malfoy, will prove to be central to everything.

** Since genderbending is on the table, I'm now curious about stuff such as Harry/fem!Draco.

With genderbenders in general, I think the most interesting part is reading how gender changes interactions and circumstances. Say, would Ivy Potter be treated differently by the Dursleys? Stuff like, sexism, how much more badly it was seen in the 90s to hit a girl. Would Dudley still be as nasty to her as he was to Harry? Would Petunia perhaps be even more of a spiteful shrew towards her than to Harry?

And further, into the Wizarding world. We know the prophesy specifically mentioned the chosen one as a "he". Assuming Ivy is still part of the prophesy and the GWL, just changing the pronoun to "she", would it be possible that some other unlucky girl had her parents tortured to insanity/murdered in Neville's place? How is sexism in the wizarding world, and how would it affect stuff for Ivy, as the GWL?

Had a weird idea about said unlucky girl. Canonically, unlike many fanon plot points, Susan Bones is not actually an orphan raised by Amelia. She does have her parents. Though being targetted by the prophesy, and having her parents tortured to insanity, might be an interesting setup to make that happen. Or maybe we'd have a fem!Neville running around. Or the prophesy was gender-neutral and Neville still applied, leading to tragedy.

On an unrelated note, about fem!Draco. Would she try to emulate Lucius as much, be as close? Would Lucius be disappointed his only heir is, well, a heiress? Or would she perhaps lean more on the "Black" side from Narcissa, as it were? Would she try harder and be even more obnoxious to impress her father instead?

But anyway, I digress. As to the choice between fem!Harry/Draco and Drarry. While I think both could work pretty well, I'd go with the former mainly out of curiosity, see how their rivalry would manifest in those circumstances.

*** Thank you so much for your comment!! You've sparked many thoughts in my brain, and I'd quite like to answer and add to your comments.

I think the Dursleys would treat Ivy differently. The house would certainly be rife with sexism and misogyny, especially from Vernon. I think perhaps he'd be less inclined to physically hurt her with cuffs around the head or slapped wrists, like perhaps he would be/have been with Harry, and rather favours verbal attacks about her gender or looks or stupidity etc. Petunia would almost certainly buy into gender stereotypes, so Ivy would grow up with comments like "a lady does not curse" or "girls should have long hair." Perhaps even racism within the household, if you picture harry/ivy with darker skin like some do in fanon.

In my head, for some reason, Harry has a darker complexion. I'm quite a fan of desi Harry. However, though with not as pale skin as Lily, Ivy looks quite a lot like her. Her hair isn't a blood red but rather a deeper auburn and hair is far curlier. So that would definitely impact Petunias behaviour, with her niece looking far too like her dead freak of a sister. Perhaps ivy's hair lightens to that same blood red as she grows older, and Petunia despises her even more for it.

Your comments about the prophecy I found particularly insightful and thought evoking. Honestly the whole concept of Susan being part of the prophecy is very intriguing. I'm not certain I would gender bend neville? Who knows. Or maybe the prophecy is in gender neutral pronouns, and the reason why Voldemort chose Ivy is because, unlike a male Neville, Ivy is his opposite and yet equal in every way. Or perhaps he too buys into the whole sexism thing like a majority of the wizarding world does.

About fem draco, I really like your ideas. I picture a slightly (and by slightly I mean very) snobby little girl who tries to be the proper heir her father always talks about, but still cannot achieve his unfairly high expectations because she is a girl, not the boy her father hoped for. Which would beg the question if she is an only child or not. But I thought for depths sake she would be an only child, perhaps due to Narcissa being unable to carry another child to term for reasons unknown (a family curse maybe, or due to the severe inbreeding. )

I quite like the idea of fem Harry, especially for the plots I've come up with.

Thank you! :)

**** Tom comes across to me as sexist at face value but it's really because the people he's grown up with let him be disparaging. He actually thinks most men (aside from himself) are equally useless as agents. He recognises society privileges men so as hench people they have more utility. It is sexist but nothing would be helped from pointing that out to him.

otheewise feels more like the gender got changed just to make it m/f instead of m/m which is just pointless imo. Though in gen I usually only like genderswap when changing the gender changes something about the character and how they interact with the world otherwise it seems kinda random.

****** I think you'd have to emphasise it in your writing. I do agree that the wizarding world is fairly egalitarian but I think you can safely assume that if the WW is racist against blood, then it would definitely be sexist.

You could easily work in the lack of equal opportunity. Things such as how only 9 of 35 ministers of magic are female, the role quite a lot of women seem to take on in Harry Potter (being mothers and wives, which is not a bad thing, but there seems to be less of a focus on their careers and aspirations)

You could also write in the idea of males being perceived as true heirs, the children men from long lines, such as the malfoys, seek.

******* I suppose, I'd honestly say though that the Wizarding World of the 90's is less prejudiced against women than the real world today. Gender seems to play no role at Hogwarts or in government. Half of all Ministers for Magic since the 19th century have been women. Amelia Bones is head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement until her death and replacement with a Death Eater. Out of the few named Aurors we know of, two are women: Tonks and Alice Longbottom. Women appear to participate in gender integrated sports, and have no discrimination for employment, taking high positions at Hogwarts (where they make up a representative percentage of faculty and staff) and in the Ministry.

This is perfectly fine and extremely common in fanfiction, but the concept of Wizarding aristocracy is fanon. The only "heir" in canon is the Heir of Slytherin.

I think it's more along the lines of inventing it. Which is, again, fine and extremely common in fanfiction today. It's also a bit glaringly obvious and out of place when I come across it. It's like inventing a problem so the author can soapbox about it, just not personally a fan.

** Id say an advantage would be to ensure the character, who will mostly narrate the romance, is of the same gender(s) as you are. This way you will have a sample of the way it feels for you which will add a nice dash of authenticity.

However that's minor, other than that unless you plan to include a very large amount of smut the situation would be more or less the same, unless you want to dig into gender norms in the Wizarding world as well, but that's a whole different kind of fic.
