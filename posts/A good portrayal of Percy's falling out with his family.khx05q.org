To me Percy's falling out with the family is what makes the series so relatable, not that I personally have experienced it but it happens a lot.

I've come across 3 fics where Percy is suicidal, largely because he thinks his family hates him. They're mean to him but then come over all sad when they realize he's been harming himself. Poor kid. Don't feel like linking to those. Don't want to read anymore suicidal Percy stories.

But I did find a decent portrayal of Percy's falling out. It doesn't just randomly force lines from canon. It's the chapter titled '1995' from the story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13524997/6/Must-Be-One-of-Arthur-s-Boys][Must Be One of Arthur's Boys]]. Sample line: "You act as if you're so above everything, that politics are beneath you, you don't care about expectations-well idealism doesn't put food on the table, now does it?" I guess canon just gives us this view of Percy being the stuffy unlikeable one but fanfic helps explain why he is the way he is I guess.


** The story Hunt by White Angel of Auralon has the story arc that Percy's falling out with his family was to protect them.
