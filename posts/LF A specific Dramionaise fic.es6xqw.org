Here's what I remember - takes place during the war, Draco and Blaise have a country house or a cabin maybe where they have Hermione stashed recovering. I /think/ it starts as Draco/Blaise and becomes Dramionaise but I'm not sure. Hermione can barely use magic and is recovering from torture and war wounds I think, and Draco helps Ron and Harry. That's all I can remember; any help at all would be much appreciated!


** I actually know this one! I don't know how to use the ffbot so sorry about that but the fic is No Greater Love by colubrina. She's one of my favourite fic authors!
