Yes, god forbid a character wants to follow rules that are in place instead of rushing off and having a near death experience every year of your education.

**** You mean, snitch Hermione who setup an illegal DA? Charmed coins to go jinx anybody who did snitch? Was willing to go against a decision by the ministry to execute Buckbeak? Who helped care for and sneak out an illegal dragon from Hagrid? Who confounded Cormac McLaggen during Qudditch tryouts? Who refused to let Harry go alone when he was going to steal the Philosopher's stone, even after he offered? Who stole books from Hogwarts to help on the Horcrux hunt?

Hermione is willing to break rules, she does it all the bloody time. The difference is, unlike Harry, her first response isn't to rush into an unknown dangerous situations with zero thought.

Turns out...the broom was from Sirius Black.

********** Where did I say she was a goddess? I just pointed out he multiple instances that disagree with your characterization of her.

Hermione has many flaws, she's bossy, she always thinks she's right, she is obsessive to the unhealthy degrees and she can be judgemental. However, she's also incredibly smart, very loyal, strong in her beliefs about what is right/wrong and will break rules if she believes it to be right, even if she fundamentally believes rules should be followed.

********* She didn't tell Harry that she thought Black had given him the Firebolt. Of course he was happy about the broom, it wasn't like he'd had much in the way of presents in his life up to that point. If Hermione had expressed her thought to him in private and told him that she was going to a teacher because of it, I wouldn't be calling her sneaky. When did I say that she should've let him 'potentially kill himself'? If you read my comment, I said that she was justified in going to a professor, but Harry had a right to know that she was going to do it.

**** By the end of first year, she's probably the one who's kissing Dumbledore's ass /the least/:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round --- that took a while --- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall --- he already knew --- he just said, ‘Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.”

  “D'you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father's Cloak and everything?”

  /“Well,”/ Hermione exploded, “if he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.”

  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .”

  “Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course --- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you --- but the food'll be good.”

And she already kind of has an "ends justify the means" attitude throughout the books. Trapping Skeeter in a jar and blackmailing her, permanently scarring Marietta, etc.

**** I mean, what? Hermione in the books is totally on the same page with Harry and Ron about 90% of their rule breaking and even proposes some of its most outrageous points like the DA. She gets dramatically less high - strung after the troll incident as is literally pointed out in the books.

As a whole you sound like a typical case of "read so much fanon I forgot the source material" how exactly do you expect a 11-17 year old to get more proactive than canon Hermione, she tops her classes, researches the systems she is fighting, and literally bugs Harry to start a practical defense club even though it's what she is literally worst at.

On the point of kissing Dumbledore's hindquarters yall need to seriously remember that manipulative!Dumbledore is purely fanon material.

**** Hermione become more proactive? unlike Ron and Harry she is the more active one. she study more advance magic some beyond her year level.

In the first year she push toward studying who Flamel is.

In the second she find out about the Basilisk.

In the fifth she come with the idea of an underground study group for study DADA.

In the sixth year she is the one to steal the books.

Having Hermione more active will simply turn her into some bloody Mary Sue (And this is why some people doesn't like the movies), and you wouldn't need Harry and Ron with her.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
