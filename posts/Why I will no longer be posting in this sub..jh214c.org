Not long ago, someone posted a thread complaining about how people who like stories about sexual relationships between minors and adults are unfairly criticized in this sub:

[[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jgdv0w/can%5C_we%5C_talk%5C_about%5C_acceptable%5C_language%5C_in%5C_our/][https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jgdv0w/can\_we\_talk\_about\_acceptable\_language\_in\_our/]]

Even more disturbingly, many or most of the comments in this thread appeared to support the OP, and defend, to one degree or another, the sexualization of children (ie, pedophilia). Including comments from one poster defending pedophilia because it was a "societal thing in ancient Greece", describing critics of pedophilia as "haters", and complaining that "pedophiles" (in scare quotes) are "acceptable targets".

At last check, the OP had received 62 upvotes. Those odd poster who dared to criticize pedophilia and its apologists was being downvoted, attacked with mocking comments about "pearl-clutching" and "think of the children", accused of dishonesty, etc. As though people who fuck children are the victims, rather than the abusers.

I was aware that such views exist, of course. There are people who will defend anything, no matter how irrational or abhorrent. But I was surprised and distressed by how strongly, widely, and openly they are being expressed here; how overwhelmingly they were being favored and those who challenged them attacked. I do not know if these posters really reflect the majority of people on this sub, or just a vocal fringe that has intimidated and bullied the majority into silence. I sincerely hope that it is the latter. If so, however, those of you who don't share these views need to step up, and speak out, if you do not wish to be judged with the loudest members of your community.

As it stands, I cannot continue to participate in this sub. I do not wish to be associated with a community which tolerates such views, or to tacitly condone them by my presence or my silence. It is one thing for authors to write about abuse as a means of critiquing it or empathizing with its victims (although it takes a very skilled writer to do so with the necessary tact and sensitivity). That is a legitimate exercise of freedom of expression. It is quite another to defend the sexualization of minors for the purposes of "romance" or pornography.

I fully expect that this post will be downvoted into oblivion, along with a slew of trolling, abusive replies about how I'm a prude, I support censorship, how I'm "pearl-clutching", etc. But that response will only prove my point, and underscore the reasons for my departure.


** Taking my comment from the post and posting it here as well as making some edits to it since i wrote it at like 3 am and want to articulate more. i agree with you

#+begin_quote
  see the difference is, Honks ship blasting off when Harry's sixteen isn't that creepy, Their age gap isn't that bad and you could make an argument that the wizarding worlds age of consent would still be 16, since the Muggle world didn't even raise it to 17 until 1950. At the same time though, having 17 year old Tonks getting hot and bothered by 11 year old Harry is fucking creepy as shit, and Pedophilic

  something like Princess of the Blacks where 11 year old FemHarry was a child prostitute who was Narcissa's favorite and no one bats a fucking eye about it, Not even Sirius who's basically her adopted dad doesn't try and murder his cousin when he finds out about it, he just lets her do her own thing.

  For some fucking reason people are ok with Hermione being groomed by Snape because "it's romantic" it's stupid and Pedophile garbage.
#+end_quote

I agree with you whole heartedly, I have already talked about Princess of the Blacks in this sub and asked people to stop recommending it since it was Pedophilic trash, and the amount of people who defended it surprised me.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dbjguo/stop_recommending_princess_of_the_blacks_please/][Here's the thread.]]

the amount of people that are OK with Pedophilia in this community is fucking weird.

** This is actually something that I had never really considered before. I've been an HP fan for almost 20 years at this point, and I've been reading Fanfiction since I was about 12 (like sixteen years ago). I've always known that people shipped these characters, but I never ventured to that side of the internet, nor will I ever. So it was always an out of sight, out of mind topic. I guess I should also say that I don't frequent this subreddit every day.

Coming at this from the perspective of an adult (who also coincidentally works in education), I definitely find the issue of child/teacher relationships extremely problematic. However, the reason it doesn't constitute as “child pornography” is because these are fictional characters. Therefore, there is no victim. I can't issue a blanket statement that all of them are bad because I don't and won't read those stories. I imagine that some are tame...just as I can imagine that others are rather fucked up. Therefore, I'll leave the policing up to someone else and will continue to pretend these stories just don't exist.

THAT BEING SAID, I would definitely raise an eyebrow at someone who writes and/or actively searches for stories with graphic sex (aka rape) scenes between a child and their teacher. That's a little concerning.

I think it's not about the attitude, but the fact that these sorts of relationships are portayed as ok, even cute and good. They are being romanticised.

My concern is how such portrayals affect the readers. As adults we know of course that an adult dating a minor isn't a good thing, but younger people might be more susceptible to influence, and by writing such fics we are normalising something that should not be normalised.

The more you hear something being repeated to you, the more you start to believe it. It's basic advertising, but it applies to everything, even this. The more adult/minor relationships that you see, the quicker it is to accept them as a good thing. This is where the concern is.

Of course we don't see the writer as any more pedophilia excuser than we see a dark fic author as someone who thinks murder is okay. If so, a lot of fantasy authors would be "murderers". This is, once again normalising something that should never be, and even is dangerous to normalise.

Change "murderer" to "someone who fantasizes about murder". Because it's pedophilia when they are attracted to children, even if they don't actually rape them and never would.

And then you wonder if maybe a sizeable bunch of the people who read that kind of thing actually /do/ fantasize about killing, even if they would never ever do it in real life, and there goes your comparison.

But please explain why "hate speech" in fiction is off limits, but sexual abuse of children is not. Do you think someone will read racism or homophobia and internalize those messages? If so, how are you not a hypocrite for wanting people to internalize Snape molesting Hermione?

Personally, i'm much more offended by someone thinking that raping a child = "romance" than i am of anti-semitism or racial slurs.

I'd say that OP did misrepresent the second comment. The comment doesn't seem to be a defense of pedophilia so much as a statement of when pedophilia was acceptable in history. And ancient Greece did have a lot of pedophilia. Anyone ever watch a documentary about Sparta?

The first comment is a bit confusing, but it seems to be a confirmation that pedophiles are currently acceptable targets in current society. But the first phrase is confusing.

Hell the fic wasn't even that bad, outside of the graphical shit and it wasn't a "lets just forgive everything that's happened and be happy" garbage truck fest either, but the amount of shit like it that i've seen on A03 is a big reason why i don't read on it unless i absolutely have too.

** I suppose in some ways it's somewhat hard to empathize with a character who is a child. I how many of these people would still feel the same if they saw just how small and childish an eleven year old actually is.

Ignoring terms like pedophilia or prudes or anything like that, what is it that's bad about someone too old being with someone too young? What is it, do you think, that people see that is bad that other people don't?

I don't agree for the usual reasons. Children are in a vulnerable situation by their inexperience and early stage of development. The trust they put into adults is, by many theories, part of that development. Changing that relationship to something sexual is an abuse of that relationship that is fully on the adult. There is a reason child molesters are killed in prison. Not only do the criminals within abhor that kind of person as far worse than them, but I'm willing to bet the guards aren't really upset about their death either. It's because, as prone to bad choices and cruelty as children can be, they aren't yet part of the greater world. They are considered innocent; not only that, but I'd say they are innocent to boot. Or at least naïve.

Some children, often for awful reasons and experiences, will act out in a sexual way. this is not a sign of a child developing a healthy sexual mindset by any standard. It's a child who has experienced enough to know about sex and sexual roles, without having the comprehension and develop necessary. The concept of a sexual awakening is exciting. In parts for the newness and for the eroticism, but it occurs in stages. Putting a child, a kid, or a teenager who has very juvenile ideas and interests with an adult who knows it all is asking for trouble.

By these terms it is more admissible for an older teenager, one who has gone through puberty, become more of their own person, and approached the older individual as their own person rather than a role model/guardian, to have a relationship with a more older partner, but the proximity to their youth is still uncomfortable.

The "think of the children" arguments attack people on the basis that children don't need protecting in a world where sex is common knowledge in most elementary schools. Children are not asexual. If you can remember your own childhood, i'm sure you remember some kind of passive sexuality. But it is young and undeveloped and has no place in sexual relationship

Edit: like all late night reddit posts, I wrote this with very little mental cohesion. Normally I delete these for everyones sake but I remember being frustrated by the same post you saw and wanted to at least try to framework some of my thoughts. Tell me if I managed to say something stupid or unacceptable. I don't doubt that I have and would appreciate the accountability.

** The thing is that no one is supporting this. When anyone writes a fanfiction or reads it, they want to understand all the aspects of reality that comes with it. Unfortunately in life you can't throw away the bad things and pick up only good stuffs. It has to have both ups and downs.

I haven't read anything like that but I have read excerpts on forced physical abuse, non-con sex etc. The point is that the fic is not all about this, instead it feels like one of the major plot point. Yes some people may feel disgusted to read it but if you can't then don't. It can be taken as an informative piece of fiction that shows us realities of life. This can help someone stay away from such a brewing situation and leave before things could escalate. Every coin has two sides, it depends on which side you're looking from.

Then there are victims who have already gone through it, they might get triggered so it's best to put up warnings about it. But some victims want the world to know what happened to them so that the others don't have to go through it. Knowledge is important, all kind. Unless you know about it, how can you decide its wrong or right? Just take the word of world for it? A just man will always listen to both sides and then decide, no matter the situation. Yes some things are unforgivable and I agree pedophilia comes under it, but if a parent has no idea how to look for signs of such atrocities then how can they protect their children from it?

I'm not saying that everyone should read such fics, I'm just saying that before you start discriminating fics, please look once whether it's informative or glorifying the issue. If it's the former, then it is a useful read but of course if it's the latter then you shouldn't read it. You can't stop others from evaluating such fic for themselves.

That is the actual issue with the rising instances of rape in non-developed countries. They are still Conservative in majority and talks about sex education are non-existent. Since its considered a taboo, people fester these thoughts like a dark secret and act to satisfy their curiosity. This is sick but unless we tackle the root cause of lack of sex Ed, this is the reality we will continue to live in. You can always try and Bury your head in the ground whenever something bad is happening nearby like an ostrich but that will not stop the act from happening. So please guys, educate your children about these, tell them the reality if you want to change it. Tell them how to differentiate wrong from right, don't shield them from the wrong.

If there is still a doubt, let me be clear that my comment supports informative fics about such issues as to how it was tackled and caught. But it does not support the fics that simplicity glorify such issues.

*** I think it depends what you do. I think if you are writting an epic about Voldemort from the orphanage to the night he came for Harry then you can't really gloss over that he murders people I don't think writing such a thing means you secretly want to be a serial killer. You are just adhering to the character

​

but if you write a Harry and Snape fic where Harry is 13. What plot point does it serve? Why can't it be set post Hogwarts with a twenty odd adult Harry?

​

i also think there's a difference between exploration and glorification if Snape is portrayed as a predator and clearly the villain it can be used to show how these terrible things can occur but when Harry or whoever is underage and its treated like any other relationship it seemed very twisted and bizarre because what's the point?

** I've been saying this for more than a year now. These trash have overrun ao3. If you look through ao3 for fics you can see so many written child porn fics and there's hundreds if not thousands of kudos for them. People have been ignoring this for so long and calling me an anti, whatever the fuck that is? And now we're here. Glad to see it get some attention though. Since ao3 seems to be supporting pedophilia it should be shut down.

Also, those of you who are going to downvote me, thank you for proving my point. You think a person trying to exorcise pedo's from a fictional community he loves cares about a few minuses?

** I am always surprised (and a little disappointed) at how many people readily defend pedophilia online. I guess it's because of the anonymity. I don't think many people would defend it face to face in front of their friends and families. Even "normal" criminals like thieves, drug dealers and murderers hate pedos.

That being said, fuck the pedos. Hating pedos is a no brainer. Like hating nazis. Though you should stick around this sub. Rule 8 specifically deals with this problem and if you see anything that violates it you should report it to the mods and it will be removed.

BTW That's why I refuse to use AO3. That they would not only tolerate, but actively encourage with tags, such content is absolutely disgusting.

Sort by controversial. Use your head. Dont fall for "not all underage fiction" is paedophilia.
