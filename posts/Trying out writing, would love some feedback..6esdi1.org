** I think your chapter reads well, though there are some errors/mistakes with your sentence structuring. Also, I have a few recommendations:

1) I would suggest not putting specific hours in where it isn't needed. For example, in your first paragraph, you say that Hermione hasn't eaten in thirteen hours. Unless it is imperative to the plot, you can delete the number of hours.

2) You talk about Cedric's Diggory lifeless face that haunted Hermione's dreams, yet how would she know what his lifeless face looked like? She wasn't in the graveyard the night he was killed, and I doubt Harry went into detail to describe what he looked like after he was murdered.

3) If Hermione is updating "A History of Magic," why is she including the events that happened in Little Hangleton? (Also, note the spelling of 'Hangleton'.)

4) Like DragonSinOWrath said, you have a little too much detail (a prime example of this is when you note Hermione makes coffee the Muggle way - this isn't essential and should be left out).

5) I don't understand why Hermione pens a letter to Harry when she won't be attending the Sunday brunch at the Burrow? Wouldn't it be more courteous and make a bit more sense if she actually sent the letter to Mrs. Weasley instead to let her know that she would be absent?

6) The chapter seems to move a bit quickly. One line you have Hermione sending Athena off to Harry, yet several lines later, the owl arrives back to her with Harry's response. I think you need to use more time transitions to show that some time has passed in between their letters.

7) While this has become popular in FanFiction, I don't believe Harry ever called Hermione, "Mione" - that's not her name. Viktor and Grawp couldn't pronounce her name so they came up with variations of it, while I think Ron called her "Mione" once, but his mouth was full of food at the time.

All in all, you have something good going here (even if I might not be a fan of the pairing), but your writing needs a bit of polish before its published.

*** Thanks for your feedback. I don't agree with all of your points but it's nice to see an outside perspective.

A few explanations:

2) When Harry brought Cedric back with him to Hogwarts Hermione could have seen him then, or it's not really hard to imagine what someone's face would look like after they passed. Closed eyes, pale, etc..

3) She is documenting Voldemort's return to power, the events in the Little Hangleton graveyard after the Tri-Wizard tournament when Voldemort is returned to his body would be highly relevant to that in my opinion.

4) Hermiones tendency to do many things the muggle way will tie into the story later which is why it is pointed out early on.

5) Harry is the one who she was supposed to be arriving with and who had convinced her to go, I will edit to try and make that more clear.

6) I originally had dashes between parts to show that time had passed but for some reason it took them out when it posted so I will have to figure that out, thanks!

7) I think calling her Mione is just a matter of preference and don't feel it distracts from the story, I know it's "not her name" but nicknames are pretty common.

Anyway just some thoughts on your comments, thanks again for taking the time to read and give feedback!

** Overly expository with way too much detail.
