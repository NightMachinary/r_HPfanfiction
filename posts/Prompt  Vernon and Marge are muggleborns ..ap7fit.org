** I'm trying to imagine how this would play out. Both of them hiding their magical powers from petunia (don't use your wand, Vernon, it's unnatural!) until Petunia reveals her witch sister? Or did they continue to hide it afterwards?

Or maybe, both of them refused their Hogwarts letter (don't learn to use your wand, Marge, it's unnatural!) . . .

I'd imagine that they'd both be less horrible to Harry . . .
