** I don't think you'll find very many. I am generalizing about a group I am not a part of, so take this with a grain of salt, but I think that for those who like (and therefore write) the HG/SS pairing, the differential in social status, experience, and institutional power (older/younger, teacher/student, "half-blood Prince"/Muggleborn, "bad boy"/"good girl") is an important part of the appeal. Making Snape just plain shy (as opposed to, say, disdainful of "womanly" things like romance or preoccupied with his memories of Lily) cuts against this differential.

There might be some fics where Hermione goes back in time to the Marauder era, featuring a young Snape, that might have what you are looking for.

*** You make a very good point, and I guess I should have been more specific, by when I was posting this I was thinking about Marauder era fics, because that is where I generally find a shyer Snape.

**** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7843043/1/Severus-Redux]]) has Snape be thrown /forward/ in time to be the same age as Hermione and in the same year. (Original Snape is still around, so he is a time-clone.) I haven't read enough of the fic to say whether it's worth reading.

  A time travel story. When Fifth Year Severus Snape tries to create a forward time traveling elixir to prove his worthiness to join Lord Voldemort, he is disappointed to find that his creation is worthless. Or is it?

***** So, not OP, but I just finished it : I'm not sure if the author is still working on it since it doesn't seem finished, but it was a good enough read. The premises are interesting but I'm less and less interested by teenage stories, I find the social interactions between the characters a bit too cringe-y (which is normal for their age, I guess). But the time-clone idea is interesting.

Makes me want to read a story with a time-clone, but a different story, something like this for example : Severus is thrown forward in time when he's maybe 12 y.o (old enough to know the Marauders and to hate them), Hermione has finished Hogwarts and is a student teacher for whatever subject, she is asked to help him adjust and ends up caring for him (as a younger sibling), which makes her interested in present-day Snape, and their relationship would be the pairing. Young Snape time-clone would maybe "fade" at some point, he's a magic anomaly or whatever. IDK, when reading Severus, Redux it made me want to read something a bit more mature, with older characters, so I came up with something like that.

I read a SBHG where a young Sirius is propelled forward to an AU where adult Sirius is alive. I also recently finished a SSHG with Severus and his ghost both in the same house.

** Severus Snape born 9 January, 1960. Hermione Jean Granger born 19 September, 1979.

And then people acuse Tonks of being a pedophile in those fics that she lusts after Harry..

By the way, Remus is only in the clear because Tonks was already an adult.

** I find Snape delightfully awkward and shy in all of Lena1987's work, might want to give them a go.

He's not generally portrayed as shy in fanfic, which is a big lost opportunity imo, since it's pretty clear that beneath his prickly exterior Snape is probably painfully shy.
