** Only time I've seen it done well is in this story, where Hermione is known as Hermes:

What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.

** I can imagine a situation in which she is continually brewing Polyjuice and finds a Muggle volunteer to acquire hair from, which is better than nothing but still quite frustrating because she wants to be /herself/ and have a properly gendered body rather than someone else. And even then, dealing with waking up in the wrong body because she can't use polyjuice in her sleep, a daily reminder that she isn't what she wants to be.

A lot of potential for a short story on this topic. It would be an interesting complication in a larger story.

** Hmmm. Have you tried "Holly" by Hecateslover? It's rather good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7236252/1/Holly]]

Using a series of potions, Harry undergoes sexually reassignment.

Also, there is one called "Ivy Kissed" where Harry uses Polyjuice to turn into a girl several times. It was written by excentrykemuse but has been removed from the site.

** Lillielle does quite a few outside the norm ficts with Harry and they are very good. Her profile: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/996809/]] and specific to your request: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10239389/1/]]

** Seems sort of obvious, doesn't it? Would write one myself if only I had the time.

Lots of good hooks there that don't need some crazy AU backdrop. Need some inteligent, knowledgeable, and socially responsible and accepting peer character, most likely Hermione, to help drive the narrative and as support, or it is just psychological-torture porn from one end to the other. Real life has enough of that for people already. Conflict seems obvious, resolution and plot structure...less so. To work in magic without it being flippant, tension invalidating, and/or insulting -- hard but possible.

Hmm. Hell, if I can't sleep one night, I'll whip something one shot up and link it here.

Not that it matters to what I'm (theoretically) writing, but what were you looking to see Harry's gender being? Mentally female while physically male, the other way around? Fluid, none? Anything but cis male (edit: or female AU)? The term transgender covers a lot of territory.

*** I've only seen one fic with a trans character (not Harry) and the situation was quickly resolved with magic. Maybe not surprising since it was a side character and they probably didn't want it to dominate the story, but a bit unsatisfying nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised to see trans issues addressed even if only briefly.

** Would making a trans Harry a metamorphmagus be cheating on the issue a bit?

**** This does raise another question. Can a metamorph change their internal organ structure as well (e.g. Tonks getting rid of her uterus and ovaries when assuming a male body)?
