** Because regardless of our perspective as adults viewing them as too young to fall in love, teenagers do fall in and out of love with a fair amount of regularity.

Part of it is just due to them not knowing what love is, and just assuming that was part of any relationship.

Part of it is the deep seated wish in all of us that we met the loves of our lives when we were younger so we could spend our lives growing old together, and it coming out in our writing.
