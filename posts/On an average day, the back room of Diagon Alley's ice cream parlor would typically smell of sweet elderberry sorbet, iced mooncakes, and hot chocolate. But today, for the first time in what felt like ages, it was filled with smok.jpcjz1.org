#+TITLE: On an average day, the back room of Diagon Alley's ice cream parlor would typically smell of sweet elderberry sorbet, iced mooncakes, and hot chocolate. But today, for the first time in what felt like ages, it was filled with smoke and laughter.

"If you think you've an easy advantage over all of us, Albus, you're wrong." Florean Fortescue wagged his pipe at Dumbledore accusingly. "Meet my eyes as much as you like, you won't uncover any secrets that way."

"I'm wounded, old friend," Dumbledore said. "You think I'd stoop to such lows?"

Garrick Ollivander chuckled quietly and rearranged the coins in front of him. "Dumbledore doesn't need Legilimency, Fortie. A mountain troll could notice your tell."

"And," Aurora Sinistra added, "it's all the more noticeable the more you try to close your mind."

Florean replaced the pipe in his mouth. "Fine," he grumbled, replacing his coins in a small leather pouch. "/Urdrig/. I'm out." Purplish-grey smoke curled from his mouth in petulant bursts, forming loose, unruly spirals that matched his wild grey hair. Still, Garrick noticed the corners of his friend's mouth twitch briefly upwards. He knew Florean well enough to recognize when he was in high spirits. Even Garrick was willing to let himself feel a brief flicker of the same warm nostalgia. It was nice to return to the old routines, which years of war and grief had forced them to neglect.

"You are a delightful addition to our Ballynok game, Aurora," Garrick said. "Albus used to always invite Filius or Horace to these gatherings. Imagine my surprise when he turned up with you."

Dumbledore glanced happily at Professor Sinistra and said, "After weeks of meetings with the school governors, I sought a friend who could drown out the coughs and sputters of old warlocks."

"I see only one elderly man in this room, Albus," Florean said, pipe between his teeth.

"Certainly," Dumbledore said. "I find my coughs and sputters the most tedious of them all."
