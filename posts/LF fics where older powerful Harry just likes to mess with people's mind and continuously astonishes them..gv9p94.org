So I was reading a fic "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by kathryn518 and I love it. Though it's a crossover, I want more of fics where Harry's just messing around and doing stuff that everyone thinks impossible.

Can be a crossover, even better if it's a Star Wars crossover.

Here's the link to the fic I was talking about [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For&ved=2ahUKEwi7_sOCu-PpAhUaQ80KHXzrADoQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw0JD1H1G9SYyqkkpj5pSF87]]

I have a feeling I've read others that fit your request, and that they tend to be MoD! fics ^{Master of Death}.

can't remember which ones, right now at least... sorry :P

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

*** He is VERY obnoxious in Daft Morons, the whole fic is a cringe fest, as most of that authors fics. But in "Ah, Screw It!" I found him to be very likeable and interesting. Not even once did his behaviour annoy me, so you throwing both of these fics in the same bucket is absolutely astonishing to me.

****** That's a very smart post! The reason I didn't particularly like the Harry in that fanfiction is that he mentioned his titles a lot. I love humility in a character, but I felt as if every small thing he did had to revolve around his political power. What did you think?

******* Ah Screw It was akin to a crack fic in my opinion. It was okay if a bit outlandish. Daft Morons was a little over the top about it's own idea. The scene where I simply couldn't stand it anymore was when they were all sitting around a dinner table at someone's home and Harry had done something dumb. This was after years of decrying the stupidity of wizards and calling them daft morons. Someone makes a joke about Harry being a daft moron after his mistake and everyone laughs along like it is the funniest thing ever. If I were to describe it in simple terms, the fic was too far up its own ass.

******* Well, he did that to annoy Dumbledore or get his way with the pureblood high society. On many occasions he states how much he hated doing it too. He still hates his titles and is annoyed if anyone else uses them. Not sure how you get a lack of humility from that to be honest.
