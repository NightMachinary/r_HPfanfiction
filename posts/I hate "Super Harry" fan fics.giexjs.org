The only slash fanfic I can recall reading and enjoying was a Death Note fanfic, because I found it very funny. Light ends up eating a slice of cake in front of L, who's suffering under a sugar-free diet. Hilarity ensues.

***** I recently read a story called Azeroth that immediately became one of my favourite stories of all time. I tried finding a link to it for you, but for the life of me I can't find the exact story again.

It's a Harry/Draco story where Harry chooses to apprentice in Potions in his "8th year" and engages in an alchemy project alongside Draco.

I don't think I've ever read a story about Potions/Alchemy that is as legitimately believable. I firmly believe the author is a time-travelling alchemist and should be burned at the stake.

***** Try Blood Magic by Gateway Girl. There is some mentioning of male/male romance and a kiss, but apart from that it is very tame. It is a Severitus fic, a fic where Snape is the biological father of Harry and most of the story is about that.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719610]]

Two het stories that are relatively unknown and that I like to recommend are:

"The Seamstress and the loveable stray" by Katinka31 which is a story about Sirius and female OC that was written before OOTP came out, so some of the facts about Sirius don't fit the canon established in OOTP, but it is a great read anyway. linkffn(714431)

"The Potion's Master Apprentice" and the whole "Darkness and Light" series by R J Anderson. Snape paired with a female OC. linkffn(1546145) This too was originally written before OOTP came out, but later had some revisions to include the OOTP canon. It is not compliant with HBP and DH, yet interesting nevertheless.

****** There's definitely some theatricality in the character that was brought to life by Rickman.

I personally really enjoy the various conflicts that shaped him - when I've got my "writing brain" switched on, I find I can do more with Snape's character than for other characters. Lots of room for interpretation. Lots of unknown facets to his background and motivations that can be easily molded to make him redeemable or unrepentedly despicable. He's a fence-sitter, but disciplined, and very talented. Likewise he's in possession of skills and has influence that can make his character a fairly active component in a wide array of stories (Potions master, DADA skills, teacher/mentor, spy, legilimens/occlumens) - he's very interesting. His strained relationship with Harry, in the right hands, can lead to interactions, tension, and dialogue that you just can't have with any other character.

There's a huge amount of opportunity to expand his character to fit whatever story you write. Once of the best stories I read about him had him in post-war Britain living his life as a cross-dresser. And somehow the author was talented enough to make the character believable in that context. I doubt I could believably picture any other character doing that.

** The problem with Harry Potter I would say is that the Dark Lord is tremendously powerful, that is, one of the most of powerful wizards of his age, and Harry - well, he's just a kid.

There isn't a "proper" form to deal with Voldemort other than relying on LUCK to solve the Voldermort problem in realistic terms.

That's why if you don't power-up Harry or deal with Voldemort thanks to immense luck, there's no point in the story.

Regardless, some OP fics are just ridiculous because of how powerful make Harry. In order to engage the reader you have to make the protagonist suffer a little, I would say. If not, where's the sense of adventure? 😌

So there has to be balance. Harry has to be almost as powerful as Voldemort or equal to him, or the story has to be inventive enough to solve the Voldermort problem in a creative way.

***** Who COULDN'T help harry with defeating Voldemort? All the professor's have specialties that they could help harry work on, or help Dumbledore build a plan that plays to each of their abilities. For instance McGonagall using transfiguration to trap or otherwise impede Voldemorts ability to move as easily and Flitwick's dueling specialty and Dumbledore's versatility/power to occupy Voldemort's actual face to face fighting while someone else sneaks up to put him down for good. (Sneak attacks are anticlimactic but just a rough example off the top of my head) I personally love stories that Flitwick steps up to help harry since he is afterall a former duelling champion.

In summary JK Rowling wrote in a decent amount of impressive adults fan writers could use as well as tons of adults that she didn't specify much about, which allows a technical non-OC character that the fan writers could develop more. After all, any adult teaching in that school should be better off fighting Voldemort than a virtually untrained child.

Or I've also seen a few fics where harry gets the ministry to work with him, like Amelia bones and the unspeakables.

Harry can definitely be overdone to a ridiculous extent, but he's the Chosen One of this story; if he's not at least as powerful as Dumbledore, then he doesn't have a snowball's chance in Atlanta in personal combat against Voldemort. Sunshine and roses aside, Dumbledore was the only person the Dark Lord feared, with good reason.

**** But that's the point right. We have the meta knowledge to know that Harry wins, If he didn't it would be a cheap "look I subverted hahaha", but the journey and situations he has to go through in order for the author to show he's ready to slay Voldemort is what the story should be about. (At first, more after Hogwarts stories guys)

The powers are cool and all but what does it mean for Harry to have and use them?

If Harry could one shot or even challenge Voldemort, he should just do it. Its one of the reasons people dislike Dumbledore.

***** Raw potential means d*** all compared to experience and training. A good Super! Harry shows the training, research, and backbreaking work that otherwise goes into becoming the next Dumbledore.

As for Dumbledore's seeming inaction, I actually have a reasonable explanation. At the time of his death at the end of 6th year, Dumbledore was either 115 years old (if we go by his canon birth year of 1881) or 150 (if we go with the number Rowling gave in an interview). In 1980, when the prophecy was given, he was 98/99 years old (using the former year of birth), almost a centenarian, extremely elderly by any standard you choose to use, Muggle or Wizard. Until 5th year, he had three full time jobs; a Headship, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump of The International Confederation of Wizards. That's a massive workload for anyone, let alone someone in the 100+ demographic. Simply put, Dumbledore is playing Twister and has stretched himself too far to do anything else.

****** "Raw potential means dick all compared to experience and training." That's not necessarily true. The idea that a group of teens hold off Voldemort's best and the many other feats of Harry Potter year 2 and 3 prove that.

Magic has always been an equalizer, one of the reasons I don'y buy the gender power dynamic in a lot of fics.

Albus Dumbledor at age 114 was able to out duel a revived Voldemort while protecting Harry Potter. In what Harry described as some of the most impressive and creative magic he'd ever seen. Albus Dumbledore had constantly at ages 95-99 fought "Full Power Voldemort" to numerous stand stills.

And by wizard standards it wasn't very old.

Albus Dumbledore having all these titles most likely didn't attribute to workload and were adviser roles, and even for Hogwarts Minerva most likely did the day to day paperwork.

**** That is something that bugged me about canon HP. The prophecy stated that he was born with a power that the dark lord knows not.. The ending given in the books is Harry's capacity for love and his willingness to sacrifice himself coupled with the fact that the Elder Wand was technically Harry's is what won the day..

However, that is utter bullshit. Voldemort would never DO those things. But he sure as hell knew what they were. Besides, the whole reason he survived was because his MOTHER had those same qualities. Voldemort has experienced several wizards willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their loved ones. Did he understand it? No, he was incapable of understanding why someone would give up their lives for another. But he KNEW it.

Even if we factor in the Elder Wand. Voldemort KNEW the wand. Hell, it's the reason that he was carrying it in the first place. Even then, it's not a 'power' it's a tool. A very powerful one, it by itself is not a power.

Honestly, sometimes it feels like J.K.Rowling just couldn't decide how to make Harry powerful enough to fight Voldemort without making him godlike, so she came up with some cop-out chain of events to set the stage for Voldemort to disintegrate from a bloody Expelliarmus.

** The only SuperHarry I can stand is extreme post-hogwarts. There's a Dresden crossover that has Harry as an old, old man as the protagonist - he dies, goes on the train, only for someone to call on the phone requesting the Master of Death. He is summoned, makes an entrance, and transfigures a weird eldritch body into his human shape again.

He's pretty damn powerful in that story, but it feels believable, because he's like 120-170 years old by that point, with the majority of those used to hunt dark wizards.

Here's a link btw, just read the parts in order: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-dresden-files-the-master-of-death-part-iii.214737/]]

I think a lot of it is the attitude as well. Lots of these stories feature a little kid with an ego so large it eclipses Jupiter, and most of the time the story portrays it as acceptable. That creates a dissonance in the reader; you want to slap this kid for his comments, insults and general cringiness, but the story people are genuinely cowed or respectful towards him.

I think making a compelling character is the bigger problem. I like stories where the protagonist is absurdly powerful, but uses this power in ways that aren't cruel or disingenuous or hypocritical. Power comes with responsibility, and I like to believe that most people would do a vibe check with themselves if they suddenly found themselves being a god.

Interestingly, Core Threads does this well. This Harry is on the upper end of the power spectrum, but he has a very consistent and likeable characterisation. It sort of falls apart towards the end, but especially the middle, before he gets the three hallows, I consider the best super!harry from a characterisation standpoint.

For Artemis Fowl, I don't mind someone turning Harry more into him, though I think the enjoyable aspect there was that Artemis /didn't/ have magic - and so he had to rely on his intellect (even if boosted up by the author) to manage anything.

In my opinion, this is the best way to write a story about a character with god-like strength: focus the plot on other types of conflicts in which that strength is not a trump card. That's what Neil Gaiman did in writing the /Sandman/ graphic novel series, in which the main character is something higher than even a god.

** I theoretically love stories with a very powerful Harry, but a lot of them are terribly written trash. Good heroes need adversity and obstacles to overcome (duh)! If Harry can just breeze through everything it's not interesting (duh)!

I want a super Harry story were Harry grows magically extremely powerful from a very early age, but that creates many problems for him. Examples:

Every wand he tries to use burns out after just a few days and he constantly has to get a new one. This could lead to all sorts of interesting developments. He could try staffs (since they can handle more power) but finds them too limited. He could try to make his own wands, but he learns that making good wands is a skill that will take him at least years of dedicated work to master. He could temporarily solve it by scrounging old wands from the room of requirements, but they don't work well for him and (of course) burn out fast.

Every time Harry casts a spell or tries transfiguration etc. the power is like a horrifically powerful firehose of streaming magic. Whatever spell he is trying to cast gets turned to 11 and Harry has to concentrate very hard to limit his magical output so that the spells he uses are even remotely useful.

When Harry daydreams or actually dreams, magic just leaks out of him and causes unexpected magical phenomenons around him causing him to have a room all to himself but leads to social isolations.

People fear him because sometimes his accidental magic is dangerous and his social isolation makes him lonely and a little bit resentful of all the fun and joy of other people being casually friendly with each other around him. His social interactions consist mostly of scholars and teachers and Dumbledore who becomes his reluctant mentor because there's nobody else who can understand powerful magic in the same way. Maybe Harry still goes to classes, but while he's the most powerful he is outshined by some scholarly types who understand magic much better in a theoretical way, including Hermoine who can even do magic better because she doesn't have to strain against her own magic to not explode the whole room. Maybe an adversarial relationship could be created based on that that later develops into a friendship. Or some other character. Whatever.

My whole fucking point is that a powerful super Harry could be written in an interesting way. It's like trying to write interesting stories about Superman. Writing interesting stories which have great power is difficult, but possible and I desperate want to read them. Alas, they are few and far between.

One powerful!Harry that I absolutely love is Fate is a Four Letter Word by Philo on ao3.

It is about a 40+ year old Harry who is married to Ginny and lives a quiet life as "man next door" with a career as a carpenter. Ron is an Auror and Hermione a lawyer. James, Rose and Albus have graduated while Lily and Hugo are in their last years at Hogwarts.

His live gets turned upside down when Ginny gets murdered. To the ministry it is an open-and-shut case while Harry and friends quickly suspect political motives. He and his friends have to catch Ginny's killer(s) and keep themselves and their children safe and prevent the rise of a new pureblood supremacist movement. Yes, there is an attempt at Harry's life bc he is powerful and thus seen as a threat by the enemy.

It is a great who-dun-it with plenty of plot twists and I can highly recommend it if you like that sort of story. While Harry is powerful, there is no powerwanking - he is still "just Harry".

Most people are put off by the main pairing (slash and Snape), but this is unjustified. Give it a try, you won't regret it. linkao3(4267422)

** Super!Harry is boring, agreed - to me, it's because it doesn't feel earned and reduces all the challenge.

That being said, powerful Harry fics /can/ be good - but what is important there is that you need to have buildup to it (having it in his backstory is almost impossible to make work, for instance) and it needs to adjust his challenge. If the main challenge for such a powerful Harry is still Voldemort, than Voldemort - or his followers - need to be made into a bigger threat (eg, making them more strategically smart). Otherwise, a powered up Harry might just roll over them. If the challenge is something else, one way to make it work is to make it not dependent on his magical power - where it does nothing to help him.

I've read some fics that manage to make powerful Harry work like that - by making the powering up take a while, be at a real cost, and with either alternate goals that aren't helped by that power (or hindered), and/or a more powerful Voldemort.

*** I've yet to see a story, and I'd like to sometime, which ups the ante on every character.

- Everyone worth their wand has an expanded trunk. Harry's is cozy and nice, with a small living/bedroom, a few bookshelves and an explosion-proof potion area, but Malfoy has a 1:1 copy to his father's mansion in his trunk. Even Ron got his mum to enchant his trunk with a replica of his room at the burrow.

- When channeling strong magic, the body reacts. People's eyes glow, their hair sparks, etc. It's part of being a wizard.

- Unique abilities are dime a dozen, and most wizards will eventually develop one as they grow into adulthood. Dumbledore for example is so good at transfiguration he's figured out how to transfigure space itself. Snape has a supernatural sense for potions, to the degree that he can literally make one up as he goes along. Voldemort has the ability to sense any sort of magic cast, performed or existing around himself. Just stuff like that.

- Dead houses are dead for a reason, and once a name has been declared so, it is dead for good. If a muggleborn with the same name wishes to create a new bloodline, they can of course take the name for themselves. However, inheritances work like they do and no assets sit around waiting for a dead family.

That last one may be overly indulgent, but I can't stand that trope.

An AU that takes place in a perpetual magical golden age (in the sense of innovation and magic, not socio-economic) would be very interesting to read.

Alas, most stories of this type I've read glorify and justify magical racism through bloodlines, which inverts the trope and makes it equally bad, just in the other direction.

Although whether skill/experience or power, people have different abilities to work magic. I usually assume, that most specialise on a few spells for their work. That explains why there's an economy - not everyone can use magic to make clothes, for example. Or to repair complicated items.

I don't think this is the case for two reasons:

1. This could just mean that most people just never need combat magic after Hogwarts. Most wizards are probably great at summoning charms and cleaning charms. But most wizards probably aren't skilled with shield charms for the same reason most Muggles don't know martial arts. It generally isn't needed in daily life.

2. The people we learn about in the past of canon are the Dumbledores, not the Mafalda Hopkirks, but there were probably mostly Malfalda Hopkirks in the past too.

Watching a brutal back and forth spell off where Harry's enhanced abilities make him even with a Dark Lord 54 years his senior, and not "EXPELLIARMUS!" trying to fucking disarm Voldemort.

It's why i Like fics that power up Harry and don't buff anyone else, but just removes PIS and makes Voldemort use spells that aren't Avada Kedavra (Which by the Final battle had failed against Harry twice) and makes him years of Dark Lord abilities, but Harry's Super abilities make it a Shonen style Power vs Skill clash.

Though sometimes I do like ridiculously Super Harry. Reading Harry beat Voldemort using the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, the Giga Slave, summoning Cthulhu, by literally being the God of the Bible, with the Kamehameha, with Hakai, having Zeno-sama erase Voldemort because Harry is Zeno-sama's friend...

Voldemort essentially offs himself due to his fear and power hunger. Harry just pushes him along through bravery and self sacrifice. It's a victory of virtuousness rather than power. Personally, I think that's a better story than Harry getting a power up from a Magical McGuffin. But I can see how others might disagree. I can see the appeal in an epic showdown.

And it's fanfic so I see the appeal of going in a whole other direction. I just personally find it a bit less compelling.

I mean yes, he is powerful, but just like a special forces guy, a bullet to the head should take him down. a thirty year veteran could be taken down by an 18 year old that was trained and has experience. Would not be easy, but a lucky shot should take them down.

Thrity guys should be able to get him if Voldemort is not using something like Fiendfyre all around him. But no, it is imposible because he has the power of a god, the reflexes of a snake, the strenght and endurance of giants, and the luck of the devil.

I have seen many posts saying that a 17, or even a 15 year old, that it is imposible to even touch him, that that makes him a super harry.

You say he had to stop practicing at some point, but the shit he does in the ministry in order of the Phoenix is LEAGUES beyond anything we'd seen up until that point. Like, until then, the patronus was the most advanced magic we saw. Then Dumbledore and Voldemort just absolutely hammered it. Like, even Molly Weasley is beyond Harry's capabilities, and she was a house wife for years. Harry can barely tickle a serious Bellatrix, but Molly Weasley can annihilate her. In all honesty, that's my favorite thing about the Harry Potter books. It doesn't matter how strong, or smart, or dedicated someone is to their craft.

Don't know if it's played different in the book, but harry stayed there in the background doing absolutely nothing at all, though I can see he was most likely unable to move because of magic pressure shenanigans. Like had there been one more person, a competent/experienced one, could they have won while voldemort tied magic with dumbles someone else casting a cutting curse or AK?

Had Harry actualy trained for war, could he have done more? You say they never saw anything like it before, and I am of the same mind, but would it have been imposible to teach him more? Make him more than a liability, make some hit and run, sneak a peek and shoot something to make voldemort twitch?

Also, Molly is pretty amazing and exemplifies it, if a mother that has not trained for war or not kept in shape at all can beat one of the most "powerful" witches like bellatrix? Why can a Harry trained in fighting not at least survive him? not match him, voldemort could probably, if he actually tried kill, him with some esotheric use of magic, but at least realistically survive him.

Alright, going back to what I wanted to say, a fanfic with a harry trained better for actual fighting could realisticaly do much better than he does on the movies. Not match voldemort but give him pause, at the end at the last fight he matched magics, so magic power itself should not be THAT different.

Voldemort should be able to be distracted by harry while allies run, hit and run tactics could do something, had he no allies or overwhelmed in numbers if he does not escape there should be a chance of making him run or killed.

It's just that, the cliche of only you can do it, no one else has any way to do it annoys me.

** Lol I remember that one.

The problem with creating a "Super Harry" / "Overpowered Harry" story, is that you actually have to devise a method to make him powerful, and for the author that's really flipping difficult to do in a believable way. It took Dumbledore decades of experience for him to be as powerful as... Dumbledore. As far as I'm concerned, without figuring a way to "boost" Harry's power in a believable way, you're looking at similar decades of study and practice for me to believe Harry is comparably powerful.

The Santi's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][/Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived/]] did it quite well.

"Master of Death" versions of Harry are a shortcut to delivering a Super Harry in a not-too-objectionable way. Though Master of Death is such an undefined term that it kinda becomes Godlike!Harry unless you impose restrictions. My favourite interpretation of Master of Death Harry wasn't even a Master of Death-Harry story. Harry's animagus was a crow, and as crows are historically descibed as omens/messengers of death, when he was in that form he could see spirits of dead animals. Very big brain move by the author that I had little problems buying into.

Likewise, having Harry be fundamentally changed into a more powerful person. I.e. in Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] you have Harry get Dumbledore's knowledge transferred to him. That's a "cop out" in a sense, but you at least easily believe his newfound abilities. And Taure doesn't gloss over the fact, he labours over how Harry acquired /decades/ of knowledge in a variety of skills. This allows us to suspend our disbelief - because we understand how powerful Dumbledore is, we can transpose that understanding to Harry. You can't "cheat" your way to power, the audience has difficulty with giving a shit if you just tell them your character is powerful without justification. Another fict that uses this method is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][A long Journey Home]] wherein a "Jasmine Potter" lives for an exceedingly long time, we therefore believe she can conceivably become overpowered in that time frame. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is another one like this.

One way of portraying a powerful Harry is to not focus on generalised power. Many fics go the "Harry understands magic /differently/" route, but that is difficult to write effectively unless you know what you're doing. It takes more than a "Rocky montage" to make me think your character is powerful. It is a much better idea to develop Harry's abilities in a restricted domain, such as:

- Your Harry chooses to invest his time studying Potions. Therefore I believe that he can acquire expertise in this topic with sufficient motivation.

- Your Harry invests more time practicing Transfiguration, I will therefore buy into the idea that he can overpower opponents using advanced Transfiguration.

- Your Harry receives tutelage in overpowering his spells to use the "brute force" method of beating down death eaters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful, but Power is Power]] is a story that goes over how an innately powerful Harry learns to apply his power more effectively. At least then the author provides the baseline power for reference, I can therefore believe that power can be /more efficiently applied/ to overcome obstacles.

I imagine the reason "magical cores" exist is because authors had a difficult time finding ways to develop their character's power. If you have "magical cores", it's easy:

- Your soul is the source of your power, as Harry has a bit more soul with Voldemorts Horcrux in him, that makes him a bit more powerful. But wouldn't that make Voldemort /less/ powerful?

- Using rituals to increase the power of your soul. Harry uses rituals and Dark Magic to become more powerful than normal.

** I have seen 'Super Harry' done well. But the distinction is that he's super compared to others his age. When up against titans like Voldemort or Dumbledore he's nothing great. He's getting there, but still behind. I'd personally recommend Taking Control by fake a smile. Sadly it's sequel never got finished, but it's one of the most well written HP fanfics out there that I've read.

Another good one that I really liked was Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart. This one I only recommend if you enjoy very detailed explanations about lore, and evil Dumbles, and a ridiculous plot wrapped up in a semblance of seriousness. It is a well written story in my opinion. But it was never finished sadly.

*** Oh yeah! There was one story that I really liked. It was a world where every pureblood/halfblood had 'family magic'. Some unique ability that only their clan had. (Gave a bit more reasoning behind the pure blood mania). Harry in this was able to transform into a dragon (Basically Smaug), so he was quite a bit more powerful than his peers as this gave him a damned good control over transfiguration. But he still would be beaten like an amateur by most adult wizards.

It was called Breath of the Inferno by Primordial Vortex. However, it ends after first year simply because the author, despite having very good writing in my opinion, seems to jump from one idea to the next without actually finishing any. It's a shame too, because a lot of his stories really interest me.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

** I've seen a Super Harry done well by playing up the comedy angle...and setting it in a rather grim world that his talents can't easily fix. The juxtaposition is quite interesting to read.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter the Dragon]] has Harry turn into a dragon, with far beyond human strength, ridiculous magical reserves, nigh-invulnerability to magic (even the killing curse), comprehension of all languages, etc - but slower mental maturation than a human, so he's stomping through Hogwarts literally eating his problems for breakfast (the troll in the bathroom was quite delicious) and thinking that in order to be a good dragon, he has to dig himself a lair in the mountains and carry maidens off to it (all with their consent, of course) and have study groups with them.

Meanwhile, it's a world without international treaties, so travelling abroad means negotiating passage with the native wizards; where international people-smuggling rings use extensive mind magic to brainwash people into prostitution etc and pull kill switches in them for if they're rescued; where Muggle hunting has only recently become /unfashionable/ through Dumbledore's efforts; where, if Hermione had turned down the offer to study at Hogwarts, she would likely have disappeared within weeks to become a mindless pleasure slave and brood mare while her parents would lose all memory of her and be magically compelled to have more children for the kidnappers to someday harvest.

It's actually really well written, albeit incomplete (but actively updated).

I remember reading a crossover where Harry is raised by Saitama(from *One Punch Man*), and frankly it's hysterically funny, IMO, but then, Harry being super-powerful is played for laughs, as is the whole fanfic. I still follow it and wait for new chapters, as the author is still actively writing it.

​

There was another fanfic that sort of had an interesting premise, but it had so many stupid "Harry knows something that no one else knows because he's a curious muggleborn" without any sort of justification moments and it just annoyed the piss out of me to the point where I gave up trying to read through it both times I read it.

** To be fair “To shape and change” is actually one of the more down to earth Super!Harry there is, in the sense that at least the author made the effort of seeking out mechanisms for Harry's badassery that didn't involve a little kid being instantly smarter and more powerful than every other character (the whole werewolf thing was because of his parseltonge, although this brings up the question of why others healers with the ability didn't do it sooner).

Really, there are plenty of stories that use the Super!Harry troop much worse than this one. You've seen nothing until you read one of the ones where little six-years-old Harry manages to crumb-stomp all his possible oppositions while getting his degrees at many different muggle universities, building up an harem big enough to make all sultans in history green of envy because of his thousands of noble titles and mastering all known types of magic without a wand (which is supposed in-story to be difficult and yet Harry has no problem).

I get it this is mostly a fun thing that people do for fun and you should continue to do what you think is fun.

But from the perspective of the reader it can get a bit boring when there are no real obstacles for the protagonist. They don't have to struggle for much and its harder to get invested in their journey.

The story of Harry Potter as a series set up pretty ideal obstacles for someone who was like Harry. Even if someone stronger or smarter or better connected would fare much better Harry wasn't that person. So it was still a struggle for him.

The obstacles played to his weaknesses and flaws to a degree in my opinion. But alot of these super Harry or Hermione stories even when the obstacles change they play to the character's strengths. I think it would be so much more interesting to see a super Harry story where he is amazingly strong and competent but the obstacles are such that its still a huge struggle. He still has flaws and weaknesses and the flaws play into those. Change the world and plot to be a more challenging journey for this op character so you can have him be badass get that wish fulfillment but still be compelling.
