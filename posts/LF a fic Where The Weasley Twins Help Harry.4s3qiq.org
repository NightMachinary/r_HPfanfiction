Im looking for ones as the title says because I find those to be interesting in how they try and help him escape from Dumbles or from the Dursleys. I don't care what type I just want to know whats out there.


** There's this one: [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hogwarts_Dawn/index/]] But, it's incomplete. Good part: you can read Harry get helped. REALLY helped.

*** Should say that while this is a good read it is also an OC-riddled crack-fic.
