Lets try something new here guys! Post your best 100k+ words cliche fics, and explain why you like them. (Rich Lord potter-black-etc, marriage contracts, love/loyality drugged by weasleys, theft from vaults, spying weasleys, op-goblins-remove-blocks-horcruxes-and-heal-harry-with-one-ritual-for-free-cause-harry's-nice-to-them, Harry learns Occlumency and is suddenly super smart, and last but not least: super harry kills death-eaters) Lets try to stick to proper grammar and nonslash for this go-around!

My contribution: linkffn: (The Vanishing Cabinet of Time) long, well written, with evil dumbledore and ron, marriage contracts and helpful goblins (and timetravel ofc!) Doesnt go overboard with the cliches, but keeps it nice and even.


** My lord, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8831374/1/The-Power-of-the-Press][*Power of the Press*]] linkffn(8831374) is almost a one stop shop of traditional cliches. It has manipulative Dumbledore, Weasley's that are slightly xenophobic and racist (both Molly and Ginny), a super-smart Harry, Harry and Hermione team up to help to outwit and outsmart the wizarding world, a massive deus ex machina plot device that is mainly used so teenagers can teenager, Harry goes to a foreign school who are so much more advanced and progressive than the backwater Brits, and it goes on.

So why is this fic so good? The easiest way to describe it is as if all of the cliches used in this fic are the Waitrose version to your typical Poundland variety. Not only are the cliches done really, really well but the entire story is almost fun personified at points. It's a tightly written story, with not much in the way of extant threads that never get pulled. The story is easy to read, has tight mechanics, and only has objectionable content when you think too hard. It's not trying to be /Groundhog Day/, it's perfectly happy being /Bedazzled./

It's a perfect example of "cliches are not inherently bad."

*** I second "Stealing Witches". I, like most everyone else, have read hundreds of cliched fics and if an author can write a new story, chocked full of them and it still feels fresh to me, then they have some mighty talent. I think it's because the characters are written so they are believable and relatable. Even the WBWL seems like a real person. It's the only harem fic I read that hasn't gotten icky for me because the author has treated each female with dignity and as individuals determining their own paths.

** My first entry is Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond. As the title suggests, it's a soul bond story. It has Lord Potter, who is wealthy, rich, and pretty much nearly an ultimate Gary Stu. It also has the requisite Weasley bashing, though no manipulative Dumbledore

Another one is linkffn(Harry Crow) If the above isn't Gary Stu enough this probably would fill the gap. Lord Potter, Hogwarts Champion, Weasley Bashing, Dumbledore Bashing, super helpful goblins etc...

linkffn(Faaery Heroes) It's a time travel story with a Harry/Hermione/Luna Pairing. Weasley/Dumbledore bashing and while they don't have titles, they get rich quick.

Last but not least linkffn(5483280) This is probably one of the biggest, if not the biggest Ron bashing fics.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it.

** I haven't read linkffn(7724057) in years, but it was one of my first so I hold it close to my heart. It has all main characters being attractive (I'm not sure if that's considered a trope), it has mentor!severtis!Snape, a Merlin prophecy, magic not seen since Merlin, Lord something or the other, WBWL, neglectful Lily and James (well-meaning though) and a host of other stuff that I can't recall. I definitely think it's worth a shot though because of well fleshed out and unironic it is. Slytherin's Potter is another fic with the most Mary Sue Mary Sue that I have had the pleasure to meet. But it has good guys get godd things so that's nice
