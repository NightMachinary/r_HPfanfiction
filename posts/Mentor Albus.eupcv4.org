  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for since I haven't read this in ages. I should mention, it certainly is /M/ rated. I don't remember if there was any smut, but I doubt it.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
