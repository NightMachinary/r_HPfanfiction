It may start as Harry/Ginny, then he looses his Memory and in the process of recovery fall for Hermione, so in the end, its H/Hr. So far, i know "Notebooks and Letters", "Harry Potter and the Memory Thief" which has a vice-versa content (ok, she already loves him, when she get "memorized", so she is falling in love a 2nd time) and "Harry Potter and the Mauraders Revival" or something like that.

Maybe a Case for the Harmony subreddit, but i wanted to give it a try to see what the results would be here

*** Honestly, no...?

People's desire to do their own paring often gives cannon couple members the shaft, but a premise like this (an event that can cause major trauma to a relationship) is probably one of the more realistic ones.

Despite what we read in our romantic fiction, major things like memory loss, sickness, and the like can put an enormous strain on relationships, and some of them do break down. And it often isn't the fault of anyone in those relationships...

That is, having Harry/Ginny fall apart due to one of them losing their memory (or the death of a close friend, or one being permanently crippled) is a lot more realistic and understandable way for a relationship to fall apart then an author soapboxing on how their personalities are incompatible and they should have never gotten together in the first place.

Edit: I guess it matters if it is like the Hermione one mentioned where the romance broke due to the memory situation and the new romance sparked out of 'True friend who stayed by my side' instead of a memory whipe that leaves love unreturned

**** Well I was specifically referring to the fact that such a situation would really suck for Ginny, especially if he winds up falling for Hermione. Not really speaking to the practicality of it,

But even practically the premise doesn't hold up since Ginny and Harry naturally work well together and thus would likely find their way back together, and Hermione simply doesn't view Harry romantically. I can cede that Harry/Ginny doesn't work due to the trauma but I still don't see how Garry/Hermione happens then

***** Garry/Hermione Forever <3

"Hermione simply doesn't view Harry romantically" That is going to kill pretty much any H/Hr for you, so :P. Although honestly, given how much of a blank slate Harry is (he is very much an Audience Surrogate character), it would not have been hard for it to go in that direction in cannot if Rowling wanted :P.

Although even with that view, a memory loss situation is likely the closest you can get to H/HR no?

"I'm not the person you want me to be Ginny. Maybe I was him once, but I don't remember any of it. But I'm not Him", or the cross "I know you still see me as who I was, but I'm not him anymore. You are hanging onto the ghost of your dead friend" ;)

I'm not sure the one i am recalling is the one the OP linked, I recall one where Hermione gets hit by a curse that removes her memory and the whole world treats it as if she died but Harry...

****** I could see the fact that Harry is no longer the Harry Ginny knows could lead to their ending it. But I guess it goes into the argument of whether Harry also loses his personality along with his memory.

But you're right, memory loss is probably as close as one can get, but again that assumes Harry's actual personality changes too. Also, if a big issue is Harry is at this huge disadvantage because everyone knows everything about him except himself, then the most likely scenario is Harry winding up with a stranger. At least then he is on equal footing.

Interestingly, there is a great hgfan1111 story (think it's Brighter Than Sunshine) where both Harry and Ginny lose their memories and wind up in the muggle world yet someone end up back together. JKR did say they were soulmates so even if we were to ignore post-battle canon events, that alone suggests that even memory loss wouldn't keep them apart.

*** I mean, yeah. On the other hand, with 99% of pairing fics that don't comply with canon pairings but also somewhat follow the epilogue it almost feels like someone HAS to get the raw deal.

That or they are written so OOC so that they can be portrayed as an asshole so they can be removed from the plot.

Which is subsequently why I don't read many epilogue compliant romances that don't feature the canon couples.

**** I had Post-epilogue Fics in mind, doesnt matter, if it follows the Canon pairs. Can be that The Quartet doesnt want to get married and built a Family after 19 Year and after the "Epilogue" they decided that now would be the Time, but then the "Accident" happens
