  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

  Why does everything have to be so black-and-white? Everyone either idealizes it as the greatest thing ever written or devalues it as the worst thing ever written.
#+end_quote

Not everything is being judged in such a manner, at least as far as I've observed it here in [[/r/HPfanfiction/]]. You can often find comments here mentioning a story or another, and then giving a fair warning like “x and y were good in this story, but z was poorly done, so go ahead and read it if you're ok with that”.

HPMoR generally gets a harsher treatment because almost from the get-go, when only the first 10--40 chapters or so have been published, it was being overhyped by the LW community and represented as some masterpiece in making or something. And it had a good potential back then too. As su3su2u1 mentions somewhere in his review (IIRC), the story kinda starts with the implied promise to make characters use various scientific concepts in their decision making, thus introducing and explaining those concepts to the readers as well. But as the story progresses, such concepts start being used as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave][hand-wave]] plot devices more and more. Like with the Fermi calculation example you've quoted, they only serve to demonstrate how awesomely smart and cool MoR!HP is without explaining in-depth what the concepts themselves are about. Harry then starts to use the time-turner as his cookie-cutter solution to pretty much all major hurdles on his way, Harry starts using Aristotelian reasoning to pull solutions out of thin air (e.g. Dementor destruction, partial transfiguration, etc) while the universe readjusts itself to make it all work, VD takes the idiotball, etc, etc. Essentially, HP!MoR turned out to be the exact same type of story it was trying to criticize and deconstruct, only even worse because it was also suffering from grandiose delusions.

tl;dr: HP MoR is facing such a negative reaction partly because it was being overhyped, partly because it failed to meet the expectations of its own fans, partly because of EY's overinflated ego, and partly because of the seemingly cult-like properties both HPMOR and LW communities were starting to develop.

p.s. Incidentally, now that [[/r/HPMOR/]] has noticeably toned down its crusade across various boards, you see pieces of MoR criticism here less often as well.

******* Essentially this. HPMOR isn't all bad, it is well written in parts and Eliezer has some good ideas, but at some point the fic turned unreadable.\\
Instead of showing a 'logical' Harry and how this changes the world he lives in it became a way for Eliezer to show just how smart he thought he was and how dumb everyone else was, by Flanderizing everyone to make them illustrate whatever point he wanted to make.\\
Harry was unrecognisable as a canon character from the start but soon the same occurred to everyone. In the end it was as bad as a Chick Tract.

********* While I do not agree with the flanderisation bit (eh, whatever), I do have to say that the very gist of many people's attitude towards the story can indeed be summed up with [[/u/hovercraft_of_eels][u/hovercraft_of_eels]]'s first paragraph.

To elaborate, no, HPMoR is not a bad story; it's decent and at times even good and if you like the kind of humour therein it can even be quite entertaining for you. That said, it also does have moments where it all becomes stilted---which is why the story is “decent” rather than “good”; the scale is “toxic waste, crap, decent, good, great”, by the way, with the third one being ... well, not wholly good but better than the usual crap, you could say readable---and Yudkowsky got a lot of negative points for his attitude which at times was ... well, frankly, inedible; “arrogance and delusions of grandeur” is a somewhat blunt and mayhap not nice but overall fairly accurate way of describing it. And since HPMoR is, to many people here, “the story written by Yudkowsky”, well ... his attitude suddenly becomes that much more important to people's opinions on HPMoR.

And it doesn't help it when there are people that you could call his people, going around and spreading “truth” that HPMoR is better than the original (no, it isn't, as the latter is overall on “good” which is one grade higher). /That/ is bound to make some people annoyed, really.

  I mean... I've commented on two threads asking for fic recommendations, and I've been downvoted and argued with both times that I made a simple recommendation of HPMOR. I wasn't "crusading" and I'm not part of the "less wrong" cult, and I was met with basically an automatic reaction.

****** For what it's worth, I agree with you. I loved HPMOR specifically /because/ it took pot-shots at canon and smartened-up every character to an unrealistic degree. It's just playing in JKR's sandbox, and realising that within those bounds, you can do anything.

I also love canon, and can appreciate it both within and beyond the context in which it was originally written.
