Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Dark Priestess sought to end the dominion of the wizards over the elves.\\
In her ravenous hatred she found no peace, and with boiling blood she scoured the Magical Britain seeking vengeance against the wizards who had enslaved her brethren.\\
They knew she would come, just as she always had, as she always will, to feast on the blood of the wizards. For she alone could draw strength from her fallen foes, and ever her power grew, swift and unrelenting.
