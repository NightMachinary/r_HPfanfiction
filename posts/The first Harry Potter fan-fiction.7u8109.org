*** Yeah, and before those there was probably some 10 year old kid out there who wrote a 50 word story at school.

** Apparently, the author was originally known as Gypsy Raven, was the founder of "Harry Potter's Realm of Wizardry" (one of the early HP fan-fiction archives), and was also the author of the first Draco/Hermione story.

In any case, she was also the "creator" of the Harry Potter category in FF.net:

"/Four years ago today I E-mailed [[mailto:xing@fanfiction.net][xing@fanfiction.net]] to ask if a Harry Potter section could be made because I had a story almost ready to post. Xing said yes and created the category. Three days later, I got an E-mail from him telling me to post my story or he'd delete the section. I have been in this fandom far too long. *g/*"

*** I don't think that was actually published in 1969. And since it takes place after OoTP, I'm thinking it's probably not the first HP fanfic

  The first message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969 from computer science Professor Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the second network node at Stanford Research Institute (SRI)

  Now AU, 6th Year, following OoTP. Tired of the way Dumbledore and the Order treat him, and ready to face his destiny, Harry dedicates long hours to muggle and magical training to take the fight to Voldemort for a change. Slight HPGW, not shippy though.
