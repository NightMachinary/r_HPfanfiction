I've just finished season 4 of 13 Reasons Why and actually felt kind of comforted by the way Clay's panic attacks in particular were demonstrated, but also nightmares & dissociation, and how all the characters dealt with trauma.

Can anyone think of any good fics that remind you of this? Or just dealing with those things in general, I would really love to read any preferably post-war

TLDR; Looking for well-written fics presenting believable mental health struggles. ik it's vague, but really open to almost anything!

Note: I can't stand Weasley-bashing myself but you're welcome to recommend any if you know some in case someone else comes across this thread and is interested.


** An Hour of Wolves by thebiwholived. Highly recommend.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** linkao3(Break and Fold by Ohwellwhatever)

This whole series absolutely SLAPS. It's canon compliant, relatable, and the later fics really explore some of the trio's cool relationship.

** Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl comes to mind. It's slash Harry/Snape - idk if that might be a turnoff. However, this fic spends a ton of time exploring Harry's PTSD after the war, including nightmares, panic attacks, and depression. Really well written, imo, definitely worth the read if the pairing doesn't bother you.

(Sorry if I'm not linking the fic correctly, I'm not on here enough to know House this works) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714]]

*** Seconded! Immediately the fic I thought of.

linkao3(304714)

For links on Reddit in general put [ link text ] (URL) without the spaces. For fic comms like this one, the fanfic bot is really useful. You use linkffn for fanfiction.net or linkao3 for Archive of Our Own. Between the brackets you can put the story's name if it's a unique title, or put the story's name and "by" the writer's name (Chrysalis by starcrossedgirl), but the best thing is to put the URL or the story ID, which always works.

** For context, some of my favourite fics that might apply to this are

- The First Day: linkffn(4367121)
- These Cuts I Have: linkffn(11317075) and its sequel Some Cuts Leave Scars: linkffn(12787674)
- Cauterize: linkffn(4152700)
- Turn: linkffn(6435092)

I'm sure there are others, but these were really super stand out ones that I often go back to, I've read other good ones but not enough to remember them! But just my recs, some inspiration.

  The war has been won, yet the aftershocks continue. The scattered survivors are left to pick up the pieces and find ways to move on. Join the various members of the extended Weasley family as they struggle to rebuild and cope with the consequences. And of course there are still Death Eaters left to find.
