I am looking for multiple fics, where Harry either quotes Gandalf or other characters, preferably being a smartass while doing so. Also, ones where he essentially acts like Sherlock Holmes (the heroin use isn't necessary).


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) is kinda what your looking for? Harry uses science to explain things?

*** I have read that and it's a very good fic but I was thinking something much closer to Sherlock's personality as well, I remember reading some oneshots a few years back ( on AO3 I think) where he at least talked like Sherlock, (who can tend to come across as more then a little condescending) when explaining things and he was a very keen observer.
