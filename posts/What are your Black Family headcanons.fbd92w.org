  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

** Based on /literally/ nothing but my own overactive imagination:

They killed the family of Muggles that originally lived in Grimmauld Place to claim the house.

Much like how Muggles children of close genetic relations are slightly more likely to develop various blood diseases, the same is true for wizards. The Blacks family line all has one such disease and without proper potions, they may show symptoms through yellowing skin and eyes (like the portrait of Sirius's mum).

Generations ago, one of the members was a Seer. They made accurate predictions about Muggle events like wars and the industrial revolution, and so the family was able to profit by playing the Muggles for fools. It contributed to the family's disdain of the Muggles and is also one of their primary sources of wealth.

They start with magic as soon as they can hold a wand. It's one of the reasons why the house is so heavily guarded: to prevent the Ministry from knowing they violate the rules. And it was his childhood wand that Sirius found and used in OotP. +It didn't work very well anymore.+

** I like the idea of the Black madness being a thing, that all the Blacks have it to some extent and it manifests in different ways. I've seen a few interesting fics where Tonks has to deal with her inherited madness. I'm ok with the idea of the madness simply being genetic quirk, but I also like the thought of it being a bloodline curse of some sort.

Also I have the idea that the family only moved to Grimmauld Place after they destroyed the family mansion by accident and left the ground cursed. Possibly after a failed ritual to try and remove a curse from the family line.

** The reason why the Blacks live in a house in London is because in a city that large the ministry doesn't notice the people going missing when they choose to go muggle hunting.

Just to be clear muggle hunting is definitely a thing in canon, Sirius mentioned that one of his aunts tried to legalize it.

** They all lived in one house.

Many people seem to think it was just Sirius, Regulus, Orion, and Walburga. But if that's the case, why are Sirius and Regulus' rooms on the (at least) fourth floor (5th in the US)? (Basement has kitchen, ground floor presumably has a dining room and parlor, first has the drawing room and at least the room where Molly and Arthur stayed, second floor has at least Ron and Harry's room, third floor has at least Ginny and Hermione, and Fred and George's rooms, and Sirius and Regulus' rooms are the top floor, plus an attic. Not to mention that Bill and Remus were also staying in the house, plus Buckbeak and why is Tonks there at the crack of dawn and not at home?) So with at least 9 rooms, and Hermione saying they cleaned Most of the bedrooms, it would make more sense for all the Blacks to live there. It'd also make sense as to why Kreature cared about Miss Bella and Miss Cissy so much.

I also think that even when married, Walburga and Orion kept their own childhood rooms and were only together for heir-making purposes. I think this because Sirius always calls it his mother's room, not his parents' room.

** AU headcanon, but whatever...

I always wanted to see a fluffy sequel to Wind Shear a decade or so later. I picture Cygnus Black thinking about his daughter's husbands: a muggleborn, a half-blood and a blood traitor. He ends up liking Ted the best, the muggleborn is the only one that will be properly intimidated by his father in law like he's supposed to. Also, Nymphadora has her grandparents wrapped around her fingers.

Another one is that Arcturus Black III knows Blood and Elemental Magic. He was very well trained in Elemental Magic that no Death Eater tried to fight him during the First Wizarding War.

** That there is no such thing is "most ancient and noble houses", and that being a completely made up thing by them. Some other families made up their own titles, like "radiant and righteous" or "right and honorable" or "mighty", but the whole trend eventually died and only the Blacks hold onto that delusion of grandeur.

That they are worse than all other families with inbreeding, regularily marrying family members and cousins to keep the bloodline pure, which, if they hadn't all died to grindelwald, would have resulted in them dying out due to infertility and squbbing. The ironic part is that it would all be instantly reversed by an infusion of fresh blood, as seen with Andromeda. Her child is the strongest Black in generations, and also the first full metamorph in generations.

I'm not really a fan of the whole "many houses and manors and castles" thing, so I believe that the London townhouse is their only residence. It was built before all the other houses in that street, which is named after it by the people living there. "See that grim old place down the street? Don't go there, that's the Black's house." Grim old Place -> Grimmauld place.

The metamorph gene is a unique heritage of their family, and exists because in the distant past, they experimented with adding a Boggart to their magical makeup. It succeeded, but the first metamorphs were wild creatures, and the blood took until it was sufficiently diluted to filter out the insanity enough so the conscious mind would remain, and was then stabilized into metamoph blood. This gene persists in exiled members of the family, and is incapable of being diluted - in fact, it needs an infusion of fresh magic once in a while, or it slowly fades. Said exiled members had children, and if those children were magical, then they were also metamorphs. This is why there are metamophs all over the world by now.

The "Black Madness" exists, and is a combination of many factors. First is the metamorph gene, however strong it may be, still carries some of that darkness with it. Second is exposure to darkness in childhood, which is what most children in the Black family had. Third is the inbreeding, which causes a whole host of issues. It is essentially a blanket term for all the biological and psychological and magical damage all Black family members have. It causes general insanity, sadism, mania and neurosis, alongside occasional psychopathy and a lack of empathy. Physically, it causes deformities which are easily corrected with magic, and a shortened lifespan. It is and was also present in James, which is why he's such a dick, and Harry, which is how he survived the Dursley's relatively unscathed.
