Hey I know it is a discussion from the beginning. But because of some comments I started over thinking this question again. I want to wright a story about him but I'm wondering if he is a good guy or not. Would be very interested in your ideas :)


** No, he wasn't a good person. He was a very flawed person fighting for a good cause.

He was a bitter man who liked to take his bitterness out on the students. He was biased in favor of Slytherin, deepening the rift between the Hogwarts houses. He used to be a Death Eater, committing numerous crimes.

No, loving Lily is not enough to make up for all his misdeeds. But on the other hand, his ability to love prevented him from becoming literally Voldemort 2.0.

Both Snape and Tom Riddle were half-bloods, sons of witches whose love for their muggle partners made them weak in their sons' eyes. Both had neglectful, or in Snape's case, abusive muggle fathers. Both Voldemort and Snape were far more talented than an average student, probably the two most gifted Hogwarts students since Dumbledore. But while Voldemort went down a path toward irredeemable evil, Snape's love for Lily kept him always wavering between good and evil. And they were already friends in their childhood, so this friendship was more than "Snape just wanting to fuck her". They were genuinely friends until Snape's fascination with the Dark Arts and his junior death eater friends became too much for Lily.

After Lily's death, he became a bitter man focused on revenge. He never became the redeemed person Dumbledore had hoped he would become. He loved Lily enough to want to avenge her, but his grudge towards James and Gryffindor house in general made him torment Harry, even though he tried his best to protect Harry when he was in genuine danger.

** People are way more complicated than "good" or "bad".

It's really all about perspective and what you perceive too be the truth. We could say that in the context of HP JKR is the one who has the ultimate truth, however I still think most people here wouldn't completely agree with her if she told us which character is "good" or "bad".

Maybe there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for Snape's actions (doubtful). Or perhaps he is a walking caricature of an evil villain (even more doubtful).

I am sure that Snape would explain his actions in someway. Angry people lash out. While it is no justification for taking out his anger on an eleven year old boy, for some it could be. Maybe in hindsight he might agree that he acted rashly (though probably not, he doesn't strike me as sb to admit his faults).

In conclusion, he is neither good nor bad, just human.

** Severus Snape was a creation of bad circumstances. He wasn't a good person. But he was fighting for the good side.

If you are in doubt just re read the books. As far as canon is concerned his love was an obsession. He didn't even care that the prophecy might mean that a child will have to be killed. He told Voldemort anyways. When he realized that it wpuld be Lily's child only then did he feel. And even then he did not ask Voldemort to spare the child or even spare the family. He had requested Lily to be spared. So he was a horrible person. He couldn't forget a grudge.

Regardless I do sympathize with his circumstances. Perhaps even a degree of respect for his bravery. But do I like his character? Definitely not. Do I think Harry should have named his son Albus Severus? Absolutely not.

** The good:

- He protected Draco. (This was partly motivated by an oath he gave to Narcissa Malfoy.)
- He was nice to Lily Evans for about five years and maintained a positive emotional attachment to her until his death.
- He fought on the comfortably racist side in the war rather than the genocidal side.

The bad:

- He ran his classroom in a way intended to send as many people as possible to the hospital wing.
- He transferred a reasonable hatred of the Marauders onto a child who had never met them.
- He failed to enforce discipline among the students, increasing divides between houses and further cementing blood superiority.
- Beyond that, he rather fomented the discord between Slytherin and Gryffindor, using the school's punishment/reward system to encourage bullying.

The questionable:

- He tried to out Remus as a werewolf. Which is reasonable if he's a dangerous beast once a month, but the Wolfsbane potion means he's not. Except he was too subtle about it and failed to ensure student safety.
- He didn't ensure that Remus drank his potion. Which isn't necessarily his job, but it would have been a reasonable precaution.
- His Occlumency teaching method. I can't see how "Clear your mind. Legilimens!" is proper tutelage, but maybe Rowling had something in mind that I haven't thought of.
- After Dumbledore's death, he was Headmaster of a school that regularly used torture on students. This is "questionable" instead of "bad" because it's not clear to me how much authority Snape had to stop it.

It's clear that, in 1991, Snape has done little that's good and much that's bad. As the series continues, his character is mostly questionable or bad, but he does have a few moments where he's seen to care about people.

Overall, I condemn him much more than I laud him.

as for dealing with him in a story, you can contextualise his behaviour to see how he'd react in different scenarios, or deal with him at different points in his life. he's brave, skillful, relentless. i don't think he's incapable of being amiable if he finds the interaction worthwhile, beneficial or becomes emotionally attached to the person by circumstance. i think he is aware of and sees value in Good in the abstract- i.e. fighting the Bad Guys

** No. Snape was a bigot, abusive, bitter and just an arsehole in general.

He lashed out at a 11 year old because that kids father bullied him.

Sirius may be still alive had Snape not wasted the time given to him by Harry's group /flying from Scotland to London/.

Snape never planned on dying. He only gave Harry his memories because he just happened to loose the gamble. Somehow that also just made the last 6 years of Harry's life disappear in the boys mind. (I mean, what type of message does it send to you boy when you name him after someone who made your life hell for 6 years?)

Snape may have helped in the end, but he sure as hell didn't make the path there any easier for Harry. He's a horrible person.

Maybe Tonks and Moody took a look around within a few minutes of Snape leaving Umbridge and reporting back. They saw nothing out of the ordinary, so the Order stood down. (They might even have waited around for two hours and not seen anything.)

Then, seven or eight hours after Snape's report, Harry &co finally reach the Ministry. Fighting begins. It takes five minutes for the Order to get the alert, five more minutes to assemble everyone and distribute Pepper-Up Potions etc, five more minutes to get to the battle.

The plot hole is that Harry &co chose to spend all night traveling after a stressful evening in order to fight Voldemort. They had six hours to consider their actions and whether it was in their benefit to find a different means of transportation, wait until they were rested, call in trained adults, or anything halfway sensible.

******** I estimated it at 450-ish miles, 60-ish miles an hour. (It's 600 miles driving. For speed, compare to the fastest cruising speed for birds: the eider duck can go 47mph.) That's from boarding the thestrals to landing, and it's 7.5 hours. I previously calculated from Aberdeen, which is in the south of Scotland, while Hogwarts is in the north; that shaved off fifty miles and nearly an hour.

There's also Umbridge briefly interrogating the squad, the walk to the Forbidden Forest, the altercation there, and arguing about how to get to London. That could add another hour between Snape getting the message and the squad reaching the Ministry. Plus whatever alerted the Order might not have been triggered immediately.

But I build my suspicion on Harry's way of warning Snape. "He's got Padfoot."

Maybe Snape know that Voldemort doesn't have him, maybe he doesn't know. At the very least you can blame the disaster in parts on him taking up to or even more than an hour to inform the Order. How would have the whole thing played out if Harry got caught in the Entry Hall by Moody and proceeded to be portkeyed out asap?

***** I looked into this a while back.

Birds don't fly faster than 30mph for distance work, generally. If the thestrals went 60mph, it would be a problem to fly on their backs without protective gear. Not enough to kill anyone, but enough that they would have remarked on it.

It's a nine hour drive, but going a consistent speed and as the crow flies would cut that down. Still probably 400 miles and over six hours. Keep in mind that they only got to the thestrals at least an hour after Harry's vision, so if it had been accurate, Voldemort would have finished slaughtering everyone at the Ministry before they even started on the trip.

The book's timeline somewhat reflects that. When they used Umbridge's office Floo to call Grimmauld Place, it was early enough that the Inquisitorial Squad was out and about, as was Snape -- so probably no later than 11pm. After the fight, while Dumbledore's talking to Harry in his office, the sun is up and bright, which is at least 4am (dawn in Aberdeen in June is around 4:15) and probably a fair bit later, to illuminate the office. That's a minimum of five hours divided between being briefly interrogated, marched to the Forest, finding the thestrals, riding to the Ministry, fighting, talking a bit, and returning.

That's for those of us who care about canon or have too much time on our hands.

As for how it reflects on Snape's character...he doesn't try to rescue Harry &co from Umbridge, but then, what could he do? And what did he expect to happen? A reasonable way to get the same events is: Snape reports to Dumbledore as soon as he's out of Umbridge's sight. Dumbledore verifies that Sirius isn't leaving Grimmauld Place and tells Snape to find a way to inform Harry. Snape assumes that Harry is in Umbridge's hands and suffering little worse than a standard detention and resolves to tell him in the morning, since he can't exactly interrupt a detention to talk to Harry privately without making Umbridge more than suspicious of him. Then there's a report of fighting at the Ministry (with a latency of at least a few minutes), so Dumbledore rouses the Order and they head out (taking a few more minutes to arrive).

That set of events portrays Snape as a dutiful spy on Dumbledore's spy, not letting his grudges interfere with his work (at least not here).
