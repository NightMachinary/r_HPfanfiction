After information regarding Quirrell and Tom Riddle was leaked (after Sirius escaped Azkaban) a petition was anonymously posted in the Daily Prophet and gained thousands of signatures: */Harry Potter Should Be Barred From Returning to Hogwarts, for Student Safety./*

Spearheaded by a bitter and cunning Lucius Malfoy, who posted the petition and made a compelling case, both to the Prophet and Board of Goveners, that Harry's presence clearly attracted dark actors. And if even the wards of Hogwarts couldn't stop them from making an attempt on his life, then for the safety of all the other students, he should not be permitted to return.

Though the vote wasn't unanimous, Dumbledore found his hands were tied. Forced to uphold a decision that would be political suicide to stand against, even if he could. Thus allowing the media and the public to foist the blame for the past two years appalling security breaches on Harry's unknowing shoulders.

Having blown up his Aunt Marge, Harry found he wasn't even welcome in the magical world anymore. Gone from a hero, to a pariah, to a hero once again... only to be just as outcasted as he was growing up. Treated as a dark omen of things to come...

▪︎▪︎▪︎

/Where, at least for his third year, Harry is barred from returning to Hogwarts, with many superstitious people and establishments refusing to serve him as well./

/Would be a good setting to show some guilt from Ginny and Dobby about the events of 2nd year, so they can develop a deeper relationship with Harry. And obviously a scenario for Harry to learn outside of Hogwarts, however you want to handle it./

/Also good opportunity for a Dumbledore subplot, my idea being he sees protecting his political career as a must (for when Voldemort ACTUALLY returns, he needs the ear of the Minister) and thinking he can protect Harry and make it up to him somehow./


** Or, interesting twist, Dumbledore flies into a rage at one of his students being scapegoated, tells the Ministry where they can shove it, resigns all his positions in protest, and dedicates his new free time to giving Harry the kind of first rate education that Hogwarts could never provide.

*** Learning from Dumbledore would be both fantastic and exhausting. He's one of those professors that is absolutely brilliant and very knowledgeable but goes on strange tangents that hardly make any sense and you're like “this is great and all but I'm super hungry and you've been talking about chocolate frogs for forty five minutes”

**** I had a poli-sci professor like that my first year at college. I'm not sure we ever actually learned anything on the syllabus, but none of us cared either because his stories were cooler.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

***** Heh, well the reason is different. In that one, it's an upset McGonagall who expels him and Dumbledore points out she'd reverse it if he talked to her tomorrow. :)

** To be honest: I think if the Brits would be stupid enough to cast Harry out there are many countries who take a talented young wizard with money to pay for their schools with open arms.

*** Pretty much. I see it like this: I doubt Voldemort canonically did much outside of Britain, but he was watched.

I could see him ending up in the US or France, and Dumbledore kind of upset about it.

But otherwise, yeah.
