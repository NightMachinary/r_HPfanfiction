My favorite fics all feature what I consider to be well written magical combat. The Lie I've Lived has the duels in the Triwizard Tournament, A Black Comedy has the duels between Harry, Sirius, and Voldemort, and the Promises Unbroken Trilogy has /many/ very cool duels. What other fics have good duels and action scenes?


** I really liked the battles in Divided and Entwined. Very bloody and gruesome, but when is war ever fair?

** I'm on mobile right now so I can't give you links but here are some fanfics that fit what you're looking for.

Gods Amongst Men by Slimah - I mean the whole second part of the story is about war so plenty of battles though Harry is pretty god damn powerful in this fic as in only Dumbledore and Voldemort(and two others but spoilers) stand a chance against him, that doesn't mean he always wins though. Be warned that it ends at a cliffhanger and it's dead.

Stepping back and Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence- also fit the bill though again Harry is also pretty powerful in both fic's with only Voldemort and Dumbledore being his equal.Both are complete and in the case of Stepping back it's a Harry goes back in time type of fic.

Wind Shear by Chilord- Same as the aforementioned fic's. Harry and Voldemort have a pretty epic duel, also time travel on Harry's part.It's complete.

Emperor by Marquis Black-The whole damn fic is about Harry waging a war. Incomplete.

Realignment by PuzzleSB- just read it. Incomplete

Edit: it's actually complete I'm a idiot.

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991- The whole god damn fic is Harry going from one battle to the next, Also time travel because why not? Complete and has a sequel that also features epic battles. A warning though I didn't like it at all for a number of reasons 1. It gets boring real fast 2.Harry is kinda dumb(not in the mental type of way but you know when you watch someone do something stupid that you know can be avoided? Yeah that's pretty much Harry in Wastelands if time) 3. Too much angst, nuff said.

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by The Mad Mad Reviewer- I honestly just read it. Compete Femslash.

Second Chance at Life and it's sequel- Epic battles everywhere.

The Merging by Shaydrall- Voldemort and Bellatrix are insane(literally and figuratively) in chapter 18. Incomplete.

That's all can think off for the moment.

Also here's a link for a post with a similar request on this subreddit.

If you don't mind crossovers check plums and kathryn518. Pretty much all their stories feature epic battles. They also have non crossover Harry Potter fics.

*** Thanks! I'll work my way through this list!

I read Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool and it was a glorious fucking mess. Very, very strange, but enjoyable. I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoys more outlandish fics and doesn't mind /extensive/ Dumbledore bashing.

**** No problemo. Also I totally forgot to add this fic to the list(Something to Live For by Grey Silver Hawk) its a Harry goes back in time type of fic but with a twist . Harry and the The Dark Lord have a pretty epic battle in the department of mysteries I am talking about flying whilst trading spells type of epic.

*** Realignment is very much complete. I completely agree it is an excellent combat fic however. I even think it's the best fic I've ever read. I disagree on Wastelands though, it felt off to me.

**** Yeah I done goofed; I just haven't read it in a while so I probably thought it was incomplete. As for Wastelands yeah it's boring, and gets really really dumb sometimes(that's why I said I don't like it at all) but it does have pretty cool combat scenes.
