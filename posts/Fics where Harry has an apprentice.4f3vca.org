** I don't know if this is the sort of thing you're looking for, and sorry to self-promote, but my current WIP features Harry being lumped with a trainee Auror OC. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=130051&chapter=1][The Aurors]]

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=710]]

i wouldnt read it though, just quoting the warning tab:

Warnings: Abuse / Torture, Adult Themes, Beastiality, Character Death, Extreme Sexual Situations, Extreme violence, Femslash, Incest, Rape, Strong Language, Underage Sex

And the term "Apprentice" is streched to the utmost anyways and is really not what you are looking for, still worth a mention anyways.

** 'Fantasic Elves and Where to Find Them' has a bit of this. First Dobby, then Sirius. Might be in the sequel.. either way, good reads.
