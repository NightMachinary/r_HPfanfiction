Mine, from Weeb Adventures.

Harry and Sirius are hunting down dragon animagus!Cedric in Spain. They tangle with Spanish law enforcement, and Harry tries to diffuse the situation...

"/Senor, we're searchino for our amigo. Por favor, no attackerino./"

It's so silly, I still smile whenever I think of it.


** Mine is from 'That Glorious Strength' by lomonaaeren

“Mr. Potter, would you consent to a kidnapping to the grounds of Fortius Academy?”

Dont know why but it just tickels me pink when I read it

**** Trickshot is funny. I will say anything by Justbored21 is good.

"Making passion love on top a flying white saber-toothed tiger that is soaring over a rainbow in Ireland whilst consuming large quantities of fire whiskey" Harry gestured to his homework "we're in a library with homework on our desk, what do you think we're doing?"

"Wait" Daphne said "Who's drinking the fire whiskey? You, me, or the tiger" is from I'm no hero.

** Probably something from /Seventh Horcrux/ - it's absolutely hilarious. E.g.:

#+begin_quote
  A few days later, I woke up in an alley with a pounding headache. By the time I'd gotten home and downed a hangover potion, /The Prophet/ had arrived. In my drunken haze, I'd killed six Ministry workers and declared myself the Dark Lord Voldemort (I never would have picked that name had I been sober).

  Once you've done something like that, it's exceedingly difficult to get a job around children. I know. I tried.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
  I surveyed the dementor floating in front of me. "Two victims for every minion you return with a soul."

  It stared at me.

  "You drive a hard bargain," I acknowledged. "Three."

  Lucius frowned. "My lord, I don't think it speaks English."

  I snorted. "I won't debase myself by using French. You deal with it."

  I stalked off, leaving a rapidly-paling Lucius with the advancing dementor.

** Question. Do you mean "sentences from fanfics that started/updated this year" or just "from fanfics you've read this year"?

Because my all-time favourite is from Escapologist Harry, written back in 2013 (previous sentence included because it needs the context for its full impact): "It took Harry two hours to regain use of his magic after it'd been sealed away, but he was stuck inside of the chains for another two days, until he finally managed to pick the lock by doing nothing but wiggling his eyebrows. It was a very complicated eyebrow-wiggle."

I'm honestly not sure what my favourite sentence would be out of a fic written this year.

*** I generally meant fics that were released (or updated) this year, but I think I wasn't specific enough in my post title. It's alright, either way.

** "Yet that visceral hunger stays with him, unfulfilled."

Tom Riddle. It's from [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]] by Metalomagnetic. There are a lot of great sentences in that story, it's hard to choose, but this one stayed with me.

** The fic is obviously old but

“Please tell me you didn't seriously think she wanted you to call her Lord Voldemort," Harry said.

from Limpieza de Sangre. Ugh. That fic. So good. So heartbreaking.
