As you might have guessed from the title, it's a Naruto crossover. Unlike most such that I've seen, it takes place in the Potterverse without either altering anyone's abilities or inserting characters into a setting that they're wildly OP in.

By using a middle-aged Iruka as the crossover character, the only ninja present is capable enough to outmatch an average wix but not so capable that he dominates battles. Instead, his contribution focuses on teaching and mentoring Harry and his friends while acting as an advisor to Dumbledore and the Order.

*EDIT:*\\
A commenter asked how much familiarity one would need with Naruto lore to get into the work. At a bare minimum you'd want to know who Iruka is and have a solid grounding in the magic system of the Narutoverse, as it does feature heavily at times. Beyond that, there are various references to characters and events that make much more sense if you're familiar with said characters/events. For the most part these are more of a comparison or reference than anything critical, but the version of Iruka I used was from the epilogue of Naruto, so the entire series (minus filler) was fair game for me, and events later in the story do directly involve characters from the Naruto side of things.

In terms of actual experience with the series, I'd say that if you've seen/read enough Naruto to know who Orochimaru is, at least somewhat, you should be able to follow at least 80% of the references.


** How much Naruto lore should readers be familiar with before they begin the work?

*** I can't say for sure, since I'm pretty familiar with Naruto lore, but having read the fic I would think if you just know the basics of the Naruto magic system and who Iruka is it would be fine.

*** Great question, and I'll be editing the post to include an answer, but to save you having to click to it:

** I have been reading your story from the very beginning on both ao3 and ffn. I am very pleased to hear that it has been completed. Now I have more motivation to finish it.

Congratulations!

Your work hands down is one of the best crossover I have read. I love how you depicted every single character. The best part for me, was how naunced in morality you made the characters, how much human like and relatable you made them.

And competent adults. I loved your depiction of Orochimaru, adult Naruto. I loved that you made a side character in the series (Iruka) into an excellent front piece for change.

Many times reading your fic, I found myself nodding my head in agreement and saying, "I wish this happened in canon." Having a consistent storyline and consistent characters that are competent is very satisfying.

In a fandom where Indy!Harrys and character bashing are the norm, you stand out above them all.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read this masterpiece!
