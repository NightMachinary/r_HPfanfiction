So the first page of that story is sort of like a flash-forward or something of what's to come, where Harry and Dumbledore are in Paris trying to contend with a disaster/attack that has been caused by Voldemort.

From the glimpse you see, Harry and Dumbledore are both very powerful, they're talking about using magic to lift entire rivers to put out a fire and other such things. I like the idea of Harry and Dumbledore and wizards like that being actually powerful instead of cannon where magic is essentially just sending/blocking stunners/killing curses from one another.

And that in this, Harry and Dumbledore are sort of equals and working together. That's not so much of a requirement though.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

** To bad that story is likely going to die soon. Too many structural problems along with real world stuff in the way.

**** It doesn't sound like a problem in the structure of the story, as much as the author's.

***** Yeah, I always considered it to be very well written for fanfiction, but I can't comment on plot structure since I don't remember much of the specifics.

**** Hi there mate. Sorry it took so long to get back. Long story, job stuff (crossed fingers).

Anyway, its not so much of a problem with the writing as it is with some of the character actions. Take this for what its worth, my opinion literally makes no difference one way or the other.

A lot of characterizations are fairly flat, particularly Tracey and Lisa Turpin. Now I straight up get they are basically OC's in canon, but I can't help but feel a lot of characters could be taken right out of the story and literally nothing about the plot or Harry's evolution would change. Neville in particular feels odd, and I can't say I understand exactly why he is friends with Harry. I get Hermione, like it or leave it, she wouldn't be able to resist a chance to get a leg up in magic. I do like the relationship with Dumbledore, though part of me can't help feel your iteration is far more hands off than would merit. Doesn't make a difference.

But Harry is kind of...odd. This got better later on I think, but in the earlier story he is more than a bit erratic and I can't really follow the train of logic (even the irrational logic of someone who is somewhat psychotic). And this is an odd thing, but I feel like we don't really see any of Harry working toward getting good at magic. He just is good at it, which again is only a minor criticism.

Really, I think your standout is where you depict the sections specifically about exploring the mind arts. It speaks to me in a lot of personal ways, and I can certainly understand the descriptions you used in the most recent chapter (spot on).

Also, again feel free to ignore, but you might want your beta to take another look at the last chapter. I'm not a grammatical whiz by any stretch, but even I can see some obvious things that jump out.

Good luck on wherever you decide to take the story though.

  After the war the Trio has split. Harry's disappeared and Hermione has turned away from magic as a way to deal with being alone. But now there is another threat to the wizarding world, and the Trio must unite once again.
