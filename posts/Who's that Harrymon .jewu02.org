:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello, I'm searching for a fic where Harry had Death with him as a Harry look-alike and I think they were kinda gay for each other if I remember right. Also there's a few scenes in the Black's house. Thanks for your help in advance !


** Oh my god, I'm reading this fic now! If I'm correct, and I'm fairly certain I am, it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17672156][The Master of Death' by Quine]]

Sumarry:\\
"I can't go back, can I?“ Harry asked after a while.

"Do you want to?“ Death asked instead of answering. Harry stayed quiet.

"I could choose to go on,“ he said after some time.

"You could,“ Death replied and paused for a moment. Then he started to talk again. “But there is something you want more than that, don't you?”

“What do you mean?” Harry asked as he let his hands wander over the back of a bench.

"A second chance,“ Death said. Harry stopped and turned around to look at the being. “I cannot simply bring back the dead. But If you were my Master, I could bring you back to the dead."

Twenty-four-year old Harry Potter feels like something is missing in his life. When Death offers him a second chance, he takes it. Accompanied by the being, Harry travels back to the summer before Sirius dies. Inside his younger body and the memories of an older self, Harry realizes, that being connected to Death may have twisted his morals a little more than expected. And while the Ministry could use a change; this time he won't let himself be used in this war. Neither by Dumbledore nor anyone else.

But if it's not that one, I have another that's sounds similar - but they're not gay for each other, more like a father-son/siblings bond.

Summary: When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind.

Hope it's one of these two, and if it is, hope you check the other out too :) If it's none of them, you might want to check ‘em out anyway, as they sound really similar to your request :)

*** On a Pale Horse is the one I thought of. And while they were not "gay" for each other, I can see how somebody might remember it that way because Death physically hangs all over Harry because he hasn't been able to touch anybody in millenia because to touch them is to reap their soul.

The other one you mention I've never heard of, but it just jumped to the top of my "to-read" list.

**** Yes, I can understand why someone might remember it that way, it's why I included it, I was originally just going to include the first one, which by the way, is amazing, I completely recommend.
