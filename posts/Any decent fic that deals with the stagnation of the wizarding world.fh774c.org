I'm looking for fics that deal with the backwardness of wizarding society compared to muggle society. However, most of the fics I've read are all extreme wizarding world bashing, mugglewank, or just badly written with lots of convenient plot points for lazy authors. Lots of them also have the wizarding world as extremely prejudiced, evil, ignorant, stupid etc and muggle society as perfect, powerful innovative technology, no problems, and nothing is unfair ever. Are there any which are slightly more realistic/better writing or not as extreme? While still dealing with wizards that are falling behind?

Basically slight wizarding world bashing


** It's a minor side-plot in linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12023037/1/Hitting-the-tomes]]), but it's there.

There's also linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196963/1/]])

  The world, universe, fate, it's all very complicated. Too complicated in fact and explaining it would take far too long, better to move on. The important thing is that everything is connected. The Universe can be changed by the simplest little things. Harry Potter's life changed because of one simple thing: Homework.

  All is seemingly well in Wizarding Britain as the last aftershocks of the War against the Dark Lord fade away, but a series of murders lead ace Auror Daphne Greengrass to a threat that may throw her world yet again into imbalance. COMPLETE!

** I think linkffn(New Blood) does that. It's basically a Slytherin!Hermione who convinces everyone she's a New Blood instead of a Muggle-born (as in the first pure-bloods must have been born to Muggle parents. There is a lot of complex and antiquated courtship traditions and you really see the difference between wizarding and Muggle fashions and Hermione exploits her dormmates' lack of knowledge about makeup since it apparently doesn't exist in the author's version of the wizarding world. In a chapter of second-year she goes buying new robes with her mother as well as other clothing... commodities, and Madam Malkins tells her that with her maturing body she should buy herself some stays which are basically the name give to what we know as corsets for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Hermione tells her mother after this when they left how stuck in the eighteenth century wizarding fashion is. It's very slight wizarding world bashing and is a bit inconsistent considering the author chose to have the movie version of Hogwarts' uniforms which is laughable because why a society stuck in the eighteenth century would have its boys and girls wear trousers and short skirts when the former is simply undignified for a gentle man and the latter is scandalous for any lady.

Warning that basically every Slytherin in Hermione's year accept her has a New Blood somewhere in their first year and the author doesn't put hyphens for pure-blood, half-blood and Muggle-born and puts upper cases to the two formers as well as wizarding or magical in regards to â€˜wizarding world'. That last bit isn't really a problem for most but it's a pet peeve of mine.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))
