** Argh. I dunno.

Sinyk's stuff kinda fits? Hermione's parents have a lot of talk with the Greengrasses about magic.

Threesome pair (HP/HG/DG) so watch that though.

I don't think it's quite what you'd like, but it's all I'm thinking of.

** linkffn(11574569)

Only one that comes to mind. Hermione's parents, they're not sci-fi geeks or anything but they get super into runes and get totally involved in the magical world. WIP

Edit: may fall victim to your dislike of iamvsmart

**** Ah okay I haven't come across that particularly as a trope so I was reading the very smart thing as the characters being over skilled and knowledgable for their ages which while justified does happen a lot in this fic.

Having looked up the author and realised what you're both talking about I remember reading some of HPMoR several years ago so I've got a clearer picture now.

And yeah I think that authors note shows why this story came to my mind for the OP's request!

*** I think any fic which involved muggle parents will fall into some [[/r/iamverysmart]] tropes because they don't have magic. Literally all they have to offer is their emotional support, their brains and maaaybe their muggle political connections if it's a Finch-Fletchley fic.

So it just comes down to whether the author makes it tolerable with good writing and story setup or not. Like the Dodging Prison... fic, the author gets into really deep detail for basically all branches of magic, and as a reader you have to at least respect that level of thought, even if you don't like it (personally, WBWL, student 60 year old politicians and harems are just not my cup of tea).

** I have a rough draft of the beginning of a story in which a Muggleborn kid, the son of a modern-day blacksmith, got his hand crushed by a power hammer and the only reason he didn't lose more of it was that his accidental magic animated a suit of armor to pull him free. His dad, a fan of scifi and comic book, incorrectly came to the conclusion that he was a telekinetic mutant (X-men style). The father geeked out (after the whole arm trauma thing was done) and encouraged the kid to practice his talents. By the time the kid went to Hogwarts, he was fairly good at telekinesis, could heat up metal hot enough to forge and weld with, and could animate his custom prosthetic. When he discovered he was a wizard and that there was a school for wizards, he decided that he was going to build a working Iron Man suit if it was the last thing he did. And his dad was cheering him on every step of the way.
