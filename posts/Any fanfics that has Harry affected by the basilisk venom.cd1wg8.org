  As he slays the Basilisk, Harry is doused in blood and venom... some gets in his eyes. Blind!Harry. Disabled OCs. Very slow-build. No pairings. 06-24-19 FYI: I just reposted chapters 1 - 110. See author's note in chapter 110 along with a new chapter for details. Thanks for your patience!

** Linkffn(Dark Savior) Crossover with Batman. Harry is actually the son of Selina Kyle and Batman (Selina was Lily's other sister, separated at birth.) Harry is noticeably suffering from the Basilisk Venom, though it's a while before anyone realizes because he was being especially secretive and stubborn.

** There was this HP and PJ crossover where Harry turned out to be Medusas great-great-something and basilisk venom basically awakened that blood and made him into a medusa. It was actually pretty interesting read. Lets see if I can find the link.
