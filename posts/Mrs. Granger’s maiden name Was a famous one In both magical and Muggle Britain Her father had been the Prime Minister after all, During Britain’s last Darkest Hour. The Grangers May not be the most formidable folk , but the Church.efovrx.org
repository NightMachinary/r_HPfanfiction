I'm sorry to do this, but the story will not get out of my head. Hermione's full name is Hermione Jean Churchill Granger. She is the granddaughter of But the Muggle Prime Minister and the magical one. The Churchill name is the among the most respected in the. magical world, The pure blood lamented The loss of an entire generation of Churchills due to the magical sacrifice Clementine Churchill the Minister of magic at the time made to save Britain from the bombs of the Nazi blitz. She sacrificed her family magic for an entire generation to save their island. With the entire generation of Muggles in the Churchill bloodline . Everyone thought the line lost until Hermione came to Hogwarts. Brilliant, Muggleborn, and the daughter of dentists No one gives her a second look until Augusta Longbottom meets the little girl that aided her grandson on the train while Picking up Neville for the Christmas holiday. In the shock she declares, “ Clementine! Clementine Churchill! “ when she sees Hermione's mother there. As the shock wears off a conversation ensues . A Churchill alive what splendid news, To horror of Draco and every Slytherin on the platform, the Formidable Churchill line was dormant no more.

Basically Hermione Granger is a Muggle born but related Winston Churchill and Clementine Churchill( who for the purposes of this story was the Minister of Magic at the same time her husband of Prime Minister during WW2) . Clementine side of the family is also called Churchill and is an old Pureblood family that had fought to defend Britain in every battle since the days of Merlin . The Churchill name alone was enough to make Grindelwald run .

Hermione has a magical legacy as well as a muggle one .

*** Funny I only realized that when you pointed it out. But then again... I just read some really old books in type lettering and handwriting in order to have a searchable digital version. All nouns was capitalized.

---------------

This idea for a history background and setup seems really interesting to me. I'd love to read something like that.

*** Jack Churchill is not a bad Idea I do love the fact that the guy took a broadsword into battle during World War II. But it's a bit on the nose for me personally ( I'm related to Mad Jack Churchill.. lol... so writing a fic with someone I am actually Related to in it it just a little creepy to me.) My aunt Kathleen still has one of his surfboards... lol

** I feel like if you were to make Hermione a descendant of Churchill, you wouldn't need the magical family or Clementine elements. If you really want to to make Hermione special, I'd probably make it a Doctor Who crossover, considering the fact that Winston Churchill & The Doctor have a long history together, and have Mrs Granger be involved in UNIT/Torchwood (the Rotfang conspiracy is real!). HP canon takes place in the 90's, so it would be before the 2005 series, which hasn't been explored much at all.

If you want to keep the magical element, it makes more sense for Mrs Granger to be illegitimate imo.
