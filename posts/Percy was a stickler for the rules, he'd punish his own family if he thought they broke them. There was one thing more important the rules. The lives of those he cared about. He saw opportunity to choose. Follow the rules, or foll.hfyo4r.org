Sorry. I'm on a Fred kick, and I don't think I've ever seen a Percy-centric fic that involves him going back in time to save his little brother.


** The battle was over. After many long, torturous hours of fighting, it had ended. Voldemort's body had been removed from the Entrance Hall swiftly after he had fallen, the Hall itself now widely empty except for those who had passed and the living family members or friends that now sat by them, mourning. Many of the families moved into the Great Hall to sit and mourn together in there.

Percy Weasley sat there now, at the end of Gryffindor table, surrounded by his family. /Most/ of his family. The sun had risen, now hovering over the horizon, spilling light into the Hall and onto the families, students, and professors within it. Despite its bright light, one that stood for a new, brighter beginning for the Wizarding World, Percy could not have felt any darker.

The Hall itself was filled with a murmur of many voices and shuffling, people speaking to each other, others walking around briskly. Professor McGonagall was making her way around the Great Hall, bending to speak to students sitting quietly by themselves, sending others to Madam Pomfrey, being stopped frequently by the remaining members of the Order, other Professors, and trembling students.

Despite the low hum of noise in the Hall, Percy could not help but feel like there was a silence overbearing him and the rest of the Weasleys. A silence that hung over them like a dark cloud. He did not have to ponder what this silence was.

Fred had always taken such opportunities to lighten the mood. No matter the situation, he and George's back and forth commentary had never failed to lighten the atmosphere within the Weasley family. But Fred was lying in the Hall, his body still, his chest no longer rising and falling, with their father, Arthur sitting beside him, seeming unable to move away from his fourth son.

George, on the other hand, was sitting on the other side of Gryffindor table, staring aimlessly at the magic ceiling, disconsolately silent. It had taken a very long time to pull George away from Fred's body, but the sight of them away from each other; the sight of one without the other, was unfamiliar and melancholy to them all.

Ron was no where to be found, having disappeared with Hermione very quickly soon after the battle ended. Percy assumed they'd gone with Harry somewhere, but he couldn't be bothered to find out where. The three of them were an unstoppable force, and a clever one at that. If they did not want to be found, chances are, Percy would not be able to find them even if he wanted to. He supposed he should not fuss over Ron's whereabouts. If he knew anything about Ron - which, he was now worrying that he didn't know much at all - he knew that Ron would be happiest with his two best friends, and that was enough for Percy.

Percy knew that, while he had always worried about Ron, even if he didn't show it, that worry had amplified. Not only because of the terror that came with the battle, but because of the guilt that was growing so vastly and monstrously in his chest.

He could not stop thinking of all of the memories he missed out on with Fred. All the times he could have enjoyed his little brother's dumb magical inventions, all the times he could have laughed as the twins demonstrated such creations, times he could have supported them, times he could have left his room to play quidditch outside the Burrow with them, times he could have simply spent with them. Instead he buried his nose in books, followed the rules, wrote /stupid/ reports on cauldron thickness.

Percy liked rules. He always had. He had had so much to live up to, with Bill being Head Boy, Charlie being captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team. Percy was always good at living by the rules, sticking to them, and he had utilized this to secure a spot as a Prefect, and then as Head Boy, and then to secure himself a spot at the Ministry straight out of school. But in the process, he'd lost so much. So much time with his little brothers, brothers who weren't like him, brothers he couldn't fully understand. Brothers he had never even taken the time to try to understand. And now he would never have the chance to.

Seemingly unable to stand to sit still anymore, Bill stood up, closely followed by Fleur. “I'm going to ask McGonagall if she needs any help,” he muttered, and without glancing around at his broken family, he walked off, his hand clasped securely in his wife's.

Charlie was quick to stand up next, taking Bill's exit as an opportunity to leave as well. The silence, the pain, the stillness; it was unbearable. He was looking at the entrance to the Great Hall, where Hagrid had just trudged in, Fang at his heel. “I'm going to see if Hagrid needs any help,” Charlie excused himself quickly, making his way briskly over to the half-giant.

George had still not made a sound. He was now looking beside him, his eyes wet with tears, his bottom lip trembling. It was then that Percy noticed George hadn't sat at the very end of the table.

He had left space beside him. A place for Fred to come and sit. A space that they all knew would never be filled again.

George was looking at it, as if hoping Fred would appear suddenly, his infamous grin on his face, making a lighthearted joke in the hopes of putting weak smiles on his family's face. But he didn't appear, and the tears were falling freely down George's cheeks now, his eyes still trained on the empty space beside him.

“I wasn't there,” the twin finally muttered quietly, still looking at the same spot. Percy could feel Mrs Weasley tense beside him. “We were fighting together, and then we got separated, and... he... he...” he couldn't seem to make out the words, “and I wasn't there with him. I wish I could go back. To change it. To be there. I wish I could just go back...”

/Just go back.../ Percy thought. /Go back in time.../

An idea hit him so suddenly that he inhaled a sharp breath, earning himself a heartbroken glance from Mrs Weasley. /Go back in time/. That was it! Percy had worked at the Ministry when Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Neville Longbottom, and Luna Lovegood had broken into the Department of Mysteries in their fifth year. He'd heard all about the wreck that had been made. Of all that had been destroyed.

The time turners...

Most of them had been destroyed that night. But not /all/. Percy thought hard, a mix of emotions swirling in his chest. They were prohibited without Ministry approval. But the mere temptation of what it could bring him, what it could bring his family...

He had already quit his position at the Ministry, but with everything that had happened the previous night, he figured it wouldn't be too hard to get in this morning, to slip in and grab a time turner. There would definitely be many witches and wizards there, but they would be so buried in work... It was risky. A much riskier task than anything Percy had even contemplated before.

But he had quit. He didn't have a position to lose anymore, and he had a brother to get back.

Decision made, he stood up abruptly, his heart squeezing when George made no indication that he'd even recognized the movement, his eyes now back on the enchanted ceiling, still flooded with tears. Mrs Weasley, however, looked at Percy curiously. “What are you doing, dear?” Her voice was thick with tears. “Are you alright?”

“Yes,” he said. It was a blatant lie, he had never been farther from alright, but with his new goal planted firmly in his head, he could see a future - or technically a past - where things /would/ be alright. “I have to do something,” he explained briefly, unable to meet his mother's eyes, “I'll be back shortly.” And he promptly rushed out of the Great Hall.

His eyes found his father first, and then the body of his brother lying in front of him. The knot that had been in Percy's throat reappeared. “I'll get you back, Fred,” he whispered his promise.

Ripping his eyes away from the body of his little brother, he found Harry, Ron, and Hermione sitting on the steps just outside. His brother had his arms wrapped tightly around the bushy haired girl, and Harry sat on his opposing side, looking lost in thought. Percy scanned them quickly, and was pleased to see what he needed lie on Harry's left.

He rushed forward with vigour, his steps quick and determined. When he made his way to the spot right beside Harry, the trio looked up. They all looked worn and understandably exhausted, but Ron's face was covered in shock upon seeing his older brother. “Per-“

Percy had no time to answer questions. He was looking at Harry now. “Harry,” he began quickly, “can I borrow that?” He pointed at the invisibility cloak on the step beside the black-haired boy. Harry looked confused, nodding slowly.

“Sure, but-“

“I'll give it back,” Percy promised, leaning down to grasp the soft material in his right hand. “There's something I have to do.”

“Percy...” Hermione's voice was coated in concern aged much older than she was.

“It'll be okay,” he promised the three of them, his heart racing. “It'll all be okay.”

This was peculiar behaviour for Percy and the three of them were quick to notice, but he had no time to stand around. With the cloak in his hands, he turned and sped towards the large gates that had been completely ruined in the battle, hanging barely onto the hinges, half of them blown completely off.

His head was filled with images of his brother, a bright, ridiculous redheaded boy, so unlike the one lying in the Entrance Hall. Fred, alive, cracking jokes and grinning with the uncanny ability to lighten the atmosphere of the entire Great Hall in mere moments. Fred, alive, seated at the very spot George had left open for him.

With the vivid image of Fred in his mind, Percy ran past the gates, out of sight of all those walking around the outside of the Hogwarts entrance, and with the cloak grasped firmly in his hands, he closed his eyes and apparated, thinking hard of the alley outside the Ministry entrance.

** The department of mysteries was a mess, Shattered glass still hadn't been cleaned up after three years since Ron and his friends Stormed the hall of prophecies. 90% of the time turners had been destroyed during the battle of the chamber of death, Sirius black Had fallen through the veil, And five Aurors Had fallen at the hands Of various masked death eaters. Percy had thought the catastrophe at the time had been the pinnacle of violence and the death eaters Nonsense but it hadn't even been the beginning. The world has become so much worse so quickly, The ministry He had held in such high regard as a staple of society the pinnacle of Law and order turned into a toady For a madman and his movement to endEd up killing his little brother. Mad brilliant and precocious Fred who turned an expulsion From Hogwarts that would be a death sentence for Percy into an opportunity to start a prosperous business to take a chance and thrive After spitting on the rules for most of his life along with George. But now his brilliant little brother was dead, And George was half deaf, Maimed by the loss of his ear and broken by the death of his twin. His rule breaking spirit crushed Like so many other victims of that megalomaniac and his monsters. The marauding Weasley twins had drop the banner of pranksters They had hoisted for the last two decades and Percy had watched helplessly as it fell into the dirt before realizing George would never pick it up again and Percy he realized he would have to do it for him.

As the only Weasley brother employed at the Ministry Percy had access to resources Fred and George Could only dream of in this situations, Not that Fred would be dreaming of anything at the moment being 6 feet under, The edge of Percy's eyes burned at that thought as he thought that the tears, He couldn't get let grief settle in his time was precious he only had hours left to accomplish his mission. Before the time turner would be rendered useless And the freshly turned earth above his brothers Coffin would be allowed to settle Untampered with. Percy needed to render the shovel buried his brother useless to make digging a grave unnecessary because no one buried a man that was still breathing. Percy Had to take a note from his brothers book hell a whole goddamn chapter he had to break the rules, Utterly obliterate them To save his family. His brother his mother their eyes were dead crushed and buried with Fred's corpse.

​

With shaking hands Percy sees the last time turner in the vault and began to turn counting haphazardly tears burning slightly as they slid down his cheeks as he hit 50 Rotations on the tiny dial, He needed years not days to fix this problem. He had to push the Temporal magics To the very limit he needed his brother Breathing, And the only way to do that was to wrench the ministry kicking and screaming to the right side of the war. Every bloody wand in England Needed to be pointed firmly In opposition to that monster and his armies it was the only way to make sure nothing ever happened to his brother to make sure that wall never fell.

Percy granted before he felt the slight discomfort of time shifting around him and he cursed as his stomach started to churn And the magic begin to burn. He felt like he had been run over by the Hogwarts express when it finally stopped and he was staring the unspeakable Edward Remington in the face before bashing him over the head with a vase. Percy stupefied the man then and did Cast the best memory modification Spell he had in his life Before disillusioning himself and bolting out of the department of mysteries towards the elevator and seizing one of the little memos circling the elevator compartment, For desperately needed confirmation the date, September 7, 1994. Fred was alive, And probably printing some poor Unsuspecting Slytherin with George.

Percy felt like he couldn't breathe his lungs burned As he finally let the tears fall for a good half hour he let himself have a mini breakdown in the elevator he charmed to remain immobile. After His tumultuous emotions finally Settled down and his mind felt exhausted, He realized his current circumstances he had planned on maybe a year or two to fix the problem but now he had three. He could circumvent even more if not all of the damage from his current position, Percy cast a quick cleaning charm on his robes and wiped his face before right himself And pressing the button for the eighth floor the department of the missuse and regulation of Muggle Artifacts. If he remembered the date correctly he had Verbally crushed his father's heart under his boot that morning, He had some much-needed groveling to get over with and a few siblings to protect, Before he could conquer the Ministry.It would take him at least a month to brew the polyjuice potion He would need to remove Cornelius fudge from his current position his father shed would do nicely.

Percy departed the elevator shaking his head and whispering, “ For Fred” One last time before marching into his father's office to beg for forgiveness for so many things most his father wouldn't even understand Percy's eyes begin to burn again as he reached the door with the engraved name of Arthur Weasley in a small black plaque in the corner his father wouldn't understand half of what he had to say but he would forgive him nonetheless no questions asked. That was just the kind of man he was. Percy felt a sob wrench through his chest but he barely stopped before pushing up in the door and falling to his knees before his father's desk Sobbing And babbling nonsense.
