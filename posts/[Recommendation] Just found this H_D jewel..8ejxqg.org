Just found this and I can't believe I missed it these past months. It's a decently written Harry/Daphne, that is surprisingly original and refreshing. Good writing for a fic and definitely piques one interest, at least it did for me. linkffn(12898815)


** Can you elaborate more? This just looks like another marriage contract fic. It better explains why Lily would agree to such an archaic custom.

*** It's pretty whimsical and strange, with time travelling villains. I haven't yet finished it all, but it struck my fancy. As to the marriage contract thing, Kendra Greengrass nee ??? and Lily Evans were best friends and study partners. Also Lily is portrayed as being bloody brilliant and the one that really defeated Voldemort. Also it's explained that it was more of an insurance policy for the Greengrasses than anything else (They knew that Voldemort would be defeated sooner or later and wanted to align with the opposition, for some reason Lily agreed). But due to the circumstances involved (Voldemort) it all fell apart and Harry only gets knowledge of it at 28. Also Walpurga's portrait is a boss in this one.

EDIT: Afterthought. It's not binding at all. No: Engaged or required to marry thing. Just a preliminary agreement, nothing else. Can be broken at any time with a small fee to Gringotts.

#+begin_quote
  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.
