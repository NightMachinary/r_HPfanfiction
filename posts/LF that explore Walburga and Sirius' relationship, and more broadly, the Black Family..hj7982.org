** The Black Sheep Dog Universe! It starts with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721][In the Black]] . It's not just Walburga and Sirius though, but also Orion and Regulus and all of their relationships with each other basically. The second work is the main one though, and where the focus of that takes place.

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

** TheDivineComedian has written several stories about the wonderfully dysfunctional Black family, like this:

And I wrote this little one-shot about Sirius and Walburga's last meeting:

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

** Hi! I'm writing an OOTP AU where Sirius's family (including Walburga) are mostly alive when he tries to take Grimmauld Place for the order. Heavily inspired by the Black Sheep Dog series (in fact I'd say it's more of a BSD AU than an HP AU). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728#workskin][Here it is]]
