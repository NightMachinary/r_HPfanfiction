I'm looking for some good written and long Female Harry fics. They can include crossovers but only of Percy Jackson/The Originals/Vampire Diaries/Twilight/Game of Thrones/Supernatural/Avengers. I would be very grateful if I get some recommendations. üòä

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I'm not sure whether linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) should be considered a crossover; it draws on some story elements from the Song of the Lioness, and some of the characters are recognisable expies, but it doesn't fully fuse the worlds; it's just HP with, you might say, some SotL-y flavouring.

The storyline is quite original, drawing on both lots of source material but not just copying either one. Some of the ways that it incorporates and reinvents a canon event are really clever, like Archie bursting into an advanced potions class and yelling "TRROOOLLL IN THE BASEMENT! Thought you ought to know," as a distraction so that Hermione can steal their Polyjuice Potion.

The first four books are complete and come to about 1.4 million words. Book five will start soon, probably in the next few months.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

** linkao3(The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding) is an entirely brilliant fanfic. I love its feminist themes- Harry specialises in thread magic, a discipline which is often undervalued because of it is thought of as ‚Äúwomen's work‚Äù, as only useful in the household. A fair warning is that it's Tomarry, but I'm pretty sure that the author hasn't reached any explicit parts yet. The magical world building is so good that I can overlook a Tomarry relationship.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.[ON TEMPORARY HIATUS FOR PERSONAL REASONS, NOT ABANDONED ‚ô°]
