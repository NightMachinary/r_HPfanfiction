I'm looking for a fic that goes deep into vampirism, exploring the different powers and delving deep into the Vampire community. Harry, of course, has to be a vampire. Preferably over 100k, slash is a big no no. And please, for gods sake, none of that twilight crap! Also no romance. Romance is poop. If you think it's still good and has romance, sill post it, but if romance is a big thing.... go die.


** I was in the process of writing one but Harry wasn't the MC, instead it follows an OC. :s

Anyway, I haven't read a good vampire Harry in a long time. Most seem to be slash.

*** I don't really care if Harry is the MC, so if this story is 70k+ then post it here!

**** I feel so bad because I haven't touched it since I posted that comment. :/ I've revised the first chapter, but it's nowhere near post worthy :(

****** You've inspired me to do some work on it, though. I'm still trying to figure out a title. As of now, it's called 'VampireFic1.' Lol. I think you'll like it, honestly. It's a really gritty world. Vampires channel magic differently and they're a lot more brutal than Twilight vampires. :^{)}

******** That sounds so mystical! I'll revise the first chapter and then post it as soon as I come up with a name, summary and a few notes. :p It shouldn't take long.

** I've written a bunch, as I absolutely hate the twilight nonsense that author's try to impose, or other weaksauce like drinking animal blood, or only have to drink one mouthful a month, or he has some random mcguffin artifact that allows him to look normal in the day. I want it to be dark, with Harry falling prey to bloodlust, struggling to retain his humanity.

However, none of them are finished, and none of them are particularly long before I got bored. Longest I posted was like 47k.
