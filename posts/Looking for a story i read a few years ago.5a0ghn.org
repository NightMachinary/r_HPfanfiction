Hi! I remember a story I read a few years ago, where Harry was a vampire and he had grown up with Remus (?). in third year they moved to Hogwarts so Remus could teach there. Colin was terrified of Harry and Harry used to scare him, one time he fainted in the hallway. Does anyone know which story I'm talking about?

I remember laughing while reading it, it was hilarious. But not finished as far as I remember


** Lol, was it the one that harry was abandoned because he was a vamp then he became King.
