Most Fanfiction seems to go to one extreme or the other. Either he forgives everything and is Wizarding Jesus/As bad as Canon Naruto for forgiveness, or he's an Emo Edgelord that won't forgive literally anyone. What I want is a Harry that finds a Middleground. If someone does something relatively minor, then sure, forgive them if they say sorry. If they do something more than that, make them actually earn that forgiveness, rather than instantly forgiving them for probably meaningless words. That, and no forgiving Death Eaters, Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort, etc.

Saw a Fic where someone told Harry he was Scum, should have died with his parents, all the classic cliches, and then the minute they apologise "Bam, we're friends again" without them doing anything to make it up to him. That's not to mention all the weird Harry/Bellatrix post DOM fics "You may have killed my Godfather, but you're hot, so let's fuck" or the even creepier pairing of Harry/Voldemort


** I'm seconding your post.

I think a relatively sensible Harry (though that's very subjective) is in Strange Reflections, even though that fic is a bit cracky at times:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]])

He takes revenge on people who deserve it, but doesn't flay them alive. He's fair.

Just one more point:

#+begin_quote
  or he's an Emo Edgelord that won't forgive literally anyone
#+end_quote

It's even worse when he's mad at people for merely questioning or disagreeing with him. I usually see this in Hermione bashing fics: She goes "Oh no Harry, we shouldn't do this! You have to listen to Dumbledore, because he knows best and I'm a stupid little bint in love with authority figures and books" and then Harry sees it as a betrayal and doesn't want to be friends with people who disagree with him on anything.

I pity people who share that kind of understanding of friendship.

** One of my favorite parts of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/369727][Inter Arma...]] linkao3(369727) is when Harry /flips out/ when he sees Lucius Malfoy, 20 years after the war, even though he's made peace with Draco.

The fic is technically a sequel to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/252249][War Is Over]] linkao3(252249), but I think it works on its own.

  People rally to a just man, as Umbridge finds when the DA follows Harry to arrest her and demand that the Wizengamot try her for torture. When Dumbledore seeks atonement in battle against Voldemort Harry inherits his power and his responsibilities. Harry must learn to wield those powers in a world where law and justice have powerful enemies and many must atone for injustice done.

** Mutant Storm by Bobmin is pretty good having Harry be sensible in forgiving people. It's a HP/X-men crossover where Jean Grey is Lily's twin sister and finds Harry at the end of fifth year. He loses his shit at the beginning of the fic and is holding a grudge against a lot of people, but comes to work through it and let a lot the minor stuff go. The major stuff with Dumbledore not so much. It's got a nice mix of action, story development, romance, and crossover elements. Harry's powerful, but not godlike, and is still a teenage boy in a lot of ways. Overall a decent older fic that I'm quite fond of.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.
