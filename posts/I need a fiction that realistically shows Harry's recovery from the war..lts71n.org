Or at least, where it is shown, the war with Voldemort would be realistic. The guy didn't seem to hold back, and the book (I just blame it for being for kids) doesn't really show how bad it might be. It can be written from anyone's perspective, but at least I want it to later describe how someone accepts psychic scars and the aftermath of war.
