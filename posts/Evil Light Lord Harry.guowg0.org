I'm kinda curious if there are any out there. You see all sorts of Dark Lord Potter fics. So I'm wondering if there is a fic where Harry is the Light Lord but is an Evil Lord.


** That's a pretty cool idea, honestly - there's tons of Evil Light Lord Dumbledore, and Evil Dark Lord Harry, but not this particular combo...

Yeah, I can see something that has roughly:

1. Dark = Wild/Unrestrained/Chaotic, Light = Controlled/Defined/Order
2. Evil Dark Lords generally are basically Voldemort, they act on every whim, delighting in chaos and domination
3. Evil Light Lords delight in order and control.

Like, a Dark Lord might Crucio a failed follower and cackle, a Light Lord would have had the follower sign a magical contract that enforced a defined, fitting, orderly punishment for failure. They are equally /cruel,/ but they operate very differently.

I'd never be a Dark Lord, but I could very easily be an [evil] Light Lord...

** Here I'd like to point out that Light Lords do not exist canonically. That said, here's a well-meaning Harry that's evil - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12331839/1/Realignment]].

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

*** Except they do. Dumbledore is "the leader of the Light" with nearly absolute control over his followers. That they never call him Light Lord is semantics.

Truly, both sides are cults.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** There's a fic but I don't remember the name. I'll describe what I remember, maybe someone knows it. The Order of the Flamb√©ed Chicken tries to summon a hero, they are lucky and not, but several come. They are all Harry variants dark, chaotic, etc. and light. Mr. Light is a healer with an attitude, really funny, wants to be paid for everything immediately refuses to fight because it violates the healer oath. It gives him a bit of background history, at the Dursleys he loses both legs and this arouses his interest in healing. He develops lifelike prostheses, they didnt notice at the beginning that he has no legs. Among his customers is Madeye, among others, both here and in his home Dimension. It gets really funny when he and his "twins" go shopping in Diagon-Allee and their side streets. There he is attacked and literally takes his attackers apart alive. The others wonder he said he did not fight , he said des but that he was defending himself and that a healer knew how to do it best and to keep the "patient" on it for as long as possible etc.
