#+TITLE: This is a little bit specific, but are there any fics out there where a Seventh Year James Potter gets sent to Harry's Fourth Year and gets chosen by the Goblet of Fire instead of Harry as its champion for the Triwizard Tournament?

** This would be so cute and interesting, yes because James could meet his son and also people would think they were secret twin brothers!!! :)

*** I doubt they would look like twins. James would probably be taller, bigger/more muscular, compared to short, skinny Harry.

**** Harry was only short in the first book, he grew up to be tall. We're told that James was tall, and height is a very heritable trait. At the climax of Book 3 when Harry thinks his dad saves them with the patronus, he's described as "tall" man, and that turns out to be Harry himself. And then in Book 6 during the "you've never been more fanciable" speech, Hermione says that he's grown 'about a foot' over the summer.

So his shortness is relative to the very tall Ron, and mostly fanon exaggeration.

Wait.... you're referring to the OP with a seventh-year James. Disregard, I misread that.

**** Oh. Okay. You are right! :) Yes then they would be just plain brothers. :)

** The closest I've read is linkffn(The Lie I've Lived). Harry's actually got the memories of James in his head, so he's a bit of both. This at least meets the latter part of your request.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
