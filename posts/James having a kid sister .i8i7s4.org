Are there any fics where Harry has an Aunt that is James's sister? Like she was still in Hogwarts when James and Lily died, and she's wacky and lovable but she can't take Harry because of the 'blood' protection being on Lily's side, a romance with Sirius or Lupin wouldn't go amiss either

  James Potter has a younger sister, one who is a year younger than him. But on the night of James and Lily's deaths, she was ambushed and left in a coma. When she wakes up in the few months before the Tri Wizard Tournament, there's going to be hell to pay. Dumbledore Bashing, selective Weasly bashing. I do not own Harry Potter

  With the events of the Tri-Wizard Tournament making worldwide magical news, a fateful decision is made. After all, family is family. This choice also coincides with events that will shake the wizarding world to its very core. The arrival of an aunt and cousin from America will drastically change the life of "The-Boy-Who-Lived". Rated M for potential lemons.
