I love Bellatrix as a character for everything she can bring to the table to make a fic good. But by GOD my fellow writers can we all agree to smother the baby talk trope in its crib? She did that like...a handful of times in the books! She's insane yes but she's got some self respect! The most I remember her actually doing that was just to say “Ickle Harry” and maybe the childish “I killed Sirius Black” taunts if you wanna push the definition.

This is a character meant to strike fear into the hearts of those around her. One of the most powerful witches and the most skilled duelists in the world. Not being able to read her with a straight face is a problem!!


** Exactly! People treat this like it's just a thing that she does in her day to day life, when she's clearly just doing it to fuck with Harry. The instant he uses the Cruciatus on her, she drops the act and starts taking him seriously. (more liek siriusly amirite!) Honestly, this is one of many infuriating things about the fandom that I 300% blame on the movies: HBC's performance is so un-nuanced and in-your-face crazy that people just sort of assume that that's how she's meant to be, but, like, it isn't . . . At all . . . Even a little bit . . .

(Seriously, I know it's not the point of this thread, but /fuck/ the villains' portrayals in the movies. Fuck them with something hard and sand papery.)

** I've encountered this many times with different characters and I think that this is a very common pitfall in fanfiction writing: Authors taking a few personality traits and exaggerating them to the nth degree. Sirius has a bit of a sense of humor? Well, now he is a clownish manchild! Ron can be a bit of an ass every now and then? He's outright evil here! The Twins take turns to speak sometimes?

Well, now---

*** Yeah the Twins one can definitely be annoying. Although that mainly goes down to quality of writing format for me.

“Talking-,”

“-like-,”

“-this.”

Is super annoying.

“But something more along these lines,” Fred smiled widely.

“Is far more bearable indeed,” George finished with a grin.

***** For me, the idea of reading one sentence over seventeen alternating lines makes it feel like a six year old being chosen to read a passage aloud in class, where they only parse and vocalise words one or two at a time with no regard for punctuation, sentence structure, or comprehension of the full string of words they just made.

When I read "twinspeak" it breaks the flow of the dialogue and makes the tone difficult to set in my head.

** Agreed. I think it should be only used, IF it is to be used at all, is for the psychological impact. For example, the battle in the Ministry. When she killed Sirus and then taunted Harry like they were children on a playground, I suspect it was so that he would be angry that not only he could no longer fight effectively but also opened his mind enough for Voldemort could possess him.

** i haven't written Bellatrix at all, but if/when I do I won't have ANY baby talk whatsoever. That just totally ruined her character for me; it was her first big scene and she spent it being SO ANNOYING that I just wished she wasn't in the book at all. I'm definitely not going to do that.

**** Why's that so bad? Molly's clearly been established as a pretty formidable witch, and she's fighting to save her daughter, while Bellatrix isn't taking the fight seriously. Perfectly reasonable that she'd take her down... plus, karma. Remember, Bellatrix killed Sirius because Sirius wasn't taking their fight seriously. This time she was the one on the receiving end.

***** "Molly Weasley, a formidable witch" Did we read the same book?

From what I remember, Molly Weasley character, until that point, is the one of a housewife. I don't think she had either used something else than Households charm before that point, and she also failed to banish a Boggart herself (Ok, she had some pretty legitime fears, but it's a Boggart, the thing student learn to deal with in 3rd year).

I won't say Bellatrix death wasn't interesting (she got cocky and been killed, the same way she killed Sirius), but that scene was totally random.

****** Yes. Molly Weasley, formidable witch. The same Molly Weasley who could do a Summoning Charm without even knowing what she was Summoning. The same Molly Weasley who was accomplised with healing and protection charms, and who in the Battle of Hogwarts had no problem with nonverbal magic. Just because she normally used her magic for household chores instead of killing people, doesn't mean her magic wasn't powerful.

And really, it was the same thing that made her unable to deal with the Boggart that made her so capable of getting to Bellatrix. Molly's biggest fear is her children dying. The Boggart was preying on those fears and showing her children that HAD already died and there was nothing she could do. Bellatrix, however, is a THREAT to those same children, and a threat that Molly CAN do something about.

You're making the same mistake as Bellatrix: Just because someone isn't the most obvious warrior, doesn't mean they can't be dangerous if you threaten their loved ones.

** No way! Go the total other direction with this! Here's what I'm thinkin: Bellatrix ONLY baby talks in a fic! WHY? Because she's actually severely developmentally stunted, and has the mental age of like, an eight year old or something. Boom. Do it serious, do it live, and you got yourself a really horribly sad case of a disabled woman being groomed and taken advantage of by terrorists because she doesn't actually GET that any of the spells she's using are bad. She doesn't GET that hurting people and death is a real, permanent thing. She just thinks it's all some big, fun game.

(And from this you can also get your redeemed Bellatrix story too, so there you go!)

** I always took the "baby talk" as taunting (sure maybe it's how she likes to taunt enemies that are younger than her but it stops there).

1) she taunts the group of children infront of the othet Death Eaters (from a writer's perspective to show that the Death Eaters feel they have already won b/c how could children dream to compete with them).

2) she taunts Harry after the group of Death Eaters realizes that these children might actually manage to get away and the task of getting the prophecy is ruined. She kills Sirius and taunts Harry to get him to leave the group and chase her (i think she was happy to have killed her cousin but i think the act was done in that moment to hurt Harry and that the taunts was deliberately to get Harry away from the others).

** Ngl, I fairly enjoy the baby talk as it somewhat carries craziness and shows that she's become unhinged after Azkaban. If I were a writer, I think I'd use it in moderation, having Bellatrix use baby talk in a lapse of (even less) sanity.

"Ickle potter-kins needs to Sleep now." With a darker undertone she drew her wand and with a manic grin splitting her face, she muttered out, "Permanently."
