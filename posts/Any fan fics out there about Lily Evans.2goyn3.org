***** Not sarcasm- Im fairly new to this whole fan fiction thing. I guess I should have asked for a fan fic from Lily's perspective during her time at Hogwarts. That link provided me with plenty of material to go through though so thanks!

****** Hope you enjoy them! Are you more interested in a Lily survives to the present day narrative, or something set in the 70s?

It's James and Lily, unfinished but still updated. Very fun.
