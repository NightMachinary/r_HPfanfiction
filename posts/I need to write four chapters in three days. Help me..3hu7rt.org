I haven't had any time to write. Fate has given me a rare uninterrupted space of time to finish writing this orangutan called HBS. Three days is all I have. Three days uninterrupted by my SO (off to visit friends for a weekend) or work (all three cell phones are turned off) and no plans in sight.

I need the sub to keep me in line for three days so I can write out the conclusion of Book 2 and send it to my beta.

Post anything you can think of. Recommendations. Reasons to avoid a certain fic. Critique your fic. Critique my fic. Write what you do to avoid writer's block. What is your set up when you write to avoid distractions? Chastise me. What's the worst piece of dialogue from your own fic? What's an idea you want to write but know you will never be able to finish the idea? Tell me all the reasons Robst is your favorite author. Anything. Write anything to keep me going.

Help me.

Edit: I have written 5,000 words for CH48. On the right track so far - 10 AM EST

Edit x2: I have completed CH48. 9k+ words before edits from my beta. I will take a break - 330 PM EST

Edit x3: I have a hit a road block with CH49. I can not seem to find a middle to the chapter. It might also be the sleep deprivation. Until tomorrow - 245 AM EST

Edit x4: I'm back on the grind. Inspiration came to me in the form of a dream...

Final Edit:

I have completed Chapters 48 and 49 to send off to my beta. I am halfway through Chapter 50, so while the weekend was not as successful as I hoped, progress is progress. In any case, I will probably withhold updates until I finish the rest of Book 2. It would be cruel to leave a large gap between updates for these particular chapters.

Thank you everyone for the kinds words and inspiration.


** From the essay entitled /Thought Verbs/ by C Palahniuk

#+begin_quote
  In six seconds, you'll hate me. But in six months, you'll be a better writer.

  From this point forward---at least for the next half year---you may not use “thought” verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred others you love to use.

  The list should also include: Loves and Hates.

  And it should include: Is and Has, but we'll get to those later.

  Until some time around Christmas, you can't write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn't like him going out at night...”

  Instead, you'll have to Un-pack that to something like: “The mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he'd had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she'd only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.”

  Instead of characters knowing anything, you must now present the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader wants it.

  Instead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.” You'll have to say: “Between classes, Gwen had always leaned on his locker when he'd go to open it. She'd roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her butt. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”

  In short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.

  Typically, writers use these “thought” verbs at the beginning of a paragraph (In this form, you can call them “Thesis Statements” and I'll rail against those, later). In a way, they state the intention of the paragraph. And what follows, illustrates them.

  For example:

  “Brenda knew she'd never make the deadline. Traffic was backed up from the bridge, past the first eight or nine exits. Her cell phone battery was dead. At home, the dogs would need to go out, or there would be a mess to clean up. Plus, she'd promised to water the plants for her neighbor...”

  Do you see how the opening “thesis statement” steals the thunder of what follows? Don't do it. If nothing else, cut the opening sentence and place it after all the others. Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.

  Thinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking and knowing. And loving and hating.

  Don't tell your reader: “Lisa hated Tom.”

  Instead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.

  Present each piece of evidence. For example:

  “During roll call, in the breath after the teacher said Tom's name, in that moment before he could answer, right then, Lisa would whisper-shout ‘Butt Wipe,' just as Tom was saying, ‘Here'.”

  One of the most-common mistakes that beginning writers make is leaving their characters alone. Writing, you may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your character should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary character starts thinking or worrying or wondering.

  For example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take...”

  A better break-down might be: “The schedule said the bus would come by at noon, but Mark's watch said it was already 11:57. You could see all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he'd pull up drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic accident...”

  A character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then you can't use “thought” verbs or any of their abstract relatives.

  Oh, and you can just forget about using the verbs Forget and Remember.

  No more transitions such as: “Wanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.”

  Instead: “Back in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.”

  Again, Un-pack. Don't take short-cuts.

  Better yet, get your character with another character, fast. Get them together and get the action started. Let their actions and words show their thoughts. You---stay out of their heads.

  And while you're avoiding “thought” verbs, be very wary about using the bland verbs “is” and “have.”

  For example:

  “Ann's eyes are blue.”

  “Ann has blue eyes.”

  Versus:

  “Ann coughed and waved one hand past her face, clearing the cigarette smoke from her eyes, blue eyes, before she smiled...”

  Instead of bland “is” and “has” statements, try burying your details of what a character has or is, in actions or gestures. At its most basic, this is showing your story instead of telling it. And forever after, once you've learned to Un-pack your characters, you'll hate the lazy writer who settles for: “Jim sat beside the telephone, wondering why Amanda didn't call.”

  Please. For now, hate me all you want, but don't use thought verbs. After Christmas, go crazy, but I'd bet money you won't.
#+end_quote

I've been using this essay to improve my writing in the past few months, and I really think it's making a difference. I don't think anyone should take the advice completely word for word, but its ideas are the same as those oft-repeated since primary school: 'Show, not tell'. I think any aspiring or current writer (and who isn't a writer in some form?) could gain quite a bit by reading this essay and actively trying to improve his own writing using some of these techniques.

** Warning: long comment incoming.

The most famous quote of Ender's Game is this: "In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them."

I would invert this quote. One of my own beliefs is that truly loving a book requires that you pursue a deep and thorough understanding of it, including not only its strengths but also its weaknesses. You don't love a book unless you feel a little let down that the author could have made the book more perfect yet failed. You describe yourself elsewhere in this thread as a self-hating author, and I think this is more or less the same thing. Authors that don't experience regret while writing might as well not be writing at all, imo.

Thus, although I love the Harry Potter books, I also feel free to criticize canon Harry as being rather passive and angsty. Although Flowers for Algernon is my favorite book overall, whenever I reread it I cringe at how incapable Charlie Gordon is of understanding social norms despite his supposed supergenius skills. And when I read Ender's Game, even though I love much about Ender's strong and individualistic character, I also recognize its flaws.

I think Hogwarts Battle School does an excellent job rectifying some of the flaws in canon Harry Potter, by using Ender Wiggins as an inspiration. But I think Hogwarts Battle School also has the potential to rectify some of the flaws in canon Ender Wiggins, by using Harry Potter as an inspiration. This potential is so far mostly untapped, in my opinion. We have not seen much character development in your version of Harry Potter, or at least not as much as we could potentially be seeing. Your character is a lot more like Ender Wiggin possessing Harry Potter's body than like Harry Potter possessing Ender Wiggin's mind. I would prefer more of a balance.

Here is a link to an in-depth critique of Ender's Game that I've found very interesting: [[http://somethingshortandsnappy.blogspot.com/search/label/Ender%27s%20Game?updated-max=2013-04-08T20:27:00-04:00&max-results=20&start=21&by-date=false]] I don't agree with all the arguments made by this critique. I think sometimes they miss the point on purpose, because the reviewer assumes a certain social justice oriented lens of seeing the world that I distrust. Nonetheless, overall I really like this review. It helped me to better understand Ender's Game, to both destroy and mentally recreate its meaning in my mind. Ender's Game is still one of my all time favorite books, but the sense in which I love it now is much more sophisticated than the sense in which I loved it a decade ago.

I think you also would benefit from reading these reviews. Here is one particular quote that really hit home with me, from its review of chapter 8:

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    "Ender Wiggin is ten times smarter and stronger than I am. What I'm doing to him will bring out his genius. If I had to go through it myself, it would crush me."
  #+end_quote

  How do you know that it will bring out his genius, Graff? It's never given you what you needed before. You've only had near-misses and flameouts. Is this how Mazer Rackham was trained? Actually, why isn't Mazer Rackham in charge of this training? What qualifications do you have that make you so sure your technique is the perfect recipe to make the ultimate military genius? In short, Hyrum Graff, who the fuck are you?
#+end_quote

The way in which OSC writes is extremely compelling. In many ways that is wonderful, but it can blind us to certain important counterfactual questions. I'm hoping that you'll be able to use Hogwarts Battle School as a way to bridge the gap between two very different works of fiction, to capture and examine some of the strengths and weaknesses of both worldviews. With this sort of big picture theme in mind for your story, hopefully you'll be able to find some kind of inspiration that guides your writing from here on out.

Make Snape pathetic despite his strength, don't glamorize his failures. Treat ruthlessness as a form of weakness as often as you treat it as a form of strength. Don't fall into traps: question the assumptions of the source material even as you utilize them. For example, is it true that all geniuses must be tortured ones?

Here is another quote I found compelling (despite bias within it) from the review of chapter 13:

#+begin_quote
  EMPATHY EXPOSITION TIME.

  #+begin_quote
    "Being here alone with nothing to do, I've been thinking about myself, too. Trying to understand why I hate myself so badly."

    "No, Ender."

    "Don't tell me 'No, Ender.' It took me a long time to realize that I did, but believe me, I did. Do. And it came down to this: In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him."
  #+end_quote

  What was I saying about unearned characterisation earlier? He murdered Stilson because he didn't understand the difference between bullying and gladiatorial arenas. He made Bonzo's hatred of him worse and worse over the years because he didn't know or care to know what mattered to Bonzo. And he was able to kill him in the end, not because he understood everything that mattered to Bonzo, but because he knew how to goad Bonzo into a disadvantage. That took a bit of taunting about honor, nothing more.

  Let's have at this a little deeper: if Ender truly understands someone, everything that matters to them, then why is he never able to offer them another way out? If he really got what made Bonzo tick, why was there a deathmatch instead of a speech saying 'I know what you really need, and here's how we can do this with neither of us dead'?
#+end_quote

I absolutely love Hogwarts Battle School, but if you're going to set it apart from being just a better version of the standard super Harry fanwank, then you need to add a little something more to the direction that the story seems to be heading. This isn't to say that your Harry is overpowered, he's not. It's to say that unless you have some kind of poetic or social message underlying the story, your story will revolve around power and power alone, and in my opinion that would be something of a waste. Art needs both light and dark, your story does have both which is fantastic, but the light is rather scattered and incoherent. If the light aspects of the story were tied into some big overarching message about the importance of love and the weakness of individuality and faux-martyrdom, or anything else at all vaguely like that, this would be extra fantastic, regardless of whether you make this story a tragedy overall or you make it into a more traditional adventure heroism narrative.

Perhaps you are already trying to show the weaknesses of Ender's individuality and disregard for social concerns? Some things, like Harry's relationship with Hermione, do imply a bit of this. But in my opinion, you could do a better job of making this obvious and important and interesting. Don't just show the weaknesses of individuality, then, show the wonderfulness and strategic advantages involved in caring for others as well, how caring for others can strength the self through nourishment rather than through suffering.

I critique because I love.

TL;DR: next time you get stuck, try skimming these chapter reviews for inspiration.

That means I generally do not have much of writer's block to struggle with. Finally, I tend to define goals and means for the characters, then let them act, instead of structuring a plot, so I usually only have to ask myself "what would Harry do now? What would Hermione do? How would Voldemort react?" and half a chapter is just waiting to be typed out. It does mean that my planned plots run away from me often though.

** More fuel for the fevered fantasist:

These rules were originally tweeted by Emma Coates, Pixar's Story Artist.

- You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

- You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be very different.

- Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite.

- Once upon a time there was /__. Every day, _. One day _. Because of that, _. Because of that, _. Until finally _/_.

- Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free.

- What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?

- Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.

- Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time.

- When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up.

- Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it.

- Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone.

- Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th -- get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself.

- Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.

- Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it.

- If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.

- What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against.

- No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on -- it'll come back around to be useful later.

- You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining.

- Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating.

- Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How d'you rearrange them into what you DO like?

- You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write ‘cool'. What would make YOU act that way?

- What's the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there.

** Oh, and just an idea for the Room of Requirement fights. A battle in an icy mountain wasteland might be interesting. An extended one. Lasting 24 hours. With nothing but their wands to survive.

I can see you doing some really creative stuff with that. How do they survive? Food, wild (magical?) animals? A full day/night cycle? Guerilla attacks? Cooperation, with betrayal?

It would really strain members of a team and introduce a lot of tension. I think it would be awesome. Kind of like Lord of the Flies, but in an icy mountain wasteland-like area with magic and battles.

Focusing a lot on someone's abilities to hide, sneak and ambush as well as maybe gather information from others. If there are a lot of pairs where there is no conflict in people outside the pairs, and no-one knows who their opponent is, could be very complex and exciting.

** Have some quotes (1 per message):

Babylon 5: Final note of Season Three spoken by G'kar

It was the end of the Earth year 2260, and the war had paused, suddenly and unexpectedly.

All around us, it was as if the universe were holding its breath . . . waiting.

All of life can be broken down into moments of transition or moments of revelation. This had the feeling of both.

G'Quon wrote, 'There is a greater darkness than the one we fight. It is the darkness of the soul that has lost its way.'

The war we fight is not against powers and principalities -- it is against chaos and despair. Greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope, the death of dreams. Against this peril we can never surrender.

The future is all around us, waiting in moments of transition, to be born in moments of revelation.

No one knows the shape of that future, or where it will take us. We know only that it is always born in pain.

** When I'm writing, I like to use a lot of analogies. For example, when Harry finds a new friend, I write a couple of sentences somewhere about him seeing a bird flying away, only to be joined by a second one. When Harry is in turmoil emotionally, I set a scenario for him being in a wild landscape. A river flowing over rocks with a thundering noise. The story I'm writing now is kind of like an odyssey. Harry is shunned by everyone except for a couple of close friends. He searches for a home but can't find it anywhere.

Hence the river analogy. It's a journey that starts rocky but ends in calm waters as Harry finds his home in the world. Of course, Voldemort doesn't make it easy.

I'm rambling, but did it help?

I've been following your stuff since back when Portkey.org was relevant. That's a /loooong/ time. (loljk to Harmony fans)

It's been a pleasure. Really. In fact, HBS is one fic of four that gave me the kick up the arse to start writing too. It's almost a certainty that more than one person out there feels the same way.

That being said, only two things are certain in this world. You want to end it, and we want to see the conclusion. You've made your availability public now, so that should be more motivation than anything. We all hate those fans who think your life revolves around them getting updates on time, but we all like to keep our inboxes nice and airy, lol.

Anyway, right there with you. Getting my wisdom teeth out today, so I'm sticking to stationary hobbies that won't spill a mouthful of blood in someone's face. I've only got a chapter and a half left; I'm just a notoiously slow writer and this chapter I'm on is probably the hardest I've ever had to write (writing unreliable narrators epiphanies are fun). Have you ever known exactly what you wanted to write, but actually executing it is a headache and a half and you'd almost rather outsource it to a hundred monkeys on typewriters? That's the feeling.

  What's an idea you want to write but know you will never be able to finish the idea?
#+end_quote

It is a story element rather than an idea on its own.

So in the late 50's Tom Riddle knocked up some muggle girl, she then gives her daughter up for adoption. The baby is adopted by the Evens family, and they name the baby Lily. Where this come from in my mind is the whole Lily's sacrifice saves Harry bouncing curse nonsense. The explanation in the books is very bad so I had to solve it in my head another way. I think it wasn't just that Lily sacrificed herself, but a culmination of Voldemorts soul being so ravaged, and him killing his own daughter - which I think probably invokes some old family magic or something when he then tries to kill his grandson as well. I know 'family magic' isn't cannon, but is me giving some credence to the whole pureblood thing, they can't all be complete morons, they surely have a point of some sort. So in this story Harry would be a parselmouth by birth and not because he's a horcrux, Lily was too and either never figured it out, or never told anyone. Harry might not even be a horcrux, the evidence Dumbledore uses to reach this conclusion is that he's a parselmouth and how else would that be possible? I think a great story could be built around this idea, how it's found out, how people react.

I have an idea that I would /love/ to write but doubt I'll ever get to it. My own headcanon as to the disappearance of Sally Anne Perks. She stumbles upon the Room of Requirement in second year and while there gets petrified by the Basilisk. Because of the magic surrounding the particular room conjured, no one thinks to look for her, and it isn't until years later (during the Battle of Hogwarts? Or during Teddy's Hogwarts years maybe?) that someone finds her and realizes she's just petrified. They'll wake her up and she'll have to figure out how to navigate life after being frozen for so long.

** Two excerpts, both about change --

#+begin_quote
  I swear, if I hear once more that line about "Get your hero up a tree, throw rocks at him, then get him down"... It's a god-awful illustration of the three-act structure and an even worse representation of storytelling. ....

  So what on earth does that pithy gem describe, really? I get that the 'up a tree' part stands for Act One: the inciting incident, the trigger, the destabilisation of the hero's world, jeopardy. And I get that the 'rocks' represent Act Two and conflict. It's not mentioned but it's a given that the rocks get larger and meaner with each throw, to create rising conflict.

  ... then get him down... ?? Is it just me or is that just a teensy bit anti-climactic? As a third act that simply will not do. Not around here.

  Having exhausted our supply of rocks, it's time to get serious about making tree-guy suffer. Remember that chainsaw you stole from the set of Evil Dead: Army of Darkness? (Yes, I know about that; No, I never told The Chin, but I think he suspects.) Go get it. Because the writer's job is not to get the hero out of the tree. Your job is to make your protagonists suffer to the point where they have only one way out, where only one thing can transform the suffering into a solution: change.

  I'm talking earthquake-fault-line-sized change. I'm talking about straddling the abyss with one foot on either side as it groans and cracks and widens beneath your hero, forcing a decision to go left or right, zig or zag, one way or the other, or do nothing and perish. At that moment, for the hero, standing still is no longer an option.

  Drama is all about taking characters and pushing them until they break, one way or the other. If a character can't be broken, then they have no place as a main character in a story. So writing a drama involves thinking of all the ways that your characters can be broken; this is the way that I chose for Tarquin.

1 A Harry / League of Legends crossover.

Problem: League of Legends Lore is the absolute worst. THX RIOT!

2 A Harry that joins the Riders of the Apocalypse after his death in the Forbidden Forest and roflstomps Voldemort as the Rider of Conquest. Never made more out of it than a dialouge between him and the Rider of Death.

3 The ultimate crossover. Employing a multiverse-setup I'd have Harry meet up with several other heroes from different worlds in order to destroy Darth Sidious. As far as I got I can say one thing with certainty: Its a Harry Potter / Toph Beifong pairing. The other stuff I got is just dialouge between Harry and several other characters (including: Avatar Aang and Toph [Avatar], Warchief Thrall and Sylvanas Windrunner [WoW], Geralt of Rivia [The Witcher], The Dragonborn [The Elder Scrolls], Gandalf [Lord of the Rings], Jim Raynor and (good) Kerrigan [Starcraft], Vi and Caitlyn [League of Legends], and so on and so forth.

Problem: Imagine the clusterfuck.

**** Its horribly shallow and short. Most champions are described in simple terms of "He did that because of that and then joined the League", leaving them as complete blanks in terms of character or backstory. The same with the areas/nations the champions come from. The Shadow Isles were literally described with "nobody knows what the fuck is going on there - move along".

But you have to give Riot some leeway here. When the first Lore was made and the foundations of worldbuilding were done, they were a group of independent developer who built a new game onto "DotA Allstars". They were busy making the game work and had no time to think of storylines for their champions. When the second big wave of champions steadily rolled in they were building an E-Sport league. There was just no time and at that point, nobody really cared anyway. Players played because of the mechanics and gameplay, not because they loved to read about the champions they played with.

Riot tries to undo this nowadays. Their latest effort being the Bilgewater Event in three acts. Another example would be the remodelling of Lores around Shurima, following the introduction of the champion Azir.

But in the end, they only try. The stories are mediocre at best and merely give a narrow view of the champions' personalities. Enough if you're willing to work with near-OC's, not enough if you're searching for developed characters.
