So I've been think about ^ and I am genuinely curious about whether or not there are /any/ fics at all about Harry and /all/ the Weasleys and Hermione join him on Voldemort's side.

I don't mind if it's 'Voldemort is actually the good guy' or ' "They've all gone dark!" ' but I'd like there to be a good turning point for them all, possibly something Dumbles did.

If it's Dark!Harry, Weasleys, and Hermione, I honestly don't mind how gruesome the violence may be. I have a surprising strong stomach (Though I read one that was so gruesome that I bolted to the toilet and couldn't finish the fic), but I would like no suicide attempts/ successes or self-harm, and no rape scenes/mentions, /if possible/.

I'd like it to have humor, /obviously/, even if it's not often.

I just can't stop thinking about Molly hitting Voldemort with a wooden spoon in a motherly way cuz he did something. (That clearly would only work if it was a 'Voldemort is actually the good guy' type of fic)

I'm fine with /basically/ all ships (but I prefer gay Harry (Specifically Drarry)).

If anyone can find something like this, /that would be amazing/. ♡♡♡


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] looks like a good fit. He's basically Voldemort here, but his goal is to teach DADA forever. In order to achieve that, he must eliminate all competition, including his other versions. He sees Ron as his worthy minion, and Hermione as his successor and trains her accordingly:

  “I glanced around, casually checking for listeners, before admitting. "Hermione, much like you, my nature is also somewhat evil. But I channel that evil into constructive aims like murdering the Dark Lord. We should probably get back to that, by the way. It's been a few weeks."

  "But what if I'm the next Dark Lord?"

  "I don't think You-Know-Who will like that very much. You'll have to kill him anyway," I said.

  Hermione giggled, smiling up at me. I don't know what was funny about that, but I took it as a good sign.”

Another fic, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], also has Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, AND the Longbottoms all firmly on Voldemort's side. Needless to say, this Voldemort achieves total victory in the end.

** Of lies and deceit and hidden personas is pretty good but it's Harry/Tom.
