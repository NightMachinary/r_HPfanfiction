In some fanfics, especially those who are Slytherin-centric we often see that there is extreme prejudice against Slytherins, to the points where they're bullied just for being Slytherins.

Of course each author can do as they like, but I wondered if it's also true in canon.

We do know that some characters in canon express some prejudice against Slytherin, like Ron, Hagrid and even Harry himself, but would you say it was as bad as we see in some fanfics?

Also, do you feel this prejudice was somewhat justified? I mean every single Slytherin we see in the series is either bad or used to be bad at some point in their lives.

Opinions?


** I think its worth mentioning that canon!Slytherin is evil house. Never a nice thing is said about it. The best Slytherin house has to offer is Slughorn, who is a creepy old man, and Snape who is a petty vindictive bully.

A lot of what fanfiction tries to do is give depth when there is none in the canon material. This is one of those areas. Since canon Slytherin is evil, in fanon people make them the scrappy underdog. Lashing out because is all versus them.

*** I see. I sometimes wonder whether Rowling originally intended Slytherin to symbolize everything that is bad (racism, bullying, genocide etc.) but in the last books she realized that having a "House for evil" is not a very good idea so she threw in Slughorn and made Draco a little bit more humanized.

**** Rowling originally wrote a children's story, which became a darkish young adult series. This creates a strange juxtaposition within the series. Another example of something fanfiction often tries to 'fix' is that canon!Voldemort is nothing but a comic book villain, so fanfiction often tries to humanize him and give him real motivation and goals.

Most of the awful tropes in HPFF come from this juxtaposition. If one tries to examine the plot and character motivations of PS and SS especially through the lens of an a young adult novel things don't make sense. Which gives rise to manipulative!Dumbledore.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

****** Well, “Seventh Horcrux” does have that, albeit Tom clearly has some sort of disorder in it so it's up to you how “humanised” (or not) you consider him to be in it.

That aside, you might stumble upon a character study or something of that sort if you try (assuming there even is one), but honestly, I think you'll have a greater chance of getting a humanised Tom in a crack story than in a normal one as most “normal” stories tend to just copy-paste him as the villain with neither changes nor any insight into the “why” of his character.

** While there were a few good people in Slytherin, this house produced a disproportionate number of murdering psychopaths.

So I think the poor reputation of this house was fully justified by the end of the series.

Now, I don't think there was anything wrong with the philosophy of the Slytherin house, and problem had more to do with Sorting Hat putting students there based on family pressure. If the sorting was done purely based on a student's character, then a large amount of them would find themselves in different houses.

After the war, Sorting Hat would highly likely ignore blood purity as a requirement. Combined with many purebloods' reluctance to further associate with this house, it could be expected that Slytherin was highly populated with Muggleborns by the time of Epilogue.

*** Yea and I wonder why. Being cunning, ambitious, resourceful don't necessarily seem like psychopath traits to me.

Ahh, I see. Well, I don't think blood purity is that important for the sorting hat anyway. We know they were at least some half-bloods in Slytherin.

**** It's not that being cunning, ambitious and resourceful makes you a psychopath Death Eater, but rather that if you're the sort of person who grows up to be a Death Eater, you're probably cunning, ambitious and resourceful.

There's not that many Death Eaters in canon (I think one of the posts on the front page right now says about 50?), so even if there's normally only 10 students a year in Slytherin, out of the 200-300 adult Slytherins you'd expect to see, at most a quarter of them were Death Eaters - so at a bare minimum 75% weren't. However, that's still /much/ worse odds than every other house.

** I'd see it being mixed. I can see students disliking then just for being Slytherins, in the same token that they dislike those Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs. Less to do with the specific house and more to do with the fact that is not their house.

I'd like to think that the adults would move past that for the most part with the exception of a few immature people.

** No no, this isn't exaggerated. In canon Book 7 we see that apparently not 1 Slytherin was willing to stand up against the Death Eaters and that all were evil. Or, more accurately, McGonagall makes this assumption because Pansy wants to hand Harry over rather than fight against a gang of homicidal maniacs.
