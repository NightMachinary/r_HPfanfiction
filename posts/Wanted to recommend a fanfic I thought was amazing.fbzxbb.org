The fic is linkffn( Falling Star by GoldenLioness4) ! It was a decently long fic and is set in the marauders era. It is Sirius centric and the characters are really well done, it had me sobbing at the end! There is a OC dada character and normally I'm not a find of OCs but he was so realistic and I'm almost sad he's not real because no other fics include him hahah. It spans â€˜the Prank' and Sirius running away and I'm in love with it! There's also a version of it on harrypotterfanfiction.com that has much less chapters but some details are different in that version, just to let you know as I enjoyed reading them both because of the slight differences, I slightly preferred the version on harrypotterfanfiction.com as it had a few slight changes that I enjoyed ( nothing crucial in plot more added / changed things in certain dialogues that I found more gripping and powerful) however, the one on fan fiction.net is much more developed


** Sounds amazing! Is it romance or drama or just slice of life? I'm planning on downloading for my kindle which would recommend the hpff or ff one?

*** It's not a romance, probably a mix of drama and slice of life. It's quite angsty at times but In a good way. I recommend the one on fanfiction.net, only because it's a much more complete story, they are very similar in terms of what has been published except ffn has about 34 chapters and hpff.com only has 20 or so. So I would say, read the ffn one! I read them the hpff one first but only because I found it first. There is very minor differences to be honest, only slight changes like an added sentence here or there to be honest so I wouldn't worry! But definetly go for ffn because there's so much more of it there! Hope you enjoy it , it was one of my fav fanfics yet! Professor Keenan is so likeable!!
