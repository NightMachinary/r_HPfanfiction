I want to say Harry has taken over Weasley's wizard wheezes but I could be wrong. All I remember is Draco is homeless and I think a girl who works for Harry ends up becoming friends with him. Draco might end up with Harry's scarf at some point. I'm pretty sure it was on Ao3 but I really don't remember much else


** This... /maaaaybe/ sounds a little like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1210501/chapters/2474869][All Must Draw Near]] by saras_girl? But it isn't Draco that's homeless in that fic. Draco helps Harry run the store and they befriend a homeless girl. There is a bit with a scarf also I believe.
