**** The one time we see it in action, the Unbreakable Vow is way more complicated than that. It takes 3 people, and it's not a way to guarantee you're telling the truth, it's more like one person gives a statement of future intention, and then the second person accepts it under (magical) pain of death.

The larger issue is that JKR has said a number of times that no magic is perfect - that there's always a way around, always wiggle room. Veritaserum, for example, isn't infallible and can be resisted. The concept of a "Magical Oath" that's infallible to the point of the user's statement being unequivocally and immediately accepted by the listening parties (this happens a lot in fanfiction) just goes against the spirit of canon completely.

Either he's a shitty friend here or it's just a convenient plot device to make this conflict happen.

And I get that they're teenagers still growing and learning and finding themselves, but for him to never get over his insecurities (or really for him to 'reset' when conflict is needed, however you wanna look at that) except when it lets him be a hero isn't brilliant. It's shitty.

Hermione grew as a character and learned how to function as a witch and human being. Harry, even with his implied abuse, grew as a character and dealt with his burdens as best as he could.

But you're telling me that because we were never closely introduced to Hermione's parents and Harry's are dead that Ron's decision to help his friends and leave his family somehow makes his Forest scene more powerful?

I generally like him, and I think overall he's a good character, but those two scenarios really stand out. They ultimately color my thoughts of the series when I begin to delve deeper into the issues I have with the series. Especially when compared to Hermione.

** Fanon misconceptions I really don't like:

James, Sirius, Peter, and Lupin self-referring to themselves as "The Marauders." This whole thing sprung up from the introduction of the Marauder's Map. Look at where the apostrophe is - the map is referencing something general, not specific, like Pirate's Cove or Philosopher's Stone.

Snape being Draco's godfather. This one really puzzles me, because nowhere in canon does it even /hint/ at this.

The idea of a Head Boy / Head Girl's room or office, usually presented as a cheap way for characters to sneak off for sex.

Magical cores.

"For the greater good" being Dumbledore's mantra. It's /Grindelwald's/ mantra, which Dumbledore casually brought up in personal correspondence, and is later quite rightly horrified/saddened that he inspired.

The Golden Trio. Makes me cringe every time, to the extent where I don't even like to see fics reference it to make fun of it. At this point, this phrase should simply be buried.

Letting the general conception of Harry's childhood go from the canon level of "grudgingly tolerated by relatives" to "cruel and unusual child abuse."

I think you're downplaying Dumbledore's involvement. It was his philosophy too, not just Grindelwald's. And it's evident through his actions that he hasn't entirely forsaken the idea, just taken it in a different direction from Grindelwald. Now if a fic actually has Dumbledore proclaiming that he's doing things for the greater good then, yes, that seems out of character.

But yeah when people escalate the abuse of Harry it's rarely to a him being punched/slapped by his relatives it's all out abuse that would be incredibly noticeable and inevitably ignored, either because Dumbledore's evil or because the author doesn't really care.

I read somewhere that JKR said the depiction of Harry's childhood with the Dursleys was purposely overdone because at the time of writing, it was intended to be part of a specific genre of YA literature similar to Series of Unfortunate Events, with a mystery plot. When the series matured, the intention changed and Harry's backstory became inconsistent with his character as a teenager, and she acknowledged this. Harry definitely should have been more messed up from what he experienced.

I like to take this as an example of how the series was quite alive--it grew up along with its readers. Now we have the happy choice of taking our interpretation of Harry's character into one direction or the other. The inconsistency makes it richer, in my opinion.

**** *Pre-CoS* I don't think the Dursleys abused Harry, at least in so far as their actual actions are concerned. Harry's quality of life was not that low -- about what you'd expect a child in a poor family to experience.

The cupboard thing isn't even so bad -- I had a friend at primary school whose bedroom was also the cupboard under the stairs, albeit probably cleaner than Harry's. Still, the principle is the same: his cupboard was essentially a small room that was just big enough for a bed but not more. A lot of children have bedrooms that just fit their beds (called a box room, a very common feature in UK houses). The other problem is no natural light, but really, if we're going to call that abuse then thousands of families are abusing their children just because they can't afford a nice house.

What else is there? Being sent to your room and made to stay there, without dinner - a common punishment. Not starving but not being able to eat everything you want? Again, a common experience for children in poor families. We don't even have evidence of Harry being smacked, which many families do. All we have is a mention of Petunia taking a swipe at Harry with a pan but there's no evidence that it was a serious attempt to cause harm rather than a "warding off" gesture.

What makes the Dursleys actions so reprehensible is not the quality of life Harry has, but rather that they could have given him a higher quality of life but chose not to. The Dursleys aren't a poor family. Harry is constantly reminded of the abundance around him but doesn't get any of it.

That makes the Dursleys incredibly nasty people but I'm not sure if it counts as abuse given that, as noted above, Harry's actual lifestyle is not abusive, being that experienced by poor children with strict parents.

Of course that all changes in CoS where they essentially imprison Harry for weeks.

They don't show him any affection at all, and they turn an absolute blind eye to Dudley bullying him. Also, Dudley has TWO bedrooms. I think the abusive stuff is so glaring because they're clearly not at all a poor family; they go out of their way to spoil Dudley AND give Harry as little as possible.

I always headcanoned the reason they didn't hit him was because they didn't want to leave marks (or JKR didn't want to/wasn't allowd to mention it in a children's book). To be honest I think the canon!Dursleys get off pretty scot-free; I don't think they deserve to be MURDERED like in certain fanfics; but they never face any comeuppance from magical nor muggle authorities for deliberately conspiring to make a small child's life as lonely and upsetting as possible, for ten years, for no good reason.

***** I thought it was pretty clear that Harry was abused, but thats what literature is for, different interpretations. I think you made a somewhat understandable distinction, between poorer families and what level of life the Dursley's could afford him. In some books its described as if Harry knows exactly how to dodge his Uncle's fists. In CoS I think its more described as Petunia taking a swing at his head with a cast iron pan, which takes a great deal of effort, so it would appear to actually be an intent to harm. Also, Harry really does appear to be starved, they weren't hurting financially, as evidenced by the obesity of Dudley and Vernon. They could have fed him, but they didn't, he seemed to get sent to the cupboard without any food for the smallest of slights.

Then of course there was Marge and her dogs, that tried to attack and bite Harry, leaving him up a tree all day and well into the night.

So I don't think a lot of abusive situations are hard to extrapolate from there. Sure, Harry probably wasn't tortured in the basement in Vernon's own special chamber dedicated entirely to making Harry's life hell, but I think the descriptions show the signs of being physically abused.

Not denying that Harry had a shitty childhood, I just don't like how fanon has generally ratcheted the level of neglect up from canon to the point where you'd have to have Vernon roast Hedwig on a spit and then beat Harry senseless with a tire iron to have it even ping on the radar.

Ditto. See, the way I figure it, using runes as a practical magic works with the idea that runes are just written spells. The correct runes work to cast a spell the same way the correct incantation and wand movement do, only a rune-based spell would last longer and stay in place, thus making them ideal for protective enchantments, binding spells, and most of the kind of things where we see runes used for in other supernatural media.

And I can't remember clearly, but I think there was a time in one of the books where Transfiguration was temporary only because of the focus/skill of the student casting it, like I think it was worded how there was a loud pop and whatever they were transfiguring went back to how it originally was.

**** The purpose of occlumency is to trick the person using legilimency on you. The legilimens is not supposed to realise that you're using occlumency at all - they're meant to think that they succeeded in using legilimency on you, but actually they haven't.

We know from Snape (and JKR) that this is achieved by detached objective thinking, separating feelings from thoughts so that your mind is compartmentalised. It doesn't seem so much as a skill as a kind of heightened self-awareness and mastery/control of your own thoughts. In a word, occlumency is "objectivity".

So yeah, shields goes completely against everything we know about both the methods and entire point of occlumency.

And you're going to have to quote that transfiguration before I believe you, I'm afraid. I think it's probably from a fanfiction, because actually we see very little transfiguration indeed in the books.

I dislike "Occlumency shields" as well, especially if it's not just a metaphor but an actual thing that one builds, but I think that what you describe is the highest tier of proficiency in Occlumency. Loosely, it seems like there might be two or three, depending on how one counts:

1. Keep a Legilimens from reading one's thoughts. I.e., "close your mind". Detecting Legilimency attempts is also a part of this. This would have sufficed for Harry in OotP and sufficed for Draco in HBP. The shield metaphor is, actually, appropriate here.
2. Make a Legilimens see what you want them to see well enough to muddle what is real and what is not, but not necessarily well enough to conceal that one is an Occlumens or that at least some of what is being read is false.
3. Hide that one is an Occlumens or using Occlumency in the first place. This is less a magical skill or ability as such than it is the ability to confabulate an internally consistent personality and mental state, then outsmart and manipulate the interrogator into believing that it is the real one. Snape had to have achieved this level of proficiency to deceive Voldemort.

This is, of course, a sliding scale relative to the skill level of the Legilimens.

I'm not a big fan of the idea of "shields" either, but it does seem like there's something functionally similar where you're "clearing your mind" well enough that someone can't pick anything up, but /not/ well enough that you're able to master/control your own thoughts to the point where they can't tell you're doing anything.
