In too many fics death is either really nice or really evil I just want one where death doesn't like Harry but as he is it's master death can't do anything other than cause minor inconveniences for Harry


** “Master I can send you back in time to a time when you can make a difference.”

“Back to 1st year,” his Master commanded.

Death had to send Harry back in time, but as he hadn't specified a location or date, he could send the disgusting mortal he was forced to call Master wherever he wanted.

And so on the date of his last 1st Year final exam at Hogwarts, Harry James Potter, aged 11 and 29, appeared on the beautiful continent of Antarctica without a wand and no way to return to Hogwarts as he hadn't collected the Deathly Hallows in this timeline.

Of course, Death wasn't heartless, he may dislike his master but the paperwork for all the deaths that would occur without the Houdini of Death's presence would keep Death busy for years. So after letting his Master shiver and lay with penguins for a day, he allowed a wand to appear so the mortal could apparate back to Scotland.

Obviously Death left all the explanations for the boys disappearance to Harry himself.

Harry was resigned and just sighed, he may have greeted Death as a friend, but Death was definitely his most dick-ish friend, and yes he included Ron in that. At least now I can save Sirius, thought Harry. But then he pictured Death and Sirius meeting and decided to avoid the Deathly Hallows like the plague, he didn't want to accidentally tie himself to the jerk again.
