I've read quiet a few, but most were pretty bad and only one or two were any good, I've probably made this thread before and this is probably a common ship leading to alot of mass produced trashy stories, but I figured I'd ask again what some of the best Harry/Hermione stories are. Preferably non post DH and even more preferably a lesser known story, not the ones I can find on TV tropes and have seen posted here 1000 times.

Also I was looking for an (unrelated) story about an avid HP fanfiction reader that gets transported to the Harry Potter universe, I can't seem to find it or remember it's name.


** linkffn(Resistance by lorien829) is pretty good and has less reviews.

As for the unrelated story, here you go: linkffn(A Curse of Truth by butalearner)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

**** Not that you are recommending it, just linking it, but FWIW I thought the Curse of Truth kinda sucked. I cannot understand why it gets recommended so often. It is 200K words of stream of consciousness (for the most part) writing. The author even explains that he didn't know half the time what was coming up and just wrote each chapter as it came - which made for weird and unfulfilling plot. He even changes the name of the main character just one chapter in.

There is also a ton of weird stuff where he kisses Hermione and then makes Harry kiss her and it goes nowhere. The M rating also makes no sense - the most graphic thing is a kiss.

  Most people tend to assume they'll wake up exactly where they fall asleep, and usually they have good reason to do so. For someone, however, even that simple certainty stops being a given one strange night, when quite surprisingly he does in fact not wake up where he fell asleep. And that is only the beginning of what will be one most unusual week in the life of Harry Potter.

No bashing either, I believe. linkffn(8693743) and linkffn(6092362) by Lorien are really good fics as well. linkffn(3186836) is a classic - you might have already read it (Vox Corporis).
