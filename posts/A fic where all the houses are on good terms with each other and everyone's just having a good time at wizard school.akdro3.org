** IIRC, in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] all the houses get along, with nothing but friendly competitive rivalry, but they're not just having a good time, since they're intensely preparing for Voldemort's return. It's a great fic though.

** Tamer, linkffn(7800059), off the top of my head this is an interesting one. This one might not be everyone's cup of tea and it might not be exactly what you had in mind. It's loaded with stereotypes (Lord Hadrian Potter, indy!Harry,' etc.) but there is some originality in it (no harems and Harry isn't uber rich among other things) which is why I bothered giving it a chance to begin with.

Harry and Malfoy are still rivals, but on the whole there's house harmony. The H/R/Hr, Neville, and Ginny are much more focused on their academics in the fic. I can recall some scenes where they all took turns helping people from other houses (including Slytherins) with their homework. Overall it's not the best writing and there are some cringe moments (Sirius and Remus referring to Harry as 'Bambi' for example...bleurrghhh!) but I thought it was a somewhat interesting take on the Lord Potter cliché with some interhouse amicability.

  Harry Potter is tired of the Dursleys. And after seeing how Fudge refused to listen to Sirius's pleas of innocence, he's tired of them too. So he runs away. And finds his purpose. Fourth-year fic. Homoromantic, asexual Harry. Slash undertones. Not Abandoned, but on Hiatus for unknown amount of time.

** In Luna's Hubby linkffn(Luna's Hubby) they have an inter-house study group that influences the attitudes and starts spreading to other years. They also play games with magical twists that makes me think “kids having fun at magic school”.

** I myself would suggest Hogwarts 1835, linkffn(5461818): a historical period piece as suggested by the title, set in 1825. Criminally underrated fic IMO, it has great writing, house rivalries are mostly just over Quidditch, and students from all houses make friends with one another. This far back there just wasn't any genuine animosity amongst the houses. For bonus it also has a great historical sense of place.

  The school stood long before the boy with the unusual scar arrived. Each year new students enter, and old leave. 1835 featured its own triumphs and tragedies as students in the houses contend with each other for recognition as the best house at Hogwarts.
