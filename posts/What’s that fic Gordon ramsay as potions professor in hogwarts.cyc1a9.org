#+begin_quote
  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** The story is actually so much more heartfelt and intense than I'd expected from the prompt/1st chapter - I couldn't believe how much I cared about all the characters!

**** Here's the chapter he's mentioned. I should also note that it's not a TWT task, but one of several tasks that the student body can participate in.

** Thanks for pointing this out. It's new to me. I've been reading through it, not finished [[https://yet.It][y]]et, it sticks to the basic plot lines of the last two books but runs far of the page in some respects. It shows the war and it's effects on the average witch/wizard from the standpoint of secondary characters and their families from the original books. There's also a fair bit of linkage to current events in the real world with it's current problems of nationalism, supremecism, etc through references to things like "The Stormer", an alternative newspaper to The Daily Prophet. The Stormer is an obvious and direct reference to The Daily Stormer a white supremacist American website and message board system. So far I'm fairly impressed with the quality of the piece particularly given that i was going to write this off as a short bit of fluff and discovering that it covers ninety nine chapters and near a thousand pages at 14 point font..
