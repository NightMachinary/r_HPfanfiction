All I'm able to find are lemon stories where Harry has sex with everyone? How do I find good stories? Help!


** Start by going to the filter button, scroll down to exclude, then check off Explicit under Ratings and apply it.

AO3's tagging system is exhausting. You'll have to start out with filtering out the main tags you don't like (m/m, , multi, etc) then also do things like manually type tags to exclude out under "Other tags to exclude". Note the common tags on stories you don't like and type them in there if they're not listed by default.

It might take an hour of filtering out 100 or more commons tags that are all slight variations of the same thing. Once you have yours created, bookmark it in the browser.

Edit: you'll also want to change the sorting to either Kudos or Reviews. Those will be the most popular. Make sure that you filter out explicit first or the top will be all porn stories.

*** Is it common for your ship to be purely porn whenever you search for it? Because mine has 20 beautiful recs.\\
The first one is romance and disgustingly cute. The second one is actually a really awesome fic I've read a couple of times. The third one is legit tagged as 'Fluff'. The fourth one is rated teen and is a fucking brilliant fic like dude that's such a good fic. The next is 'fuckng hell guys there's so much fluff' or something like that. You get the idea.\\
So is this just common for your ship or?

***** Great. I don't care. Not my point.

I don't like 'Harry/Death Eater' fics. I like drarry. That is my ship.

I followed your advice. I searched for my ship, and then filtered out some tags I don't like (I'm pretty liberal with this, since I don't care much), etc. etc.It gone me fluff and teen fics. Fics with brilliant plot.For example, it gave me Running on Air. Surely you know that fic, don't you? The one written beautifully without any slash sex scenes whatsoever? With a clever and well-written plot?Surely you've heard of it.

​

Also, are you sure you have never, in your life, read a sex scene? ever? so is the problem with slash sex or just sex in general?\\
And not to mention you have just equated 'one (1) sexual content scene' with 'PORN'.\\
Really I see some issues with your thinking.

******* Ah, I see the problem here. You don't know what you're talking about.\\
It all makes so much more sense now.

A Mist and a Weeping Rain is not a 'porn fic' it is a fic. A short fic, yeah. But so? It's still a fic.\\
There's a difference between Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain and, I dunno. Kettle. You, however, seem to be blurring those lines.

(oh and they said is was only 'lemon stories where harry has sex with everybody' )

***** That shouldn't be happening.

Like, legit. If you tag it as gen, then it should be gen.

So I have no idea why this is happening. Try asking [[/r/AO3][r/AO3]]

** 1.Use the Collections feature. See if your favorite stories are in any Collections and explore them after filtering for fandom.

1. Bookmarks: If you like a story, filter though the author's bookmarks to find more stories. Repeat.

2. This sub's weekly reading threads: Look through present and past weekly threads for fics.

** I'm pretty sure that not every story on AO3 has Harry having sex with everyone. I know the search engine on there isn't particularly helpful but perhaps if you stayed away from Explicit rated stories that might help.

**** Most of AO3's strength is in the tagging system, bookmarks and collections. The Filtering sidebar is also very good once you get used to it. The actual search box isn't very intelligent or useful. That is what Google is for.
