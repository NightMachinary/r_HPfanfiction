Bonus points if he's actively trying to hide them. I'm especially interested in Harry being a metamorphogus, and using the ability in a clever way and not telling anyone

****** For years i just posted the title and author name and figured if someone really wanted to read it than they could look it up themselves. Then I saw another doing the same and realized how lazy it was and given how lazy most people are I figured most probably just scroll past it and never see the stories I think are actually worth reading.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] is a Hinny Soul-Bond fic that gives non-apparition teleportation, magical power at least eight times more powerful than Dumbledore and all the linked stuff with Ginny like thoughts, senses, and emotions.

Only Dumbledore, McGonagall, Pomfrey, Hermione, Luna and the Weasleys know about it.

Then again, I'm just using any excuse I can find to rec this fic so... do what you will.
