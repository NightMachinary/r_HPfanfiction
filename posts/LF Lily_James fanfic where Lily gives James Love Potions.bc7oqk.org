I remember reading something like this in the past but cannot remember the author. In it the Potter family was cursed with ambitious flat-chested redheads using love potions on the male members.

Despite the content it was relatively lighthearted, yet I cannot remember the name. Any help would be appreciated.


** Sorry to say that I dont know the fic you ask for. But this did got me thinking. Its quite disturbing how lightly the Potterverse deals with what is essentially a rape drug. Taught in schools, easily obtainable, Weasley twins (who we are all supposed to like) sell it in the middle of Diagon Alley, Molly apparently made one in school and other girls find the story funny. Its really creepy. I think the only time its treated with any semblance of seriousness is when Merope drugs Riddle Sr.

*** My headcannon is that those prank love potions are not ver long lasting, like they would stop working the first time you touch or kiss the person of your 'desire' or it only lasts a few minutes.

Everything stronger is forbidden

**** Err. Even then they still somewhat cross a line similar to the imperious curse. Or compulsion charms fanfics are so fond of (curse you Fanfiction Dumbledore)

***** yes they do cross lines, but I try to see them in the context of their time.

back in the nineties the whole issue with sexuell harressment wasn't talked about and people just assumed that as long as it is not rape or with children, lots of things were seen as not crossing lines...

That doesn't make it ok, but at least not as rapey

****** Frankly, I'm surprised Hermione in the books never objected to them like she did the house-elves.

  COMPLETE. OneShot. A 'What if' exercise to make you wonder just what if it hadn't been raining on that fateful day? Or what if it's true?
