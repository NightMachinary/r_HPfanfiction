Imagine if nobody ever gave a shit about Voldemort, like people treated him like they do crazy “the end is near “ sign people on the side of the road, he's all like “MUGGLES ARE FILTH” and everyone's just like “alright there tommy boy calm down”


** Voldemort's not really an enemy that would be neutered by something like that. He could personally destroy diagon alley, for instance, or assassinate literally anyone except dumbledore if he decided it was worth it.

Like "Alright Tommy Boy Calm Down" would likely be met with an extremely painful death

** No like if he never gained any followers at all, he was just a weird little orphan who was cool, then turned kinda crazy and everyone just let him think what he wanted but nobody gave a shit or cared, and they certainly didn't help him

*** He has a lot of personal power even without the death eaters, though. Like he got a lot of his power while he was off the grid in Albania or wherever, and it seems like he did it alone.
