  Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

  “Hey Ebony!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was.... Draco Malfoy!

  “What's up Draco?” I asked.

  “Nothing.” he said shyly.

  But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.

  “Hey Ebony! Wait up!” He ran up to me.

  “What?” I asked.

  “Will you.... Will you be my girlfriend?” he asked.

  I looked at him shocked.

  “Uh... Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way does not go out with dickheads like you.” I said.

  “Please!” he begged.

  I took a long hard look at him. He wasn't that bad looking. And I never had a boyfriend before. And I really wanted to go out with someone.

  “Ok fine.” I said.

  “Really?”

  “Yes Draco. Really.” I said.

  “Ok then.” he said. “Can we go out tomorrow?”

  “Yes!” I said.

  “Ok. Tomorrow it is.” he said.

  “Ok. Bye.” I said.

  I walked away.

  “Where are you going?” he asked.

  “Home.” I said.

  “Oh. Ok. Bye.” he said.

  “Bye.” I said.

  And then I went to my dorm and went to sleep.

There's more, but I've only copied this much because it was a good stopping point.

​

Somehow, the output that the AI gave me is better than the actual fic.


** I don't know why you're being downvoted, it's pretty funny.
