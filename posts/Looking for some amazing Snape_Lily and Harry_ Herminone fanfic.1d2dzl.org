Hello fellow FF lovers, looking for your suggestions on both of these parings!


** Since you asked, I'll do some self-promotion plus a second, fall-back suggestion.

I've got a moderately large, still updating work-in-progress, slightly-AU adventure/romance fic for Harry/Hermione: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary: Harry never beat Voldemort, only barely managing a stalemate. Years later, Harry falls victim to a Dark ritual that sends him back in time to when he was 11. After Dumbledore discovers Harry's abuse by the Dursleys, things spiral out of control fast. His magical abilities damaged by the trip back, Harry's only hope is the Witch Queen herself, now known merely as Hermione Granger.
#+end_quote

Not sure if it counts as "amazing" or not, but I try. It isn't porn and it also isn't an after-Hogwarts, adult romance story either. Being set in First Year (with 31-year-old Harry now eleven again), it is more of a friendship fic for them (for obvious reasons) but there are also adult relationships represented in flashbacks to Harry's Dark-Future-Past. Again, don't know if this is something you'd like, mileage may vary, etc, but Harry and Hermione do have a relationship and feelings and such.

If that isn't your cup of tea, this one (by someone else) might be: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]]

#+begin_quote
  Summary: At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
#+end_quote

This one is another time travel story ('natch, see my profile name), so again, might not be what you're looking for. Interested to see what other people come up with as suggestions.

In any case, Harry/Hermione romance is /hard/. Not sure why. Maybe because Hermione, in canon, is such a bland plot tool compared to other characters. Which is sad, because I think she's something like 30% JK-self-insert, is actually smart and studious in a story set in a damn /school/, and would in any other story be a very interesting character. What does it say when your self-insert character gets saved by the hero in the first book, then almost exclusively sits around and reads for the rest of the series (until /Hermone Granger and the Horcrux Camping Trip/, or whatever it was called - the less said about that, the better).

**** I've sort of jammed a lot of ideas into one fic here. Lots of loose ends right now but I think the last third of the story will be a roller coaster ride of awesome. Assuming I don't screw it up. I've also got at least one sequel planned. I'll get the next update out soon. Enjoy!
