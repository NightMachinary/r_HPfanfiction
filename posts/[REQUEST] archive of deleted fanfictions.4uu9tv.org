** If it was ever hosted on FF.net there's a good chance it's on fictionhunt.com

I've found many deleted fics there, happy hunting!

Edit: decided to go see if I could find it for you, is this it? [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/7287445/1]]

*** Merlin, I can't believe you found it. The author claimed to have exclusively moved it to LiveJournal. Thanks a lot! It's strange though, I tried various google search phrases, and nothing came up and since I only read on fanfiction.net till now, my knowledge about other FF-websites is limited.

** On top of Fictionhunt that Susire mentioned, there's also [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/][HPfanficarchive]]. It was created to house fanfiction that has been removed from FFN for whatever reason. There's a lot of NC-17 stuff that was removed in the FFN purges that has lingered on here.

** If the author themselves has deleted it, you shouldn't go searching for it. Rule #6 says:

#+begin_quote
  Do not use this subreddit to try to circumvent the rules of other fanfiction communities or the will of authors.
#+end_quote

and was specifically made with fictionhunt and DLP in mind.
