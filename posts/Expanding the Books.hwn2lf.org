Does anyone know of a fanfic that's re-writing and expanding the original books with minimal changes? Maybe upping the reading/content levels to adult-ish especially for the earlier novels? Rereading the books, the lower comprehension level and length of the earlier books in particular is really off-putting as an adult. (Not hating on the books, I understand WHY that is).


** I'd love this, but I think the author would get a lot of hate for not having an original plot, so most probably don't want to bother with that

*** If there isn't one around I might try my hand at it, but I don't know that I'm a good enough writer to make it worth it.

**** Well, you'll never know unless you try, and writing is a skill I'm sure most people can improve with practice. Please reply to this comment with the link if you do decide to write one! I'd love to read it.

** I think the problem is that more content would just make the books bloated. The plot carries itself at the length it's written for. Prisoner of Askaban is within the average length of adult novels, anyway. Even the earlier two would only need a few more chapters (although, I suppose in many ways it could make it much easier for someone just to write a few up and tell you where they're inserted.)

There's not much that could be done for the content levels, unless the whole thing was told from another perspective because Harry is 11 in PoS. Although it is more acceptable to cover hardhitting issues in children's books.

I think the biggest place for expansion would probably be when Harry was younger, at the Dursleys.

That said, someone spruced up Cursed Child quite nicely. It helped that it was a script to start with.

I get that some people are into books well over ordinary publishing length (bearing in mind that those who are already big names get away with longer books). In that case, I think the major difficulty would be keeping to the canon (in order to follow onto the later books, if a read through is what you're after) without also getting JKR and her merry band of lawyers on your tail.
