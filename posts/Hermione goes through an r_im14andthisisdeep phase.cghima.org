  ‚ÄúBrilliant,‚Äù said Hermione. ‚ÄúThis isn't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever.‚Äù

** Honestly! It should be HG:MOR because goodness those /boys/ haven't got an ounce of rationality to them! We live in a /wizarding/ society; its /wizarding/ Britain, but what about the witches? Perhaps it should be Herstory of Magic, yes? You don't see any witches running off and forming "Death Eater" groups or conquering Europe!!! Wheres your rationality now? Checkmate, wizards!!!!

****** Ah. I basically never do that. Scrolling through someone's comment history just feels... I dunno, weird and snooping to me. Like going to someone's social media and snooping back through "Summer at the beach 2009!" pics.

** And Harry is always the one leaving lengthy comments on her posts about how society is so fucked up and they will never understand the true feelings of today's youth. Because that kid was emo as shit at 14.
