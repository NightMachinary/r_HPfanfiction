the 2 are actually straight. i imagine harry and ron taking a sip of such a drink and having sex with each other. The imagination could be funny. Im fine with male and female constellation (so 2 males and/or 2 females). Doesnt have to be a Potion at all, can be a cursed artifact or something like that.


** Ah, yes. The rape/non-con hidden behind magic genre.

EDIT: To be clear, I have nothing against a non-con fetish, especially in fiction /writing/. No /real/ person is being hurt.

I just feel like we should call it what it is, lest we forget that forcing people to have sex via mind-altering substances are, well, rape.

*** i dont know, if its debatable, if its rape if 2 Persons who are straight or not are sexualy twisted and fuck a person, they usually never would. In my case, they would feel ashamed about themselfs and for the other one. Through the Potion, both would want to fuck each other. I dont know, if that counts as rape

**** They would both be the victims. Anyone involved in the creation/distribution of the potion would be responsible for the rape.

That's kinda like saying that Gun Makers are responsible for school shootings. (BTW I *DO NOT* want to get political)

Unless you mean the student that made it(for OP example Ron) and accidentally drugged them both. Then you are completely right.

Please excuse any grammatical mistakes you might find, I'm sick and it kinda messes with my grammar.

It's not exactly the same. I wasn't saying that people responsible for the creation/distribution would /always/ be responsible. Just in this case where negligence was obviously involved - two innocent bystanders being exposed to it accidentally.
