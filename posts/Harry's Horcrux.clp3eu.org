You all remember how Voldemort's spirit went through Harry during the end of Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone? Well what if thats when harry got the horcrux. Tom meant to murder so the intent at least and the soul went through harry. Tell me your opinion on this


** Why would Harry's scar hurt in the opening feast if he didn't have a piece of Voldemort's soul in him yet?

** I think he was already a Horcruxes from hints in the book. But perhaps more of Voldemort's soul could of attatched to Harry's horcrux making it stronger.

** Harry could talk to snakes because he was a Horcrux, and he could talk to snakes before he started at Hogwarts.

**** Sure, but the books suggest that although Lily may indeed be a descendant of a Squib, the ability to talk to snakes comes from the Horcrux. I think Dumbledore basically says, in Chamber of Secrets, "you can speak to snakes because Voldemort can speak to snakes".

***** Yes but that was only a theory. Nobody knew she could have been a squib everyone thought she was muggle born.

****** There's a piece of canon I think from Pottermore which suggests muggleborns are effectively the long-lost children of Squibs. I don't know how "true" that is for the HP universe but I don't think it's really relevant to Harry and his Parseltongue - we have a much clearer link with textual evidence from canon that it's a result of the Horcrux which was created at the same time as his scar.
