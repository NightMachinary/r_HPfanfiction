11-going-on-12-year-old Harry Potter shut the door to his room and collapsed on the bed.

Then he got up again. There was something that felt like a magazine underneath his head.

Harry picked it up. It wasn't a magazine at all, it was a brochure...a magical brochure, given the moving picture on the front.

"Beauxbatons Academy of Magic wants you?" he quietly read aloud.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section-1
   :END:
Harry started to flip through the brochure.

Beautiful castle, check.

Top quality magical education, check.

Friendly staff and students, check...oh my, make that /very/ friendly students.

And at the end of the brochure, someone had scribbled, in childish block letters, 'ABSOLUTELY NO DARK LORDS, EVIL PLOTS, OR MALFOYS'.

--------------

Hidden in the garden, below Harry's window, a house-elf crossed his fingers and /hoped/.

"Please work, please work, please work..."
