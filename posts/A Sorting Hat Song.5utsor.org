I'm struggling to make an original sorting hat song. Any advice/ suggestions?


** My suggestion is to not bother. Originality for the sake of originality isn't necessarily a good thing. No reason to fix something that's not broken.

*** Agreed. I've never read a Sorting Hat song in fics. It's either bad or same as canon, so I don't bother.

** Have you ever seen a good Sorting Hat song? If not, then it's probably a bad idea to write one.

Anything that needs to be told to your characters can be said by Dumbledore/whoever is the head. Any hidden message for the reader needs to be somewhere less cliche and ridiculous.

** I think we have about 6 different sorting hat songs if you include /The cursed child/, so you could use one of those? Or simply mention that the hat sang about friendship or whatever without actually writing it.

** Unless its trying to carry an important message I wouldn't bother. Its something that can so easily be awful, many people will skip it and its probably very hard to get right. Unless you really want it in there I would get rid of it, simply have it in the background while a character looks around to see who is new at the staff table.
