I'm having my first foray into authorship, and I want to write a LOTR crossover, but don't want read LOTR because of the pairings, imagine wanting to write a Harry Potter fanfiction but no wanting to read the books because of Harry/Ginny, basically all I know about LOTR is what insight fanfiction has given me, (Shaky at best) and the wiki. Any advice?

*** Aragon/Arwen, Eowyn/Faramir and I think a few Hobbit wifes are mentioned. Other than that just complete background stuff.

*** Yeah, the best stories involve something that the writer obviously likes. If you don't like a book enough to even read it the project is probably a bit doomed.

** Pairings in LOTR? What pairings? Of the fellowship the only one who has a relationship that I know of is Aragorn with Arwen.

Also maybe choose a series to cross over with that you actually know and like?

*** Doesn't Eowyn end up with Faramir and Sam has a wife in the end as well?

**** Forgot about Faramir and Eowyn, and Sam does get a wife, though it's well after the events of the main story so it's not really important.

***** There's also the bit where Eowyn fancies Aragorn.

Plus the Silmarillion has several. Some of the Ainur are together, although that would be the most obscure fanfic plot ever. But Beren and Luthien is actually pure love story. And there are plenty more.

** If you write this fanfic without a comprehensive knowledge of Middle Earth, I WILL flame your ass in the comment section. I will /burn/ you to the ground with my criticisms. And more so, when the more knowledgeable middle earth readers find out about it.

**** Yeah, but many readers have only watched the movies too. They can just add a disclaimer that they've only watched the movies.

** Don't write a fic based on your knowledge of FanFiction alone. You'll learn enough Fan Canon to get by, but not enough about the actual story to write a good fanfic. Case in point, the lord of the rings does not have any pairings, unless you count the fact that in the epilogue they basically go “and then these names characters married each other” while wrapping up all the loose threads.

** I mean I know all you would from reading the books but Wikipedia is really your friend in this, Lord of the Rings is unbelievably complicated and convoluted.

For example: Gandalf is not just a wizard but an angel/god sent down to help mortals battle the darkness without fighting the whole war for them. That's actual canon but extremely oversimplified.

** I'm honestly curious as to why you would even want to write a fanfic of a story you haven't read.

Also, pairings? What pairings?

** Fool of a Took. You might be able to get away with a minor series. But the most complex and intricate high-fantasy series ever? LOTR fans will be sending arrows at you faster than Legolas.

** If you're going for something in the style of Tolkien or something that evokes the spirit of LOTR, you're probably going to run into problems straight off. Lack of knowledge /will/ show in that fandom. You'll be able to get away with more if you say it's based off the movie verse, though.

(But two of the top-notch HP/LOTR fics I've ever read are written with knowledge of the books, and it really does make a difference.)

As for worrying about the "pairings," they're not really all that present in the books. I mean, they exist, but they're not all that in-depth. The movies definitely played them up more than the book trilogy ever did.

And you mentioned using a wiki. Is it Tolkien Gateway? If it isn't, I'd recommend checking it out -- it's incredibly thorough.

** IF you want romance, maybe don't read High Fantasy but rather Fantasy Romance stories? Just a suggestion.
