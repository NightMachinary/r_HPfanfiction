Hey! I'm currently working on a story and I can't remember whether Harry takes his Invisibility Cloak with him when he goes on the Sirius rescue mission in The Order of Phoenix. Does anyone knows if that's the case? Does he take the Marauders Map with him as well?

** Checked the book, doesn't say anywhere that it does.

Granted, the Lithuanian translation is /really/ shit, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was lost in translation.
