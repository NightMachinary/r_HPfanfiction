Im talking about a twin who doesn't like his fame,constantly tries to include Harry in the families activities,doesn't have an irrational hate of 'slimy snakes' and all things green and silver,isn't a pro-light zealot,isn't arrogant and knows his flaws,dislikes his parents and doesn't consider them good people,and doesn't believe the sun shines out of Dumbledore's ass.

Basically the opposite of the normal WBWL twin.

It would also be cool if Harry falls into the wrong crowd which influences him to turn dark,while his twin tries to save him from that path.

Any pairing (no slash)


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/][Antithesis]] has a twin who I actually quite like the character of. Great story, but very tragic.

*** I recently read this over the past week and a half, While I enjoyed most of it, just once I wish something went right for harry. Ya know, something that wouldn't cause a normal person to commit suicide.

**** It is a fantastically bleak look at how shitty things can be when everything that can go wrong, goes wrong in the worst way possible.

** If you are cool with Girl-Who-Lived and wrong twin then Harriet Evans and the Famous Cousin is fantastic so far imo.

**** Harry Potter and the boy who lived by the Santi. Best place to read is darklord Potter as it's the most complete version but it is incomplete and doesn't seem like it'll be finished.
