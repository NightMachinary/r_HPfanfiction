Mostly focuses on Ron and Hermiones relationship and the formers struggle to graduate. I think there was something about him getting his letter later than Harrys? Great fic, any help would be appreciated!

**** Welcome! I'm curious to see what the other fic is now...always after good reading material. R/Hr and H/G are two of my favorite pairings.

** I do believe what you're looking for is "Turned to Real Life." It's gone now, though, which is a shame, because it was REALLY GOOD.

*** That sounds familiar. Boo! I should have known it'd be gone. Oh well. At least I've got closure? Thanks so much!
