** Here are a few must reads:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]] PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be. /- Welcome to the painful end of fanfiction. This story is incomplete, which means you'll never get an ending but it is still on my list of must reads because what little we get of it is so good. It's still 200,000+ words. If you're going to read fanfiction you'll have to get used to incomplete stories sooner or later./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry_the_Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story. /-First of a series of funny stories. Quite short./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][When in Doubt, Obliviate]] When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins! /- Truly brilliant story where Harry is raised by Lockhart. You'll have to read it to believe it./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4389875/1/Gossip-Queens][Gossip Queens]] After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic.

There are plenty of others but one of the things I realise now is that the more you read fanfiction the more your tastes change. When you start out you'll read stories where Harry goes to Gringotts and finds out he's Gryffindor's Heir and you think "That's a cool idea.". Then, many stories later, Harry goes to Gringotts and find's out he's Slytherin's/Merlin's/Someone's Heir and you just think "Argh, not this again!" Some of my favourites are only favourites because of how they avoid the cliches that I only recognise from having read so many bad stories. So don't limit yourself to reading the best first, there's some merit to exploring for yourself and reading the truly terrible ones as well.

And, as a last point, the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/library_list.php][Dark Lord Potter Library]] is another one of the best places to find consistently above average stories.

** I just started reading this and like it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]] - it's a OC fic written a lot like the books. Summary: The war against Voldemort never reached America, but all is not well there. When 11-year-old Alexandra Quick learns she is a witch, she is plunged into a world of prejudices, intrigue, and danger. Who wants Alexandra dead, and why?

You also may enjoy the resistance of Azkaban [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2980054/1/]] summary: It's been twenty five years since the death of Albus Dumbledore and the Ministry of Magic is now under the control of Lord Voldemort. Those who oppose him place themselves under the command of Harry Potter, former Auror and ruler of the island of Azkaban

I read a lot of stuff mainly manuals etc. I have two jobs and a wife plus two kids. I enjoy reading to clear my head so I for what I am interested in its pretty much everything.
