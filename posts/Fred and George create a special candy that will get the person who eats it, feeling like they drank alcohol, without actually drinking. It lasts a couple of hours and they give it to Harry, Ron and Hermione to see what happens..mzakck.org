** "Snape, you bastard!"

Severus Snape looked up from the dunderheaded peons he called students' homework with surprise...

** Although suspicious, all three agreed to try the candy so long as Fred and George promise not to bring anybody else. As expected Ron and Hermione immediately started making out in a corner as though it was their life's duty. Try as they made the twins could not separate them until the candy wore off.
