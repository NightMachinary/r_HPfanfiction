Completely ignoring the movies, I am not satisfied with book Ginny. Are there any fanfictions out there where she has a fleshed out character? I don't like her just being 'the perfect piece' to Harry and please no bashing.


** Try the works of Annerb, particularly linkao3(Changeling by Annerb)

** There are many such fics! Besides Annerb (which I strongly recommend), I also recommend Floreat Castellum (Not From Others) is a telling of DH from Ginny's perspective. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6246406/chapters/14311300]]

â€‹

There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/457505/Melindaleo]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird]], and frombluetored's Teatime Series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465]].

** linkao3(Inner Demons by serendipity_50) was the first larger fanfiction I read, which persuaded me, that it is possible to have ones which worthy of reading. PTSD, angst, NSFW, but pretty good one and mostly canonical.

And later I read linkffn(5677867) and it is something which tries to makes sense out of the storyline of HBP from her point of view.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

** I like Ginny's portrayal a lot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185). I find this version of her a great example in character development, considering the new circumstances and her own experiences. And yet, she's still very much recognizable as canon Ginny (post GOF).

Unfortunately, this fic is on hiatus in its final story arc. The author has assured me that Ginny will play a decisive role there.

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. M for later. Eventual Hinny.
