Are there any tips you can give?


** In what areas? But important points to remember: *dont remove magic, its an integral part of Harry Potter. Harry without magic is just an oc called harry. *Try to avoid canon rehashes of either world. Harry beeing around will change things, think butterfly effect. *Avoid the plotbased stupid ball (Harry is in a desert, is walking in the sun dehydrating and will barely make it. Because he forgot to transform some sand into an umbrella and a goblet, forgot about the augumenti charm for said goblet, forgot a cooling charm, etc) *hp magic is op if used properly, find a nice medium between curbstomping and forgot-i-was-a-wizard!harry *not all readers have done/will do research to refresh their memory of the crossover, dont assume the readers remember everything.

** I'm curious which fandoms you're crossing, too. Fusions are hard to pull off, but can be very satisfying if done well. It's technically easier to jump specific character(s) to the other world and follow them from there.

** I don't know how helpful this post will be without knowing which fandom you're interested in using in your crossover but

I recommend keeping the HP world and crossover fandom's world separate. If this can't be done at least try to keep the other fandom's character(s) in character.

As luminphoenix said don't make Harry a moron when it's convenient for the plot but also don't make him a genius either.

Harry, as he is in canon after his third or fourth year, is already OP enough for many fandoms so please don't turn him into Merlin2.0 before he goes to the crossover fandom's world or interacts with their characters.

** I personally love writing crossovers and think the world building is the most fun part. The only advice I can give is: make it about the characters. Don't use it as an excuse to just mash two worlds together, but try and figure out how it would change the people

** Cannon consistency if possible, no bullshit like magical core or super god like person. But best is when it doesn't take itself to seriously.
