Magic is a marvelous thing, capable of incredible feats and on this night it would enact a miracle.

It occurred on a Halloween night, an auspicious date for such an event. In a small village called Godric's Hollow people were out celebrating on the streets, unaware of the events that were soon to happen. On one of these streets a tall pale man appeared and strode on towards his goal. The man believed that on that night he would triumph over destiny and demonstrate his superiority over such silly things. But fate can be fickle and the future can come to pass in a way none would expect.

In this village there was an odd house, on first glance it would appear to be nothing special, a regular house in which an ordinary family lives. But there would be no first glance, for what was odd about this house is that no one could see it at all. In fact as far as everyone was concerned the house did not exist at all.

The pale man approached the nonexistent house as if completely unaffected by whatever magic was keeping it hidden. As he approached he raised his hand, in his hand he held a stick which he aimed at the door. With a flash the door was blown off its hinges and a scream was heard from inside. A man from inside yelled "its him! I'll hold him off take Harry and run!". The Pale Man laughed and after a short duel of flashing lights blasted the father aside much like he had the door. In the mean time the woman, Lily had grabbed the child and ran upstairs. She ran to the nursery room and placed the child Harry in his crib and barricaded the room to the best of her ability. She turned to her child and looked him in the eye as he stared in confusion. Yet another blast was heard and the door and barricade vanished as Lily turned around to face the invader.

The man looked at her and said "I have come for the child, you may live if you stand aside". "No, not Harry, take me instead" Lily begged. "stand aside foolish woman, there needs not be more death on this night." Lily gazed back defiantly, and started to lift her wand. "Avada Kedavra" With these words and a flash of green light Lily, now dead collapsed to the floor.

The Murderer stepped over the body and approached the child. "I see not what is meant to be special about you" he whispered "but now however you may have been a threat will never come to be". He raised his wand towards the child, who was staring back uncomprehendingly, tears gathering in his eyes as he glanced down at his mother.

"Avada Kedavra" and with a flash of green light the final death of the night occurred. But no, something had happened. Magic had gathered in a single spot in front of the child and reflected the green magic back at its caster. Such a high concentration of magic however can be unstable. While deflecting the magic, it also erupted.

And so only one was left alive. The building now had a large hole in the roof. Inside the building all that was left of the people present was the corpses of father and mother, a cooling pile of robes on which could be found a wand, and finally a crying child in his crib.

And so on this night a miracle had occurred.


** So at work today I was thinking about how there was a distinct lack of a type of fic I greatly enjoy. I thought to myself, well if no one else is writing it then I should.

So I started thinking to myself on how it would go. I instantly changed the magic system to one I always liked more and that still fits the series. Then I started working on my prologue chapter. But as I was thinking through what I would write I quickly lost the original idea and ended up with something new.

Originally I wanted a type of story with Harry reading fantasy books and noting how his life is quite reminiscent of an MC in a novel. It would have been a cracky fic about the shenanigans of an OP harry who slightly broke the 4th wall, which is something I wanted more of.

But as I thought, and then later wrote I ended up with this. I am thinking of this going in the direction of a more serious fic where Harry investigates magic and tries to discover what it was that occurred on the night his family died. And in the process would discover how magic works.

I considered having a form of narration explain what was happening during the event, but thought this fits better.

This is pretty much one of the first things I really wrote. The only other thing is like a single chapter of an original story back in 7th grade, which fun fact is the only Google result pertaining to me if you were to Google my real name.

Anyway criticism is appreciated, and a fair warning even if there was a lot of interest I am not sure I would end up continuing this. I suspect I would be terrible at being able to take it anywhere.
