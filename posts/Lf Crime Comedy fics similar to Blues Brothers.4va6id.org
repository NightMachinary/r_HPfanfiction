Does this exist? Ideally with Harry as one of the main characters, and I would prefer Ron to be his partner in crime but I'll take what I can get. Also, I don't care about the premise of the story just as long as it's part of this genre. Let me know, thanks!


** I'd love to read this!

"It's 106 miles to Hogwarts, we've got an enchanted Ford Anglia, half a bottle of Firewhiskey, it's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses. Hit it."

Edit: linkffn(3695087) is a crime/comedy, but it doesn't have much in common with the Blues Brothers style of humour.

**** goddamn you both: I just started noodling on a fucking Harry Potter/Gilmore Girls story where Harry's tossed back to 92 as a 27 year old so he emigrates to america to stay out of the way, I'm already writing two full AUs, and now I'm making notes on this!

**** There's so many quotable lines and insanely funny things going on it's hard to just pick a few. The Parselcrotch line (you'll know it when you read it) is my favorite I think.
