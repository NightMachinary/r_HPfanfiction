Any story where Albus dies a painful death. I really don't care about the rest of it, if it's a longer story(30k+ words) then mention where in the story the death takes place please. I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25477843/chapters/67426642]]. The bit with the prophecy just made my blood boil. I need an outlet.


** In the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1567849][Potter Rage]] series by Lomonaaeren he gets thwarted in a way I've come to enjoy more than a gruesome death, also from Lomonaaeren there is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] although his death is somewhat underwhelming in comparison to the fate of others in particular Snape.

From memory, those are the best I can think of but if I get anything else I'll be sure to share...I emphasize with you quite a lot, sometimes one instance of a character just makes you want to read them /burn./

*** Oh thank you for that. Something like Potter rage is just what I needed. I'll look at the other one in the morning.
