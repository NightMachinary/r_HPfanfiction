The title is pretty self explanatory. I am looking for fics that focus on a daughter of Sirius Black that is either Harry's age or a bit older. Preferably includes some romance with a character other than Harry or Ron, such as one of the older Weasleys. I have spent a lot of time on fanfiction.net and HPFF searching for fics like this and have had trouble finding many so thanks in advance for any suggestions!


** linkffn(7936530), and its sequel.

I don't remember there being any romance, though.

  The House of Black still stands. The House of Black will always stand. But what happened after Hallowe'en 1981? Dynastic feuds, family politics and maybe, just maybe, a hope which can be found in the dark of night, and the darkest of hearts. Not your typical Sirius-has-a-daughter story. Rated M. Complete.

***** Yeah, I was just referring to OP's request for a daughter who's older. I've read and enjoyed the Dangerverse and I don't think it's exactly what OP wants haha, but then again, maybe!

**** No worries. Just be alarmed, it actually starts with Harry being like two years old, and the first story in the series which is like fifty chapters or something covers his childhood until he starts Hogwarts -- then the next four stories go through the time at Hogwarts.

Let's just say there's a fair amount of sugar in Anne Walsh's stories.

On the bright side, the story's actually finished. Anne Walsh is one of very few authors who set out to write an AU that covered all seven of Harry's Hogwarts years in detail, and actually managed to FINISH the dang thing.

**** It drags on and on and /on/ from what I remember and the chapters are long. Also, if I recall correctly, Aquila is a bit like Bellatrix as Sirius thinks.

I don't know the actual plot since I never reached second or third year but I'd say give it a shot. It's been a very long time since I read it.

**** I thought it was pretty good, although it does drag on a bit. iirc shes pretty badass compared to harry.

I also read every long fic i can get my hands on so for me what drags on "a bit" is often longer than an entire fic that my roommate reads so pls take my words with a grain of salt.
