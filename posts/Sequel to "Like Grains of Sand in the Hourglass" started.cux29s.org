  Hourglass 2 - Dora Kirk aka time-tossed Nymphadora Tonks thought that things would be easier with Voldemort exposed and Umbridge gone. But now there is a new enemy on the board vying for Voldemort's role, her boyfriend is getting friendly with another girl, and to top things off...Time itself seems to be breaking down more and more often. Who knew being a teen again was this hard?
