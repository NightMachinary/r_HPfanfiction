Just wondering are their any fics set around a dueling tournament out there? can be based at Hogwarts or the wider wizarding world (maybe its international like the triwizard tournament or limited to UK either way works for me). Main character can be just about anyone really (Hermione perspective would be nice bonus though) One-shot or LF are both acceptable.


** JBerns's 'The Lie I've Lived' has a very good take on dueling, which also features prominently in the story.

His other stories also do the dueling/action aspect much better than many stories, although getting used to the 1st and 2nd person perspective can take a little.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/31/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Chapter 31 of DPSW]] certainly fits, and is a segway into the next arc with Harry being tried for attempted murder.The tournament itself is very well handled with good descriptions of magic being used.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year

** The Magic Quill has a dueling tournament near the start. The double barreled wizard.. It's about a group of wizards and witches trading stories at the Hog's Head. At least that's how it starts. It's very well written and was the first fanfic I ever read. It still remains among the best ones I've ever read too.

Edit: BTW It's all OC characters with little cameos from canon.
