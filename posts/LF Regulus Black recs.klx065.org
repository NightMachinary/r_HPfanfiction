I'm having a hard time finding any good or complete fics that are regulus centric. I'd prefer hermione or OC pairings but I'll take whatever you can give!


** Hey! Huge Regulus stan here, I've written quite a lot about him - my AO3 profile is [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/unspeakable3][here]]. My most recent Reg fics are:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26691385][Brother]] linkao3(26691385) - Sirius meets Regulus on the battlefield

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23417602/chapters/56124778][A Transient and Embarrassed Phantom]] linkao3(23417602) - when he died, Regulus became a ghost and got transported to Hogwarts.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) - Kreacher saved Regulus in the cave, and took him to Sirius

I'm also just finishing up a canon-complaint fic about his final years, hoping to start posting in January but in the meantime there are some snippets on my Tumblr [[https://unspeakable3.tumblr.com/tagged/lionheart][here]].

Other recs:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] linkao3(14760663) + everything else by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheDivineComedian/pseuds/TheDivineComedian][TheDivineComedian]], tbh, but Blackpool was the first Regulus fic I read and loved so it has a very special place in my heart!

One shots by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/such_heights/pseuds/such_heights][such_heights]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/thewhitebirds/pseuds/thewhitebirds][thewhitebirds]]

Unfinished/ongoing fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20233435/chapters/47951446][Bindings, Bindings]] linkao3(20233435) - Lily and James drag themselves (and Regulus!) out of the afterlife to sort shit out

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] linkao3(5986366) - time travel Harry rescues Regulus from the cave

  Sirius Black has always hated sitting idly by while other people get their hands dirty. But his first Order assignment out in the field leaves him feeling more turbulent than ever after he encounters the very last person he had hoped to see wearing a Death Eater's uniform.

  Regulus Black died twelve years ago and was transported to Hogwarts, as a ghost. It's not the place he would have chosen to linger for all eternity, but he supposes it's pleasant enough.

  "We don't drown. We float. That's how Muggles used to tell, isn't it?"-When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost.It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything.(A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)[Edit: SPOILERS in the comments.]

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11240489/1/A-Tale-of-Two-Sides][A Tale of Two Sides]], by Emiliya Wolfe has Regulus as best friends and then lovers with James Potter's Slytherin twin sister, Emma. It's set in the 1970s and is epic length, but I remember it being pretty good.

  James and Emma Potter are twins - inseparable. They have their Hogwarts years planned out from the start, including the House: "Gryffindor, where the brave dwell at heart!" But what happens when the impossible comes true? Standing on opposite sides of the war, the twins realise that not everything is as black and white as it seems as the battlelines seem to blur...

** I run into the same problem! I have my own fic that heavily features Regulus (with a Reg/OC/Remus triangle):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13582160/1/Severed][Severed]] is a work in progress, but will follow Regulus, the Marauders, and an OC for the last year and a half of Regulus's life.

I'm definitely going to check out the other stories recommended here!

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

  Eighteen is too young to die, but sixteen is too young to be marked as a servant of a madman, and seventeen is too young to cast the cruciatus with shaking fingers and feel it cast on you in return, twitching limbs and a throat hoarse from screaming. Seventeen is too young to be cloaked in black and masked in silver, firing curses at someone you hope is not your brother, huddled in your room with only a house elf for company and wondering if the next battle will be your last, hoping the next battle will be your last. Regulus is the brightest star in the Leo constellation, and the brightest stars are always the ones that are snuffed out first. Regulus Arcturus Black, a proud, foolish, frightened boy, is no exception.
