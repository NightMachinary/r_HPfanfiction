:END:
I can't remember the name of it, but it was a lengthy fic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] where they explored all the characters of the next generation and their post-Hogwarts life. I can't remember many details but I remember that the final chapter ends with them in a bar that one of them owns (I think it was Louis Weasley) and at the bar, each day a different set of the characters come in to bartend and have special drinks.

I would really appreciate it if anyone else remembers this fic! Thanks so much
