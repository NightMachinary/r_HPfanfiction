:END:
I know this is a fairly common fic plot, but all I can remember about this fic is that Harry travels back in time, meets Tom Riddle and trounces him in a public battle (an underpants related spell?) and then Tom conceded that it was a deserved victory. I'd be super grateful if someone could find this as it's been on the tip of my tongue. Thanks!
