:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for this fic I read forever ago where Hermione accidentally travels back to the Marauder era. This was definitely on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] (though maybe not anymore because of all the purges), and it was likely published before 2015. It was also definitely a Remus/Hermione fic. I can't remember a lot, but I'm pretty sure the fic started with Hermione falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries which is how she travels to the 1970s (it might have been a Time Turner accident or something else though, I'm not sure). The only scene I know for sure is where Hermione is telling Remus, Sirius, James, and Lily about Peter betraying the Potters and James is confused because he says Remus would be his second choice for Secret Keeper, not Sirius. If anyone knows this fic I would be enormously grateful. Thank you!


** i've not read this yet but it's been sat in my to read later for ages. it might not be the fic you want but i thought i'd go ahead and share it anyway [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24339502/chapters/58688299]]

***** Yes! It does have Harry x Sirius which sort of seems to be the focus, but Hermione and Remus get a lot of development.

The fic deals with the logistics of Harry and Hermione being in the past and how they deal with it/ what they do, and all of the drama that ensues.

Also, Harry and Hermione are BAMF and pretty experienced because they're from after the war, so that's good. It's just really well written and very interesting.

(This is all probably in the summary/tags, but yeah.)

*** Hmm... I don't think so, because I think Hermione was the only one to travel back, but thank you!

** It sounds really familiar to me, but in my time-travel phase I mostly read Hermione/Sirius, so it's very possible that I'm mixing my stories up. I found three stories I've saved that are Hermione/Remus timetravel, and they appear to be from around 2016. Unfortunately I can't remember much about them anymore. The first one says it's inspired by a ffn story, but it seems to have Harry as another timetravelling mc with Hermione, so that might not be right? I'll link them in case it's one of these.

*** I actually though Divergence might the fic for a while, but the details don't seem to match up. The other ones don't seem right either. Thank you though!

** I'm almost positive it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7860277/1/Chemistry-Timing][Chemistry and Timing]]. This is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE fics. The time travel is so well done and it's all canon compliant (EWE).

*** I'm not sure. I don't think my fic had so much back and forth between times, but I could be misremembering. It looks interesting either way though, so I'll probably check it out! Do you know if it has the scene I described? Thank you for the suggestion!

**** Sorry I think it must have been a different fic after all. In chemistry and timing, hermione travels back to her 3rd year. I should have read your post closer. But it is really good!! You should read it anyway lol.
