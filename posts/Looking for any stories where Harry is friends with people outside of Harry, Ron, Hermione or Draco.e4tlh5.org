In so many stories we have Harry befriend Ron and Hermione, or if sorted in Slytherin then Draco, and then somehow still befriends Hermione towards the end/middle.

Even in an AU Harry for some reason is still friends with these three, maybe because it's easier to fall back on what you know, but I'd love to see Harry befriend other people. Maybe older students? Maybe More then three? Maybe only having one other close friend instead of a trio?

Harry can be nice to Ron and Hermione, but I'd rather not see him become friends with them. What would it be like to have Seamus, Dean and Neville be friends with Harry? Or Fred, George and Lee take them under their wing? Or he's friends with Parvati and Lavender or something? Just something different then the typical, Ron, and Hermione or Draco.

Would rather not have Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's if possible.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.

Would be interested in seeing how Harry's personality might change from having different friends, he can be sorted into a different house, as long as he doesn't befriend Ron, Hermione or Draco.


** Only one I can think of where he's not friends with anyone of them is Three Black Birds linkffn(13247979). Harry is older and friends with Daphne and Roderick (OC, Draco's older brother), all three Ravenclaws. Harry's younger brother, Tom, is canon age and befriends Ron and Hermione.

*** Just a warning to anyone who reads this fantastic fic: it's abandoned and won't ever be finished. The author is uploading outlines for the rest of the story, but won't write the rest. That said, what we have is pretty good and it ends at a really satisfying place. Delf is one of the best versions of Daphne I've seen and the OCs are all pretty good characters.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's POV. He's two years older than canon, light, and smart. Eventual HP/DG.

** There's a solid argument that a lot of Harry's characteristics are in response to befriending Ron on the train and not wanting to lose that friendship.

Personally I've always wondered what would've happened had he befriended Lavender first instead. A higher priority on his personal presentation and possibly some decent advice on how to handle his fame are just some of the more obvious possibilities.

** I've seen a couple where he becomes friends with Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott like [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1785][Life As Dictated By A Talking Hat]] or just Slytherins in general other than Draco/pansy/etc. like linkffn(8412878), or the twins like in linkffn(9764958). Then there is also Lisa Turpin, Fred, and George in linkao3(13067763).

  Harry, with some prompting from Parvati and Lavender, get to know the five decent Slytherins in his third year, whilst trying to avoid Ron and Hermione's bickering over Scabbers and Crookshanks. This prompts the timeline to change, to truly end the war for good. A series of drabbles centred around characters, situations and friendships. Not always chronological. Rated K for now.

  (Re-Posted!) What if Harry Potter met Fred and George Weasley years before he found out he was a wizard? What if they didn't know he was Harry Potter until they helped him on Platform Nine and 3/4? How would Harry's first year at Hogwarts go with his best friends who were infamous third-year pranksters? Well, read and find out! First Book-UA. (No pairings in this book!)
