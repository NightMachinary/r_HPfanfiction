By choice or necessity, a lord with five billion votes or just Harry Potter or even just a kid/young man trying to be heard, voting/influencing for the good, the bad or just himself. I don't care. Harry is politically savvy.

Bashing, Crossovers, slash and dark!harry are fine. Please no Romance/smut-centric plots, genderbending, mpreg, harems or pottercest. Thank you

Edit: Oops. I posted this without knowing there was another political request. Though since mine isn't about brilliant politics, I'll just leave it up
