Too many stories use the veil of death or some sort of ritual to shift Characters or act as if both the universes exist side by side already such as the potter verse is mostly hidden from the marvel verse in Child of the Storm or as in some Star Wars crossovers, it's no longer long, long ago, in a galaxy far, far away but is happening concurrently.

In a free written story, I had Franklin Richards, an omega mutant, create Harry and Hermione as near omega mutants themselves in the Marvel verse which I felt was pretty unique.

Anyone got other examples of unique ways of crossing universes over to facilitate a new story?


** I've seen SG1 crossovers seemlessly integrate the HP and their universes. I think the reason for that is its a secret government project and it's in 'murica.

Mass Effect crossovers play on the MoD!Harry very well. I love Madness effect [[/spoiler][where Harry is the epitomy of a quintesential Ravenclaw]].

There are some crossovers, some GoT and LoTR fics, are MoD!Harry that was reincarnated into the universe. These stories may or may not have their memories intact.

These are just a few that could seemlessly integrate the two universes of your prefered crossover.

*** SG1s work for the reason you suggest.

Every Mass Effect crossover I've read was a terrible Harry Stu where Harry was to be the Human Spectre but didn't want to be it until Fem!Shepard shows up and he joins up to so he can save the day every time and she'll fall madly in love with him. #dreck

I usually avoid LotR because they're usually slash. I've read four or so that were awesome, two of those were the same author and one was comedy where horny!harry was a 12yo Elfling.

**** Steelbadger's LoTR fics? Yeah those are awesome. S/he usually pops in and out from time to time.

I'm assuming the first ME fic is Getting too old for this? It's a humor fic. It is kind of cracky too. Would suggest Harry Potter: Geth if you're looking for action.

You havent touched Asoiaf crossovers? Those are awesome. The prime examples are Wizard of Harrenhall, The Black Prince, and The Difference One Man Can Make. The first and last one are base and lore building with Harry [[/spoiler][wasn't sure how he got there for the first one and a spell mishap in the field for the latter]]. The second one is a reincarnated Harry.

***** Yeah. The stories are good, I just couldn't remember the writer's name.

No, I don't know the ASoIaF/GoT universe so I don't read them. I tried to watch the series but was rather uninspired, couldn't finish the first episode. I like to know both universes as intimately as I can before reading them.

I tried HP: Geth but didn't really get into it. I liked the idea but I prefer human!harry series though I may try again someday. I do like cracky but Harry Stu on its own isn't funny to me, it's just lame.

Now a Harry-Stu in ME who constantly bumbles? That could be hilarious. When everything goes his way, it gets lame. Kinda like the freewritten [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9900528/45/Harry-Potter-Drabbles][Harry-Stu]] I wrote for Legend of the Seeker. Too perfect of a character means the story is boring to me.

Which is why my Harry-Stu!Legend of the Seeker story won't ever be turned into a real story because there isn't any way for that Harry to be stopped by anyone in the Old or New World. Even their gods would fall before him.

I'd like to see a good Harry/Hermione[pref romantic but teasing!Platonic would be good] Warehouse 13 where they're the ones hired, not Myka and Pete.

****** The fics I've mentioned from asoiaf only use the location. It is completely AU.

Some ME fics YMMV, I'll give you that. However, MoD!Harry's supposed to be more level headed if you're going for the asventurer!MoD or insane as per some crack fics.

Legend of the Seeker? Sorry haven't heard of it. Will google though. Same with Warehouse 13.

Anyways going back to topic, other than the ways mentioned, there are some crossovers that Potter was summoned (e.g Wizard Runemaster) from another world.

Or just say fuck it and do it like Harry Potter and the Technage; America has no statute because of Superheroes. Which leads me to another petpeeve. Marvel has too many crossovers with HP. I haven't seen any decent DC crossovers.

** You could simply be brazen enough to offer no explanation whatsoever. In the only crossover I've written, the HP characters we know and love were transplanted to universe it was being crossed with (they were born there, grew up there, and will stay there), and I've basically been cultivating a standalone story that essentially boils down to "HP in another world". No explanation needed whatsoever.

You may lose some readers for it, but a few will appreciate the move for the sheer chutzpah it requires.

*** I've done that once or twice in some story ideas. My 2nd year Harry in Wonderland just had Harry awakened by Alice landing on him during her fall after he was knocked out by his running into the platform wall. Never got much farther than that though.

I'm working on an original series that crosses over exported parody characters from How to Train Your Dragon, Harry Potter, Dazzler, Punisher, Buffy, and about a dozen more literary series with the characters all going to one high school. I'm still debating if I explain why all these characters are going to a high school together or just take a refuge in audacity.

** Really, the best way to get a crossover going is whatever is briefest.

No one much cares how your characters got into the wrong universe, and unless you have some grand ideas for tying them together, it's best to simply get it over and done with as quickly as possible. There are far too many crossovers that waste multiple chapters on the story of how Harry (or whoever) came to fall through the veil of death (or whatever).

For that reason, if you can get away with it, you should skip the crossover mechanic completely. Mention it later, if you don't want to feel like you're ignoring it. At least, that's my preference when reading. I usually end up simply skipping the first chapter of every crossover (time travel fics are the same).

** It really depends on the other universe.

I think some crossover writers bend over backwards to build in a veil or an trip to an alternate universe using ancient magic when really all you need to do is say, "yes, these things exist in the same universe."

Like Harry doesn't have to time travel to live in a world where Marvel characters exist.

*** Yes, some of them work with no explanation. Buffy, Charmed, and Supernatural are particularly good for this - "Oh, you come from a society of magic/paranormal users/fighters that keeps itself secret from the rest of the world? So do I!"

** Let's see...

For Star Trek I've used the events of Star Trek occurring in the same universe as the ones in HP - wizards a secret society on Earth, and there's a similar secret society on planets like Vulcan. As I recall, in the 'verse I made Cardassia wiped out their wizards, and there's different policy planet by planet.

Then there's use of various enchanted objects in conjunction with each other - I've used that in Grimmauld Place where there are a ton of potentially powerful objects that could act with or against each other to engineer an unexpected reaction.

There's the use of time travel - especially in fics involving universes like those of Black Sails or Pirates of the Caribbean - and then there's also the involvement of a higher power to cross 'verses over, which I think is generally a little uninteresting unless the powers involved are well-developed and interesting.

There's a lot of different ways to approach this sort of universe-hopping, but the way it's approached depends on how much effort you want to put into a cross-over and how separate you want to keep the initial worlds.

** Have multiple stories occurring in the same world but not interacting with each other. Have one story be in the future or past of another and accessed through time travel. Have one story be an alternate timeline of another. That's all I can think of for now.

*** The hard way of time travel for Harry into the Star Wars universe was done in linkffn(Shiver Me Timbers! by Wolfd890) which I thought was pretty good since most HP/SW stories are portals through time, concurrent, or universes connected by the veil.

I do like the idea of having both universes be happening next to each other as a branch due to a decision that was done differently. It reminds me of my old world stepper story idea where my five-man band would get blown from universe to universe as they tried to catch a criminal who was causing issues in each universe to facilitae a new one where his SO didn't die by his own hand.

  He'd slumbered in Hoth's cold embrace for millennia before being exhumed by the Alliance. Could he help them defeat the Empire? A HP SW crossover(obviously)

** The best crossover I have read was not Harry Potter based but LotR and Naruto. In the story Sasuke is in the world of LotR but never explains how. all we know is that he was banished from the Elemental Nations, and if he returns Naruto will kill him. it was great.
