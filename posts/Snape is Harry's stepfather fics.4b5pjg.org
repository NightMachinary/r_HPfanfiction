** I know of one, but I'm pretty sure it's abandoned- it hasn't updated since June 2013. I can link it if you're still interested. It has 56 chapters so far.

**** Cool, here it is. linkffn(7207644)

I didn't want to link directly to it, just in case someone clicked on it and started reading it without realizing it is abandoned, I hate getting into a fic only to realize it'll never be finished. :(

** I remember one that I can't remember the name of where V made a deal with Harry where he revealed to Harry that Lily was pregnant at the time of her death, so Harry chose to keep her alive and thus entered an alternate timeline where V was still in power. Snape was his stepfather and it turned out Lily was having an affair with Sirius. No muggleborns in wizard society after 1981. And then there is a 2nd year spell that goes horribly wrong but I dont know how to cover up spoilers on my phone. Anyway does anyone know which story this was?
