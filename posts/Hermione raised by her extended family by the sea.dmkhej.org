Hello, all~

I can't find a story I'm looking for. It features a *really* long alternative childhood for Hermione. In this childhood she is sent away from her parents for a bit (I don't remember why) and raised by the sea in Ireland and learns to love it there. She has cousins and eventually has to go back to her parents and she resents it because she misses her other family. Any help would be amazing!

** Hi, I read a fanfiction like that, but I'm not sure it's the same. It's a crossover between supernatural and harry potter, it's really good

Hermione Granger is seven years old when she kneels in front of an altar she's made herself with an offering of the best sweets her pocket money could buy and prays to a Trickster God. Gabriel hears.
