I often encounter fics where, if Ron and Hermione break up or get divorced, it's blamed on Ron most of the time, either because he's cheating or because he's portrayed as a useless and awful boyfriend. Hermione's flaws are often forgotten; she is at least as argumentative as Ron, much more stubborn in her ways and opinions, and I really don't see her as very open for compromising. Her lack of acceptance and flexibility, I think, has the potential for disaster in a relationship.

I just wanted to see if there are any fics where Hermione either cheats on Ron or is otherwise blamed for their break-up. If you know of any fics where Hermione's flaws are more prominent and emphasized, that would be appreciated too.


** Loose Cannon Has that as a small little part in the beginning of the fic

** One of TMBlue's fics (Thieves or Stealing Sleep?) has this at it's heart, although there's a really massive plot twist.
