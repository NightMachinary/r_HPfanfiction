So I know it's totally clich√© and all, but I like them. =) You know the one, they get stuck in a broom closet/house/muggle world/snow globe/alternate dimension/etc and end up falling in love. So let's see your favorites! I want Draco/Harry, Harry/Snape or Snape/hermione. Don't care if there's any secondary pairings. Not too dark/abusive, etc and as much in character as possible. Thanks! =D

** Well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7170435/1/Bound-to-Him][Bound to Him]] (SS/HG) is my personal favorite of that genre. It takes an interesting spin on the soul-bond trope, and one of the only truly good fics I've read involving this trope.

SO EXCELLENT. The Blurb: Yet another one of those Harry And Draco Are Forced To Be Together By Something Beyond Their Control And Then Stuff Happens Leading To Twoo Wuv stories. Because every HD writer has to write at least one. [Finished]

Seriously, I've reread this one for YEARS. They're forced to be in close proximity and it's SO realistic and lovely and never feels forced at all.
