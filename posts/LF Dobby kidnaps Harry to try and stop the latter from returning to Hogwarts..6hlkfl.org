Because technically speaking, if Harry is chained down in a dungeon in a secret holiday manor (owned by the Malfoys, presumably) on the other side of the planet, he can't get into trouble at Hogwarts, right?

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.

** Great idea! Maybe Dobby doesn't chain him, but just puts him in house arrest in a manor? And all sorts of hilarity ensues

** If Dobby kidnaps Harry from the Dursleys then they would have the summer to get into trouble with Draco too.
