As I have read more, I have begun to hate Dumbledore-Bashing, and some of the fics I've revisited have been severely underwhelming. Can anyone recommend me some fics (preferably H/G, but I'll take all pairings) which have Dumbledore as a "Good Guy", or at least with good intentions.


** Sib's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]] is a classic. 250k words, complete, H/G book six replacement.

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr.

I'm also fond of Ella's (DeadWoodpecker's) treatment of Dumbledore in her [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]] series. Two complete novels; a third is a WIP. H/G.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.

*** Cheers, I think I've got 'The awakening power' on my list but the other one is new to me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By The Divining Light]] and it's sequel both have a great DD.

Book 1. Follow Harry and Dumbledore as they descend into the depths of Old Magic seeking power and redemption in equal measure. En route they encounter ancient enchantments, a heliopath and an evil that could burn the world.

** I can't believe - *can't believe* - that no one on this subreddit has recommended Shezza's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][*/Denarian Trilogy/*]] or Eilyfe's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magics-of-the-Arcane][*/Magics of the Arcane/*]].

[[/r/HPfanfiction]], I am disappoint.

One Shot. "I was never a child. Just a very short adult." In which Albus Dumbledore is perturbed, Voldemort is disturbed, and Harry is just Harry.

** If you're up for a marathon challenge, there's [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=read&storyid=6048&chapterid=&agree=1][Harry Potter And the Fifth Element]] by Bexis. I think it's around 1.5 million words, but is complete and has a very capable Dumbledore who avoids the master manipulator trope.

**** No problem. IIRC the first chapter is of Dumbledore calling a 'war council' do address several concerns. I remember being extremely impressed with his abilities and acumen after reading so many barmy Albus fics.
