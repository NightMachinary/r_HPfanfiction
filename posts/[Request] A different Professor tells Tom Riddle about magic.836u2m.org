Basically a story where it explores what would have happened if a professor other than Dumbledore told Tom Riddle about magic.


** Can't imagine things would have turned out very differently. Young Tom was a total sociopath from the get-go.

*** Young Tom watched one of his teachers, soon to be a very famous and important man, light his things on fire with a flippant turn of the wand. Dumbledore did nothing to help the Orphaned, lonely and off-tilt child - he just stood by and watched as Riddle took one step after another towards the mass murdering soul rending psychopath we all know and love.

Then again, all the adults in the Harry Potter universe and completely incompetent. Nothing would have changed if JK had written it that way. In the community built by millions around her work, however, quite a lot could have changed. I would personally imagine some sort of total AU, because it's either that or Riddle gets help but ends up killing it in his bid for power. In general, things would either change or you would just end up with another dime a dozen cannon rehash.

The best way to write that kind of story, in my opinion at least, would be to focus on Riddle's years in school then - in the event that the world of the 1980's is free from the effects of a second war - add a sort of short cameo to the original main characters of the HP verse and possibly the fact Hogwarts would have twice the population, etc.

**** The "orphaned, lonely and off-tild child" was openly talking about making people hurt. Young Tom had killed a fellow orphan's pet rabbit, he'd tormented the other children in various ways, he had stolen their belongings for no other reason than because he COULD. Young Tom had also tried to work magic on Dumbledore, demanding "tell me the truth!" while staring him into the eyes -- possibly trying to work either some form of mind-reading or control.

The "lighting things on fire" was in response to a demand that Dumbledore show him magic, as well as a bit of a reprimand: You're behaving unacceptably, stop it.

Dumbledore also clearly IS trying to reach out a hand to the boy in the scene, but the moment Young Tom finds out that Dumbledore does not condemn him bullying, stealing or tormenting those weaker than him, he closes himself off. He refuses help in any way, he doesn't even want to be accompanied to Diagon Alley. It's only the things that Dumbledore insists on that he pretends to go along with, because he knows Dumbledore is more powerful than him.

If we're to believe Mrs. Cole (and she really had no reason to lie at that point) Young Tom already then was good at sucking up to authority figures and outwardly pretending to obey the rules as laid down. Granted, he wasn't as subtle as he himself thought he was, as Mrs Cole had caught on that he WAS tormenting the other children, but he was smart enough that he never did anything out in the open, and never in such a way that anyone could PROVE he did anything.

I know it's a popular thing among fans to blame Dumbledore for everything evil in the HP world, but in the case of Young Tom, he was not the innocent child frightened into evil by the big bad man setting his wardrobe on fire. He was already too far down the path of evil.

It was the result of growing up in an orphanage with powers he didn't understand, where the authority figures may not have been directly abusive, but were too overworked, stressed and borderline alcoholic to be able to give him the attention, affection and dicipline he needed to counteract his naturally sociopathic tendencies. It wouldn't have mattered one bit who was sent to fetch him -- unless the person who was sent to fetch him was secretly a time-traveller or something set on murdering Voldemort before he ever started Hogwarts.

That's not to say that things COULDN'T have turned out differently. But if you want a non-villainous Tom Riddle, then you're better off making it so that Merope didn't die, or maybe Tom Riddle Senior actually decided to take the boy in and raise him as his own -- or he was adopted by someone at an early age, someone who could raise him with the care and attention he needed.

***** Telling someone to stop misbehaving by, possibly, threatening to destroy everything they hold dear isn't going to endear them to you. It's going to, as you mentioned, give you a child that will wear a mask for the rest of their life.

I believe Dumbledore was a man that was too overworked to do anything to help the world, what with people like the Malfoy's pulling the strings. At the same time, I believe he was someone too afraid to act for fear of loosing whatever power he had. Dumbledore didn't have power at the time, he was rolling in the mess of his friendship with Grindelwald. He was a schoolteacher, it was his job to keep the best interests of his students in mind. At the same time, there was an entire school full of teachers that where incapable of seeing through whatever guise he had put up by then. Dumbledore may have been powerful, but he wasn't a god, he was a human with human weaknesses and human flaws.

I agree with you, in general, Riddle was lost at that point, but he wasn't so far gone as to be impossible for someone dedicated enough to find.

In the end, however, my interpretation of events is very colored by the fandom. In regards to Riddle, I do believe that /he/ was one of Dumbledores mistakes; the man had every opportunity to kill him when he wasn't much of a threat. I've read fics where Riddle is a saint manipulated by Manipulative!Evil!LemonDrop!Dumbledore and fics where he is a reprehensible evil even the mighty Albus desires to have snuffed out at birth.

****** "Threatening to destroy everything he holds dear" is a bit of a stretch. The wardrobe briefly turned aflame and then the fire went out, showing that the fire hadn't damaged anything at all. There's a pretty big jump from that to a threat.

And Young Tom doesn't even seem to consider this... His reaction, once the shock has settled is essentially "Cool! I want to set fire to things too!"

My interpretation of Dumbledore is actually the opposite of yours... i don't see him as a man afraid of losing power, but as a man afraid of gaining too much power. The entire Grindelwald story, and the consequent death of Ariana, made him deathly afraid of becoming too powerful. He'd learned that if he sought power, people he cared about died.

The result of my interpretation is actually the same, that he was sometimes too afraid to act even when he probably should have. I just disagree with the motive.

And Dumbledore made a lot of mistakes... but failing to kill an eleven-year-old child, even a clearly sociopathic one, because he MIGHT become the worst Dark Lord of his time? I don't count that as one of his mistakes. I really don't hold with the idea of killing people for crimes they haven't committed yet. For one thing, you'd never know when to stop.

******* An eleven year old child? Merlin, no, but a 17 year old who had already split his soul? Already killed and framed a relatively innocent man, one Dumbledore clearly believed was not responsible for Myrtle? Or a twenty something year old, returned from some time gathering support - much as Grindelwald had? Someone he wouldn't hire, someone he knew had done wrong? Do what is right, not what is easy - his own words.

Dumbledore... Is probably afraid of having too much power... He did deny a position as Minister of Magic... Still, in the years leading up to his death he was removed from many of his positions by a corrupt government, one he had been fighting for decades; I don't think he fought hard enough. Rowling gave him power he didn't use properly; at least not visually.

In regards to the fire, you said yourself that it had been his way of telling Riddle to behave. Perhaps I misunderstood, perhaps not. Regardless, Riddle didn't have a lot - if my information is correct most of his possessions where stolen, trophies - but his room was sparsely furnished; I doubt he had many places to put his things. If I walked up to you and explained that magic was real and instead of, for example, conjuring a chair or changing the color of something, I caught something on fire? I would have felt threatened, afraid perhaps, though still desire to learn how it was done.

******** Okay, this turned out to be a very long answer, so brace yourself here...

Suspicions aren't proof. You don't kill people because you THINK they have done something wrong. Dumbledore might not have trusted Riddle after the Myrtle incident, but he never actually got any proof. We already know Riddle was GOOD at hiding his crimes so that it couldn't be proved he did anything.

There's a big step from "I don't want this guy to teach children" to "DIE DIE DIE EVIL SCUM DIE!"

But then, I'm one of those soft-hearted wimps who actually thinks that killing should be a last resort and not something you should EVER do lightly, or on mere suspicion.

I think Dumbledore is a good example of how the old misconception that "the person who does not want power is the one most suited to wield it" is just that -- a misconception. Yeah, people who hunger too much for power probably shouldn't be trusted with any big amount of of it, but people who absolutely do not want power are often reluctant to wield it when it's necessary.

I think most of Dumbledore's positions of power were thrust upon him and that he didn't really want them -- and so he didn't really use them efficiently.

Of course, a lot of the problem is that since the books are told almost exclusively from Harry's POV, we don't really get to see a lot of what Dumbledore DOES, or what his positions of power actually entail. In the books, Dumbledore just appears every now and again to be charmingly eccentric, to deliver exposition, or on a very rare occasion actually show up in the nick of time to save someone's life. What he does with the rest of his time, we have no idea. Since we mainly get to see the workings of the Ministry or the Wizengamot in book five and onward, when Dumbledore either has been kicked out or his presence is reduced, we can't even say if there's any significant difference between the Ministry and Wizengamot whether he is there or not.

A lot of people point at how wizarding society is rotten to the core, and that this, plus the fact that Harry ends up having to fight for his life roughly once a book, as an example of how incompetent or possibly evil Dumbledore is since he let it get that far.

Personally, I think these people tend to put more power into Dumbledore's hands than he actually has... like you said, he isn't a god, but a man. A man who has a lot of magical power, who is good at talking, and who is extremely clever, but who might not necessarily be the best leader around, and who has been thrust into too many leadership positions by a society who tend to put too much store on magical prowess and power.

That is a thought that I see repeated time and again in the book, which isn't really challenged: If you're good at flinging around spells, you're obviously good at everything else, even if you in reality don't have a clue. If you don't have a lot of magical power, you're inferior at best and totally worthless at worst, no matter how many other amazing talents you might have.

The wizarding world respects power, but it doesn't seem to respect very many other things. Dumbledore is actually one of the few people in the books who has any kind of respect for people who aren't magically powerful or conventionally successful. Most other wizards tend to treat them with amused pity at best or outright contempt at worst.

But even Dumbledore can occasionally get enough and use displays of power to make himself heard, which brings us back to the Young Tom scene:

This isn't a case of Dumbledore telling Tom that magic is real and then unprovokedly demonstrating it by setting his wardrobe on fire... Really, through most of this scene, Dumbledore is INCREDIBLY patient and polite with young Tom, who is acting pretty terribly throughout. Not only has he been stealing things, he has talked in disturbing tones on how he can make people hurt if they annoyed him, he's lost his temper a number of times, twice he tried to place Dumbledore under some kind of spell where he commanded "TELL THE TRUTH!" and then he demanded to see some magic performed, once again in a commanding tone that hints that he's trying to force Dumbledore.

This isn't a kid who's going to listen to kind words and polite requests. This is a kid who is used to getting his own way because he can throw his weight around and often terrorises other children simply because he can.

Young Tom is trying to do the same to Dumbledore in this scene, and I think Dumbledore's fire is a warning: You're not the only one with power. He does afterwards spend some time telling Tom that theft is not tolerated at Hogwarts, and that the magical world has laws and rules that you break at your own peril.

A scare tactic, perhaps, but Tom had demonstrated expressively that he did not respond to anything else.

In any case... my main point with all this was to say that the flaming wardrobe was not a huge turning point in Tom Riddle's life. It WAS a huge turning point to find out he was a wizard, but I don't think Dumbledore's handling of him had much to say for anything. He would have gone down the same path whether that happened or not.

Which is why I think that it would not have made any difference whether or not it was Dumbledore who came to talk to him at the orphanage or not. :)

********* I am not someone who would easily kill another, it's just that Dumbledore had already suffered through a war. Dumbledore had already allowed someone with tremendous power slip away from him, someone who he knew held goals to see the world under the palm of his hand. Grindelwald was probably much like Riddle during his rise to power, polite and good at getting people to follow him. He may not have sought immortality, but he did play a part in the holocaust. That speaks enough of what kind of mad man he was.

I'm not trying to say that Dumbledore should have killed him in school, but I'm also trying to say that he had the clout at that point in time to do something about that particular mad man. Regardless, your most probably correct about his introduction to the Wizarding world; so I'll propose another question. Do you think things would have become worse if Dumbledore hadn't been the one to know what Riddle was before he came to Hogwarts? Would he have remained oblivious to what the boy was postering all through his youth or would he simply have let things lay, as he did in so many other situations, at the lack of evidence? Without Dumbledore being able to conclude who Riddle was in school, they would never have found the horcruxes and never have been able to truly kill him. Then again, he did string together quite the chain of accurate conclusions based off of little evidence regarding Riddles life.

********** Just because you've been in a war, doesn't mean you get more willing to kill. In fact, some people have the exact opposite reaction. And keep in mind that Dumbledore didn't kill Grindelwald either; he defeated him, yes, but Grindelwald was still alive at the time of Voldemort's second rise.

You might think Dumbledore should have killed Riddle at a young age, but obviously Dumbledore did not think so, At no point does he ever say "if I'd only killed him before he got too powerful!" And I don't condemn him for that. Killing a fellow human being is, and should be, a last resort. And what's more, killing a fellow human being in a time of peace, with no trial and no judge, and no evidence other than your own suspicions? That's really stretching it. That's elevating yourself above the law and above everything and everyone else; it's appointing yourself to judge, jury and executioner all at once. It means you decide that YOU have the power and the right to decide who should live and who should die, regardless of laws or rules.

And that is not a role Dumbledore -- whom, we know, did not trust himself with too much power -- would ever take. As for your other question:

That is hard to say. We don't know anything about any of the other teachers Young Tom might have had, other than Slughorn and Headmaster Dippet -- and he had both of them thoroughly fooled, so we know he was good at pretending.

Though I think Dumbledore might still have had some suspicions after that entire Chamber of Secrets ordeal. Perhaps not as strong as they would have been if he hadn't already heard Riddle's "I can make people hurt" speech or heard Mrs Cole's warnings, but I think he would have realised that SOMETHING wasn't as it appeared to be,

I don't think Dumbledore knew about the Horcruxes until much later in any case... I definitely don't think he knew for certain until Harry brought him that diary. That was when he knew that Riddle must have made at least one Horcrux. How he deduced that there had to be more than one, I don't know... but clearly he suspected, and started looking into what other kinds of objects Riddle might have made into Horcruxes. And then, four years later, when Harry brought him Slughorn's memory four years later, he not only had his suspicions confirmed, but also knew just how many Horcruxes Riddle had set out to make.

*** Voldemort has never read as a sociopath/psychopath to me; they don't have the sense of self-preservation that he does, nor his fear of death. More of a malignant narcissist with an attachment disorder.
