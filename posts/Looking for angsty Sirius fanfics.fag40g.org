** Oh, you want my favorite genre? /cracks knuckles/

Linkffn(the bureaucratic error by iniga) -- my absolutely favorite post-Azkaban Sirius. Ongoing but updates with impressive regularity.

Linkffn(The Lost Ones by little.acatalepsy)

Linkao3(one to speak another to hear by seventymilestobabylon)

Linkffn(dark birthright by malebron)

Linkffn(Bleak Midwinter by Jolie Black)

Anything by The Divine Comedian. I'm sure you've seen their work rec'd frequently on this sub and linkffn(Blackpool by The Divine Comedian) chief among them.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding Wars are over, but the work of recovery has only begun. Remus Lupin is trying to find his place in an ever-changing world, and when he is invited to serve on a truth and reconciliation commission, he has to confront the truth that lives there---in the past and within himself.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

Apologies for the borderline-necropost response. :D

This fic took me a while to find the name of. I don't have an 'angsty Sirius' file, so I've been poking around my other bookmark lists to see what fits and somehow I forgot a name like that. :D

The community has a few fics that I enjoyed in, too. Some of them I enjoyed, some I didn't, but I don't know your taste and I figured I'd just rec the lot rather than just the ones I liked.

#+begin_quote
  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight.

  “Don't talk about her,” he snarls, and Sirius knows what will happen from here. He likes to bait Remus, snark that it isn't the wolf but him that comes crawling to Sirius every moon, but he knows it's only partly true. There's an animal there, just under the surface, an animal with a man's desires. He can hear it in the way Remus can't catch his breath, feel it in the way he leans down to run his open mouth over Sirius's neck, inhaling his scent.
