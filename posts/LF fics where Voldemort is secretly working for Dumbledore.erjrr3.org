Looking for any fics where Voldemort is actually Dumbledore's pawn. Doesn't really matter the reason why, although quality reasons are always a plus. Any ship, any length, preferably complete, but even if it isn't, send it over :)

Thanks in advance!

(Inspired by [[/u/Pedroidon17][u/Pedroidon17]]'s prompt where Dumbledore is Palpatine and [[/u/flingerdinger][u/flingerdinger]]'s comment that Voldemort would be Count Dooku.)

#+begin_quote
  Many have criticized Albus Dumbledore for not taking adequate steps to undermine Tom Riddle's plays for power, rein in Severus Snape's behavior toward Gryffindors, and see to Harry Potter's welfare... but what if that was the point? 'It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor...' (Manipulative!Dumbledore. Oneshot. Crackfic.)

*** I can feel your enthusiasm from here, lol. How cringey is it? The fact that it features, erm...*checks the summary*...a "Harry with a backbone" seems to imply a very specific type of OP!Indy!Harry, but I'm hoping I'm wrong on this.

** There is a WIP on Webnovel called Dark Lord Dumbledore that is a SI in Harry's body by a god with the mission to tear down and expose Dumbledore as a mastermind dark lord behind every evil thing in society. It's a power fantasy but explores some pretty interesting things and is updated frequently. I quite enjoy how brutal and efficient the MC is.
