**** As far as I have ever been able to tell, he has no ability to write characters, dialogue, plot or even good smut. Every single story is just basically a piece of wood that has the name of the MC on it, who for some reason is really interesting to every other female piece of wood in the universe, then he spends 2000 words or so smacking them together pretending it is somehow arousing. How he has not gotten unbelievably bored with his own writing is beyond me, he has written so much and there is just nothing that could possibly catch people eyes outside of the very rare pairing.

  Lily uses a dark ritual to protect her son which has long term ramifications for him. Not that he's complaining about the perks of the matter. Harry/Multi, obviously. Very dark and may offend delicate sensibilities. More information inside. Reposted after accidental deletion. Don't ask even though someone end up will doing so.
