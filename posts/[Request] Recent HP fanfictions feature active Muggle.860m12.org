Is there any Harry Potter fanfiction that satisfies the following features?

- Recent (<3 years old if completed, <6 months if in-progress)

- At least 10k words

- Featuring active involvement of Muggles, either the government, the army or just the families of the Muggleborn

- A war between Muggle and Wizard

- The protagonist(s) uses technology and/or science (or /at least/ logical reasoning) to deal with the problems

Thanks for your help.

Its a very AU fic(also AU on the muggle-side)about Harry joining the military and revealing his powers to his superior.He has long term plans of becoming the emperor of europe. They use him as weapon during a war, and at one point the statute of secrecy breaks. It features lots of conflict between different countries who treat their magicals differently and partly use magic in their military. also they develop a lot of technology combined with magic.

It doesn't really have a war between magicals and muggles because most sides have both. But it does feature some things like the military using magic and muggles against death eater controlled territory.

#+begin_quote
  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.
