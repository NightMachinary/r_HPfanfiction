Honestly looking for anything that has Harry dealing with the Blacks. (Not just Sirius) Time-Travel/ Marriage Contract/ Dimension Travel/ Adoption/ etc.

Except, please no slash, not really my cup of tea =P

  Adoption
#+end_quote

Since everyone else her is providing stories where Harry bangs the Blacks, here's one where he gets adopted after the third year. Mostly family and friendship focused with a romantic subplot thrown in between in the last few chapters.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius has ever made.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** Linkffn(The Green in the Grey) It's a WBWL story and it only has 3 chapters so far. Hasn't been updated since April of this year. Includes manipulative!Dumbledore. However it was an interesting read and I'm hoping the author returns to it. Harry gets adopted by Sirius and is raised by Sirius, Arcturus, and Cassiopeia Black.

Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) This one hasn't been updated since 2017 but it's long running and the author states they're still working on it in their bio. Spoilers: Lily was hit with a curse that would basically destroy Harry after he was born, to save him James, Lily, and Sirius used a potion that basically turned him into both James and Lily's son and Sirius and Lily's daughter. Harry discovers this and eventually is able to switch between himself and Sirius's daughter. They're both the same person but almost different characters As the story progresses Harry builds a family with the Blacks, including Sirius, the Tonkses, and Narcissa.
