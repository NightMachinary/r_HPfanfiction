What are the names of all the students in Harry's year that I've forgotten?

Gryffindor Boys: Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan & Dean Thomas.

Gryffindor Girls: Hermione Granger, Lavender Brown, Pavarti Patil, (Added - Fay Dunbar (?))

Slytherin Boys: Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle, Vincent Crabb & Theodore Nott.

Slytherin Girls: Pansy Parkinson, Tracy Davis, Daphne Greengrass, Millicent Bullstrode,

Ravenclaw Boys: Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, (Added - Michael Corner)

Ravenclaw Girls: Padma Patil, Sue Li,

Hufflepuff Boys: Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Zacharias Smith,

Hufflepuff Girls: Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, (Added - Sally Anne Parks, Megan Jones)


** Depends how you define canon. I think you got everyone who was mentioned in the books. Rowling had an original list of 40 students in Harry's year in her drafts. This list was shown in a BBC documentary called /Harry Potter and Me/.

In the series we are introduced to:

- 8 Gryffindors: Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Lavender Brown, and Parvati Patil.
- 5 Hufflepuffs: Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, Zacharias Smith, and Susan Bones
- 6 Ravenclaws: Terry Boot, Mandy Brocklehurst, Michael Corner, Anthony Goldstein, Padma Patil, and Lisa Turpin
- 8 Slytherins Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode and Daphne Greengrass

The addition of the class list gives us 4 more Hufflepuffs (Wayne Hopkins, Megan Jones, Roger Malone and Kevin Entwhistle), 4 Ravenclaws (Isobel MacDougal, Stephen Cornfoot, Oliver Rivers, and Sue Li), and 1 Slytherin (Tracey Davis). The rest of the students that make up the original 40 are assumed to be 2 female Gryffindors, 2 female Hufflepuffs, and 1 female Slytherin. These students are Lily Moon, Sophie Roper, Sally-Anne Perks, A. Runcorn, and Sally Smith.

It's commonly thought some of those names, like Lily Moon, were moved around so Lily Moon became Luna Lovegood/Lily Evans Potter and Sally Smith became Zacharias Smith.

*** Zacharias Smith wasn't in Harrys year. He was (at least) one year below. Harry, Ron and Hermione met him only at the first DA meeting - if he was in their year they would have known him because they would have spent 5 years of herbology with him.

**** His age is unconfirmed and his birthday is assumed to be between 1979-1981. Ron is described as not knowing who he is, but I don't recall Hermione not knowing him. I added him to the list because Rowling suggests he is older than Ginny at the Battle of Hogwarts where she is underage and he is portrayed as a coward shoving first years out of the way instead of staying to fight, although Ginny has a late birthday.

I copied this from the wiki: It is never stated in the book what year Smith is in. Since he was on Quidditch team in the 1995--1996 school year, he was at least 12 years old on 1 September 1995; and since he was still attending Hogwarts for the 1997--1998 school year, he was at most "1 day to 18 years old" on 1 September 1997. There are speculations that Smith was at least 17 years old on 2 May 1998, since he was fleeing from the Battle of Hogwarts, and under-age wizards and witches were instructed to leave. This would put his date of birth before 2 May 1981. However, it was also argued that his fleeing could simply be an indication of his fear at the time, or simply that he was in the queue in the first place because he was underage.

***** Neither Ron nor Harry knew who he was. Harry remembered him as "a member of the Quidditch team" not as one of his classmates. It is simply impossible for them to not recognise him if they spent 5 years in a class together. And for him being seventeen: Ginny was born in summer, like Harry. That's the reason she is underage during the battle. Every sixth year born before may would be of age.

This logic goes out the window when you consider the way Rowling wrote and introduced new characters. How do they not know Cormac until their 6th year/his 7th when he lives in Gryffindor Tower with them? How come Sally-Anne Perks shows up in the sorting, but disappears when Harry takes his O.W.L.s without a mention?

If Sally Smith became Zacharias Smith from the original 40 list, then he's in their year if you count the list over the named students in the books. Rowling may have decided to make Zacharias into a younger student, but it's never mentioned one way or the other.

But they did know that he was a Gryffindor and one year above them. They just didn't know his name. Zacharias on the other hand Harry only recalled vaguely to have seen at Quidditch-Matches. That's a big difference.

******** I can't see not knowing his name until 6th year. Do you really believe that no one ever once in the 5 earlier years called out "Hey Cormac" in the great hall or common room? And that no one ever talked about him with friends concerning dating, class, etc or that he never tried out for quidditch before then?

So considering all the possibilities for being either calling out to him or talking about him they had to have heard his name and seen him. Especially if someone called for him. I mean basic Human nature is to look up and see who is talking to who and after two or three times he should at least know the name. I agree he wouldn't actually know him since they never interacted but they should have known of him.

********* I think it is very realistic. Most teens don't give a f* about students older or younger than them. Only those who share classes with them or do sports with them are relevant because they actually have contact with them. Exceptions are obviously older or younger siblings of their friends - but other than that? Nope. No reason to know their names. I am pretty sure if I ask any of my students if they can name an older student who doesn't do sport with them or is the sibling or a friend of a sibling they couldn't name one.

********** Are they living in the school with them 24/7 for over 9 months each year? In a tower where they may be only 70-80 kids total? That's a very different situation than spending only 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. In the latter I would agree with you that they wouldn't know or care. In the former it would be almost impossible to never interact in any way with kids living with you.

** I think megan Jones was a hufflepuff in his year and Fay Dunbar another gryffindor in his year but I'm not 100% sure. There's also Sally anne parks who vanished sometime between 1st and 5th year.

****** In fanfic? You can do whatever you want. Some readers might not like seeing extra Gryffindor girls in addition to Parvati, Lavender, and Hermione, but it's your story.

But since she's a videogame only character, lots of readers might mistake her for an OC.
