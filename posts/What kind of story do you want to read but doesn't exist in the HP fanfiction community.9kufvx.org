For me, I want to read a Slytherin Harry that isn't a mini-politician, surrounded by mini-politicans, that isn't loved by Snape or hated by any non-Slytherin, and whose personality isn't altered (considering canon Harry already had enough traits that the hat wanted him in Slytherin).

How about you?


** How about a story where Harry actually gets seduced and does NOT take charge half-way through? He can be seeing tits for the first time, at some point he will be ve in control. Give me an actual, unbalanced relationship where he is slowly learning the ropes while the woman permanently ruins others for him.

I feel like there's some great drama in the concept and it feels so weird to me that nobody ever tried to write it, considering the level of absurdity pairings in this fandom can reach.

Perhaps the general unimpressive levels of magical ability is why the purebloods are manic. Having the Weasley kids do chores by hand and wear hand me downs instead of transfiguring stylish clothes? Maybe that's a limit of power/ability too.

In the real world, hardly anybody becomes skilled in Krav Maga or combat pistol shooting because the chances of ever needing those skills are so low that it's not worth the effort.

But then, the Wizarding world has gone through the first war. You would've though that would have made more people learn self-defence. So you may have a point.

It's interesting you mention Krav Maga, because that material art. IS intended for a populace to protect themselves. Israel is under the constant threat of terrorism and war, and every 18 year old has compulsory military service and combat training. It would be interesting to take the obvious analogy with WWII and magical Britain further in fanfiction.

I mean, there's a charm for after curfew movement over hogsmead, so why not for whena team of death eaters lands in your back garden?

And theoretically, despite the horrible hiring practices, kids take 7 years of self defense in DADA.

***** I would read a story where after Voldemort's mysterious death instead of celebrating people were paranoid. The Longbottoms stayed hidden, people still coward inside, and after a very long time they started to realize they were okay... for now. But after two Dark Lord in such a short time they don't trust it. Instead of Fudge with his "ignore it" mindset they elect a minister who wants everyone to be prepared for whatever comes next.

​

By the time Harry gets to school things are on there way to being very different in wizarding Britain. Some changes are already in place but the minister and their supporters a pushing for more. Then there is Dumbledore pushing a more 'moderate' view. And then there is the dark wanting to burn it all down.

​

Oo! Maybe the ministers people learn about Quirrell being possessed and use that as ammunition against Dumbledore. Maybe they realize that if they are the ones to help Harry take out Voldemort for good it will help ensure they can "get done what needs to be done for the greater good." It would be cool if the three parties on the spectrum (two extremes and the moderate) all were working for their idea of the greater good and all thought they were in the right with Harry lost in this new world trying to figure out what's actually right. And this is why I should avoid dangerous threads like this. At the slightest provocation my plot bunnies breed and now this story is taking off in my head and I have no time to write it!

Basically, a thirty-six year-old Harry accidentally yeeted himself into his eleven-year-old self via Sorting Hat. The 'Harry-attuned magical shockwave' that resulted screwed up the Horcruxes and activated them.\\
The scar just exploded, Quirrelmort became Turbanmort and Quirrel, the Diadem became a furniture golem, the Diary became paper mache Riddle, the Locket turned Grimmauld Place into Monster House, and the Cup took over a dragon.

The Sorting Hat decided to make him the Headmaster for shits and giggles. He ended up conscripting Tonks in exchange for exempting her D.A.D.A. exam and a Letter of Recommendation.

I don't know if it will be your thing so I'll explain. It's a Harry Potter/Avengers crossover with a female!Harry is Loki's child premise. The Fates are meddling and arrange for Lily and Loki to meet and have a child who is born the Godess of Fate. She doesn't know this though. Harry grows up ignorant of who her actual father is and the powers she'll grow into. Part one of the story is looking to be about 15 chapters and focuses on what happens when Voldemort uses her blood in the ritual to restore himself (GoF). Using her blood will turn him from an enemy to an ally. Once part one is done we will time skip to 2012 for the events of Avengers and the introduction of Loki.

For example, Harry Potter reborn as Jon Snow, or vice versa. The Jon Snow reborn as Harry Potter angle is almost more appealing to me because Jon would have to reflect on all of he horrorible things that happened in his previous life in the ASoIaF universe, while dealing with Harry's problems in his own unique way. This would be especially interesting to me if it was presented in such a way that Jon failed to stop the White Walkers, and views it as his responsibility to save as many people as he can in this life. Bonus points if some of the surrounding cast remind him of people from his previous life. Robb Stark and some of Jon's other siblings/cousins had Auburn/Red Hair sound like a certain beloved wizarding family we know of? Or to drive the point further, Daenerys is described as being the most beautiful woman in the world, there's a certain champion from Beauxbatons described in a similar fashion. The reverse comparisons could also be used if one were to write Harry in Jon's “shoes.”

*** I actually have a story that is somewhere between an outline and an actually story that I wrote last year. It is several hundred pages long and covers years 1-7. In the story Carl Grimes from the Walking Dead is reborn as Harry Potter. After I finished the story I always intended to clean it up and post but I can't work on more than one story at a time and got caught up in new ones so it fell to the side and sits as a doc in my computer now.

​

In the fic Carl spends the first few years not certain if he's dreaming this or not. He's super paranoid that one day walkers or something else will show up and he's going to be in a young vulnerable malnourished boy with no supplies and no support. Than he finds out he's a wizard and that zombies are a thing as are infiri and all kinds of other horrible dangerous things but the only way to protect himself is to hand himself over to the magical world and learn. So we have a prepper Harry Potter (Carl Grimes) gone off to Hogwarts looking to learn as much as he can. When I first came up with the idea it was because I was imagining what 11 year old Carl would have done if faced with Quirrell and I needed that story. Later there was a scene I wrote for third year with Carl facing his greatest fear and it kind of broke my heart. The trauma from his first life and then death was definitely still there. At the time Carl was still alive in canon so I had to imagine my own end for it.

​

My three favorite crossovers are Harry Potter/Avengers, Harry Potter/Walking Dead, and Harry Potter/ASOIAF so seeing you suggest the last made me happy but extra happy for another reason. I've had several ideas with Harry reincarnated to that world but the story I just mentioned above? My plan for that was to make it a series with Carl being reincarnated after every life and eventually reaching godmode with all he learned. His third life was going to be as the first born son of Robert Baratheon.

​

Silent brooding little John as Harry I would definitely be down for though. Him finding out magic was real would probably be a great sigh and a “why me?” Maybe he's been planning for years that he'd become a soldier because what else could he do with so few resources being treated worse then he was as a bastard. When he learns there is no army in the wizarding world it forces him for the first time to think about what he actually wants and to go for it?

** I know, I'm late to this thread but a fan-fiction similar to the The Martian.

A inept wizard, preferably a muggle born, goes out muggle because he couldn't understand and handle magic and the society's bigotry. Now, fully focusing on his muggle studies and becomes a astronaut who now gets castaway in Mars.

The guy tries his fully muggle science methods which don't work nearly good in this situation. So, now, he has to rediscover his magical talent and make peace with the part that still yearns magic. Thus he now starts to combine muggle sciences and magic to become the universe's first techno-mage and successfully return home.

​

Maybe this incident becomes the muggles first exposure to magic and they start to accept it seeing how it saved a man's life.

I know, it's kinda crazy and too hard sci-fi but, I'm a sucker for these kinds of stories.

In the Fantastic Beasts movie, we see the sisters cook a fancy dinner in literal seconds - the meal is both assembling and cooking while flying from the pantry to the table. If I could cook like that, would I be resorting to hot dogs every time I'm too impatient to cook for myself? Hell no.

Sure, you'd lose a lot of the specialty magic - how often do you need a spare coat button when all you have is a random beetle? - but basic, household things? Easy enough.

Given how conserving calories is a literal life-and-death situation when stranded on Mars, waving a wand to do the heavy lifting of farm work, repairing broken equipment, summoning/conjuring fresh water, and cleaning martian dust could all be what keeps you alive.

I actually am intrigued enough about the origins of magic that I have a very minor (compared to the size of the fic, anyway, it's actually pretty important to the character) part of my fic where my MC researched the origins of spells and finds them rooted in ancient rituals. For example, it turns out a silencing spell's wand motion copies the same movement pattern as a ritualistic dance that involved putting banshee blood on the mouth of the person you wanted to silence and following a specific dance pattern, and that pattern in turn was based on the shape of an ancient rune.

The initial part of this fic would be the three of them, in the fallout from the dementor attack and Remus and Sirius now becoming soulless husks, resolve to collectively improve and do everything in their power to save Remus and Sirius before their bodies give out.

The part I like about this is that the dementors attacking a bunch of kids ends up getting out and convincing the other schools to withdraw from coming for the TWT, leading to a whole new 4th year plot. None of that graveyard repetition.

And as for the remaining Slytherins (except notable people like Riddle, Slughorn, Snape etc), they are generally not shown to be cunning in any way, nor are they more ambitious than most other students. The one defining characteristic of slytherins that is repeatedly shown is their desire to inflict suffering on others and their glee when doing so. Which is a very poor replacement for ambition and cunning.

Even the adult Death Eaters don't really have any ambition to "purify" the wizarding world. They enjoy torturing and killing, and of course they strongly advocate blood purity, but without a strong leader they wouldn't get shit done.

** I would love to read an Harry/Lily story which is not just milking the kinky-ness of the situation. Like, Harry is thrown back in time and, through a series of cosmic coincidences, ends up realising that this younger version of the woman who eventually became his mother (who has no attachment to any Potter at this point) is the one for him.

Or how about a story where an older female student, or even a younger teacher, eventually ends up adopting Harry. They run into each other at Kings Cross/the Express/the first week at Hogwarts and the girl answers a few questions Harry has about Hogwarts, and they end up talking for hours. Over the next few months, the girl becomes some sort of mentor for Harry, and eventually into either a big sister or a mother figure for him. There are a few stories where Tonks initially fills that role, but they all end up in a romance. It's frustrating to the point where I started writing a story to fill that niche.

Or maybe a real triad story where all characters love each other and not just two girls who are arm candy for Harry. The eventual sequel of "Grains of Sand in an Hourglass" might go there, but I am waiting more than a year for it now.

The Man Who Folded Himself is a 1973 science fiction novel by American writer David Gerrold, dealing with time travel. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1974 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1974. The book explores the psychological, physical, and personal challenges that manifest when time travel is possible for a single individual at the touch of a button. References to both the American Airlines Flight 191 crash and the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers, events which did not occur until 6 years and 28 years respectively after initial publication, were added in the 2003 edition.

" '---All You Zombies---' " is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was written in one day, July 11, 1958, and first published in the March 1959 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine after being rejected by Playboy.

The story involves a number of paradoxes caused by time travel. In 1980, it was nominated for the Balrog Award for short fiction."'---All You Zombies---'" further develops themes explored by the author in a previous work: "By His Bootstraps", published some 18 years earlier.

The happily ever after part makes it harder, but not impossible.

Closed Time Loop = things changed in the past cause the time travel to happen so nothing is really changed. Not groundhog day.

  There was no troll in the girls bathroom in 1991. Hermione found no friends that night. Therefore the brightest witch of her age is on a perilous path. Because with magic it is so very true that knowledge is power. But is it also true that power corrupts? Will the only daughter of two dentists become the third Dark Lord that rises in Dumbledore's lifetime?

** I want to read a really good Lunar Harmony fic, where they are in a fully developed polyamorous relationship and there's a well written original (as in, "not a canon rehash") plot. Preferably they are young adults or time travelers, because I don't care too much about children or teenage bullshit. I also want them to act independently, having strong friendships that they built on their own terms and no constant side plots about what the Weasleys are doing as if the world revolves around them or how Dumbledore trims his beard. One of the bigger flaws of the HP novels in my opinion is how the agency of the protagonist is severely limited.

Comedy or adventure theme would be best, no fucking horror or melodramatic angst, where Harry is some kind of broken man that needs to be healed by the soft female touch of his lovers.

** Stories I would like to read (but have no interest in writing):

- Epic HP/Animorphs Crossover. They have similar enough settings/themes/era's (Children in the 90's saving the world), yet are functionally different enough to provide a lot of interesting concepts. Besides the Science vs. Magic part (which is always fun), The HP Universe doesn't seem all that open to things beyond their understanding, and is conflicted enough that you wouldn't expect them to pull together for an external threat like an alien invasion. The concept of a secret wizarding worlds with powers big enough to give humanity a fighting chance against the Yerks would be super-tempting, but the Animorphs would want to avoid the Yerks finding out about the magical world at all cost & the fear that part of the wizarding world is evil enough to actively help them would slow things down. I thought out a pretty neat way to do intro/worldbuilding, but nothing for the second/third parts of a storyarc.

- A decent "Deconstruct the Wizarding World with Science/Engineering". There have been a few good fics that brush on this (I really like how Escape handled Hermione's parents), but I haven't seen a good one where this is the principal tenant. Like straight up: "Is energy being created? Can we harvest this for free energy? Factory-created magical items? How about we get some councilors and professional administrators for Hogwarts. Does magic leave residue? Does the heat created by magic eventually dissipate or does it stay forever, increasing the entropy of the universe. Use it to avoid Heat Death? What are the limits of spells? Is it based on willpower, desire, or other measurable features? How much exhaustion is caused by spells. Do lighter weight spells take less out of the wizard? How does the environment interact with this. What natural features are less permeable to magic. Can you use them to create KEW's? HP's math is based on pretty basic calculations, what happens if you create spells with advanced calculus. Is magic limited? can the quantity of magic in the world be quantified?

Stories I want to read and I've considered penning:

- Harry bugs out in the first few years (possibly during the mess between Year 1 and 2), Fresh Academy Graduate/Auror Trainee Tonks metamorphs to take his place while he is searched for. Supposed to be quick but a chain of events has Dumbledore manipulate her to stay disguised, so she gets to go through the events of years 3/4 (not to mention puberty again). And then taking it to Hermione/Tonks. Besides being able to do the fun 'adult view on the stupidity of the early years', can also address some of the items of 'adult in kids body' and 'female going through male puberty' and 'A wizarding world with aging/deaging potions and transformation spells would have different taboo's than the muggle world'

I don't think I've seen any of these done at all (much less done well)

** I'd like to read a story where Ginny is born a year earlier (this'd also probably be a story where Ron doesn't exist). I think it would be an interesting quartet of Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville, with maybe the possibility of H/Hr/G in the future.

Sadly, I don't think this idea will ever take off because people usually either really like Ron or really hate him, and in both circumstances they want to either love him or bash him as much as possible.

*** It would be interesting to explore the dynamic if you made Ginny and Ron a second set of twins in the family. Molly gives birth to Ron first so he's still the big brother and is disappointed thinking she's about to get two boys and no little girl. Only then Ginny is born. On one hand because they are twins Ginny and Ron are close and it makes Ron less insecure to have her. On the other she's the families baby girl and gets special treatment because of it which hurts/frustrates him. The twins kind of get it with people seemingly not carrying if they can tell them apart or not so instead of teasing Ron so much they help build him up with Ginny helping. It would maybe fix some of the things people dislike about Ron to win them over and give a lot of interesting dynamics to explore once school started. Ron would become best friends with Harry Potter and be thrilled but Ginny friended her roommate Hermione who Ron doesn't care for and with Hermione comes Neville. Suddenly Ron doesn't just have to learn to share his twin with everyone but his new best friend too. It would also make things a lot more interesting when the time for dating comes. Maybe Ron just assumes Ginny will be his date when Hermione turns him down and then he finds out Ginny is going with Dean and is furious. Neville could be going with Ron's neighbor Luna and Ron doesn't know whether to panic about a date or Ginny.
