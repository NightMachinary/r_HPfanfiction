Please no Harry/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Tonks, or Harry/Fleur No Fem Harry I'm good with any slash( Tomarry or Drarry preferably) Any word count Dark Harry is fine Bashing is good too And any crossovers


** Not 100% sure what you do like but I'm gonna assume you want Harry-centric fics? Also going to assume you're okay with darker fics since you're okay with dark Harry? Hope you like these, if not let me know what you like to read and I'll try to find some. I feel like I've read loads of Drarry but can't find it saved anywhere, -_\, so there isn't much of that.

This doesn't have any Harry planning really, he travels to another dimension where the war is much worse.

Very fun, not a darkfic. Adult Harry ends up back in time and there is a minor Harry/Bellatrix pairing but we don't see much of it.

Harry and Daphne, 99% post war, have a kid after what is essentially a blind-one-night-stand. Cute story.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15356202][Say My Name]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Thunderbird587/pseuds/Thunderbird587][Thunderbird587]] linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15356202?view_full_work=true]])\\
This is a Drarry fic. It's AU, obviously, where Harry goes back to Hogwarts after the war and ends up with Draco. It does start Ginny/Harry but at no point is the fic rooting for them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/waspabi/pseuds/waspabi][waspabi]] linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278?view_full_work=true]])\\
Another Drarry, this one has more non-Drarry plot than Say My Name. Completely AU, Harry never goes to Hogwarts and the Hogwarts gang (Hermione, Ron, Draco, Ginny, Luna, Neville) finds him with the hope he can end the war. Very cool fic, I loved it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Endrina/pseuds/Endrina][Endrina]]\\
This is actually a series on AO3 that starts with Snape 'kidnapping' Harry and raising him in secret with Remus. Harry is such a cute kid/teen. Ends with Drarry but you don't see that until they get older. It's a unique take on Harry's magic.

â€‹

Let me know what you think, enjoy!

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? COMPLETE.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  Harry needs some time to let his guard down in the war. So he goes to a celebration just before he, Ron and Hermione plan to get Hufflepuff's Cup from Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Who could have guessed what the consequences would be?

Well, you just took out 90% of the fun and paired a teenager with the crazy terrorist who murdered his parents and is old enough to be his grandfather so here are two short (and one longer) gen crossovers.
