I remember Harry was legitimately evil, he tortured Hermione to the point that she used the killing curse on herself to end the pain, and it explained that Ron is so stupid cuz he died years ago and Ginny has been controlling his body using necromancy, and the worst thing of all: Harry forced Peter Pettigrew to kill his own mother. Does anyone else remember this fic?!

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.
