** linkao3(14464764)

This one isn't complete and I doubt it will be completed, but you never know, and it is still probably worth reading.

linkao3( 13557357)

Same here, the fifth book hasn't been completed for 2 years, but the first 4 are finished and I am reading it now and enjoying it.

  So this is based on a tumblr prompt by Mauraders4evr (https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard/blog/marauders4evr)"Harry Potter AU where Harry is hiding in the cabinet in Borgin and Burkes. And he sees Lucius grab Draco with his cane. And he hears the hiss, “What did I tell you?” And he hears the quiver in the blonde boy's voice, “Don't touch anything.”And Harry knows.Because he's used the voice that Draco uses for the past twelve years.He knows.Because now that he's lived with the Weasleys for over a month, he knows that that's not the way that a father's voice should be.He knows..."And it wouldn't leave me alone so...

** The Promise series, starting here: linkao3(3580050)

Minerva takes Harry in after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban.\\
