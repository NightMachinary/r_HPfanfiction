A lot of OP Harry's have him being Dark or (at the very least) "Grey" but I've not seen any where the prospect of Light and Dark comes up and he's on the Light side.

I'm writing one at the minute where Harry's combat skills are firmly rooted in Transfiguration, many people misinterpreting it as Dark magic only to discover he is firmly Light sided.

Are there any fics where Harry is OP but is adamant about being in the Light?


** Yeah, there is one I can think of off the top of my head but it's so far to the light that he's a Christian and like, prays and that's where the power comes from. It's a weird because of the religion but still has some interesting concepts. I'll see if I can find it for you

  A slip of the tongue reveals to Harry an alternative path, one much more demanding than he experienced before, where the rewards he asks for are denied him...

** If you've never read “The Soulmate Bond” by Keira Marcos I can't recommend it enough. He practices the healing portion of parselmagic and has an oath to never turn dark even though he's accused of it.

** No accounting for quality in this one, but Harry is as light as possible and op as fuck in the Refiner's Fire duology.

*** Couldn't get through the first book. Too feel-good happy for me for no reason. Plus Harry getting a summer job and everything was pretty weird, it was like 50's America and not 90's Britain.

**** To be fair, summer jobs are super common in America in modern times, and I was led to believe that they weren't exactly rare in Britain. But I've never been there so could be totally wrong.

***** It's just that it was manual labour and his Boss hired him with a vote of confidence, everything was sunshine and rainbows, and then he starts dating his Boss' daughter with his blessings, etc. Couple of "whoops, I let my bikini slip!" moments there, too. Not hating on the setting, just saying that it clashes horribly with Harry Potter.

For lack of a better word, it was very "Boomer". I think the author had been wrtiing fanfiction since the 80s (and the duology was written before the seventh book) so that has a part in it.

One OP Light Harry story that I like doesn't focus much on the OP part, but is well-written and tries to play with characters in a light similar to canon, is "Red is the Heart". It was a pretty great story.
