That character whose canon characterization just does not (in your opinion) justify the size of their fans and level of positive portrayal in Fanon?

Personally, I would pick Draco - bullying, spoiled brat who was literally the Dudley of the magical world. Not being willing to kill your headmaster does not make you a good person. But there are so many stories where Draco is a hero or gets shipped with Harry or Hermione and all of it is so contrived and OOC I end up feeling like he's a self-insert.


** Amelia Bones. She does absolutely nothing of worth in canon and yet she's basically Judge Dredd in fanfiction, running over (both magically and politically) everybody short of Voldermort (and at times even him). People say she's fair, but in practice she allows Harry's railroad attempt of a trial to happen in complete disregard of its irregularity.

​

That said, I don't really have a problem with this interpretation of her. She's the best placed character to set up as "the cavalry" in fics where the system actually works. This is something that happens to many characters (like Draco Malfoy being recast as a byronic hero, being more or less the best suited canon character for the role) and it's something that allows for a much greater variety of fics than strict adherence to canon, so I'm in favour of it.

*** The key point is "fics where the system actually works." Turning the political shenanigans of the Malfoys back against them can be a great deal of fun, if done properly.

In many ways, she's as much a blank slate as Daphne Greengrass, which gives writers room to use her character as needed. And sometimes that goes in unexpected directions, as with the one where she as Minister tries to have Harry and Ginny executed to keep everything quiet and calm. Hail Odysseus, i believe?

**** Hogwarts Sirius would work perfectly well, maybe even AU Sirius that never went to Azkaban, but not canon adult Sirius. Snape I'd say no way. Anti-hero, sure. Byronic hero? It would invalidate his whole background. Plus you can't have adult Snape or Sirius deal with the teenage characters as an equal, so they're automatically disqualified when writing a school years fic.

#+begin_quote
  are we using different definitions of a byronic hero?
#+end_quote

Probably. I'm going by the traditional one of charismatic and strongly impassioned but flawed man staying strong to his convinctions in the face of social pressure. Very frequently upper class and socially dominant. Tragic backstory recommended but not mandatory. Out of these, Snape is only flawed. Oh and he's a melodramatic immature brat, which most byronic heroes also are. You make Snape charismatic and socially dominant and suddendly his whole childhood and adolescence make no sense. He's not Lily's creepy friend anymore. He's not slytherin house's asswipe baited into becoming a death eater to achieve a degree of social acceptance (also a point against him being self-principled, since in canon he's anything but). Even if you make him develop some charisma as an adult, you still have to motivate it.

Sirius's Hogwarts years basically read as a byronic hero's character development arc, starting in conflict between his ideas and his family's, ending with resolution in finding a new environment where he can be true to himself, but as an adult, what internal conflict does he have? A tragic backstory is not enough to make a byronic hero.

Draco is basically in the same position as Sirius, only his character is developed out as an antagonist in canon instead. But the potential is still there, you only have to actually develop him rather than using as comic relief until you need someone to redeem.

******* draco has very little of the qualities you describe- he isn't charismatic, nor passionate, nor does he have strong convictions or will. he's a moral coward, and /bends/ in the face of social pressure. he's only socially dominant among the children of his father's cronies, and at least one of them turn on him. to the rest of the school- not so much

this...isn't what happened. he did become a DE out of personal ambition, which is a point /for/ his will, but the DEs are a fringe group of cultists, reviled in the wizarding world. he wasn't 'baited'. he didn't violate any principles he had. being a dark wizard, and a DE, came naturally to him. and well, we disagree, because i don't think it's difficult at all to portray snape as charismatic/compelling as a teenager or adult, even if unpopular because of his cruelty

the byronic characters i think of, and who are often compared to snape, are erik/the phantom and heathcliff- brooding, intense, vengeful, cruel, homicidal

Draco first appears as an 11yo kid whose characterization is being an upper class kid whose only idea of how the world works is his terrorist dad's indocrination. You can make whatever character changes you want to him without it compromising his background in the slightest. You can throw whatever event you want at him and he'll believably change because he's a little kid growing up. Snape on the other hand is an adult, whose characterization is basically his past and his behaviour. You change those and all that's left is his name.

#+begin_quote
  the DEs are a fringe group of cultists, reviled in the wizarding world
#+end_quote

A 'fringe group of cultists' including a large amount of the wizarding world's ruling class and pretty much every slytherin in Snape's age group.

Also Snape flip-flopped from one side to the other multiple times through his life. Genuinely switched sides betraying friends and allies because of non-principles based reasons like personal gain/ambition and revenge. He doesn't have convinctions.

********* draco is a kid, sure. my point was that the archetype of a byronic hero is very far from his canon characterisation as is. the characteristics snape has- willful, vengeful, passionate, brooding, intense, cruel, near sociopathic, genius, arrogance, etc. are much more in the vicinity

#+begin_quote
  A 'fringe group of cultists' including a large amount of the wizarding world's ruling class and pretty much every slytherin in Snape's age group.
#+end_quote

it's still a fringe group of cultists lead by a man who looks like a monster from a fairytale. where do we read that the majority of slytherins in his age group joined? i also don't know it consisted of a large majority of the ruling class- besides the malfoys and lestranges/regulus. pureblood ≠ wealthy/aristocracy

this also doesn't really change my point that he wasn't baited so much as he was ambitious and the DEs were an organic fit

#+begin_quote
  He doesn't have convinctions.
#+end_quote

as a child/teen/young adult, i agree. he's driven by his will, ambition and various passions. i think post lily's death the situation is...more complicated. idk what you mean by 'multiple times'? he was a DE, then he wasn't. this still, imo, doesn't invalidate his byronic potential, especially compared to the other byronic characters i mentioned

erik is a deformed and reviled stalker and murderer who kidnaps christine and attempts to coerce her into marrying him

heathcliff is driven by his passion for cathy, and vengeance, and is a vicious domestic abuser

neither of them have convictions past their own passions- for love, vengeance, art

#+begin_quote
  Draco married the younger sister of a fellow Slytherin. Astoria Greengrass, who had gone through a similar (though less violent and frightening) conversion from pure-blood ideals to a more tolerant life view, was felt by Narcissa and Lucius to be something of a disappointment as a daughter-in-law. They had had high hopes of a girl whose family featured on the ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight', but as Astoria refused to raise their grandson Scorpius in the belief that Muggles were scum, family gatherings were often fraught with tension.

*** Even if someone doesn't worship her.... I mean, what reason would they have to bash her. Thats the issue. Shes not a major love of any of the main characters. Shes depicted as innocent, often bullied, somewhat strange girl with a difficult childhood who has a quirky mind. She escapes bashing because there is no reason to bash. Its also the reason folks love taking her and twisting her character in interesting ways, such as making her dark, or involving her in a romance with a major player.

That said, she still qualifies as an over-hyped or rated person and I agree with that assessment although I don't think she's the most overhyped.

The closest I've seen to bashing Luna is a fic that had her be the youngest Unspeakable ever, because she had no moral compass and thus no qualms about using magic that was better left alone.

But in general, I agree with you--and what's worse is that Luna's my favorite character.

It's extremely frustrating. Unlike the glorification Hermione receives in Fanon--which essentially ignores her flaws and exaggerates her virtues--Luna is treated as a different character entirely.

I think a lot of it comes with fanfic writers being primarily teenagers who identify with Luna being the bullying. But they ramp up the bullying to far beyond what we ever saw in canon and they ignore canonical Luna's response to it.

It's ironic: Fanon Luna is a judgmental, self-righteous, superficial, omniscient jerk who is always written as the good guy and winds up being a far bigger bully than anything we saw happen to her in canon.

Oh and there are those stories that make Hermione a super genius. She's intelligent and highly logical but she isn't Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein for goodness sake. Remember seeing a story that had Hermione building Harry an Iron Man suit and was like “you've got to be joking...”

** Don't hate me for this, but the real answer? Every goddamn character in this franchise. There is such a divide between the ideas Rowling copied and was going for, the way she actually ended up executing those ideas by copying them wrong, and the way fans choose to interpret the books and characters so those things can be more tolerable.

For the love of god, everything that happens in Harry Potter happened the way it did because Snape told Voldy about the prochecy about the two kids destined to oppose him and said "Now please kill James Potter and his son, leaving Lily alive for me". Voldy said "How about I don't do that?" and killed 3 people that day. But the location of the Potter family could only be found because that Secret spell with the Secret Keeper... The Potters wanted to make Sirius the secret keeper (or was it Moony?) but Sirius said "You know what would be wacky? Doing something nobody would see coming" and just like that, James trusted Ratboy The Untrustworthy with the lives of himself, his wife, and his infant son.

In fanon, Harry doesn't get with some random no-name who came out of nowhere, he gets with a better woman he had chemistry with. Or Ginny becomes a better woman he has chemistry with. Or he becomes Lord Chad of the Massive Harem. His canon friends are either called out for being flakes, portrayed as even worse flakes and shat on for it, or rewritten as better people. Bad endings are replaced with better ones. Fundamentally awful human beings are shat upon for being awful or changed for the better. Fight scenes go from "Who uses kill spell first" to something more creative and interesting. And for every one "Its an adult fic because rape happens" fic, there are three more stories far more adult and mature than Rowling's "Its an adult story because torture spell usage happens" story.

Harry is heroic, in some way. Voldemort is either threatening or shat on for being petty and generic and nonthreatening. And the Weasley Twins actually prank bad guys instead of random students.

Fanon is where we write the Harry Potter stories we thought we grew up with, and the Harry Potter stories we want others to grow up with.

And going OFF on Ron when he tries to slut shame her. I'm not a huge Ginny fan, personally, but I think people who say she does nothing in the books haven't read them in a while.

**** Right, that is the typical fanon characterization.

There are zero likable or admirable Slytherin characters in canon. I think it's reasonable to assume that is due to Harry's POV, so I am ok with speculative fan fiction in this area.

****** Would you call Slughorn likable? Admirable? "Not terrible / as bad as the others" and "Is sorry he helped Voldemort" do not = admirable or likable. For people who want a Slytherin to admire, there are slim pickings, and fanfic is a way to imagine some possibilities.

** Draco is wonderful. He can hold up to Harry in Quidditch and comes close to Hermione in studies, is smart can do Occumulency and handles planning very well. Definitely not an overrated character. Also must be good looking as even in the books there is nothing negative mentioned about him whereas all sorts of negative facial attributes are attributed to Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle. This is important because Harry has an inherently biased against Slytherin. Most Overrated according to me would be James Potter. Most Underrated would be Ron Weasley . He certainly does not deserve the hatred he gets

*** I have to respectfully disagree. Many characetrs were written as decent Quiditch players while Draco seemed to brag a lot and bribe his way onto the team. We don't know if any games Slytherins won was due to his skill or to the viciouness of his teammates. There is also no reason to believe his marks were close to Hermione's - Snape gave prefferential treatment to the Slytherins and to Draco especially. He knew a lot of curses/hexes but as bully that doesn't really suprise me. As for Occlumency and being a good planner, those are both signs of being cunning and being able to set disconnect from your emotions, not heroic (or villainous) traits. Isn't there a quote about how if you want to know the measure of someone pay attention to how they treat anyone they consider to be lesser? Draco spent a lot of time bullying any student he considered inferior, disrespected any teacher who was not an associate of his father's, and had no issue being a bigot/racist/snob. In the last two books we saw him suffer because his family's bad choices came home to roost, but he still fought Harry in the last battle and, if Voldie had won, would have been willing to sit back and enjoy it. I don't consider being forced to deal with the consequences of your terrorist ideals to be particularly sympathy worthy.
