Hi I just finished my second chapter of my fanfic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29844804/chapters/73434570]]. I'm looking for a beta reader to read my upcoming chapters.


** I could beta for you. I do have a question though. Reading the stories description, I get the idea that this is a romance focused fic. While not a bad thing, I'm just curious if this is what you intended. Will the romance be the main focus, or is there more to this story besides maggy malfoy and Harry's love hate relationship?

*** It will not surround romance. That will be a side part, but no that will no be the main part.

**** If romance isn't going to be the main focus of the story, you may want to be more short and concise in your description about the relationship, and actually add to the description what the story is about.

I don't know your story plot, but For example:

"Harry potter has an interesting destiny. Fated to foil the dark lord, he will have to grow and learn how the prophesy affects him and how can he stop the greatest dark lord of all time? With enemies around him, even at school, such as a malfoy boy, how will the malfoy sister play a part in Harry's role? She hates harry..at first. Harry hates her..at first. What happens when the youngest daughter of the dark lords favorite family begins to become enamored with his greatest enemy? How will the love/ hate relationship between margerate malfoy and harry potter effect the fight against voldemort and his followers?"

Something like that, where your giving insight into the relationship subplot, but still letting readers know what the main plot will be. Right now, reading your story description, it only includes relationship information

****** I would use it as a template, as like I said, I don't know your stories plot outside of what you intend to do with Harry's relationship. If that description works with your indented plot though, feel free to use it.

And sure. Youll just have to PM or email me with new chapters to go over before you post

** What exactly do you expect a beta to do? Just curious.

Also, switching the POV more than once in a chapter is disorienting. You shouldn't have to explicitly mention the narrator.
