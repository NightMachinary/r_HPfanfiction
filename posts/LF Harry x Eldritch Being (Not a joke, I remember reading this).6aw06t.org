Okay, as most of you know, there has been a sort of meme/spam/thingy going around where people are requesting 'Harry x [Something big powerful and possibly godlike]. These threads have caused me to remember a fic where Harry, at the Dursleys, is in a weird relationship with either an Eldrich being or Death... or something else like that. The being is incredibly pervy, I think it used its tentacles to defile its own body, but my memory is not as good as it could be. Thank you.


** i thought i knew what you meant until i read pervy and tentacles now i have no idea and i really want to read it
