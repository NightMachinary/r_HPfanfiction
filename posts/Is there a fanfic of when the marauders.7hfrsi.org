  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** Okay so I am obsessed with the Marauder's, or I was when I was really into HP Fanfic. Here's a bunch, and you can also check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3742838/][my favorites on FanFiction]].

Love, Life, and Sugar Highs linkffn(928550) - This one is 114,253 words, so it's not CRAZY long but it's also not short. They include the Beatles in this fanfic, which I don't understand why that's so RARE. Overall I really enjoyed it.

10 Things I Hate About James Potter linkffn(3555029) - Again, only 115,120 words but it is cute and amusing. It takes on a different personality for Lily, not just the cut-and-paste 'Lily loves school and hates rule breakers' that a lot of people use.

She Said What? linkffn(5048579) - Hah, one with a lot of words! This one has 313,283 words and is all Lily's diary. It's a more typical fic, but it is written well and I enjoyed it.

Lily's List linkffn(2795240) - This one is 159,618 words and downright the most adorable fic I've ever read. Lily writes a list of things James would have to do for her to love him, and the fic is a lot of him doing those things. It's so cute and it is written well.

You Don't Say linkffn(7012597) - 114,187 words with a super jerk-y James, but he is also a lot of fun and it is a fic I laughed a lot while reading.

Operation Get My Lily linkffn(6337679) - Okay, this one is 110,826 words and the cutest thing I have ever read. Another one with a list, because Lily writing a list just makes sense.

Summer Magic linkffn(7286177) - This one is 123,057 words of meddling from all sides. Unlike a lot of other fics, this one doesn't completely ignore Lily's parents. Plus, we get to see James in the muggle world and it is great.

EDIT: Formatting.

EDIT 2: I originally posted this list on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/404mxi/lf_long_mauraders_lily_and_james_story/][this post requesting Jilly fics]].

  You mean to say that Potter's family is coincidentally staying across the street from our beach house for the summer, Mum and Mrs. Potter are now randomly best friends, and they expect me to hang out with that git for two months? You've got to be joking. (Even worse? There's a sequel.)

  Lily genuinely liked James Potter. He was handsome enough to make any girl swoon, but he was also funny, clever, and secretly kind. Unfortunately, he could also be rude, thoughtless, spoiled, and cruel. Finding the balance was the tricky part. Author note: James is a jerk. Please don't be surprised.

** This is actually a little broad because the Marauders Era actually can be divided and broken down. Are you looking for just the Marauders? Or Are you looking for Jily (James x Lily), Wolfstar (Remus x Sirius), Marauders/OC? Then there's also Lily and Severus (both romance and friendship). Here are some of the ones that the others haven't mentioned:

  Lily Evans has spent years despising James Potter. He has spent just as long worshiping her. When seventh year pairs them Head Boy and Girl, each comes to realize that their judgment isn't quite what they thought it was. This is the same story that was over on Checkmated, but I completed it here. Prequel to Heroes for Ghosts. Warning: this story is a strong M rating.

** Linkao3(The Debt of Time) is a multi part fic about Hermione traveling through time. A majority of the story is about her reliving her childhood with the Marauders and it goes through all seven years at Hogwarts and then a year or two more before going back to the future.

Obviously it focuses a lot on Hermione, but every important thing that happens to the Marauders is in the story. It is hilarious, heartfelt, and heartbreaking at times. Definitely worth a read if you haven't read it yet.
