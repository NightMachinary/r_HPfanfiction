** Nah, I'm pretty sure that Merlin got trapped in a tree in Arthurian Legend. And he'd probably be pretty angry about that, perhaps enough to lash out at anything that came near.

Now where could we find a tree like that...

Along the way, the Malfoys forgot that Merlin was actually a house elf. They just knew that old elf was batty and liked torturing himself.
