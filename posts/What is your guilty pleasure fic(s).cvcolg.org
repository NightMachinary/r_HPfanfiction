  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** I really like it when characters innovate a bit instead of just relying on existing spells. Like, we've got a charm that can make a lot of light, and the typical shield charm is see-through, so what if we modify the light charm into a coherent beam? Would the resulting laser beam be powerful enough to hurt an opponent?

Or maybe let's try to see what happens if you combine aguamenti with incendio and a transfigured nozzle. How much usable thrust could you create that way?

Or how about we measure how long it takes to summon the Knight bus and from where it typically appears. If you're dueling a dark wizard on a road, could you summon it just right to roadkill your opponent?

*** I like good transfiguration myself, although a flexibility in thinking is always a plus in combat in fics. Make wizarding combat be more about strategy and skill.

Methods of rationality might have issues, but it's right that in canon a wizard needs to only know how to apparate and use the killing curse in combat. Shield charms don't protect and the best defense is to not be there.

** Overthrow the corrupt, incompetent, and malicious British Ministry of Magic is a massive guilty pleasure of mine. Sure, the new revolutionary regime could be even worse, as the aftermaths of many real world revolutions show, but I consider the status quo to be utterly unacceptable.

I mean if you throw teenagers and children to the wolves, and if they win the day, you are going to deal with a bunch of hardened and ruthless child soldiers who also happen to have a bunch of issues. Most of them are not going to let your shit go on any longer, and they are going to make you pay, with very very high interests. Even the Wizard Jesus can only take so much, and he will crucio enemies who spits on his friends.

Not many fics address that topic, but here are some I like very much:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): The Trio and their friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings against Death Eaters who got off again. I just love the following excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  The Ministry would burn. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon. They would burn, every last one of them, because if that was the only way to keep them from ever going after Ron and Hermione again, then that was what he would do.

  Burn it all, scour it to the very bedrock, and rebuild it from scratch in the ashes. If the Minister could not command the Wizengamot, then the Wizengamot would yield. By Fiendfyre, blackmail, or loyalty, he did not particularly care which.

  His left hand rested by Hermione's neck, tangled in her hair. His right had a tight grip on Ron's shoulder, “silent reassurance that he was there, that they had him back for good.

  "They will burn," he vowed quietly. "Every single last one of them will burn for this."

  Hermione's breath hitched. Then her grip tightened and she looked up to meet his gaze, stubborn and furious and defiant through bloodshot eyes and ash-grey skin.

  "They will burn," she agreed.

  "... Every single last one of them," Ron finished, low and hoarse. "Every single last one."
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): The establishment learnt nothing from Voldemort's defeat and tried to add a marriage law to their list of atrocities. Harry and Hermione reacted violently to that, so violently that other European Pureblood regimes decided to intervene.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald broke out after Dumbledore's death and offered to help Harry. Together they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11961978/1/Justice-Justice-Shall-You-Pursue][Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue]], linkffn(11961978): UK government and allied wizards shot up Death Eaters, Thickeness/Umbridge Ministry, and Voldemort. The Trio helped hunting down Horcruxes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travelled and killed off their enemies in droves. They even did the Goblins in, but failed to get Snape and Karkaroff...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901): Another take down of that stupid marriage law trope, in which a gravelly injured Harry hires a super assassin SI from America to take out those responsible. Written by the same author of NOFP.

Finally, I greatly enjoyed the scene in CoG where Grindelwald incinerated those Ministry goons.

  Harry brought back Pettigrew at the end of the Third Task, changing the course of the war. With his godfather by his side, he learns the importance of having allies during turbulent times, even if they are unexpected. How will the Wizarding world react to this new, proactive Harry?

  The year after the war was a confusing time for the teen warriors. They had fought against the greatest evil - what was next? Follow them as they try to find out. Cannon pairings. Thank you to Mr Orzech for the cover image!

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
