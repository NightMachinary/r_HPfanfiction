:END:
All i remember is that it was WBWL fic, Potters alive and they all were on quidditch match? Death Eaters attacked, Harry was lost and Potters left without him(they actually forgot about him, also it was pre-Hogwarts ) Voldemort shot AK at Harry; Remus and Sirius saw it from some window but left before they could see that Harry survived and Voldy took the kid Later in fic, close to the end (tho it was unfinished work) Remus was kidnapped and tortured? And Voldy told Harry to kill Remus, but he didn't want to and struggled, Remus recognized him through some magic?? And told him it's ok

I would be very grateful! :)
