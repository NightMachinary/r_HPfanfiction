What's your favourite feel-good fanfics?

They don't have to be entirely fluff (I think some conflict probably helps), as long as there's no exaggerated drama and angst...


** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) This fic always puts me in a good mood. The ending is happy and satisfying too.

** I have a lot of fics that fit that criteria, here are my four favorite ones:

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][*/A Black Comedy/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][/nonjon/]]\\
  Nonjon is the master of action-comedy and his fics are extremely funny in my opinion. I can also recommend Browncoat, green eyes of him - it's a bit older but still fun.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][*/Oh God Not Again!/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/674180/Sarah1281][/Sarah1281/]]\\
  It's a time-travelling Harry (Peggy Sue) with a whole load of fun, the chracters are a bit more likeable than in ABC.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199602/1/][*/The Thief of Hogwarts/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1867176/bluminous8][/bluminous8/]]\\
  Pretty cool story with a slightly different Harry. Sadly not complete I think, but it's a good read either way and has a lot of fun moments.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/][*/Barefoot/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5569435/Zaxaramas][/Zaxaramas/]]\\
  When Harry touches something, he gets to know the history of the object. Not strictly feel-good, but I don't recally any really bad situations or angst.

That actually kind of disappointed me. Yeah, harem stories are, as a rule, terrible. But Barefoot goes through the trouble of making up some convoluted reason for Harry to sleep naked with a girl in his arms every night, which at some point becomes two girls who both clearly want him, but nothing ever happens? I feel cheated.

I admit I just skimmed over the first half of the story so I'm probably missing a lot of details.

** linkffn(Core Threads) is the objectively best one, and dear to my heart. Someone linked linkffn(Seventh Horcrux), and it's always an awesome read, though not very fluffy by any means. linkffn(Harry Potter and a grandfather's gift), in contrast, is /not/ a very well-written story, but it's a quick and pleasant read, with no OOC behavior, good spelling and a good sense of humor; for me, it's the quintessential feel-good fic.

If you forgive the digression, I think the difference between /Core Threads/ or /Grandfather's Gift/ and most OP!NoConflict!Harry stories is that in those two tales (and there might be others), Harry never crosses any lines. Many wish-fulfillment stories end up having Harry 1) kill his enemies, and in needlessly jerkish fashion at that, and 2) end up at the head of a harem. (And I'm not going into the bashing issues. Why does having an OP Harry mean the other characters should be made into terrible people? For... contrast?) This apparently fulfills some people's fantasies, but puts off most reasonable people you can meet on this sub.

As a sidenote, I've been skimming some of the reviews of that story and there's an actual sociopath:

** Both of these Harry/Luna stories make me feel really good inside:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487457/1/A-Boy-a-Girl-an-Owl-and-a-Train-Compartment]])

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12499983/1/Somehow-You-ll-Just-Know]])

There's no real end to fluffiness with this couple, so any fics you seek out will probably be good, but these are two recent ones that especially stand out in my mind.

  Luna Lovegood wondered if she would have a boyfriend someday, and her father hoped that when it happened, she would find the right person. If you like Harry/Luna romance with plenty of "Awww..." moments, Luna/Xeno stories focusing on their father/daughter bond, or stories about the tensions at the intersection of romantic relationships and familial love, this is the story for you.

  Harry doesn't expect to enjoy his fifth year back at Hogwarts, and would just as soon be alone on the train... but a few hours with a certain blonde Ravenclaw may have an unexpected effect. A "what-if" variant, grounded in canon, but also inviting you to explore the possibilities. For anybody who appreciates H/L as friends and/or a potential couple.
