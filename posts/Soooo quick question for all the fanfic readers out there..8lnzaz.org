Have you ever gotten so into a fic that it starts to affect your real life? HPMOR was the one I had serious problems putting down.


** I was the opposite. I had problems putting up with HPMOR. I was curious enough to see how it ended that I had to force myself to finish it

** Yep, same here. Any time I start rereading HPMoR I wake up a week later wondering what happened in between because I'd have stayed up so late every night to keep reading /just a little more/. That story is entrangling, no question. I get sucked in completely every time.

I can't off the top of my head think of any other HP fics that have that effect on me. Most recent was a naruto one.

**** Oh, speaking of reading at work, I did get pretty sucked in to a pretty hilarious HP/Bleach crossover just the other day. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568]] Relatively short, but I got distracted enough by it that they noticed I was reading instead of working.

** I've never read HPMoR, but now you've piqued my interest. I will have to check it out.

I have been reading fanfiction for years in stints usually. I recently fell back into HP fanfiction, and more specifically discovered the Tomione ship. I kind of lost the last few months of any free time in my life just reading through all the works I could find. I feel like this happens anytime I fall into a good pairing or something I just scour all the fanfic sites for works, and become a hermit.

*** I feel you. At times I feel like I can't stop reading and then at other times I don't even want anything to do with it. HPMOR is pretty good imo. Yeah Harry is a bit of a pretentious douche but it doesn't take away from the story. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion on a fic. I'm sure I hate some stories that others love.

***** I think there are nearly as many ways to criticize the author of HPMoR as their are ways to criticize the story itself, but I kind of have to disagree with this one specific instance.

Everything is not "okay because he's smart". One of my favorite things about the story, though I could not for the life of me read it through more than once, is that Harry's arrogance of his own intelligence is precisely how he gets brought down low.

He underestimated the wrong people, overestimated the wrong people, and his judge of character throughout the entire story was nearly always incorrect and he allowed himself to be influenced against his best interests by people who trusted because "they were smart".

Harry's arrogance and [[/r/iamverysmart]] attitude is exactly what lead him to being betrayed despite how /obvious/ his would-be betrayer was. His arrogance also ended up hurting at least 3 of the people closest to him.

It's something he eventually comes to acknowledge.

****** I never got past chapter 6. If it takes over 100 chapters of cringeworthy behavior for some sort of payoff, then that's a bad story. It's like saying "Sink 100 hours in this shitty gamd because it has an awesome final boss fight."

Some people like it but shipping Harry with Magical Nazis also gets you thousands of likes, so that is not really an indicator of quality.

******* I don't personally care if you read the story or not, but there /is/ a reason that the story is one of the most wildly popular fics in /fanfiction/, let alone Harry Potter where, I believe, it's at the top.

I'm not going to tell you that you'll like it, but there /are/ legitimately a lot of great moments in the fic, even if it doesn't balance it out to become net positive.

Certainly it deserves more than 6 chapters, imo.

******** 6 was generous. I felt like closing it after the first one but kept reading because that many favourites meant quality, right?

Sorted by favourites, the top fic of the entire fandom ships Hermione with the coward who called for her murder at age 12. Number 5 twists one of the most disgusting humans in the entire series (Snape) imto a loving father figure. There are more Death Eater ships in the top 40. If you look at the most popular stories updated within the last month, almost half are ships with genocidal scum.

I think we may just be born to disagree with each other. xD

But that's alright. For future reference, though, a marking of popularity is certainly not going to be found simply by searching "favorites".
