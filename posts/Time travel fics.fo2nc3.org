I'm specifically looking for ones like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11233445/1/Whiskey-Time-Travel][Whiskey Time Travel.]] In it, Harry is sent back to 1978 and has a job at the Three Broomsticks. He was an Unspeakable in his timeline and the status still applies but he just sorta hangs around until the plot actually gets going.

No m/m, mpreg, or whatever other types of fuck shit I'm not up to date on.

Thank you.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
