** This is an interesting idea, but I'm trying to figure out why Draco would be suddenly calling /Lily/ a mudblood. I mean, yeah, sure, that's how he sees her, but it would be a complete non-sequitur for the conversation.

*** I can see Draco calling Harry a son-of-a-mudblood, which could be a generic wizard-culture insult whose specific meaning he doesn't even think about.

**** You know, I find it funny that the Dursleys insulted Harry's parents more than Draco did, at least so far as I can recall.

Draco said they came to a bad end for making the wrong choice, but that's not an insult.

On the other hand, Marge insulted his mother, "If there's something wrong with the /bitch/ there's something wrong with the pup."

I swear, Marge is probably the only person I want to punch more than Umbridge.

  This starts somewhere in between chapter 37 and 38 of “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” by J. K. Rowling. Harry just learnt about the Prophecy and wrecked Professor Dumbledore's office, but wounded members of the Dumbledore Army are still in the hospital wing of Hogwarts. He thought that the mysterious prophecy is the last surprise of that summer. How wrong one can get? One of those stories of “the summer between the fifth and sixth year, Harry gets his issues together”, but hopefully less tropey and with a twist.Response to my own challenge at Reddit.This is very much Work in Progress, so you can expect changes even to the published chapters. Comments, review, objections and accusations are all welcome.
