** You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father,' Voldemort hissed softly. ‘A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child ... and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death ...' Voldemort laughed again. Up and down he paced, looking all around him as he walked, and the snake continued to circle in the grass. ‘You see that house upon the hillside, Potter? My father lived there. My mother, a witch who lived here in this village, fell in love with him. But he abandoned her when she told him what she was ... he didn't like magic, my father ... ‘He left her and returned to his Muggle parents before I was even born, Potter, and she died giving birth to me, leaving me to be raised in a Muggle orphanage ... but I vowed to find him ... I revenged myself upon him, that fool who gave me his name ... Tom Riddle ...' Still he paced, his red eyes darting from grave to grave. ‘Listen to me, reliving family history ...' he said quietly. ‘Anyway Harry, how is your sex life?'

***** Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord ... you have no idea ... he has weapons you can't imagine ... I was scared, Sirius, I was never brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen ... He Who Must Not Be Named forced me --' ‘DON'T LIE!' bellowed Black. ‘YOU'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!' ‘He -- he was taking over everywhere!' gasped Pettigrew. ‘Wh-what was there to be gained by refusing him?' ‘What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?' said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. ‘Only innocent lives, Peter!' ‘You don't understand!' whined Pettigrew. ‘He would have killed me, Sirius!' 'Chicken Peter, you're just a little chicken. Said Black, 'Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep.'

  “Snape's Patronus was a doe,” said Harry, “the same as my mother's, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized,” he said as he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, “he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?”

  “He desired her, that was all,” sneered Voldemort, “*but when she had gone, he agreed that there were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him ---”*
