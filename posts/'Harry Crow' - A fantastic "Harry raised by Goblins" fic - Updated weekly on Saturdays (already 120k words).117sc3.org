** I wouldn't say it's Fantastic.

Like all of Robst's work it's certainly readable, and has some interesting ideas but it lacks depth and the characters are very one dimensional.

Plus it has the problem of the heroes always being right, no matter what.

That said, it's worth a read.

*** Great points. I would also say that it is ridiculously fast paced.

** Harry is so powerful that it should qualify as crackfic (usually he is more competent/powerful/intelligent than professors - see first transfiguration lesson for extreme example)

#+begin_quote
  Minerva had been a transfiguration prodigy and now held a mastery in the subject, an eleven year old goblin-trained wizard had just totally destroyed everything she held to be true. She was a powerful witch but couldn't even contemplate repeating the feat this boy just achieved when she was the same age. It wasn't just that though, Harry Crow just threw the transfiguration rulebook out the window. Where the hell did they go from here?

** Several new ideas in this story that kept me interested. I liked how Harry is considered to be a goblin.

However, the story has huge pacing issues. 20 chapters in and is only on the Christmas holidays of the first year. Several characters are, as already mentioned, one dimensional. The author is writing themselves into a corner for time.

I'll continue to follow it for a while to see if the story continue to peeks my interest.
