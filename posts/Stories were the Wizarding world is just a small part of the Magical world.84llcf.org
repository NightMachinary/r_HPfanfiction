Were Wizards and Witches(pure-blood,Half-blood and Muggleborn all added together) make up less than 5% of the Magical worlds population with the Wizarding world being more of a small Bridge between the Muggle and magical worlds and at least 60% of the Population of the Magical world being made up of Half-breeds(for want of a better term) and the last 35% being made up of purebreeds of the other magical Races( maybe 17-18 other magical races so that they each make up on average 2% of the 35%). although I would prefer if the wizards made up and even smaller percentage because if we stick with the idea that there is 15000 wizards in the Uk that means that there is only 6,000 purebreed of each magical race which doesn't give them a sustainable population.(maybe give the magical world a population of 40 million world wide)

maybe have harry accidental stumble into the into the Magical world during his third year while he is staying as Diagon Alley with there being a portal to the Magical world like the Leaky cauldron is portal to the muggle world.
