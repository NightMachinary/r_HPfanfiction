** And who's the Dark lord? Grindy? it's not his style to kill a baby himself though .. he has people for that and also how was he supposed to know about Tom when he is in an orphanage in muggle world? how AU is your magical world?

or is this one of those cases where Tom replaces Harry's soul in infant body?
