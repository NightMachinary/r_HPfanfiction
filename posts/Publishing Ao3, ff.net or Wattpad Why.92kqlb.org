** If you want to maximise your audience and just post to one site, FF.Net. It's by far the biggest.

** I crosspost on both FF.net and AO3 for better reach and also as a backup for my story. FF.net has high reach, but AO3 users give detailed reviews, atleast for me.

*** I think FFN could benefit from a version of the "kudos" button. Half the reviews on FFN are literally just "wow this story is so cool update soon please". A "kudos" option may help cut down on those.

** i think ffnet has a bigger fandom but ao3 imo is the better site for reading on, for the tags and layout. i'd say post on both of those and forget about wattpad.

**** I hear that they upgraded the system for main pairings or something, so hopefully it'll get better. Would be nice if they would let trusted users go through fics and note main pairings and characters, and if anthologies could have tags for their own separate chapters.

**** I feel this. My OTP is rarely front and center in stories. I've gotten in the habit of clicking a fic, selecting "entire work" and using control+F on my favorites' names. Oftentimes, they're mentioned maybe three times in the entire fic. It's irritating when there are only 400 fics with the pairing I want and a good 20% of them are just people tagging background pairings to get more attention.

*** Ime, Ao3 is only really useful for reading /porn./ There doesn't seem to be a way to filter /out/ porn stories- I can't get everythign /but/ the smut, and 95% of what's on that site is smut.

**** there's a section in the filters where you can exclude things like pairings and ratings and warnings and tags. if you chose to exclude explicit or mature fics then you wouldn't have porn.

***** The problem is, most of the fandoms I read in are violence heavy- they tend to wind up high rated via gore and violence. And you can't distinguish between the two. Plus, half of the writers on that site don't bother to tag their stories properly- there's a /lot/ of "not rated" porn, and unless you're willing to filter out all the potentially /good/ stuff there, too, you're gonna have to wade through a few hundred porn stories. The filters are good for smaller fandoms, but in anything big like Harry Potter, they don't fully cut it.

** Ff.net for the largest audience, but I personally prefer reading fics on AO3 because of the default larger font size and the site design is more appealing in my opinion.

**** Yup, I know. I just prefer not having to make changes to the settings. A little lazy, but the default settings on AO3 are perfect for me.

** [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] has a huuuge audience, and more HP fanfiction. AO3 is just better for finding fanfics you are interested in, and I find it more accessible. I deeply dislike Wattpad.

** Why not all of them?

I started off publishing on ff.net as it was easy to get an account. Much of my anime based stuff was also posted on mediaminor.org I finally got a Ao3 invite and now I publish there too.

I also have an adultfanfic.net acct I can post the stuff other sites would ban me for like heavy abuse scenes and hardcore rape scenes. I post the milder versions currently.

** most people, myself included, don't like wattpad because a lot of the fics on there are immature, poorly written and are primarily original fiction or rpf. I've found that the readers on wattpad are very encouraging though. Ffn is great for the large audience, though the publishing process is kind of convoluted. Also I usually get a decent number of helpful reviews on ffn, more on ao3. Ao3 is my favorite because of the lack of ads. I love the large audience and on ao3 i get the largest percentage of constructive reviews. I also really like the tagging system to help readers find fics with the tropes/motifs they're looking for.

** Check out Spacebattles, SufficientVelocity and QuestionableQuesting. Most key fanfic sites have their own 'most popular' fandom. The exception is [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]] who specialises in everything and QQ who specialises in smut.

** Archives of Our own has lots of stories and many readers, but yours will be drowned out by hordes of pornfics.

FFN has many stories and lots of readers, but it's all but impossible to get actual constructive feedback on your story.

Wattpad is a waste of time.

Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity are smaller and it's harder to get readers if you're not well known, (/especially/ in the Harry Potter fandom, which they are... not fond of), but they will provide feedback and critique your story. Whether you want them to or not.
