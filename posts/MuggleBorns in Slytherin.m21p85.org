  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** There is a trope that I /loathe/ that, at least for me, ruins most Muggleborn (particularly Hermione) in Slytherin fics.

It's when a Muggleborn gets sorted into Slytherin during Harry's generation: just in time for Voldemort's second rise---and Slytherins are the kindly and supportive, and oh-so-misunderstood and oppressed. The main sources of conflict are Gryffindors, Dumbledore in particular.

Now, I get it: it's the fic writer's prerogative to write a Bizarro-world AU, where the whole damned /Hogwarts/ is OOC. However, at some point, when a canon character is OOC enough, you have to ask, why even keep the name? And so it is for Bizarro!Slytherin full of nice, helpful people.

Why? Is it that they like the snake imagery? Is it that they want to play [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool][Evil is Cool]] trope straight but realise that evil characters would be unsympathetic, so they make Gryffindors even more evil? Why?

** Do you need them to be the main character? I've never self-promoted before, but I write second generation, and my favorite character is probably the Slytherin muggle-born. He's the only time I've ever been as interested in writing an original character as I was in a canon character. As I don't think he really fills the prompt because he's only a secondary character in Scorpius's story, here are my headcanons:

His arc was basically that he was incredibly privileged in the muggle world and since the Death Eaters and Voldemort are gone, he was able to find it really funny when he entered the wizarding world and was suddenly treated as a member of an oppressed group because he didn't really have to face what happened to muggle-borns during the first and second wars. One of his first scenes is the Gryffindors bullying Scorpius for the Voldemort's son rumors (Cursed Child shit if you don't know, but it's not Cursed Child compliant at all), and he retaliates by baiting them into saying the word "Mudblood" so the professor will deduct a bunch of points. Then Rose Granger-Weasley corners him after class to say that people have actually suffered because of that word, and he's very flippantly like, "Yeah, me, just now."

Then there's a rebirth of the dark at the end, to show how a moderately reformed Slytherin would react to Voldemort essentially giving them the choice to join him or die. He has his life threatened for being a muggle-born and the other two Slytherin muggle-borns are both killed. He chills out a bit afterwards but stays pretty absurd, mostly he just doesn't make jokes about being the Slytherin muggle-born anymore. He also, in one of the oneshots I'm working on right now for gifts and requests, compulsively passes off muggle culture that no one in the house recognizes as his own creation.

As far as other fics with a Slytherin muggle-born, I've only ever seen one (Put Your Curse In Reverse), but he's an even less significant character to the plot than my Slytherin muggle-born. In general, the trend that I've gathered from my two points of data is that they tend to be more relaxed about wizarding politics, as in less likely to judge someone based on their family because it's meaningless to them, and also cleverer than the average Slytherin. Because Slytherin is both the house of cunning and ambition and the house of blood purity (which the hat openly admits in Order of the Phoenix), there are some Slytherins in the series who aren't very clever at all. Really, most of them do not strike me as incredibly clever or cunning. A Slytherin muggle-born, because they directly contradict the blood purity tenet, would have to really embody the cunning and ambition of the house. So they tend to show the best of Slytherin without the inherent flaws in the house.

** Off the top of my head,

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is still /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic, despite being abandoned.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist by BrilliantLady) is a bit crack but is a fun Slytherin!Hermione fic.

linkffn(Brilliant Magic by LJ Summers) is tolerable, though like many romance fics (this time Hermione/Twins), the author isn't really paying attention to other aspects of it.

It's a HP crossover with Worm, but its probably actually better if you haven't read Worm (I certainly don't) all you have to know is Taylor Hebert is a villain turned superhero with bug powers, in a post apocalypticish world where massive interdimensional beings regularly cause havoc.

The fic is fairly well written, with some interesting characterization. It's pretty dark, and the main character is a bit of a Mary Sue, but overall a very satisfying read.
