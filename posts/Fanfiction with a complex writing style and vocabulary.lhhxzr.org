I don't want to come out as pretentious and obnoxious, nor do I wish to discourage people from writing, but I'm searching for fanfics that have a complex, nuanced rich sense of writing style. Quite many fics - and again, I have no intentions of being mean or vindictive - have a tendency to focus on the story but not on the actual writing style. The sentences are often too short; the adjectives used can be described as simplistic and repetitive. Furthermore, the grammar and syntax are, well, mediocre and sadly do not have it in themselves to open up a thirst for more complex stories. (As you might have guessed, I am a firm believer that /essence/ and /form/ are two complementary elements that need to exsit in an harmonious equilibrium.)

I have - of course - devoured several fanfics where writers use complex grammar and vocabulary. Some fics that come to mind are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last by Speechwriter]] (a fic with diverse, rich and elevated vocabulary), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12132374/1/Six-Pomegranate-Seeds][Six Pomegranate Seeds by Seselt]] (excellent phraseology, quite a lot of Latin fixed idioms, which I particularly liked) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12868175/1/The-Revolt-Volume-III][The Revolt Series by Van's Scribbles]] just to name a few. Of course, there are bound to be more fantastic fanfics out there, but these are first to come to mind when discussing not only a genuinely thought-provoking story and complex character structures, but also the beauty of the written form.

If a story has only basic grammar structures, if there are a lot of spelling mistakes or if the genuine form of the written word is somewhat lacking, I somehow cannot read the text in its entirety. For me, bad form somehow subcontiously translates as bad essence. The essence and ideas should be top place, yet form needs to be firmly set.

Again, I wish not to discourage writers from writing and my rambling has no intent of showing that I am a "language purist" (as I too, sadly, often lack the adroitness to write in an alluring way; c'est la vie. This is especially true for English, as it is my third language and I accept that I still have much knowledge in need of accumulation in order to have a firm grasp of it.).

So please, if you have any fanfics that you would care to endorse, please, write them down in the comments. I'll appreciate it greatly.


** 1. Many of us have English as the second language, have mercy on us!
2. It is not language, it is the story, which matters.

*** I divide learning to write into four stages:

1. Very simple (e.g., the typical primary school essay)
2. Too ornate: purple prose, too many adjectives, "emerald orbs," etc.
3. A return to simplicity, only more nuanced than before. Better rhythm, a richer vocabulary, etc. You'll see this in well-written straight journalism.
4. Mastery (i.e., the author's voice). Great prose writers have a distinct voice, and some are more flowery than others. But they are always clear, and words are chosen carefully.

  the latter often leads to purple prose and bloated word-count as the author tries so hard to put in all that fancy grammar.

That's stage 2, and the writer needs to learn to tighten their prose first.

One thing I like about canon is the way JKR's prose grows up along with Harry. All the books are well-written, but the each book is aimed at a successively higher reading level.

** Shameless self-promotion:

My story might meet your criteria. I was lucky enough to have some merciless high school teachers who pushed me to become a better writer. My writing isn't flowery, but I use a rich vocabulary and pay close attention to clarity, rhythm, and flow.

Furthermore, ESL readers have said my story is easy to read, particularly because there's so much dialogue. And other readers have told me how genuine my dialogue sounds.

To balance the self-promotion, I can also recommend /[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The Secret Language of Plants]]/ by Endrina.

*** Please can you break down what's going on in your fic for me? It keeps getting recommended here but I want to know what I'm getting into first. I'm sorry if this is annoying.

**** No problem -- thanks for asking!

The background for my fic is that I found JKR's epilogue incredibly depressing ("Former child soldier marries high school sweetheart and enters law enforcement!"), and I wanted to write an alternative.

Personally, I grew up tremendously during college, and I'm giving my characters something similar, only without the actual university. So Harry meets loads of new people, has various girlfriends (but no harem), slowly deals with trauma, explores new magic, etc. I also give Hermione a lot of attention, but not as much as Harry.

The first chapter should be enough to give you the flavor. The writing and story improve considerably over time, but chapter one is a solid start. And the overall mood is very fun, with minimal angst, so it's a nice escape from outside stress.

  Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Heaps of dialogue and world-building, and OCs galore. Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. NO MORTAL PERIL.

** As much as I lament that poor grammar and incorrect English are common in fanfiction, it takes a lot for it to be a showstopper for me. I can forgive a lot for a good story, particularly if I can tell that the author is using English as a second (or subsequent) language. That's not to say it doesn't bother me, though.

As for sentences that are "too short," Ernest Hemingway would like to disagree.

Yes, I am being somewhat facetious, but short sentences are effective and are often being promoted over longer, more involved, sentences.

I suspect that a lot of the simplicity in what's being written is due to a couple of things. Here in the US, at least, the books assigned for reading in school no longer emphasize older works that were written when eloquent and flowery language was more common, with longer sentences with multiple subordinate clauses. Second, I don't believe that middle and high school students are being taught to diagram sentences anymore, which is a useful technique for learning how to read and understand, and thus be capable of correctly writing, long and involved sentences.
