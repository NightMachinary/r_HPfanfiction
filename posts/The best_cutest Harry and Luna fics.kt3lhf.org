  ‘Hey, is everything..?' Harry began to form the question, but it dissipated into nothingness. Why was he finding this so hard? Luna had been there for him countless times, always with the right words, or lack thereof. He frowned at himself. Luna deserved a better friend. Luna deserved the kind of friend that she was to him.‘Hey, Luna,' he said, more determined this time. Luna looked up at him from where she was putting away the dishes. ‘Wanna go for a ride?'

** The only Harry/Luna fic I've read, Antithesis, is pretty dark, heart-wrenching, and depressing in terms of the overall plot, but also heartwarming in terms of the Harry/Luna ending/epilogue. Wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for lighthearted stuff, but it's a beautiful read, and it did make me a lot more interested in the pairing.

I will say that this [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14993789][oneshot]] based in the same universe is absolutely adorable (and hilarious).
