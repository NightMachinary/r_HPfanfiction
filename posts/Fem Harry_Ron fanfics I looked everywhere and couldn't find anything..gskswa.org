Tbh it can be fem! Harry/ron or fem! Harry/fem! Ron but /no/ Harry/fem! Ron. I want fem! Harry. I would even be down for a fic where it's not a romantic relationship but Harry's gender doesn't change anything about their friendship and they're extremely close best friends.


** It's super hard to even find good Ron/Harry slash

** Ron/FemHarry? That's a rarepair if I've ever seen one. Check this link out on AO3. My favourites are linkao3(28878408) and the S.S. Best Mates (Rarry) series, linkao3(18404723).

  Ron wasn't expecting her to even show up tonight. But she did. He wasn't expecting her to dance with him. But she did... Harry didn't expect to fall for him in just one night after four years of friendship... But she did.

  Ron is very insecure about himself and his relationship with Harriet. Harriet on the other hand just wants to sleep. (Now with sequels)
