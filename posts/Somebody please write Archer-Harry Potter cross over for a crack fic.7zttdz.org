Wouldn't it funny if Archer and Lanna(who has AJ at this point) stumble upon kid Harry while on some ambiguous mission in UK, and takes him away after beating the shit out of Dursleys? Then Harry will turn out to be a functional alcoholic-spymaster wizard whom Malory loves for refilling her booze with magic, whom Sterling and Lana are proud of, and whom Krieger loves to experiment on to combine his freakish science power and magic!


** To me this screams one-shot with a post DH alcoholic dark wizard catcher Harry who's kinda an asshole cause he is fed up with the wizarding world's shit. Him and Archer essentially have a dick measuring contest while chasing a wizard messing around in the muggle world.

** Newcomb and I have discussed this extensively. Not a crossover but rather an HP story inspired by Archer characters, complete with Krieger!Snape with his holographic Lily waifu in the dungeons and an alcoholic Malory!Dumbledore with a twisted relationship with badass Archer!Harry.

Only reason why we didn't write it is that it would literally just be Archer haha.

  Dumbledore paused. "Why was he dressed as Hitler? Oh, who remembers."

*** Maybe it would be fun to include Malory that harrasses the hell out of Goblins to give her access to Potter vault so that she can have endless collection of alcohol from all around the world only to see Harry drink all of it.

** This is the best thing I never knew I needed.

Harry walked into Umbridge's office, and looked at all the gaudy decorations. "Do want nifflers?" he asked. "Because this is how you get nifflers."
