I'm looking for fanfic with a ruthless and brutal Snape who doesn't care much for his childhood anymore and cares more for the war (meaning Snape isn't bothered by the Marauders [namely James] the way he used to be).

Can the ruthlessness be directed to the side of the Dark instead of the Light? If that's not possible, that's fine.

I also don't want him to be ruthless to any of the kids or professors. I want him to be ruthless to people such as Wormtail or even Umbridge (though she has no side, really). Heck, even Petunia works (though she has no side in this war either)!

If none of these requests can be met, still recommend some fanfics where Snape isn't all sappy (and don't recommend In Blood Only! I'm already reading it!).


** I'm always recommending this but will do so again: The Never Ending Road by Laventadorn has my favourite characterisation of Snape ever. I'm afraid he very much hasn't moved on from hating the marauders but it defo fits your request for a non-sappy Snape. He's certainly quite ruthless at points.

Word of warning - it's long, and the sequel is unfinished. At the moment it's updating roughly every 6 months.

** linkffn(Darkness Visible)

This fulfills most of your conditions and is wonderfully written and plotted.

  AU after GoF. Trelawney makes a new prophecy about a mysterious Half-Blood Prince, and Dumbledore struggles to find out who it's about. Already walking a tightrope between two masters, Severus Snape feigns ignorance while making his own plans.
