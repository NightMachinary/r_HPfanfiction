** It really bugs me too! It's like McGonagall is supposed to be some sort of wizarding social secretary, keeping track of everybody's birthdays and sending out greetings!

Sadly for us, JKR doubled down on this on Pottermore, saying that McGonagall got hers exactly on her birthday, which is in early October. (OMG can you imagine Hermione getting her letter nearly an entire year early and being told she had to WAIT?) So the only way around this is if you don't consider Pottermore to be canon.

I recently came up with a way to have both (although it's still stupid and all letters should be sent in the summer only, but She Who Is Sometimes Crazy has spoken): around the eleventh birthday she sends out JUST the acceptance letter (the first page Harry got). The book lists, as always, come out in the summer---after they hire the next year's DADA teacher. Kids with late summer birthdays, like Harry, will get both letters at once. Everybody else gets two letters that first year.

** "We await your owl by no later than 31 July"

That's canon.

Now, Harry, whose birthday is 31st July is in a theoretical pickle. One of the biggest decisions of his life...has to be made in no time at all.

But he was sent (but did not receive/read) his letter days before his birthday . And again. And again.

And what about people born in August? Do they receive it in July? They must, surely. Otherwise it'd be "Happy birthday, you're invited to Hogwarts. It starts in September, you need to go back in time to accept it"

As for people born in September, yeah, having to wait would be a little awkward, but there's no perfect system, is there?

****** According to information that made it onto Pottermore, it is impossible to use Accio on living creatures. Full stop.

... We see Harry practice it on Trevor the Toad in Book 4 (the first book in which the spell appears, no less), and then another toad in Book 5. Ted Tonks is stated to have summoned salmon with it in Book 7, though it's unclear whether that salmon is alive or not.

If Crimes of Grindelwald counts for anything, Professor McGonagall was teaching 8 years before she was born - the movie takes place in the late 20's, according to Pottermore she was born in 1935. We also have another instance of "Accio does(n't) work on living creatures" when Newt summons his Niffler.

Those are the glaring examples - I'm pretty sure if I dig around, I can find loads more where that came from.

EDIT: At some point, questions also pop up around whether or not it's possible to "learn" Parseltongue - which Rowling has flip-flopped at least 4 times on ("Dumbledore understood it" according to a 2007 interview versus "he'd have no way of having learned it" in a later one, "It's not a language that can be taught" versus "Ron opening the Chamber of Secrets"), with Pottermore going the route of "impossible to learn, full stop".

**** Or, for a Muggle born who's birthday is early in the school year (like Hermione) there's the complete opposite issue. Imagine finding out about magic and everything in the September /before/ you're allowed to go, and you have to keep it completely secret for a whole year. Hermione will have turned 11 on 19 September 1990, and doesn't go to Hogwarts until 1 September 1991. No way would they expect young kids to keep a secret for so long, or like hang onto a wand for a whole year with no magic lessons and expect them not to do any damage.

It's more likely that Muggle born kids get told a little earlier the first time so they can say they don't need the Muggle secondary school place they'll have been offered and the Hogwarts teachers can go visit them and explain, but like in May or June. Then the kids who assume they're going to Hogwarts (is wizarding raised) get the book list a bit later because there's less admin involved with those kids, they just need a shopping trip. Harry was in the second group because they assumed he's known all about it for years and that's why his came in July and why they didn't send someone a little more capable than Hagrid to introduce him to the wizarding world.

** Was there any indication of if it's always during summer or if letters are sent like a week or two before the birthday? I can't remember...

*** Harry gets his first letter a week or so before his birthday, which lines up with the start of the summer holidays. No other indications exist in the books.

It's treated pretty inconsistently in what I'd consider "extended canon" - in a Pottermore book, McGonagall receives her Hogwarts letter on her birthday. Which is in October, so it'd be practically a full year before she could actually go. This doesn't line up with any other reference we have - all other years' letters arrive during the summer hols.

**** I'm pretty sure the summer starts weeks before his birthday though... and a quick google suggests they get out in late June, while Harry's birthday is the end of July. Either way, yeah fanfics are inconsistent, but as they can write whatever they want all I'd ask is that they clarify if it's going to be a plot point relatively early on how they're handling it just for clarification purposes.

***** Summer holidays start late in the UK.

It's mildly confusing owing to there being multiple school systems with differing holiday schedules, but if Harry goes to a state school (likely, given Dursleys - they're unlikely to want to pay school fees for him) his summer holidays are likely to start mid-to-late July and end in September.

** Thank you. That actually helps to add some simplicity to a fic I'm writing now where I want to delay Harry's entrance by a year. It's not published yet, I'm about 3 or 4 chapters away from when he will get his letter.
