I really don't care about the main story or the magic aspect, I'm just looking for any story that features sweet, mushy, romantic love between either Harry and Fleur or Harry and Daphne

Edit: I wrote Tonks instead of Daphne.


** His Angel has a lot of problems, but the fluff between Harry and Fleur is first rate. It was abandoned after 400k words, but honestly I think that's probably a good thing. A summary page at the end gives the major plot points for the rest of the story. linkffn(8135514).

From Southampton to New York and Beyond is a post Hogwarts EWE with Harry / Daphne. The entire fic is just fluff, its cute and well written. linkffn(12300252).

Harry / Tonks actually doesn't have much fluff as a category. I've read them all at this point and I'm struggling to think of one. At best Harry Potter and the Never Ending Summer has some fluff and is well written. With Tonks being who she is, the vast majority of fics that have these as a pairing also have a lot of adventure and action, rather than focusing on fluff. linkffn(3606379).

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

** Harry/Gabriel is basically the same as Harry/Fleur since neither character ever got fleshed out at all. So here's one I read recently [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/]]

*** I really enjoye Jeconais longer stories: Hope, This Means War, White Knight Grey Queen and I thoroughly enjoyed the Daphne Vignettes.

My only qualm is in all of the longer stories the time line is about a month. Hope, while it stretches longer still makes large jumps. That being said I really enjoyed Hope and found myself liking Gabrielle more than I thought I would.

I have toyed with writing my first fanfic being a Harry/Daphne. In my head it adds up but writing it is a whole other story (pun intended). I may start trying to flesh out some ideas.

BTW, just finished reading Pureblood Princess linkffn(6943436) and I rather enjoyed it all the way up until the ending. I won't spoil anything but the relationship that they developed was done nicely, IMO.

*** I've been meaning to read Hope for ages but kept putting it off, because Rated Teen = no smut and I really don't think Veela can be written well without sex. Does that fic prove me wrong?

**** Yes, there is still sexual content but it is covered under the teen rating. If you are looking for mature content then yeah it's not there but just because it's rated T doesn't mean it can't be talked about at all.

**** I generally hate reading harem stories, but I felt this one was developed rather well--there are particular reasons and nuances behind the harem, it's not just "ok tons of cheap smut."

Pretty well-written in my opinion. I'd say an 8/10 or so.
