I am looking for fics where people from the canon verse or close to it (Voldemort wins for example) travel back in time but end up in a AU verse.

Like Manipulative!dumbledore/Weasly bashing/Alive James and Lily/Girl who lived/ wrong boy who lived Stories.

It can be anyone traveling, but preferences for the Trio and like it to be the entire Trio. With canon (like) non-bashing personalities.

Some thing like The Red Knight (fnn(12141684)).

Oh man, where to start on this one. Alas, I'm no longer allowed to. Here's something close to what you're looking for. I can't remember how AU the new timeline/universe is. The rapport between the trio is well executed and satisfying in this though.

  The war's not over. Voldemort created one last Horcrux and sent it back in time, and Harry, Ron and Hermione have to travel back to destroy it and prevent that timeline's Voldemort from rising once and for all, all while doing some good old fashioned meddling along the way. HP/OFC, RW/HG, RL/NT.
