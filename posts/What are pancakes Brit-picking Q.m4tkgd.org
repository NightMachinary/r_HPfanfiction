When they say/write 'pancakes' in the UK, are they referring to the thick American ones or the thin ones you roll/fold over like it's done in Europe?


** This depends on where you are from. Up here in Scotland we have Drop Scones, or Scotch Pancakes (also crumpets are similar, and are different to down South) which are similar but made slightly differently to other pancakes. Equating our Pancakes to crepes is also somewhat false, as the pancakes that we make, usually on Shrove Tuesday, are thicker (2-3mm) than real Crepes (very thin) We make the distinction between the three types. Pancakes are as described, Crepes are much thinner and American Style are much, much thicker. We don't usually have them for breakfast, its more a teatime/ afternoon thing.

**** And then there are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatschinke][Palatschinke]], which is the thing in all Central and Eastern Europe (and it is not fair to use a German word for it, as it is originally Hungarian one, I believe). They are filled with wide variety of fillings (from a jam, sweet cottage cheese, to spinach) and eaten even as the main lunch food.

I would keep pancakes for the American ones, but there are so many varieties.

I have Petunia in one of my stories, when she wants to show her working class Northern roots make for breakfast [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_oatcake][Staffordshire Oatcake]] (are they made for breakfast?).

****** Nope. They are slightly thicker, and rolled with some filling. Talking about filling, they are extremely filling. Even me as an adult male cannot usually through more than two or three.

And talking about crêpes, you do distinguish between them and galettes, right? They are two very distinct French types of pancakes (from different flour even).

****** My story is post-War, she lives in Czechia (because she managed to screw up her marriage, be unfaithful, and Vernon divorced her), and then she finds out that she is actually a late-bloomer witch. I have introduced the Czech school of magic at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]), which is truly magical place, and school there started hundred years before Hogwarts (in the first half of the tenth century, soon after the death of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia][Saint Wenceslas]] it has been abandoned, according to the Muggle archaeologists). She then tries to reconcile with Harry (my headcanon was basically the situation half-a-year or so after the end of “Inner Demons” by serendipity_50 linkao3(601124)), visits him in his home at Grimmauld Place, and that's the situation when she talks with him and Ginny about childhood of hers and Harry's mum.

Unfortunately, the story is in Czech, and I have stopped working on it, while in the middle of the second rewrite. I think it needs the third rewrite and translation to English (or perhaps, I would write it in English directly and forgot the Czech version).

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

A pancake is like an American attempt at a crape.

Crape is seriously thin/nearly see through, a pancake is maybe 2/3mm

*** crêpes ≠ pancakes, at least not in central europe.

Crêpes are extremely thin, made with what amounts to a see-through film of batter in a pan, while european pancakes are ~ 2-3mm thick. Crêpes are also baked (fried?) for longer, because they need to be tougher so as not to rip when you take them out of the pan.

However, I don't really have a problem with an extremely british Harry using the terms inteechangably, so long as it's a round, flat thing they put stuff into.

We also usually eat them at dinner on shrove Tuesday, they're not common as a breakfast item. We will sometimes have American pancakes as a breakfast item but it's quite a recent thing and a treat rather than an every day.
