I've always enjoyed reading anything as long as it's well written, and even though I have my favorites I'm usually up to read anything.

I'll list some of my favorites in the comments :)


** linkffn(Black Demon by keeperofthemoon0) is Ginny/Sirius but without the tremendous age difference (not that I mind that...). The writing is excellent and it's a sort of a quiet, intense fic.

linkffn(Engaged Before the First Date by iheartwriting) is Hermione/George marriage law. Really, really great fic with a spectacular twist. Also manages to differentiate Fred and George pretty well.

linkffn(Twelve Dark Moons by Sophiax) is Luna/Voldemort. I can't even explain this one. Just read it. It works.

linkffn(11949881) Criminal by uchiha.s is Ginny/Neville. I loveee when an author can pair these two up and actually keep them in character. Of the very few fics of this pairing I've read, Ginny is for some reason always meek and shunted off to the side. It's a no-magic!AU and I think the only one I've read but still great.

  Oneshot, Office-setting AU. Ginny could not keep a plant alive if her life depended on it. Neville was outraged but also intrigued. He would never have guessed that the pretty sports columnist had had such a dark past. Neville/Ginny; other assorted pairings.

** Not sure how common it is, but linkffn(The Malfoy Case by natida) is a wonderful Draco/Astoria fic. Post Hallows legal drama. It has really good character development on Draco's part, a slow burn plot, several interconnected plotlines and high drama courtroom scenes. One of my favorites.

linkffn(2345437) and linkffn(11462379): A couple of decent Ron/Luna fics. I enjoy their dynamic more than anything else involving Luna. Fun stuff.

linkffn(The Radiant by fury-shashka). A bit of a weird fic in terms of how it goes, but I thought the writing was wonderful.

linkffn(Stars Fall by Lady Altair). Remus and Lavender, both of them werewolves. Excellent writing.

  Non-epilogue compliant. Four years after the war ends, Ron quits the aurors and moves back in with his parents. Luna has returned from her world travels, older, wiser and now her owl has low self-esteem. Oh, and Harry finds the whole thing hilarious. A Ron/Luna fic because it's weirdly perfect.
