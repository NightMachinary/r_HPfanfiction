I remember reading a fic on ffn where harry brother is the bwl and his parents lived and abused/ignored him. Sometime before Hogwarts he found Voldemorts Wand in the old nursery and learned magic with it. Now, I remember the story but I forgot the name of it so if someone could tell me I would be grateful.

** All I can think of that is the closest to this is linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning on the Wave) .

He didn't find Voldemort's want tho. So it's probably not the right one. Still a great series tho.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

*** I just can't read slash. Aside from being pretty cringy, me not swinging that way detracts from the story in a way that is out of the author's control.

How bad is the slash in this fic, is it a forefront thing?
