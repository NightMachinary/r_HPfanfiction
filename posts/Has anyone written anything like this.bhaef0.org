So I wamlnt to know if there's any fic out there where Harry dies and is then reborn as Harry Potter in an AU, but the catch is that the AU is a wbwl one, twin brother and everything. Just curious


** This is a really great premise. Canon Harry dies for real at the end of DH, finds himself reborn into the Potter family, still alive, with a sibling (ideally put him into the body at age 10 or 11, so that you don't have to go through the whole "hur dur, how do I baby" shtick that so many reincarnation fics do). It seems like a perfect reward, right? He gets to live the life he should have, because he sacrificed himself, and he's not so old that it'd be weird to start over again.

But then the whole "your brother/sister is the BWL/GWL" thing gets dropped on him and he has to decide how to handle it. Does he interfere, since he knows how things will go (or thinks so)? Does he just try and live a normal life, since he knows he (in his timeline) managed without a sibling? Does he decide he needs to handle everything except the sacrifice? Does he try and avoid the sacrifice all together? Lots of different ways you could take the premise.

*** My thoughts exactly, it could breathe fresh air into reused tropes while being unique in its own right.

**** The closest I've seen to something like this is linkffn(Elsewhere but Not Elsewhen), where canon Harry is sent into another dimension where his parents are alive and already have two siblings, but:

- There's no BWL/GWL. Well, there sort of is, but the world-wide celebrity isn't there.
- There's already a Harry Potter in that dimension
- It doesn't really go anywhere plot-wise, it's mainly just a feel-good fic
- It's abandoned.

I'm really hoping someone else comes up with an actual plot-driven version of this.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

** His older brother instead of his twin, but this fits linkffn(12597395)

I don't think I ever read it beyond a few chapters but from what I remember reading it was good... uh, according to the description it's HP/LV which I didn't know, so idk if you want that

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
