Have fun with that. You can use other characters in place of Dumbledore.


** It's a H/Hr fic so probably not going to be your favorite, but this prompt reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][The Revelation Of Harry Forrester]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Has a good dose of musical theory in it.

Warnings: Mild manipulative Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing.

*** The fic sounds interesting.

I don't have anything wrong with a decent interpretation of Hermione. I don't even have much of issue with her character in canon, except that she's swotty and a bit tactless and doesn't improve. Hence why I dislike the character, she could have been so much more. Read through the recent threads huh?

**** The recent threads and the not so recent threads, I kinda pegged you as "that guy that dislikes Hermione" due to your various request threads, I see I was mistaken.

(On a side note it's interesting how after you spend time in a community you start recognising names everywhere. Because i mostly read one subgenera of hp fics (h/hr) It's interesting to see that the same people are constantly reviewing and betaing these fics because they mostly read them too.)

***** You'd be surprised how many I've read. Most of my followed fics are Harry/Hermione fics due to the sheer number of them on the site. I also have a rule that a fic has to do something unique to get on my list. Plus I used to be a fan of the pairing back when the series was getting released.

Still, I do dislike the character. Fics like Renegade by 1991kira and Seventh Horcrux by emerald ashes have a Hermione I like because you see her learn to get along with people. I've used terms like bash, but only because this fandom is so polar you get nothing with any criticism otherwise.

Everyone makes mistakes and Rowling did well to make an imperfect character, but her character has quite a few moments when she's in the wrong morally or ethically and does not get called out for it as Ron or Harry would. That's my main issue with her. Rowling's narrative coddles the character.

Take Ron and Hermione's actions towards each other in canon. Reverse them and see the outcome. Hermione sends birds after Ron for having fun with Lavender. Ron sends birds after Hermione for having fun with Krum. Hermione is insensitive about Scabbers being hunted, have Ron get a dog that keeps attacking Crookshanks. A point in her favor is the Yule Ball though.

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

*** Man do I need to know music theory to properly read the rest of the fic? I'm at the part where Harry arrives at the Great Hall and I don't know what the /heck/ I'm even looking at here.
