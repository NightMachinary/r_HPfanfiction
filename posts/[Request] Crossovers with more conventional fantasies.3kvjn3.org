Inspired by this thread: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3ks2is/eu_youre_a_witcher_harry/]]

The link above is an [[/r/WritingPrompts]] submission for a HP-Witcher/Wiedźmin crossover. Now that I've seen it done, I've actually gotten a hankering for any crossovers with more conventional swords-and-bows fantasies. It doesn't have to be The Witcher specifically, it can be ASOIAF, or LOTR, or whatever your familiar with, and it doesn't even need to be a crossover. I'm happy so long as the fic fits with more "conventional" fantasy settings. So... any recs?


** Lots have already been mentioned, but there's an ASOIF one that hasn't, which is the Black Prince.

*** Has the story reached the timeline where /The Price That Was Promised/ was discontinued? I've been putting off reading this till it caught up with the original story.

**** Well, yes and no. The story hasn't yet caught up to the chronological point at which the original story left off - we're two chapters into Harry's time at Casterly Rock. However, in the last two chapters the story has begun to diverge from TPTWP in moderately significant ways, and I now think it's unlikely that the Black Prince will ever "catch up" with TPTWP, because it's heading in a completely different direction.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

*** Seconding The Shadow of Angmar, Failsafe and The Power He Knows Not as fairly decent, if unexceptional stories. /The Shadow of Angmar/ has potential to be very good, and it just updated yesterday.

The Wizard of Harenhall is a blatant Gary-stu curb-stomp fic. Will not recommend.

  Made to endure until the End, Harry Potter saw civilisations rise and fall, continents break and drown from his eagle's view high up in the sky. In the land of Middle-earth, he'd thought that he ought to help the poor sods trying to destroy the latest Dark Lord. So begins the tale of a Fellowship plus one, Rings, and a long journey to a volcano.

Millennium have passed by and his age never changes, his skin cannot stay pierced, his body cannot die; thus locking his soul, binding him forever to this existence.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  As the Master of Death, Harry cannot be taken by time. His friends were allowed to live out their lives, while he remained unchanged until they finally passed on. With nothing left to live for in his world, he sought out a new world, where he will find new friends and more danger than he's ever been in before. Middle-Earth might never be the same again, after Harry's done with it.

** One from way back: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Crystal Song)

It takes cues from the earlier Final Fantasy games (NES/Famicom era). Hasn't been updated in a while, but it ticks boxes for traditional sword-and-sorcery, a grand quest, etc. It's a little cumbersome with the way it handles character classes, but it's not too jarring if that's your kind of thing.
