Let's find a fic where Hermione's officious personality and assuming she is right grates on everyone else.

A fic where she's not magically super popular or socially adept.

Where she's not a super genius, just an excellent, moderately intelligent student.

​

A fic where she acts similarly to Percy.

​

Avoid the bashing though. So no, stealing Harry's money and spying on him for Dumbledore fics.

I actually prefer her to be written out, tbh. This, too, can come a bit too close to bashing.

Considering that the last two books deal with fighting magical Hitler, his death squads and concentration camps, I would hope that no one gets such an arc. A Machiavellian Hermione who carried the war effort through questionable means but does not get recognition (either because she stayed in the shadows or because people don't like her methods) would be a way better arc for her than learning about tact.

***** Pretty sure Dumbledore was Machiavellian and tactful. And as Barty Crouch ordered the use of unforgivables and would've been Minister had it not been for his son, no one would give a damn about her questionable means.

As it stands, canon Hermione should've learned tact, at least where it came to her friends and family.

***** You mean winning the war singlehandedly without diplomacy? Where she snubs her friends' and acquaintances' opinions?

So essentially, only Harry and Ron listen to her, two Hogwarts dropouts. We have Hermione, moderately skilled at best defending against the dark arts. She needs to learn

She becomes a Mary-Sue. A female Dumbledore/Grindelwald mix.

No a better arc would be Voldemort starts taking over, but Dumbledore and the adults are useless. Harry, Hermione, and Ron form a study group and slowly start to prepare for the war (the DA, but no loyalty to Dumbledore).

You start with more cross-house connections and smuggling vulnerable parties outside the country. The war starts. Dumbledore is dying and refusing to share pertinent information. The gang sleuths to get it.

Dumbledore dies. No one can stand up to Voldemort. The war lies on trio. They're looking for ways to get the Horcrux out of Harry, while searching for the Horcruxes. They kill the occasional death eaters, but it's a matter of infrastructure.

No, but after her dealings with Marietta and Umbridge, I was expecting more of the same. Instead, she was, for some reason, vehemently against the possibility of Malfoy as a Death Eater and did little to help the war effort afterwards other than staying with Harry. I was thinking more of something like

Ron: "We have been stuck here for a month and achieved nothing."

Hermione: "Well, how about making a few Snatchers disappear?"

or similar tactics where she uses her considerable creativity (DA coins and the like) to set up ambushes, free prisoners and stuff like that.

#+end_quote

God, I hate that trope. Cooperating with the Slytherins we know is outright braindead, the only decent Slytherin in the whole series is Andromeda Black (later Tonks), the odd misfit who was disinherited for being herself. (Slughorn should have mentioned the Horcruxes, definitely after V returned. And Snape's "standards" cost crucial jobs many recruits which undoubtedly helped Voldemort. Also, he enjoyed to torment children and voluntarily joined the magical Nazis).

******* I agree about Slytherin. I'd argue Slughorn was good if a coward.

But seriously, we only have a 1 house narrative. I'd like for more people to be involved. Belby has an uncle who invented Wolfsbane? Get in touch with him. McLaggen has supposed connections to the minister? Get them to investigate Malfoy in book 6.

It wasn't creativity. She copied the ideas of the DA coins from the dark mark.

But I'd argue that the Umbridge/Marietta scenes show a vindictive nature rather than ruthlessness.

Marietta wasn't prevented from leaking the DA, she was just shunned for it. She sent Umbridge into the forest.

Brilliant argument! Similarly, the Wright Brothers weren't creative because they copied the ideas for an aeroplane from birds.

Now, considering that Hermione had only had second-hand information about what Dark Marks did, no real details about how they did it, and no Dark Arts training whatsoever, if she could actually copy ideas based on that, it'd make her a Grindelwald-grade genius. As it is, creativity generally /is/ about synthesising what you already know in novel and unexpected ways.

#+end_quote

That's a statement, not an argument.

Hermione had a goal of getting Umbridge out of her and Harry's way. She manipulated her to get her to the centaurs, whom she knew Umbridge would almost certainly provoke. As a result, Umbridge was out of her and Harry's way. What does vindictiveness have to do with it?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

The jinx punished Marietta every time she tried to give Umbridge additional information. This kept her from saying more than the bare minimum before Kingsley (I believe) was able to Obliviate her. Short of a Fidelius, Potterverse doesn't, AFAIK, offer a way to keep someone from spilling a secret. Even the Unbreakable Vow only punishes you after the fact. So, Hermione did the best she could.

Hermione is unambiguously vindictive /once/ in the whole of canon---when she was romantically jealous for Ron. You, on the other hand, seem to consistently insist on viewing all her actions in the worst possible light. So much for "Avoiding the bashing."

Umbridge was punished by the "half-breed" centaurs she despised. But it was ruthless, and I made that argument in haste, so I'll cede that point. It's actually my favorite scene from Hermione (in the books).

Marietta was not prevented, but rather punished. Read the books. In order of the phoenix, she only stopped talking once she saw herself in a mirror as said below:

#+begin_quote
  I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there. Unfortunately at that point this hex,” she waved impatiently at Marietta's concealed face, “came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more.”

Sometimes I do mess up, although I do interpret her actions in canon as being coddled. Cho, while her relationship with Harry was doomed, had a very valid point about the jinx. But making up scenes or actions that would be out of character is what I would consider bashing. Ron being physically abusive for instance is definitely bashing. Hermione accepting bribe money is bashing.

Not sure what you mean here.

All the dialogue afterwards suggests that the punishment was incremental:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Haven't we got a counter-jinx for this?' Fudge asked Umbridge impatiently, gesturing at Marietta's face. ‘So she can speak freely?'

  ‘Just nod or shake your head, dear,' Umbridge said coaxingly to Marietta, ‘come on, now, that won't re-activate the jinx.'
#+end_quote

Umbridge, in particular, would have been in a position to see how the jinx worked. If she thought that the jinx was a one-shot thing, she would have told Marietta that she had nothing to lose, but she is acting as if it could "re-activate".

It's been a while, but wasn't that meant to help Ron become the Gryffindor Keeper? (It was definitely not an ethical thing to do, but more on the ruthless side than vindictive side.)

If someone had made a flying machine before the Wright Brothers and they had made something based on it, then I would deride their achievement. That they took it from birds is different.

​

So people confuse a bit when I discuss Hermione's talent, as I do dislike the character (a tiny amount in the books due to being used as exposition, and I hate the movie version for stealing lines). I think in terms of logic and critical thinking skills, she's borderline genius, as Rowling said it herself, and we see it in the books.

Magically speaking, she's talented, top of her class, but not to an exceptional degree.

Research wise, she's amazing, although someone once did a fic where the Summoning charm acts like a search engine when the subject is properly modified based on when Hermione summoned the horcrux books, and I think it's hilarious and should be canon.

It's personality wise that I think she's lacking in. She's coddled in canon whenever she makes a mistake. I really wanted a fic where whenever she does something like justify her cat attacking Scabbers, it just isn't waved away. Where when she attacks divination when Lavender's pet dies, it just isn't forgotten.

Where when she attacks Ron with birds, it just isn't treated as "oh her heart is breaking".

Ron is forced to confront his jealousy in canon, I just want something similar for her when it comes to her treatment of others.

​

So no bashing, this request shouldn't be the main plot point of the fics I want, but with good character growth for Hermione.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.
