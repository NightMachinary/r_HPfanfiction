I remember reading this a while ago, I don't think it was completed but it was interesting! Harry meets Draco (I think it was during the sectumsempra bathroom scene?) but Harry is kinda disguised and Draco recognises him as an old god (possibly god of death). I remember Harry being super confused but kinda winging it a bit and I think Lucius gets involved later... Please help if you recognise my ramblings or I'd love recommendations for something similar! ðŸ˜Š
