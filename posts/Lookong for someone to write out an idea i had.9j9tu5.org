We all have ideas, that's not something writers struggle for so it's unlikely anyone will pick this up as there's nothing in it for them.

*** To add to this:

I started my writing career with a similar idea (Harry runs into Luna in Diagon before his third year), and even though that plot never went anywhere, and the next 20 ideas weren't particularly good either, it only took me six months to go from outlining my first idea to publishing my first oneshot. A year later, I've written over 130 thousand words, have more than 3000 combined follows and 2000 combined favourites across 6 stories (4 complete, 2 ongoing).

If you have a decent idea and do not butcher the English language too badly, it isn't difficult to write something decent. But you have to try.

** Sorry to tell you this but I am pretty sure you find several stories that have a loner RavenclawHarry befriending Luna if you search for it on fanfiction.net
