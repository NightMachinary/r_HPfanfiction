  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards
