So, someone in another thread brought up the fact that Narcissa came of age in the late 70s and probably would've tried drugs at least once and now I kinda want to see a 70s John Carpenter/John Hughes meets Boogie Nights version of Risky Business starring the Black kids as they're left home alone in Grimmauld Place for the first time ever and they go absolutely Home Alone-level wild.

So, Sirius, Regulus, Bellatrix, Narcissa, and Andromeda are left alone by Orion and Co who are off to party or trade stamps or something and they spend the entire night getting up to the sort of hijinks you'd expect the Black children to get up to in the late 70s while alone and unsupervised in Grimmauld Place. Could maybe have Lucius and Ted turn up at one point, hoping to get lucky/wondering what the hell that panicked letter dropped off by a slightly charred owl was about.

Please, contribute more teenage movie/70s influenced shenanigans for people to get up to in this story. The more and the wackier the better. :)


** Magic + LSD after smoking some weed means the Black kids are ready to become one with magic.

"Appiration is so easy. Just keep looking until you are there."

"Transfiguration is the doorway to God, I can feel my cells changing."

"My wand is me and I am my wand, it's all so clear now."

"We should cuddle unicorns. Let's go, this will be perfect trust me."

"See, if you cast the reverse of Fiendfyre you get Heavens Grace. The storms will stop eventually, Kent is shite anyways."

"I'm sure it's supposed to make that color, it's magic. Let's add some boggle tail and see what happens!"

"I told you we needed more Shark Oil. It's fine though, cause I'm seeing in sounds right now so something worked right."

"Well no one liked Manchester anyways."

"Okay, so you were right. The London tower looks way better dressed as a giant wang."

"Agreed, no more transfiguring monkeys to fly and giving them bottles of gin."

"Well how was I supposed to know all buses didn't dodge like the Knight Bus? I didn't take Muggle Studies."

"Well it could be worse, sure the lake's on fire but at least we have more booze."

"What the bloody hell! You know what, it's fine. Not even going to ask were you found a lethifold or how you got a leash on it."

"See he's totally not a 'useless blonde ponce'! Let me see you ride a damn Welsh Green! My fiancee is fantastic! "

"Okay, so maybe the muggleborn is alright. I'm not willing to steal a baby kraken as well to prove otherwise."

"I'm sure it will be fine, look how big the Black Lake is. Of course we can, it's got our name on it. We can do whatever the hell we want to it!"

"Alright I'll give you that, enchanting the statue in the atrium to strip dance when you cast a cleaning charm on it was brilliant."

"Okay, pretty sure I've mastered the universe enough, well at least mastered this bottle of fire whiskey, to make a portkey home!"

"Close enough!"

*** I have only one word for all of this - Perfection.

I love the 'totally not a useless blonde ponce' and 'maybe the Muggleborn is alright' bits. Add a nice heartwarming bonding moment to their drug-fueled chaos. :)

**** Glad you liked it. It did kinda make me sad though writing it. I pictured this group of teens who are all family, or dating, and they are just ignoring all the shit in their life.

It's just this night of fun and enjoyment where they leave all the drama behind. Then they grow up and drift away. Always remembering that great night where they were just family having fun.

Like Bellatrix and Sirius didn't want to kill each other, they still remembered being family. Like Bellatrix was seriously distraught inside over accidentally sending Sirius into the veil but had to hide it.

It's this sad broken group that just wants to be family and live happily together like they did on that one special night.

Like I said, it was actually really depressing to write as I went on. Knowing what they would inevitably become and wishing I could make that night extend forever.

***** Yeah. It does have a rather Breakfast-Club-esque Poignancy to it. I think that makes the story better though. Hope and melancholy all intertwined together. It might make an interesting prequel for a "For Want of a Nail" fic - in the Ministry, Harry says just the right thing to get Bellatrix thinking about that night and she swaps sides.

****** The moment before the fighting really breaks out in the Veil Room:

Sirius knew this was not looking good for them. Still he would go down fighting and save his godson at least. Pulling Harry down he turned the boy to face him.

"Harry listen, it's not looking good right now. I want you to promise me you'll get out of here no matter what!"

Harry saw the look on Sirius's face. He didn't think he would survive this and wanted Harry to live no matter what.

Trying to reassure his godfather he smiled and replied.

"Only if you promise to have that drink with me you've been going on about."

Lucius Malfoy overheard Harry's reply from nearby. Smirking he felt the need to let a quip out.

"Potter you're not going to be missing much. Sirius Black was always a lightweight if memory serves."

Sirius barked back a quick 'oi' at Malfoy's remark.

Bellatrix had a one of her few happy memories resurface after a decade of dementors eating at them.

The fighting picked back up and it was getting close on each side. Soon Harry found himself separated from Sirius and keeping Neville from rushing in.

He saw Bellatrix sending out banishers like crazy until Sirius stopped in front of the veil drawing attention. Trying to make time for the kids to get free.

Bellatrix send a flurry of spells at Sirius who blocked them all accept the last red spell. Harry's scream tore from his throat as he tried to reach Sirius.

Instead of flying into the veil Sirius collapsed like a puppet with it's strings cut.

The fighting moved on and Harry heard Remus tell him Sirius was only stunned. Bellatrix and her crew were now retreating as Harry fought them out.

He heard a 'Renervate' and Sirius started yelling behind him. Haru didn't have time to look back or slow down. He pushed forward one step at a time.

After what felt like ages Sirius was by his side again as they battled it out in the Atrium.

Voldemort arrived and then things got intense. The minister and dozens of others had arrived at this point seeing Sirius Black fighting side by side with Harry Potter against Voldemort.

"Harry cover be for a second!"

Harry didn't even think twice and pushed even harder at fighting back Voldemort.

That was until Voldemort got hit in the head with a metallic bra.

Siruis rejoined him right away and laughed.

"Ha! The enchantment still works!"

With the minor lull in the battle Harry looked to see where the bra came from. As did everyone else including Voldemort.

"What the bloody..."

The statue of the witch and wizard were taking off their clothes while dancing suggestively together.

The minister yelled out as realization struck him!

"It was you wasn't it Black! You're the one who added that enchantment!"

Sirius smirked and went back to send a banished at Voldemort who yelled in rage at the humiliation and disappeared with a pop.

They didn't relax though as Siruis was still a wanted man. That was it!

"So minister going to try and call me a liar that Voldemort is back still!? Going to call me a liar again when like when I told you Sirius Black was innocent!? That after *you* arrested him he was thrown in Azkaban *without* a trial!?"

Fudge looked ashen as he realized he was screwed at this point. There were more witches and wizards pouring in the atrium by the second. There was no way he was getting out of this.

"I hereby pardon Sirius Black of all crimes he may have commited!"

There that should give him time to get this all back in order. Yes, that would work well indeed.

****** I wrote it but couldn't see Bellatrix changing sides yet. I could see her focusing on that moment though. It being enough to save Sirius. Enough so Harry doesn't go after her with pure rage instead he is just pushing her back. It gives her room to not have pure hatred for him in her. She keeps recalling that night, comparing it to now.

How many friends she had, how many people they knew. How many were now dead. How few were left on both sides of the lines. How it was all so hollow. She served ten years and it's still the same. More dying, less laughter, less moments like that night.

Eventually it grows to be to much and she abandons the war. She can't handle it anymore. Turning to her sister Andromeda she breaks down.

Evil twisted bitch or not Bellatrix is her sister. She takes her in and cares for her. Bellatrix convincing Narcissa and Lucius to join her as well after Voldemort forces their boy to try to kill Dumbledore.

They pull Draco from school and stay in hiding. Sirius maintains his house and no Death Eaters sneak in.

7th year they aren't camping constantly but eventually destroy the horcruxes and Harry kill LV. Making oaths to put family above all others the gang accept each other again eventually. The Malfoy family moves back to France and takes Bellatrix with them.

At least that's how I would see the over arching story roughly go.

******* Probably, yeah. An immediate swap would be a little convenient. I like the idea that it's the first domino to fall, though. That'd be a fic I'd be really interested in reading.

And I really like the little Malfoy quip. Biting, as befits his snakey-bitch character, but still somewhat amiably poking fun, as befit a reference to a treasured memory. Good balance there, doc.

******** I would love a fic exploring this more. Not something I have the time or inclination for really right now. It would be a good one though for anyone that picked it up.

/Bellatrix sat there in there chair staring in the mirror brush in hand. It was loosely held as she went through the motions of putting her hair back into rights./

/Andromeda had always said there was a special magic in brushing your hair by hand compared to using charms. Tonight, after everything she needed that magic./

It could be epic, really hope someone picks it up.

*** Lupin, maybe, but I bet James wouldn't know what they were. And hey, she could have a supplier. Some enterprising Half-blood with ties to the Muggle World buys drugs there, then sells them to angsty Pureblood teens looking to rebel for a significant mark-up. Hell, for all we know, she took Muggle Studies and experienced a whole module on drug culture, with a practical experience element. You wouldn't even have to be up-to-present-date to study that - Victorians loved Opium and we literally sent care-baskets of Heroin to soldiers during WWI.

Personally, I was thinking that she'd get them from Andromeda. Imagine the shock and awe at the goody-two-shoes having Muggle Drugs, build up her fanon Muggle-loving Rebelliousness.

**** Ok, but what about /wizard/ drugs? Like, what if there was a potion with similar effects to LSD, but also causes the people who drink it together to share hallucinations? Or any other sort of bizarre effect on top of the trip.

**** Yes to everything you said. And people always find a way to get contraband and do illicit things (or at least things they claim to be against). I've got a whole list of American politicians as evidence lmao

I picture Harry getting really excited because he finds some extremely rare and expensive bottles of firewhiskey or whatever in 12 Grimmauld Place only to do a massive spit-take because they've all been totally watered down by the Black kids decades ago. Oh and Andromeda & Narcissa reconnecting not to the point that they're besties but enough that they tell people stories about each other's wild teenage antics

***** Oh yeah. If not the lot of them, then Sirius at least totally emptied the family wine-cellar to drink with the Marauders. That's why he really got kicked out - he stole all the good booze.

I do enjoy the idea of post-war frenemies Black Sisters.
