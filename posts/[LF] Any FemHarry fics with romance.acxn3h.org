  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

  Harriet Potter, displaced in a world where people have strange powers and nobody speaks her language, is pretty sure she's screwed. Until that is, she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children.However, when their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. With assassins on her trail and a new group threatening the just-found stability of the Shinobi world, Harriet may be hard-pressed to create the family that she's always wanted.

  "Kakashi regards her for a moment. “You're not like other civilians.”Hari shrugs. “I wasn't always a civilian,” she admits. “I've never been a ninja, but I've seen my share of combat.”I've seen friends killed in front of me. I've been powerless to stop it.The weight of the world has been on my shoulders, and miraculously I'm still standing.Sometimes I don't know why.I'm not sure if I deserve to.Why me?She doesn't say it, but she doesn't have to."Or, Hari and Kakashi meet when they're both dealing with things, and one night will change everything.

  When Loki's Staff spat out a girl with a lightning bolt scar, HYDRA were not expecting things to go downhill so fast. They certainly weren't expecting their new unknown to run off with the Winter Soldier.
