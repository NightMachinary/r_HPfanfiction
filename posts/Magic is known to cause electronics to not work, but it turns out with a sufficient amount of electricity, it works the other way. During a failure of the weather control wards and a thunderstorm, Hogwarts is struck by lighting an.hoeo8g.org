** The entire premise is an unjustified assertion which contradicts canon.

Electronics don't work at Hogwarts. That could be because there is an exceptional amount of magic there, it it could be because of security spells specific to Hogwarts. There is zero evidence that technology can't work in the presence of any magic, or vice versa, and in fact a lot of evidence to contradict it. Like the fact that cars don't break down every time they drive by the entrance to Diagon Alley, or Mr Weasley's car, or... just too many examples to name, really.

The way the fandom has inflated one line about electronics not working at Hogwarts into "Magic and technology are opposing forces, and even a tiny bit of one renders the other unusable", is one of many examples of how something lifted whole-cloth from other settings has been inserted into Potter fanfic and then repeated so much that a lot of people insist its canon. Its honestly ridiculous.

*** People looking for Harry: What kind of ungodly invisibility secret uberspell is he using to completely hide himself and his friends???!

Harry, Luna, and Hermione: haha high voltage transformer go brrrrr

seriously though, harry seems a bit overpowered in this fic. I hope they give Sauron the death star in the end.

**** Hostility aside, you /do/ have a point. Canon purism is an absolute blight upon fanfiction, not just limiting the creativity and artistic expression of fanfic authors, but actively /shaming/ it, forcing the writers to stay within a box of a poorly-defined abstract concept that can never be truly satisfied in reality. And all for the sake of, what? A cheap status signal that you have better taste than that 'poor pleb' who reads indy!Harry stories and enjoys the idea of a Magical Core? Who /cares/ so long the story is good? Worldbuilding is just a tool for the sake of storytelling--if the OP's idea about the electricity works well within the confines of a story it's told within, what's the point of denying it?

(And I say that as someone who doesn't /like/ the idea of electricity or technology being opposed to Magic. Just for the principle of things.)

**** Nothing like ghosts disappearing forever, portraits losing their consciousness, the probable death of a lot of magical creatures (including sentient ones) and magical plants, the possibility of human deaths if anyone is in the RoR, owls losing their powers, major breaches of the statute of secrecy (from the end of the secrecy enchantments), the end of many spells of great historical or sentimental importance, the end of protective spells, and whatever conjurations are in use disappearing for a fun-filled time.

â€‹

Now that I wrote all that, I'm not quite so sure it'd be fun without making the story completely nonsensical. Probably be better served by a prompt along the lines of "Frustrated with the 7th years tendencies to constantly use magic when they turn of age, Snape forces Dumbledore to implement a policy of no-magic weekends once a month."

*** No, it doesn't.

There is no magical equivalent for the internet.

There is no magical equivalent for space travel.

There is probably no magical equivalent for CPR/life support (magic cannot bring back the dead, but it depends on how you define "dead").

Just three examples off the top of my head.
