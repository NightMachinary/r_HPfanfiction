I've seen stuff like FemHarry and the like being asked about every so many days, there is a search engine; do people not use it? Or forget about it? Why don't you use it? Not trying to be rude or anything, merely curious.

And it's not just FemHarry, it's other ones I've noticed asking similar things. (I know I'm guilty of doing this, but have tried not to ask for things I think might have been asked previously).

Edit I meant the search bar on reddit.


** Because answers from a year ago might no longer be relevant. Some stories start out promising but then take a turn for the worse. Some end up deleted. And there are new stories coming out every day, so a thread from a few years ago might miss some good stories.

*** Alternately, a thread from a few years back may reference a story that has since been buried by too many subpar similar-to-a-search-engine later entries.

** Ironically, you could have used the search bar on this subreddit to find an uncountable number of posts asking this exact question.

*** Actually, that's not a good example because in OPs case the search terms wouldn't turn up anything relevant. There are too many unrelated threads with the phrase "why don't..." in them, and the word "search" pops up in many fic search and request posts. Searching for the phrase "search engine" just turns up posts about how to search FFN and Ao3 effectively.

** Laziness.

Or alternatively, Slytherin-ness. Getting people do stuff for you instead of doing it yourself.

It's the same reason why people on the main sub keep asking why Harry didn't notice the Thestrals until book 5.

*** As an addendum to the "Slytherin-ness" idea:

Some people enjoy the social aspects of technology and will prefer to solve their problems through interaction with real people even when the self reliant method provides faster, more thorough results.

** I used to do that, but after a few times coming up with nothing relevant I guess I mentally relegated search to 'not really helpful' and forgot it existed.

*** I've found that google searching with "site:[[http://www.reddit.com/r/hpfanfiction/][www.reddit.com/r/hpfanfiction/]]" in the search field gives much better results.

** A strange combination of knowing exactly what I'm looking for and not knowing what I'm looking for at all.

For example I'd be looking for a fic which has xyz general characteristics but not fics a4 b3 c7 or d2 because I've already read them.

The older the thread is the more likely I am to have already gone through and plundered it for anything of value.

** Because I have plundered through all those old threads already and read anything that interests me.

I am hoping with my new thread somebody will reccommend me something I haven't read yet!

** Because people want the best ones available and usually only good stories are posted here. If you threw something like femharry into a search engine, you don't get very good stories as a result.

**** I haven't used the search feature on Reddit in ages, it typically gives me a bunch of old, irrelevant crap -- even if I search for an exact post title -- it might be like 10th on the list. Using Google to search Reddit yields better results.
