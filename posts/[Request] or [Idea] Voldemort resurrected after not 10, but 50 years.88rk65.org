Discussion in my latest post gave me an idea.

May be someone can recommend me an already written story. If there's no one, feel free to use the idea for your story if you find it interesting.

Quirrell didn't find Voldemort before Harry's first year at Hogwarts.

Moreover no one found him for about 50 years (or more?). All Riddle's followers are dead, almost no one remembers him. Finally he manages to recruit some weak minded guy and made him perform some Ritual to give him a body.

At that point Harry is more than 50 years old, his years at Hogwarts were pretty mundane without any adventures. After school he had an usual life: got a job, a family and so on.

Let's make it harder: Dumbledore suddenly died at some point from old age, but he didn't managed to tell Harry about the Prophesy, horcruxes, Riddle history and so on.

As result the story starts with Riddle starting from zero and Harry being a middle aged man with the Prophesy still being active, so both of them has to meet at some point. Horcruxes are still in game.

What do you think?


** I really love this idea! The whole thing with Quirrell won't happen, but Malfoy might still give the diary to Ginny. The whole plot of Prisoner of Azkaban would be still there, but then Sirius won't die in Harry's 5th year. Barty Crouch Jr and Pettigrew would still be a problem and the whole plot with quiddich world cup and death eaters attacking will be there. So basically, Harry won't exactly lead a completely ignorant happy life anyway, so his choice to become auror will still be plausible. Then, let's say Dumbledore dies in Harry's 6th year, trying to find proof that Voldemort will eventually come back to life, but for some reason Snape couldn't save him . And this time, there was no need to tell Harry of prophecy or anything so Dumbledore dies without telling anyone of the prophecy. Now only Snape is aware of its existence and the first part, however, he might not be still alive in 50 years time. So, in 50 years, the memories of Voldemort will fade among the general public, but for Harry it will still be more important, since he would have fought basilisk and seen Tom, called boy-who-lived, etc. And if he was an Auror, he might at some point realize just what kind of dark magic was the diary. But he wouldn't know that Voldemort had more horcruxes, I guess. When Voldemort is resurrected, Harry would be the first to realize what is going on(the scar), [daily prophet would call him attention seeker for trying to be relevant again as boy-who-lived...]. I guess then he would realize that Voldemort has more horcruxes, but not exactly how much. I don't really know if the prophecy makes any difference at this point, I believe Harry would fight Voldemort anyway. But might be interesting to see Harry discover the prophecy in the Department of mysteries, and than think of what is the power the dark lord doesn't know about. After that everything depends on finding out about horcruxes, etc. since Slughorn would be dead as well. I imagine it would be an interesting adventure/mystery story, but more like detective, finding out new pieces of information, without any help from Dumbledore. And then, a lot of badass Voldemort - Auror Harry fighting. :)

** I love this idea.

Do you think Harry would be surprised if he wasn't exposed to fighting dark wizards growing up?

I also think that doing it with a Potter child in Hogwarts with the diary first being unleashed would be a really cool idea to explore. Maybe Lucius gives it to Scorpius when he goes

I think that for some time he won't understand what a hell's going on.

Mixing it with Riddle starting from nothing and Harry being an average person (his "glory" days are long in the past) may lead to an interesting plot.

** YEEEEEES! Someone make it from Riddle's POV. It would be even better if wizards are more advanced now.
