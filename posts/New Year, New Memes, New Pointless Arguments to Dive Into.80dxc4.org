** Okay. H/Hr is /not/ the only acceptable FanFiction pairing.

Not only because there are so many fanfiction pairings that picking out any one of them as the "only acceptable one" is a huge insult to writers and readers alike.

Not only because it is very blatantly not canon, and Harry and Hermione didn't have much chemisty in the books.

But because H/HR is without a doubt the blandest, dullest, most /boring/ pairing in fanfiction history. It's the literary equivalent of mayo on white bread, or plain tofu.

Even if we filter out the worst-of-the-worst (Weasley-bashing, OP!Independent!Harry) I have yet to read a single H/Hr story that was even remotely interesting, or kept their personalities from canon.

Hermione especially suffers in this respect; she tends to lose pretty much all her canon personality and just becomes this bland, boring and dull "perfect girlfriend" who does nothing except act like a cheerleader for Harry. Her amaxing intelligence is perhaps paid lip service to every once in a while, but she seldom if ever actually does anything intelligent. All the quirks and flaws she had in canon and that made her an interesting and three-dimensional character are gone, and what's left is a cardboard cutout that makes even the heavily toned-down, more two-dimensional Hermione from the movies seem like a brilliantly deep and multifaceted person by contrast.

Which is why H/HR, far from being the only acceptable fanfiction pairing, is one of very few completely unacceptable ones. :)

There, completely opposite opinion!

**** Lots of arguments in that article are extremely silly anyways. Harry hates the constant bickering of Ron and Hermione. Conclusion: Harry hates argumentative women. Completely ignoring the fact that Harry's super duper soul-mate destined forever-love Ginny Weasley is supposed to be super-argumentative and a firebrand.

Maybe Harry just doesn't like to listen to people arguing? Ever think of that? Same reason why he immediately takes Ron back whenever he fucks up. It's supposed to give us insights into Harrys character, not about his sexual preferences.

It's fucking funny how it also tries to describe Harry as some kind of rebellious, anti-authority teenager, because he dislikes Snape and Umbridge.

That's fanon portrayal, not canon: Ginny in the books never loses her shit /at/ Harry, it's always either in defense of him (against Malfoy in book 2) or when embarrassed in front of him (against Ron in book 6). The closest she gets is in Book 5 when she reminds him that she had been possessed too, and she speaks "coolly".

And Vernon, and Petunia, and Fudge, and Lockhart, and Scrimgeour, and every authority figure from the Ministry or that isn't nice to him at school.

It doesn't really help much when you list more despicable people from the series. The HP universe if full of incompetent and downright vile adults in authority positions. Not even the Dalai Lama would remain calm and placit.

Defying authority in literal life and death situations is also not something that I'd count as rebelliousness. Harry is always quite respectful and calm unless he gets is antagonized, pushed over the edge and throws a tantrum. Rebelliousness is when you defy authority as a matter of principle, which Harry absolutely does not do. He never just 'acts out'.

So anyway, since Hermione goes along with it most of the time, even sets a teachers robes on fire and brews illegal polyjuice potion, I guess she's a rebellious teenager too, right? They are the perfect couple after all! Two rebellious teenagers in luv. What utter bollocks! This kind of literary analysis is the bane of all of mankind. You can interpret anything in a text if you don't take a holistic approach to a character.

******* You are a rebel regardless of how shitty the authority you oppose, because you are still fighting against the system. For example, the “good guys” in Star Wars are called Rebels, because they are fighting against the Empire. I think you're mixing up the actual definition of rebellious and “teenage rebelliousness.” You are making some arbitrary definition.

And yet everyone except Harry /does/ remain placid. Fudge remained Minister for years, Lockhart was a celebrity beloved by all, and nobody could claim that Scrimgeour was incompetent or vile, his agenda just didn't align with Harry's... because Scrimgeour wanted Harry to make the Ministry look good in the eyes of the people.

Then why does he constantly flaunt McGonagalls rules and break curfew with his Cloak? Why does he break into the Restricted Section when he feels he needs to? Why does he 'kidnap' and strip Crabbe and Goyle, stealing their identities and infiltrating their common room? Why does he sneak an extremely dangerous dragon through a school filled with kids when he could have gone to a teacher instead?

I could literally sit here and list every canon plot point, because Harry gives /zero shits/ about authority figures that aren't names Dumbledore, Molly, or Arthur. Yes, he respects McGonagall and other teachers, but never hesitates to disobey them if he feels it's necessary... and he ALWAYS feels it necessary.

How are you not getting this? They are all *idiots*. It's so the children have a reason to do something. If the adults were even remotely competent there'd be no Harry Potter books. Harry would be totally happy being a normal school boy, not doing anything to draw attention to himself. You have to be completely tone-deaf to read this series and come away with the impression that Harry has a rebellious nature. On the lawful/chaotic spectrum he's probably somewhere in the middle.

Because he's worried one of his best friends (Hagrid) is going to get in trouble. He's not doing it to defy authority.

They wouldn't be plot points if they weren't necessary. You don't see Harry skiving class because he's bored, or pulling pranks, shoving teachers into the Black Lake to have a laugh, throwing insults around randomly or anything else a rebellious person would do.

You seem to be under the impression that I think Harry is some kind of authority lover. He's *normal* on that spectrum. His bravery and sense of honor and duty (which is almost the opposite of rebelliousness; even in the army you have to defy illegal orders) just overcome his respect of authority (and same goes for Hermione, who certainly is not rebllious).

********* Enlighten me, isn't lawful-chaotic related to how one feel toward authority-order with no regard to why? Being the "why" the other axis of the spectrum? Harry is seen having no regard toward authority throught the whole series. Despites whatever motives he has. Harry doesn't even blink when breaking rules, and he becomes progressively more rebellious in that regard. Yes, adults in Harry Potter are incompetent but that is precisely why it makes sense that Harry dislikes/is against authority figures. At most, he only complies out of respect for the person, not whatever position he/she represents.

Even though Harry is highly sceptical of a lot of authority figures he seems to hold societal structures and compliance with societal norms in some regard: *He wants to be an Auror!!!* Any player who claims his character is chaotic while pursuing a career in law enforcement would get a stern talking to by a GM and probably a forced alignment shift towards neutral if they persist.

I'd say that not even you are convinced of that statement.

On a more serious note, there are a lot of good stories without an H/Hr main pairing and you are missing out if you refuse to read them. For example "Dignity in Fear" with its superb depiction of emotions or "Call Me", which shits on the "depressed training montage" post-OotP genre.

Hell, there's "The bloody wolf of the North", which is not even an HP-fanfiction, and it utterly hilarious without any Harry/Hermione. Imagine an OP!Harry story but with Jon Snow as the protagonist.

Tl;dr: There's nothing wrong with H/Hr, but there are countless fics which are great without it.

*** Ok, so I read 'Call Me', it's so cringy. The author is always making weird late 80s/early 90s references that feel like they put them in the story to make them look more cultured.

At one point the author tries to make Harry look 'edgy and cool' by having him want to dress up as Kiether Sutherland from The Lost Boys, with bleached spiky hair and a trenchcoat. Not to mention the whole wierd squicky sex theme that the author won't drop, because having a 16 year old being told by her mother to quote "take some condoms from her father's draw" to have sex with her 15 year old boyfriend is really fun to read. That and how her father is cool with them sleeping together, its such a shitty fic.

This is certainly on the side of a more progressive family, but not completely out of the norm in Europe. Unless it is a conservative household parents will be quite happy to allow their teenage daughter to be on the pill or provide their teenage children with condoms in order to prevent pregnancies and STDs.

Parents who think their 16 year old children with boyfriends or girlfriends aren't going to have sex are just crazy. I'd rather face that reality and bury my daughter in condoms.

***** That's why I love the story. It has underage drinking, sex, smoking and all the stuff normal teenagers do. There's no attempt to whitewash the characters or turn them into some weird, flawless über-humans. This approach is definitely better than those American "purity" fics where the characters are saving their virginity for the special "one". I'm pretty sure no teenage boy would turn down the opportunity to have sex with a girl they find attractive, so turning them into saints is simply OOC. Hogwarts is a huge castle with less than twenty adults to supervise it. People will be doing all kinds of things they are not supposed to do, so it is better to show just that than to pretend teenagers are little angels.

My own parents are definitely on the conservative side of the spectrum but my best friend's mother was always open about those matters. Sex, drinking, weed, she knew that her son did those things and yet only made sure that he was safe. Because there is no way a parent could stop a determined teenager from doing those.

****** Different cultures then. I am a German and age of consent around here is 14. Reading about a 15/16-year-old couple doesn't bother me at all, hell, one of my school lectures had a relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 30ish woman (which is actually illegal) and the teacher didn't even bat an eye at the age difference (or the statutory rape). We even watched the movie (rated for age six and above), which had nudity and a sex scene I think (obviously not graphic).

Let's face it here, teenagers have sex, they swear, quite a few drink, smoke and try drugs. It is just part of growing up so it should be included in fiction with characters in that age. The story in question is M rated, so you can expect just that.
