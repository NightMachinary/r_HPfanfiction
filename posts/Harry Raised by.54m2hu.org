Hey, are there any stories where Harry is raised by like the Malfoys? Or even the Lestranges. Or any "dark" family. Id prefer no slash, and for it to be massive (80k+). thanks!

**** Now that just hurts my feelings, but it doesn't tell anyone why you feel that way.

  The Dursleys have never wanted Harry, so when he fortuitously stumbles across a book on Wizard Family Trees, he writes a letter, hoping to find another family to take him in, hopefully one that won't mind when he does 'freaky' stuff....WIP

** This is actually an idea that came to me and I was planning on starting it for NaNoWriMo this year. I have a huge outline for the first year, and summaries for the years after that. My plan is to make it semi-canon compliant, but leave enough changes in there to keep readers guessing.
