:END:
Could anyone recommend a big, complete Tomione with a happy ending (Hermione and Tom together in the end)? Preferably one that Tom is as bad and powerful as in books and does not set aside ideals just for love. I've already read it: Upshare the Stars, Somewhere in time (my favorite), Shared Flame, Building a Mystery and Ultima Ratio.


** Neither of these are complete but these are some of the best Tomione fanfics I've ever read. Honestly they are some of the best fanfictions I've read. Strong plot, amazing understanding of character motivations and well written. The Tom Riddle in both stories are very true to canon and isn't “misunderstood good guys underneath” but very twisted/evil.

Although they are WIPs, I highly recommend them.
