I've seen so many fics with the self made tags “smart” and “independent” Harry. Thing is though, I've never actually read a fic where he isn't one of those two things. Hell even in the books he's those two things! Why do people consistently feel the need to specify those things as if the character has ever been presented any other way?


** Generally, I've found those to mean 'smart' as in not dependent on Hermione reminding him to do his homework and checking it over while 'independent' means he's not 'Dumbledore's man through and through'.

** I like smart Harry tags. Because there's a chance that it will be a Harry who does his own research for homework and doesn't depend on hermione. Canon Harry didn't really put much effort into his schooling. I like reading about a Harry who explores the new world he is in. Smart Harry doesn't always do that, and sometimes does it poorly, but it tells me it might be.

** This is mostly because this stories usually take both concepts to the limit. Smart Harry is basically a Harry who's knowledge outstrips wizards much older, experienced and with more resources to gain knowledge than him at an absolutely unbelievable age. The independent mostly is used in conjunction with Dumbledore!Bashing and deals with a Harry that quite frankly manages to get skills that are far outside a normal or even extraordinary child's gasp in how to live alone and then outright refuses to accept any influence from outsider sources under the guise of not allowing himself to be manipulated. In most of this stories he manages to get emancipated at an age no judge in any part of the world would be willing to allow(and for excellent reasons) using his plot-armor.

** Not for the reasons you listed, but what usually puts me off of those kinds of fics is how badly written most of them are.

More often than not, smart!Harry and independent!Harry go hand-in-hand with Dumbledore-bashing and an 11-year-old Harry who is smarter than the whole of wizardkind put together and politically so savvy it's ridiculous.

** Independent as a tag makes me think it's not going to be a repeat of canon events. And that he isn't drinking the Order of the Phoenix Kool-Aid and following Dumbledore's plan.
