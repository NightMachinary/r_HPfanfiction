** I read the Ever Upward series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1555645]]. Harry meets a snake at the Dursley's, and follows it to run away to a new home with the basilisk. He makes friends with just about everyone he meets, including all manner of beings.

Entirely unrealistic (even for a magical world) and yet I found it exceptionally charming.

Lots of queerness, none of it lewd, but if that's a dealbreaker for you than I would skip it.

Edit: here's the first in the series bc the bot chose the wrong one linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21584935]])

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

Okay, that's seriously long. It's not quite as long as With This Ring, but a full reread of WTR takes me several weeks. And it's all in one book, not split into a series? Wow.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but without knowing a lot more about why I might want to read it, that's just too much to tackle.

** This week I read The Changeling and The Armistice series by Annerb

The Changeling: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

The Armistice Series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017]]

The Changeling is a wonderful character study of a Ginny Weasley who has been sorted into Slytherin and doesn't understand why, what that means about her as a person, and doesn't know how it impacts her relationships with her family members. The fic covers her first through sixth year at Hogwarts as she grows, learns to accept herself, and starts figuring out what she wants from life. The pairing is listed as Harry/Ginny, but it is barely mentioned.

The Armistice series follows up on The Changeling, detailing the summer after the war, Ginny's seventh year at Hogwarts, and what she decides to do after she finishes. The series is firmly Harry/Ginny, with more and more of their relationship focused on as it progresses. The author makes a lot of interesting choices, and the portrayal of post war PTSD is top notch. There are also a lot of good portrayals of post war wizarding Britain and how the problems endemic in their society haven't gone away just because the war is over.

I'd definitely recommend both The Changeling and the Armistice series if you want to read a Ginny focused story.

** One of my now favorites - The Life and Loves of Filius H. Flitwick by PurpleFluffyCat. It is an older, underrated story that explores Flitwick in a way that I never knew I always needed. This kind of story usually isn't my thing at all. It is romance, slash, and earns its mature rating. That said, it is one of the best developments of his character - and of the characters of the others involved - that I have come across, and the worldbuilding is well done. It gets into Goblins, discrimination, and the wider world of spell and charm development.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

** I just finished ink and parchment | blood and bone. It's a Fem!Harry fic where she falls in love with the diary Tom Riddle. The romance is very slow as both protagonists are emotionally damaged and don't know what they're feeling but it works quite well. There's some Dumbledore bashing, but I think the story would have been difficult without at least one antagonist. The fic does something interesting with the horcruxes too. This one isn't creepy as the pairing often suggests and I loved it. It's Slytherin!Harry and Dark!Harry.

I'm reading the Joseph Black companion series, Joseph Black starts Hogwarts late so he is 13 or 14 in his 1st year while Harry and co are in 3rd year.

It's been pretty interesting so far, and you see the events of the series from the background and it gets pretty good in the 3rd Book in this series.

** I just finished reading /Wait and Hope/ and it's prequel, /Beginning and End/. They're a slow burn, post-war, canon-compliant Draco/Hermione romance and I loved it. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for Draco's redemption arc, strong independent Hermione, fluff, and some drama.

  Years. Broken into months into weeks into days---into hours, minutes, seconds---into moments. Simple at one end, complex at the other. In Draco's experience, moments, even when simple, had a habit of becoming irretrievable. Moments grew, stretched, multiplied into ages and eras that defined whole stretches of measurable time. Draco regretted several moments in his life, some within his control, some without: all of them irretrievable in nature. At a certain point, wedged between ‘what-ifs' of his own devising, he'd stopped trying to keep track of those regrettable moments: now and then, pushing and pulling, coming and going, beginning and end. Moments were only moments for just as long. After that, he had no control.A Draco POV prequel to Wait and Hope.

  “Harry,” Hermione began, voice very controlled, but she could feel the blade of panic slicing at her vocal cords. “Why was Draco Malfoy just screaming bloody murder about his,” and the word almost strangled her as she said it, “wife?”Harry's green eyes blew wide. Healer Lucas pinched the bridge of her nose, clearly displeased with the recent series of events.“He was referring to you, my dear,” she said. “That was the other question you got wrong. Your name is Hermione Jean Granger-Malfoy.”Hermione had to be sedated again.

** I just finished Truth, Lies and Storytelling. I usually don't like Dramoine but this take is really nicely written. Grammar and spelling are well and even if it focus sometimes a little bit too much on Hermoine and Dracos sexlive (it's not hardcore smut, I just don't like storys with to much focus on sex) it's a very well written plot.

Summary: After the war Hermione finds a book called Harry Potter. Hermione tries to find out who had stolen their live-story and let out a pretty big part of it: Draco changed sides around third year.

What I liked:

- The story idea of how the magical world and especially Harry and friends would react if the story came out.

- It's a story with a good Draco and without any Weasley Bashing. Don't find much of them, really.

- The take on how magical portraits work
