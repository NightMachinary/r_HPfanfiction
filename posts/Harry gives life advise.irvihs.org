A Fred is sad for whatever reason and Harry stumbles apon them and they need some advice on what to do and harry just straight up has no clue what to say so he starts quoting smash mouth.

"Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running. Didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see. So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?"

Or Harry is giving his wedding vows and he straight up quotes 'I'm yours' by Jason Mraz

"I won't hesitate no more, no more It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me Open up your plans and damn you're free Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing We are just one big family And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved"

I could see this going down and it is the funniest shit in my mind


** Teddy: Uncle Harry, what if I don't like Hogwarts?

Harry: You see Teddy, From the day we arrive on the planet. And blinking step into the sun.

Teddy: ....

Harry: There's more to see than can ever be seen. More to do than can ever be...

Teddy: ...That's from the Lion King...
