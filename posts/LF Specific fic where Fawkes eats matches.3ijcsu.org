I have a vivid memory of a scene in a fic where Fawkes eats matches. He steals them from McGonagall and she complains to Dumbledore about it. At one point Harry and co give Fawkes a bunch of different kind of matches as a gift and he gorges himself on them. Unfortunately that's the only bit of the story I can remember, but knowing my reading habits, it is likely a long fic, is not canon pairings, and almost definitely involves time travel. Can anyone help me out? Thanks.


** Oh I just read this last night. It's Tempest of the Fae by D.Mentor

*** Just finished it, very amusing. I read Faerie Heroes, which was the same premise and enjoyed it as well. Do you know if there are more?

** Now that we know what story it's from, I've got to say that I don't blame you for specifically remembering a scene like that. Sounds very unforgettable.
