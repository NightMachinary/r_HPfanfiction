** For some reason my link didn't work, so I deleted my first post and I'll try again.

Here is my Harry/Gabrielle, it's actually growing quite fast in popularity and people seem to really enjoy it. I am definitely bias but I think it's well written, and it's updated almost every week linkffn(13160344)

#+begin_quote
  Book 1 of a Trilogy. Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

**** Honestly, I would say a VERY LIGHT degree of bashing at most.

He is definitely good Dumbledore in this story.

** Can't really help you on Harry/Fleur beyond recommending letters by TheEndless7 linkffn(6536391)

As for Harry/Gabrielle... if it's decent and it's out there, I've read it. Give me a list of stuff you've read for this pairing and I'll recommend any decent ones you're missing. Same for Harry/Daphne, but I haven't read as many for this pairing.

I will recommend my own for this as well though straight off the top linkffn(13057557)
