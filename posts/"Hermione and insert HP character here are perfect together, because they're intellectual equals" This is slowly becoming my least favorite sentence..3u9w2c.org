Alongside "Harry and Hermione were drugged with love potion."

It's like if a character has ever showed any sign of being somewhat academically smart or hasn't done anything particularly dumb, then the above sentence can automatically apply to them. If everyone who was vaguely smart were automatically compatible with each other in every way, then us stupid people would be even less likely to get anywhere.


** I have no problem with people liking or writing fanfiction that pairs Hermione with other characters. I do, however, have a problem when they try to insist that she deserves better because [Ron, canon Harry, canon Draco, etc] is not her intellectual equal. Reddit is generally very negative towards the f-word, but I'm going to go ahead and say this anyway...that's sexist bullshit. It's implying that Hermione simply cannot be allowed to be the smarter, more successful person in the relationship. The girl is EXTREMELY competitive. It's probably the main reason she was placed in Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw (you know, behind bravery). I have the feeling that Canon Hermione would always be trying to one-up an "intellectual equal"...and therefore, extremely unhappy.

By all means, keep writing fanfiction with other pairings. That's the point of fanfiction. Just don't say that.

*** This is how I've always seen it. Look at how she reacted to the Prince. A /book/ got under her skin. She likes Ron because he's light and funny, while also being brave and loyal. She values her own intellect, how it makes her feel and how it allows her to accomplish her goals.

*** So I missed this post at first, but I'm glad I found it. While I take a little bit of umbrage with the whole reacher/settler dynamic in any relationship (it's just... /hm/...), Hermione is very clever, and is very likely to find herself being the more intelligent partner in most - if not all - of her romantic relationships, should she choose to have them.

By and by, Harry and Ron were keen to admit that she was brilliant, and that's what made the trio so endearing. They valued each other for /who they were./ Totally agree with you on the sexism point, though I'd also say that there's a little bit of intellectual snobbery there too... at least among some of the Hermione fans (not all!).

*** And herein lies one of my big problems with H/Hr as a ship - that Harry is the one who must live up to the standards of the beautiful genius that is Hermione.

HERMIONE HAS CHARACTER FLAWS.

No one seems to notice that yes, she is bossy - and in the bad way, that she is often oblivious to the needs of others, that she holds grudges intensely, and that she lacks certain social skills.

Hermione is a super-awesome character. Her intelligence and passion for doing the right thing make her an incredibly effective friend (almost sibling) of Harry's, and her seriousness and work ethic help inspire Ron to improve himself, but she's not some goddess. She's human, and all the better for it.

Riddle was too forthright. Young Riddle projects himself as innocent and 'I'm just a poor boy'. (How he speaks to Dumbledore and Harry, his designated rivals, is different)

He didn't possess Hermione, at all. Is also attracted to her, inexplicably.

** The comment wouldn't as bothersome as it is if people weren't so inclined to overestimate both Hermione and "insert HP character here"'s level of intelligence beforehand.

Of course she's clever, but not a genius - that is, not on Dumbledore or Voldemort's level. None of the male characters in her (relative) age group have been shown to exhibit that sort of spark, either.

Yes - many of us are disappointed that most of the main characters paired off early on, and it's only exacerbated by the extended lifespan of the average witch/wizard, so let's not lose sight of that.

Do you really want to see Hermione "meet her match", as it were? Write a fic and take her across the globe, or something. Let her spread her wings, and rest assured, she'll fly right into him/her. One can only take so much MisunderstoodRomantic!Snape. Or Draco, even, who is probably the intellectual equal of Harry, at best.

And Ron's sophisticated! He plays chess, lol.

********* A lot of us were taught absolute unwavering respect of the Rules. Rules are there for a reason, follow them. This is often reinforced by being bullied by those who don't follow those rules and being able to go to an authority figure and then being protected by the rules. When Hermione feels that the rules are doing more harm than good, she breaks them, but not without due consideration first. But letting a prefect drink firewhiskey where younger students could see him? There's no good reason to break that rule, besides wanting to have fun, and plenty of impressionable younger students around who could seriously hurt themselves by following that prefect's example.

I strongly identified with Hermione's need to follow rules, they're there to protect me, after all, and many times have done so. Authority figures have protected me in the past, so I respect them for that and trust that they'll continue to protect me in the future.

I can completely understand how someone from a different background could consider someone like Hermione (or me) a killjoy, but I also think it's important to recognize why someone might identify so strongly with the absolute need to follow rules as well.

Edit: Snape has a similar attitude for a similar reason. The rules are there to protect students. Any student not following the rules is endangering themselves and others. Adults often get the most angry when they are afraid for the people they are supposed to look after. Snape swore on Lily's memory to keep Harry safe. How terrifying must Harry's exploits have been to someone who truly understands the potential dangers he could stumble upon? This doesn't excuse all, or even most, of his behavior. But how terrifying must it be for a professor, acting /in loco parentis/, to catch a student out of bed after hours and realize that they truly don't know where all their charges are?

********** I must see Hermione in a different light than both of you. Granted it's been awhile since I read the books, but I don't remember Hermione being so rigid. Yes she often spouts off about following rules but I don't recall her actually going to authority about them being broken. The firebolt is an obvious exception. Even with the potions book she didn't rat Harry out. She also never made any real attempt to stop Fred and George, she constrained them to a degree, but didn't ever run off to a teacher about their shenanigans. I always read her as the conservative friend who gave a token effort to follow the rules but acted as she believed was right.

  But letting a prefect drink firewhiskey where younger students could see him? There's no good reason to break that rule, besides wanting to have fun, and plenty of impressionable younger students around who could seriously hurt themselves by following that prefect's example.
#+end_quote

Lol, are you serious? Ron wanted to /try/ Firewhisky in the Hog's Head, not get shitfaced in the streets of Hogsmead. There were hardly any younger students there, and even if there were, I really doubt Ron would inspire them to drink as well.

Some rules are meant to protect us, yes. Umbridge thought her rules protected students as well. But I don't care about Hermione's rule-mongering as much as the arrogance she displays when she tells others not to break minor rules, and then /breaks major rules/. Simply because it suits her. Even after her own rule-breaking backfires at her (/cough/-furry-polyjuice-/cough/). If I had a friend like that... well, we wouldn't stay friends for very long. You can justify her all you like, but in the end, her character simply comes off as unattractive - especially to those rebellious characters.

*********** I think it's at this point (or very close to it) that we reach the overarching issue: the quiet but no less uneasy schism between fans who think that Hermione carried the Trio, and those who disagree. But that's an argument for another thread ;)

It could be argued that Hermione was just looking out for her friends, or trying to instil a greater sense of social responsibility etc. But it doesn't wash, because - as you've said - Hermione was almost as fond of breaking (not even bending) the rules when it suited her. She's not only guilty of (somewhat) permanently hexing a fellow student, but false imprisonment as well! It doesn't matter who she did it to: just that she did it in the first place.

Of course, this is okay because reasons.

Either way, it all comes down to "Hermione knows best", even when it's how to have fun properly. Hate to sound like I'm bashing the character because I like her, but the way she's often glorified rankles me a little.

********* Underage drinking in front of other teens, many of whom are even younger, and when you are a figure of authority and respect? And when you are expected to be acting as a figure of authority (which I expect prefects are while in Hogsmeade)?

No, that's not "harmless rule-breaking."

Now, if Ron's /father/ offered him a sip of alcohol, and Hermione pitched a fit... that would be much more of a grey area. If it's during a Hogsmeade day and Ron's "on duty," she'd have a point. Arthur would arguably be in the wrong. If it's in the Leaky Cauldron in the summer, she might technically be right, but pushing it.

Anyway, I say ligirl is 100% correct. Hermione is more than willing to break the rules when it's important - she does so very, very early on in the first book! She sets a /professor on fire/ to save Harry! What's more, she was /wrong/ about Snape being the bad guy there! That's /not/ the behavior of someone who is slavishly devoted to rules. No, no, no, not in the least. She respects the rules more than most and is slower to break them than most, but she places things like Harry's safety above them, which is more than appropriate.

And it's no coincidence that the one time she went to the professors about something was the Firebolt. She should have talked to Harry first (friends trust each other, and didn't even try to trust that he'd listen to her), but her first priority was his safety - even more than his friendship with her.

So, no, she doesn't break rules when it merely /suits/ her, she breaks them when she finds it to be the only way to preserve a much greater value - usually Harry's safety, but sometimes the lives and safety of others. And I say that "break the rules when it's necessary to save lives" is exactly the right attitude to have.

Yes, Confounding McLaggen mid-flight is a very heroic act, not at all done simply so her boyfriend could get a position on the team.

You might see a prefect trying Firewhisky at a pub /with no younger students around/ as harmful, but I don't, and so do characters like James, Sirius and Riddle, who would never fall for such a person. Which is the point I'm trying to make in the first place - she's not an attractive character, and her attitude alienates her friends.

Well, you manage to come up with /one/ example - and since we all know that falling in love makes you do dumb things, I hardly think this goes very far in defining her character, especially given the weight of examples going in radically different directions.

Obviously undeage students can come in at any time - since, you know, /they/ did. And if prefects are effectively "on duty" when in Hogsmeade, Ron's responsibility outweighed his desire to have fun with underage drinking.

Would this be the same James and Sirius whom Lily hated for so many years until they (well, James at least) drastically changed behavior to become... more responsibile? Yeah, great role models there, along with Riddle of all people.

Honestly, if you're trying to hold up pre-Lily James and Tom Riddle as people who are more "attractive" as characters and somehow preferable as friends to Lily and Hermione, there's no way that we'll ever come anywhere even remotely close to the same planet as "agreement." James was a toe-rag and Ron often wasn't much better. The fact that James had to change to court Lily rather than the other way around is quite telling, I think.

************ You're comically missing the point. That example shows exactly how Hermione breaks the rules when it suits her, whatever her reason is.

I'm not holding James and Riddle as people who are attractive - this thread is about characters who fall in love with Hermione, and sadly, there are many fics where Riddle and James inexplicably do. /Fans/ find them attractive, and they were attractive in-universe. Is that so hard to understand?

Again, we came into this particular sub-discussion from the premise that Hermione's attitude annoys and alienates Harry, /which it does/. It doesn't matter whether it's justifiable or not - it's simply annoying and unattractive. People don't generally want to hang out, go have fun with someone who expects them to be "exemplary".

**** Yes, during the one time that she admits herself would probably never happen again, she was conventionally attractive. She was "pretty". And a bunch of other girls were beautiful or stunning or some other higher superlative. On 99 days out of 100 (or more like 6.99 years out of 7), Hermione's appearance is average at best, appearance-wise. And then there's her actual character, as Almavet says - not the 'conventional' attractive type of personality.

*** I don't think Hermione was ever described as repulsive, just plain. Maybe slightly better after her teeth were straightened in GoF. Also, part of me thinks that she may have become somewhat attractive in HBP onwards, simply because I don't believe Cormac would have batted an eye at her if she wasn't.

**** I like the fact that Hermione is plain and has character flaws. In fact, that's one reason why I like her character.

I like shipping her with other characters that are imperfect and not written as super sexy and perfect. One of the things I'm most irritated at are people who simply squish two characters together for no reason other than the characters saying "wow! We're so similar! Time to bone!"

On the other hand, I love reading fics where two flawed people find the similarities and affection for each other, and let's be honest, having shared interests is a huge part of falling in love or looking for a long term partner.

Also, if you take into consideration that the characters have survived a WAR, it makes a lot of sense why many marry and settle down with others who went through the same horrors as they did. Being in a conflict like that changes you and as PTSD is apparently ignored even more in the magical world, I doubt that many get much in the way of treatment for it.

Write a pairing well, and I will almost welcome the similarities. Write them poorly and I will exit your story without finishing the first chapter or reviewing.

**** I think she likely always had good bone/facial structure, just bushy hair and prominent teeth that made her look goofy/geeky. I don't believe you'd suddenly become as attractive as she supposedly did for the Yule Ball just by wearing a nice dress and slicking down your hair. It's like those movie scenes where the ~nerdy girl takes off her glasses and is now beautiful, e.g. the Princess Diaries. She was attractive to begin with.
