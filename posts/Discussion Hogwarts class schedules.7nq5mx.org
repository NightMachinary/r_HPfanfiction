How many classes do you think Hogwarts students typically had in a day. 3? 6? I was never quite sure in canon, and I wanted to be at least somewhat consistent when I write the story I'm working on. What do you guys think? I'm leaning more towards 3 a day with maybe astronomy only happening once a week?


** Not counting Astronomy in the evenings, there are four standard class blocks per day. The "standard" class time is about 90 minutes, with doubles being up to three hours. Two blocks in the morning and two in the afternoon.

Your average third through fifth year student probably has at least 80% or more of these class blocks filled, meaning they would have either three or four classes every day.

First and second year students have less subjects and more free time. Sixth and seventh year students have fewer subjects, but more intense classes, so their schedules are probably just as full.

Some reasoning below:

First and second years only take the seven mandatory subjects. Third through fifth years must add at least two of the five possible electives. So most people took nine or ten classes. Hermione was only able to take all twelve with a time turner because of overlapping classes (and I think that there were multiple overlaps) so I would hazard a guess that 10 is the maximum under normal circumstances. (Except Bill, Percy, and Barty Crouch Jr. also got twelve O.W.L.s so that doesn't really make sense.) Once you get your O.W.L.s, you're more are less considered qualified, and the N.E.W.T.s are much like advanced study. Students are expected to drop a number of subjects at this point, especially since they need certain grades to secure a spot in N.E.W.T. classes. I'm not sure there's even a minimum number of classes one must take at this point. But by the time you get to this level the classes you do have probably have way more double lessons filling the blocks anyway.

But let's consider the scenario of years 3-5, where most students will have 9 or 10 classes. Younger students get more of a break and advanced students are just specializing in specific subjects, so these are your years with the full schedules, at least in terms of the number of subjects.

The first classes of the day begin at 9am. There are two morning classes with a bit of a break (probably a very short one) between them, or it's one block if you have a double. Lunch probably begins at noon, since the afternoon classes begin at 1pm. Curfew is at 9pm, at which point students must be back in their common rooms. However, besides the time I'd expect to be set aside for dinner, students need time in the evenings to be able to use the library and study with students in other houses. So dinner has to start pretty early. It actually begins before 5, since Harry once went to dinner early in order to grab some food before a 5:00 detention with Umbridge. Which means there can be only two class blocks in the afternoon.

With five days of classes per week, four blocks per day, that's twenty class blocks up to be filled by ten classes. So then you've got to consider doubles, and repeating classes. If half of the classes were doubles (reasonable since we frequently hear about doubles for the five most "core" classes) and half of the classes meet twice a week (probably a conservative guess considering the frequency at which we hear of the same class on different days), ten non-astronomy classes would fill your schedule. Most students during these years probably have 8 non-astronomy classes, so that would leave you with an 80% full schedule. This is mostly dependent on how many times a class meets per week, so 8 classes could easily fill your schedule too.

*** fwiw, when I laid the class schedule out in excel, the bottleneck was on the teachers. They simple didn't have enough time in the day to actually teach everyone. Like, years 1-5 are split into 2 groups, and then there's year 6 and 7, which means 12 classes for one teacher. Even split up into A and B groups that's not really enough time if the classes are of any significant length as well as the ability to have a "double" class.

**** The one thing I can think of is a two-week schedule, with classes being doubled for one group in week 1 and for the other group in week 2. My own university did this, whatever the reason.

I doubt this is what is actually happening and instead it's probably just another showcase of Madam Rowling not being good at maths, but I figure if one wants to have something that fits and works with just one teacher per subject it's probably the easiest explanation that makes any kind of sense.

**** Well, I did some of the math.

A lot of this is guesswork, since precise times are very hard to come by. Also, some of the books (especially OoTP for some reason) actually mention the specifics of Harry's schedule a fair bit, at least in terms of having X class on Monday morning or Y class on Wednesday afternoon, so I could have tried to come up with more specific details, but that would have taken me a bit too far into the realm of contradictions, since Harry's class schedule doesn't seem to be the most logical thing when you look at it all-together (or at least as much of it as you can piece together). Also, it's really hard to find specific citations of their class schedules, most of that info is randomly scattered through the books in tiny little tidbits, and I didn't feel like taking the time to read through the entire series again just for this purpose.

In addition, the closer you look, the more contradictions you find. There's the example I mentioned of multiple people earning twelve O.W.L.s, despite time travel being required to attend twelve classes. And, there's the fact that there's no way the teachers could simultaneously fit seven years and four houses of students into their schedule without /tons/ of overlapping. If the average subject takes up only two class slots per week (a conservative estimate), even if /every/ class had two houses in it at once, a professor would need to teach twenty-eight classes in twenty slots. Although, come to think of it, N.E.W.T. classes generally have low enough numbers to combine all four houses, so if all of those were fully combined, the number would actually be twenty-four. But we know that many classes took more than two blocks per week (there would be a double and it would happen on multiple days), and many classes only had one house in them. Hogwarts could not possibly have functioned with only one professor per subject.

*TL;DR:* I did the math, but in order to avoid contradictions, at a certain point I stopped doing the math and instead just made some common sense assumptions.

***** Well the 12 OWL business can be explained that they learned the subjects on their own time and you can take an OWL even if you weren't in the class. I imagine a lot of muggleborns would take the Muggle Studies OWL just to beef up a future resume.

Well we also need to consider that you can likely take such tests outside of school, or perhaps in the years between OWLs and NEWTs. There are other possibilities beyond taking 12 classes the same year.

And I agree about the 1 professor per subject bit, but I have always thought that since Harry misses much the final 2 years or so, we simply don't see enough. Perhaps there are TA's or teacher assistants just like in college who sometimes teach or take over classes.

Although JK Rowling's material was full of contradictions and somewhat messy canon, so there is always that.

** So I worked out a whole class schedule for one of my series -- I had to add multiple teachers per department to make it all work, but what I have is four per day for first years, with six total class slots per day total. Once students get to third year, they'll be taking five to six classes a day, depending on their schedule (by classes, I mean class blocks -- some classes are double lessons).

**** I made a table in a google doc with each time slot and which classes were offered during it. Since my fic focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione, all in Slytherin, I figured out the schedule for them. Once I got to figuring out the schedule for the upper years (3rd and beyond) I scheduled some classes at the same time (ie Runes and Muggle Studies). For 6th and 7th year, the schedules are super messy because in my AU there's more class options, so class overlap was figured out depending on which classes my main three needed to take.

** Let's assume that NEWT courses are all combined (Hogwarts loses students and the remainder drop some classes), and all other courses are doubles. Professor Snape, teaching a core class, has 10 lower classes and 2 upper classes. Let's say it's two sessions per week per class. That's 24 sessions.

He can handle 1.5 hours per class. He's got to do about five sessions per day -- perhaps two in the morning and three in the afternoon. And he gets one free period. This gives him 36 hours of lecture and labs, plus patrolling the halls, overseeing detentions, cleaning and maintaining the potions classroom, and so on.

(He could do two-hour classes and not die, but that would be a bit grueling for him.)

Now let's look at it from a student's point of view. Seven core classes as opposed to Professor Snape's twelve classes. Students in years 1 and 2 spend, on average, half as much time in class as professors. Hogwarts needs to double its teaching staff.

Anyway, that would be 14 sessions per week in years 1-2, 18 per week in years 3-5, and call it 12 per week in years 6-7. Split across five days, we're looking for 3-4 classes a day at most.

Ever wonder why the Marauders had enough free time to be pranksters and still become Animagi? Or how the twins managed to make their products while still in school? It's because they had so much free time compared to a normal working schedule.

edit: this does mean it's a bit silly for Hermione to have enough trouble fitting three extra classes into her schedule that she needed a Time-turner. She'd still have had more free time than Professor Snape!

** Here's my headcannon: (Without extra teachers [or handing out rare ministry artifacts nilly-willy], and without inconsistencies like the Gryffs having Divination and Defense alone but being paired with the Slytherins in Snape's class)

For Potions, if years 1-3 have two classes a week, and years 4-7 have three, that adds up at 30 hours for the teacher. (2[hours]x2[sections]x3[year grups] + 3x2x2 + 3x1x2 = 12 + 12 + 6 = 30)

For Arithmancy, it would be three classes a week for all years. (3x2x3 + 3x1x2 = 18 + 6 = 24)

For fourth and fifth years, that would be a full schedule if they've got three electives - in my headcanon, there are some theory classes in Astronomy -, so there'd be 29 classes in a day and 1 at night)

I know this goes against some stuff in the books - but then again, JKR had Umbridge's first class on a Saturday -, but that's the way I made it add up.

We /do/ know that there are at least six slots a day (the first Monday - /cough/ Saturday /cough/ - in fourth year was History, double Potions, Divination and double Defense.)

EDIT: Stupid markdown\\
EDIT 2: Maths mistake, 3x2x3 = 18 not 12.

*** The only thing non-canon that I could find is that Astronomy happens at midnight (Harry mentions it in the first book, I'm pretty sure). Other than that, no one's to say it's not canon, since we really don't have a good basis off of which we can base it on.

** I always go with five hours a day (Sometimes that means five classes a day, and sometimes it means four classes (Like when they have double Potions). Like an ordinary British school.

I had a whole schedule set up for the school once... I can't remember what story it was, but I do have it on my SD Card... :o

EDIT: Found it. I actually did six hours of lessons per day (I always thought it was five like an ordinary British School but I guess I couldn't fit everything into twenty five lessons) but for Year One I gave them four lessons of everything but Flying (Which happened on a Tuesday during fifth period) and Astronomy (Midnight on a Monday, sharing it with the Seventh Years :p). They also get four free periods a week, which I suppose would be Study Hall more than free periods.

I also found out that I only did Year One and Year Six for some reason but I have spaces for all Seven Years. :)
