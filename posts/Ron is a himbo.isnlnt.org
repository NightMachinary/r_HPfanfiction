** What do you mean by it? Do you mean it in a "stupid, but attractive"? Or a "male whore"? Regardless, both are incorrect.

** Ron got good OWL scores, so I wouldn't consider him vacuous.

The real himbo is +Hagrid+, +Dobby+, +Dudley+, +Filch.+ Actually I can't think of one. All the characters that might be arguably considered attractive are usually intelligent. And I don't think the vacuous characters that we see would be considered attractive.
