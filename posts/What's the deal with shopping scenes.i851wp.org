I've been reading some fan fics and I've noticed a lot of hate for the diagon alley shopping scene at the beginning of a lot of fics. I'm just curious why there's such a rage-boner for them.


** My main problem with the Shopping trip chapters is that, just like the "Goblins inheritance" chapters (which they usually follow), they are completely pointless for the story. There is a dramatic principle called the "Chekhov's gun" that states that "/every element in a story must be necessary, and irrelevant elements should be removed/".\\
In canon, Rowling follow this principle, and every Diagon Alley scene she wrote brought something new to the story (introduction of a new characer, foreshadowing of the plot . . .), when she didn't have anything new to say, she just passed the scene (by having Molly buy Harry's school supplies while he does something else). Fanon shopping trips usually fail to add something to the scene, it's just Harry going to a shop, listen to the shopkeeper for a bit and then buying the most expensive item they have, item that will never be used or even mentioned in the story ever again.\\
Now, I admit that, in order to make a world feel more alive, it can be interesting to twist this principle and add some "pointless" things, but I don't think having Harry go on a shopping spree is a good way to do it.

Another problem I have with these chapters is that they are boring. As I said before, they can mostly be summed up by Harry buying expensive things, but it takes foreeeever for him to do it. I don't need to know that Harry chose his trunk among the 10 inside the store, that is has 3 bedroom, a kitchen, a training room and a potion laboratory inside, 3 locks including a blood one and that the shopkeep added a charm to reduce the weight. Just like I don't need to know that his new robes are in Acromantula silk, black with silver embroidery on the sleeve.\\
All I needed to know is that he had bought a well protected trunk with a flat inside, and expensive robes, and even then only if these things have anything with the story. These chapter take forever to read and are just boring.

Finally, they are pretty much all the same. Harry leaves Gringott (where he inherithed 30 Magical House and is richer than Cresus), and then:

- Goes to Olivander to buy a wand (either his Holly one or a "Custom" one with several wood and magical core).
- Buy a Trunk with a full flat inside
- Buy robes in Acromantula Silk (either at Madam Malkins or at Twilfit and Tatting)
- Buy a looooot of books because Harry is soooo smart.

At this point, it really feels like if you have read one Shopping trip chapter, you have read them all.

â€‹

But I think that hate is not against Diagon Alley chapters in themselves, but in the scenes that has the problems I outlined. I'm pretty sure I have read one or two fics where the Diagon Alley chapters really feel like canon and were nobody (or almost nobody) complained in the comments.

*** You forgot the visit to a magical curio shop where he picks up any awesome magical items (Pensieve, magic sword/dagger, etc.) that he didn't get out of his vaults. Usually includes at least one thing the author made up and was like "Harry should totally get this cool thing I came up with".

***** To be honest that does seem like something that should have been done though even in canon. Prescriptions change, especially during puberty.

He really should have been getting new glasses at some point. Also I know she said there was no magic eye stuff in HP, after the books at least.

Still, a handful of people in the entire have glasses. Harry Potter, Amelia Bones (monocle, I think the thing is enchanted) Dumbledore and Rita Skeeter. That's it, that's the entire list of people with glasses in the books.

I'm pretty sure there was some type of eye magic to be had in the Harry Potter world.

Even if not, who the hell wouldn't want to be able to have 20/20 or better?

****** Hopefully some stuff is done, just off-camera. Same as we never really see anyone getting a haircut or going in a bathroom unless it's relevant to the plot, Petunia might very well take Harry and Dudley to the doctor at the beginning of every summer and we just don't hear about it. Just because Harry got his glasses broken by Dudley in the first book doesn't mean he doesn't get a new pair every year.

*** That's a super good explanation. I think you've hit in on the nail with the fact that Rowling uses it as a scene to add something important, but fanfictions often just use it to equip Harry with something to show how 'cool' he is but that isn't important to the story.

I think Diagon Alley feels like an important part of a Harry Potter story, because it's in basically every book - and so people think you just have to have it in there before you get to the school bit, but they don't think about how to use it.

**** Of course, it is important in the books, because it is the first introduction of Harry to the magical world. However, the point of that scene is exactly as [[/u/PlusMortgage]] said, introduction to the magical world, not shopping itself. And even worse are gender-bender stories. If I ever read another chapter (or two!) of Harry shopping for his/her lingerie, I will die. Even otherwise reasonable stories like linkffn(A Fair Life by Rtnwriter) have chapter 6, which can be safely skipped, because it brings nothing aside from titillating readers with Harry buying her bras.

*** Arguably, it can be relative to the plot that Harry, finally having money and opportunity, goes wild with spending because he's never had to learn money management.

Think of it as that scene in the movie "Big," where he gets his first paycheck and it's OVER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS and he thinks he's stinking rich.

** I actually really like the shopping scene and it's sometimes the make or break of a story for me. I like to know what Harry gets so that I can get a good picture of what he's wearing in the story. It's also normally very early in the story and can set the tone for the magical world.

It can be the make or break because it shows the canon divergence in the story's. Ex. Which wand does he get/does he have two; is he getting jeans or robes; does he get a lot of books; what pet does he get; what's in gringots for him (vaults/titles). I think those questions can tell a lot about the story. The author also may take time to describe the setting and do some world building

And then later in the story when things are described I'll remember the descriptions of things such as the trunk or an outfit, and it helps me create a better mental image.

*** the issue is, most of those things end up being warning flags: if he dosen't have loads of titles, then that's same as cannon, so the Gringotts scene isn't needed. and loads of titles is a warning flag to most.\\
if he has a different wand, very well, but if he has a custom made wand, it's nonsensical, because, as Ollivander says over and over again: the wand chooses the wizard.

Honestly, i've only once seen a shopping trip being done well enough that i haven't gotten bored of the story partway through the shopping trip, and that's linkffn(make a wish).

** I like (well written) shopping scenes because I love world building. I'm always excited when an author gets creative in expanding everyday magical life since Rowling really didn't. Lots of the shopping chapters are the same but every once in a while the hit the immersive mark. Can't think of Harry ones atm, but the Alexandria Quick series and What's her name in Hufflepuff have creative magical community scenes. I know they're lots more that I can't remember.
