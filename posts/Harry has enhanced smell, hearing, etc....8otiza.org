Any stories where Harry has senses on a level similar to Wolverine(X-men), and it's not just a party trick. What I mean is that it's actually useful, and continuous, and not a one-off. I just really like the idea of him taking a sniff downwind of a hallway, or in the hocrux hunt, and knowing who/what is there. If he has some enhanced reflexes, speed, and strength that'd be cool, but the senses at least, and they have to help in the story.

The more words the better.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Hmm...I know I've seen one before where Harry had hypersensitive senses after being exposed to the Cruciatus or something like that. There was a bit where he mistook his heartbeat for footsteps, and nearly deafened himself when he tried speaking. His senses were acute enough that he could sense what was behind doors and hear people speaking from far away.

...I don't remember which fic it was, though. Or if it was a one-shot.

** It's not central, but this reminds me of how, in linkffn(The Accidental Animagus), he can use his cat form's enhanced sense of smell for tracking (and does).

** Pretty much Blindness Linkffn(Blindness).

Aside from the obvious enhanced sense of touch, hearing and smell that many blind people develop, Harry possesses what he calls a form of mage sight. To give a very underwhelming explanation, it lets him see magic. If you are Naruto fan, its basically the sharingan but for magic instead of chakra. And this gives him incredible insight into practicing and controlling magic.

Mind you he gets OP halfway through, just so you are aware.

**** I've always tried reading this story, because it has a lot of what I like(including a few tropes), but I could never read that far in. I don't know if it's the style of writing, pacing, or something else, but it just never really clicked for me.

***** Brennus has kind of a weird style. On the one hand, he uses the same spells and magic repeatedly, he falls into the magic-is-energy trope, and he writes most of his stories in that way where most of the major characters look like idiots except for a couple fic (and I'm not even sure its meant as bashing either, its odd). On the contrary, he tends to have good banter and dialogue. Ironically, the best part of his Harry Potter fics are the parts that don't include magic. Hail Odysseus is a bit unique, its a Slytherin!Harry fic, but him being in Slytherin is probably one of the least important parts of the book. Also, he tends to make stories where both he and Ginny (always Ginny) are both noted as powerful, which is a gripe I have with a lot of OP Harry stories (no one is on his level except maybe Dumbledore/Voldemort). Honestly, I prefer it when he becomes skilled/powerful, but its by taking advantage of what he has in canon: quick-thinking, creativity, and fast reaction. I can only name a few that really capture that.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
