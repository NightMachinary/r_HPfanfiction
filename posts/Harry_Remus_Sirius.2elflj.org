I found one fic with all 3 and id love more, but im really hoping for Harry/Rem or Harry/Sirius specifically :)

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading


** Depends, are you okay with pure smut? Maybe a little smut? No smut at all?

I can rec fics for days of those pairings but I don't know if you like smut or not.

*** If you're offering I'm totally okay with smut, as long as it's got a decent story behind it :)

** OP, I'm not sure if this is your type of thing but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]] is a pretty good long fic (400k+ words) between Sirius/Lupin at Hogwarts. It follows their relationship almost exclusively and heavily features Lupin's lycanthropy and Sirius' family. Just finished reading last night, absolutely loved it.
