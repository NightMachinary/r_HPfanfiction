I'm currently working on a Slytherin!Harry fic with only a single change to canon... Draco doesn't make an ass of himself when getting fitted for robes. This leads to him properly befriending Harry. I was wondering if the HPfanfiction reddit was a good place looking for people to help with Fanfiction construction and for people that have extensive knowledge of the Canon. I'm no slouch but I like having second opinions on things.

*** I do try to make things interesting without going all Mary Sue territory... Sometimes I do have to scrap ideas because they are just too... "Perfect" in world.. I like making Harry arrogant, I like having him more reserved than Canon. He's conflicted about the people he calls friends, because of the first war. He's upset about the rest of the world looking to him as some sort of savior hanging out with "the wrong sort". He's weary of Dumbledore instead of trusting and compliant. I try to make it so that anything and everything that happens happens as it did in Canon unless Harry being in Slytherin could/would affect that.

**** Don't bother sticking to canon. Most people who've read fanfic knows exactly what happened as canon, and would as such likely skip sections that merely reiterates canon from a slightly different viewpoint. Well, I assume so. I generally just avoid fics like that altogether.

Instead, butterflies. Butterflies are the bread and butter of good fanfics. We want to see how you can twist canon until we can recognize what's going on, but don't know for certain what's going to happen next. See if you can put in a scene where something seemingly irrelevant is discussed, only for it to have huge consequences a year or so later. Have Lucius discover how the Dursleys treated Harry (but avoid blowing it out of proportion), and use that to discredit Dumbledore, rendering the dairy forgotten. Instead, do something like having Harry stumble across the Room of Requirements, and have one of his friends put on the Diadem, and carry out an old plot of Voldemort's. These are just examples, mind.

By all means, focus on how your Harry differs from the one in canon, but make sure that you don't leave your readers bored in-between divergent moments, and most of all, keep them guessing as to what actions will change things utterly, and what will end up the same, despite all the butterflies.

** When it comes to discussing canon, you're definitely at the right spot.

When it comes to discussing Slytherin!Harry, yea... maybe. Not the most original thing, so enthusiasm might be low.

If this is becoming a Drarry, you may want to change forums. As far as I can see, there aren't much fans of that here.

But for some reason I just can't stand Draco/Ginny. I don't care if others like it. Everyone has their preferences but I just can't read it and I don't know why.

** Feel free to post a link to a Google doc with your first chapter. Or PM me if you'd like. I'm always up for reviewing stories.

I've gotta say, though, that this:

#+begin_quote
  Draco doesn't make an ass of himself when getting fitted for robes. This leads to him properly befriending Harry.
#+end_quote

doesn't follow for me. Even if Draco hadn't shown his bigotry so early in Madam Malkin's Robes For All Occasions, it wouldn't have mattered. Draco was quite cruel to Ron on the Hogwarts Express by mocking what was most important to Harry: having a loving family. I /really/ liked this scene in PS because it showed us something unique in three very different characters in a wonderfully concise manner. Draco demonstrated that not only is it important to him that a person be of 'proper' lineage, but they should /also/ have the 'right' views on what makes someone worthy of being a member of magical society (e.g. being a bigot). Ron got embarrassed at his family's poverty and angry at Draco's taunts. Harry rebuffed Draco's attempts at friendship thanks in no small part to his experiences with another bully: Dudley Dursley.

You're going to have a very difficult time convincing the reader that Draco and Harry are capable of being friends in a PS divergence.

*** I feel like in the right circumstances, if Draco and Harry became friends at Madam Malkin's Robes, then Harry might have been looking for Draco on the train and never met Ron until after the sorting. By that point, Harry would probably be a Slytherin. Even if Harry realizes Draco is a bully by that point, his house is set. Or maybe Ron comes across as the bully because Harry is more sympathetic to Draco.

I'd read that fic. Harry seeks out Draco on the train, but doesn't find him. Listens to the Sorting Hat telling him he could be great in Slytherin + Draco just went there...and then he finds out that Draco's a jerk, and people like Ron don't want to make friends anymore because he's a Slytherin.

*** Well, that would be an interesting idea though. What if Dudley hadn't been a bully? Assuming he picked up that behavior from his father, that's where the "one change" would need to happen. The Dursleys as a whole could have simply completely ignored Harry (thus keeping him with an undesirable home life) and that could give [[/u/Dezmar-sama][u/Dezmar-sama]] enough wiggle room to alter/enhance certian personality traits with Harry. It could also allow for the thought of, "Maybe I just wasn't worthy? Perhaps Draco can teach me how to be worthy." Or something.

Eh, I'm not certain Harry would ever have this thought. It seems sycophantic and I think that would be OOC for him. On the first train ride, we see that Harry is capable of disagreeing with bullies right to their faces, even if he's outnumbered. That tells me that Harry would rather risk losing a fight for speaking his mind than cave in to conventional 'wisdom.'

I think your other point about Dudley's early behaviour has a lot of merit. It's one of the small things an author could change early in their AU divergence that would drastically alter how Harry Potter tackles conflict. I don't think that a less confrontational Dudley would make Harry willing to give Draco's worldview any credence, though. At that point, would he still be Harry Potter?

***** But, if Harry has no practice in defending himself from bullies, would he be less willing to argue against those with conflicting ideals? This Harry would have very little experience in confrontation, after all.

In the AU I described, I think it would be normal for a child to desperately just want his family to /notice/ him. To finally stop ignoring him. This trait can manifest differently depending on how the OP would like the direction to go, but it's not a far stretch to presume that a naive Harry could believe more power = more likely to be noticed. Though, I agree that Draco's bigotry would probably still make Harry angry. You're right on that. Even in this scenario Harry would want to prove that no matter his heritage or history, he can still be worthy of attention and friends- even if he is unable to vocalize this at the time. Hm. Unless Harry is more politically inclined and sees that being friends with Draco is an easy tool to gain that power he desires? That would need a whole other butterfly though and I'm pretty sure it's been done before.

I agree that this could be a compelling motivation. It might lead to a very different Harry who uses the bigotry of others to bring about reforms. This would be difficult to do, though, as the protagonist is still eleven-years-old and I can't imagine magical Parliament bending to the whims of a Hogwarts student. Harry has also never shown much of a drive to seize power, so he'd need an extremely compelling reason (e.g. imminent threat) to have such a drastic change to his canon personality.

** Right now you've got the barest idea, so your next move is to think hard about what interesting changes come from that moment of divergence---preferably ones you haven't read before.

I try to stick as close to the canon /tone/ as possible, because that's part of what I love about the books, but you kind of have to stray from the canon plot when you do one of these divergence fics, just because other people have already covered the ground on any of the common points.

I don't read Draco-centric fics because I don't like the guy, so this may be extremely common. But the question that comes to mind for me right away is: This doesn't make him any less of a bigot, right? Harry is much more likely to be the one influenced by Draco than the other way around since he's the one being assimilated into the culture, which means your heroes are both bigots. Which is interesting, but I don't see how you get to very many canon plot points with such a different Harry. So every time you're about to rope a canon plot point in, think, "Is it really possible for this to happen with my characters as they exist now? If it isn't, what happens instead?"

Don't underestimate this: /Nearly everything/ is affected by this change. If nothing else, on a very basic, cynical level, JKR relies on Hermione constantly for plot advancement: Much of what happens is driven by Hermione being a smarter, more driven researcher than anybody else.

Sure, you can just make somebody else a really smart and driven researcher, but at that point why diverge from canon at all? How would Harry and his complacent, drawling Slytherin friends reach their goals, and how would those goals differ from Harry, Ron, and Hermione's?

** Remember, you don't have to follow canon completely in things that normally wouldn't change despite the divergence. Not all of the horcruxes must be in the same place, or only destroyable by the same things, and the obstacles in the Philosopher's Stone don't have to be the same. This is one thing which 99.99% of fics ignore, and it's just a canon rehash with different characters and relationships then.
