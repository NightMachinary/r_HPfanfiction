I read in alot of Fanfictions that Harry cooks alot, I wanted to take a spin on this cliche by him having dreams of being a Chef. I had the idea of him mixing certain potions while cooking to give food different effects. Are there any fics that have Harry as a Chef.

  After a life of war and adventure, all she wanted to do was live a fairly quiet existence running her little café and avoid inquiries on future children from Mrs. Weasley. She didn't expect Tony Stark to wander his way into her life and decide to never leave. FEM!Harry/Tony Stark

  Magic is about intent; so when Harry unconsciously starts pouring magic in to his cooking, he creates something magical no one can resist. At 16, despite being the owner of a 5 star restaurant, his life is normal...until Tony Stark appears with his band of misfits and refuses to leave. Gods, magic, prophecies, bonds, Harry's life will never be the same ever again. SLASH.

  The first time that Harry met Tony Stark he was just about to close his little bakery shop, Bite Sized. The second time Stark came to the bakery he brought along a pretty redhead that had a phone stuck to her ear and seemed to be trying to placate someone on the other end of the phone. Tony/Harry. Slash. Drabbley.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year

  *The reports of the Doom level of this cookbook are greatly exaggerated! Harry Potter wrote a book. It's not what anyone expected. He has revolutionized cooking by combining potioneering and cooking by utilizing the skills of a potioneer in a kitchen.

  Just as he finishes one war to save his world, Harry is literally pulled into another. The trials of living in Zuellni aren't as bad as back in England, but the Contaminoid threat will rear its ugly head. Harry has to fight to protect what he holds dear, but that is nothing new. A certain silver-haired manipulator just has to be put in his place first.
