**** This story is kinda like Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus. Both stories seem to me moving towards some randomness without any specific goal.

The original super!Harry fic. Features Harry/Ginny (very little fluff, it's a fun romance), OP!Harry and crazy shit happening all over. Voldemort appropriately grows in power, to keep things interesting.

  *Completed* Harry's fifth year and he's just been chosen by the Order. Kinda strange, especially since the only living member in the Order is Harry! New powers, new friendships, new relationships and old enemies. H/G and R/Hr.
