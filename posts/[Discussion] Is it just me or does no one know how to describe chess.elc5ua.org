"You need to play more aggressively", "It was time to move forward to take the offensive" "He needed to fall back into a more defensive position and wait for an opening"

Am I just not versed well enough in chess and these are all legitimate things to think/say during a high level chess game? It sounds more like something out of a League of Legends match. Sometimes I imagine in my head wizards chess is really their name for Warhammer 40k


** Probably which is why I leave it at some version of 'they were playing chess. Harry was losing and the pieces were yelling at him.'

*** The difficulty of describing strategy games like chess is made even more apparent in the Hikaru no Go fandom. It's the awkwardest thing, reading works where authors fail to describe how the game works when its central to the story. Describing chess is hard enough when you have pieces with individual names to help convey what's happening on the board, but then Go doesn't even have that. Most writers probably haven't even touched a Go stone nor understand how to play it, at least most people know chess. And since HikaGo involves high level professionals, authors need to use annotations, though few do.

***** Hmm, the fandom's fairly dead, and there's not much activity. I can't remember which are the best fics, and there's very slim pickings so what's there isn't amazing to more developed fandoms, but I'd say linkffn(Hikaru no Ghost) is decent, there's a lot of works by esama (who you may know for Business and Island of Fire, both fantastic) who is also a great writer for HikaGo, though I haven't read many of their works because I felt like reading fem!Hikaru at that time, there's also a lot of solemn, one shots out there that are good, and I would recommend linkao3(A kid like that? by Amber_and_Ash). I'd also recommend linkao3(Affection by Veltpunch) which is a K-pop minor crossover, though I fear it may be dead given the tragic state of f(x) in real life, even though Hikaru has already left them.

The show was definitely well researched, and the manga had Yukari Yoshihara 6-dan as the advisor, though she was only a 4-dan for most of the manga's run and later a 5-dan in 2002. If you want to read or watch other strategy game manga/animes, I'd highly recommend March Comes in Like a Lion, which is an amazing series about Rei, a 17 year old shogi player. It's not as focused on playing games as HikaGo, and a lot is focused on his mental state, but everything is amazing. I believe the advisor is Manabu Senzaki 9-dan, so the games are well thought out, and he also provides commentary at the end of chapters.

*** Would you find a fic that went the complete opposite way entertaining? The banter, the narrative description, the 'action' description all talking about Chess in the same way that you'd talk about an aeroplane dogfight to the point that you're half expecting them to announce checkmate like Darth Vader? "I have you now..."

** I want someone to go in detail for a chess match. And then halfway through, swap to describing a completely different game. And transcribe the final lines from the exodia match of Yugioh. Then swap back to the end of the chess match.

You know, to make sure people are paying attention.

** I have an interest in chess -- not enough to spend hours on consulting openings or playing in general, but enough that I play once a week-ish at a local chess club.

Yes, they're somewhat legitimate sentences. Chess just happens to be basically impossible to make sound exciting, especially to people who don't care about it (aside from blitz, which I'd imagine can be fun to watch even if your chess knowledge only goes as far as "knows how the pieces move").

Even as a chess player (kinda) myself, I would never bother going into detail when describing chess in a fic, except maybe for fics where chess is a major focus (what about a "Ron the Chess Champion" fic?), beyond "they played chess, Ron won, the end".

*** A troupe of house elves brought forth an assortment of coagulated dairy products arranged enticingly on large silver platters.

"Cheese!" exclaimed Ron as he grabbed a passing cake sized slice of Gouda and bit into it.

"Ron can you please stay focused" Shrilled Hermione, "Hogwarts is keeping /slaves/ Ron. /Slaves/!"

"Well letting all this cheese go to waste isn't going to help them." he muffled through a mouth full of sage derby streaked with Avada Kedavra veins as he stuffed camembert into his pockets.

**** This made me think of the story, Schooled, where the students write porn as a prank and Ron mixes up the words /frottage/ and /fromage/. So he basically writes porn about cheese and so the other students make sure he always has cheese with his meals.
