:END:
Hello

I'm looking for a fanfic that I read a few years ago. In this fanfic Harry buys a house in a muggle neighboorhood. He learns about magic and summons demons.

I think he was gay and owned a bakery shop or something but that could be a different fic.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year

**** Started reading this because why not.

And then I got to the part when he chose red walls and black accents for the kitchen and dark olive green for the living room of the house he just bought. And I got irrationally angry, because that's what my kitchen and living room were done in when I bought my current house.

And holy shit was it awful. Maroon walls in a kitchen? What the hell - don't do it!
