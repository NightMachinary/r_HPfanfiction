I'm searching for fics that have Ginny as a main character, and with her 1000% more interesting than canon. I just finished linkffn(The Changling by Anneb) and want fics similar.


** I recently read the [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=360][Thorny Rose]] trilogy and it has a manipulative Ginny. The first one is a bit weird in its attempts to show how "THINGS GETS REAL, REAL FAST" but it's a fun read.

Other than the Ron bashing (which gets better) I think its main problem is that it's mainly a shipping fic so while its Ginny is fun the possibilities of a character like that are not explored as fully as I'd wish.

*** Currently re-reading it for the 4th time. Definitely one of my favorite fics out there. It's a pretty upbeat story, easy to read, and the Ginny POV feels like a fresh breeze between all the Harry POV's and her character is well thought out. If you haven't read it already: I recommend it!

  Something is 'wrong,' with Harry. He's hearing voices. or rather, a voice. Its telling him he's been on the wrong side since the beginning. Harry doesn't believe it. But for how long? Dark!Harry, eventual HP/LV slash. Don't like don't read. Complete with epilogue. Sequel up.

** I feel like this should be a topic I could recommend you tons of fic but even though she's one of my favorite characters there's not a lot of fics that focus on her and manage to be well written at the same time.

I have an old fic though that is pretty amazing. Warning, the sequel was never finished even though I wish for it every day :'(. I'd still recommend you read it though!

Set after OOTP, Ginny comes to a conclusion about how she can best help fight the good fight: by pretending to be pulled over to the dark side. With the help of her mentor Severus Snape, she will use all her cunning, skills and feminine wiles, to become the Order's other double agent, with the goal of causing mayhem amongst the dark forces, and maybe bringing a certain someone over to the side of good. Published: July 13, 2003 (between Order of Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince) - Updated: January 4, 2004

Huh. I finished reading this just an hour ago. It is interesting, but I cannot call a story which has a premise of "Character suddenly embraces his/her Slytherin side" a genuinely good story. Still, the words flow smoothly and the author avoids the Super Mary Sue trope, so it is a decent read and the sequel was promising.

Allegiance has nice character interactions and the conflict within the weasley family is done believably well. Unfortunately, the plot is a rehash of canon and Draco is whitewashed. Not bad, but not all that good.

Thanks for your comments though, I see you around a lot and always appreciate your recs and commentary.

I like Ginny, but I am quite choosy when it comes to fanfics, and moreso when it comes to Ginny. For a character who doesn't seem all that complicated in canon, she is surprisingly hard to write, and fanfics which get her character voice and humor down perfectly are rare.

So am I, actually. The only story from FictionAlley that seems to get rec'd is /The Paradigm of Uncertainty/, and the rest of the site is forgotten. I'm currently looking into The Silent Siege by [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/swishandflick/][swishandflick]], which does hold promise.

** Hmmm. Here are some interesting characterizations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4774376/1/Fire-Ice][Fire & Ice]]: /Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. Ginny Weasley burns for revenge and Tom Riddle is frozen in time. When two forces of nature collide, destruction is assured./

A Ginny travelling back in time to kill the teenage Tom Riddle is quite interesting indeed. She is driven and fully dedicated to her task, and I like that.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260&chapter=1&textsize=1][Curse Breakers: The Maya]]: /Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter./

Ginny is characterized as a very competent curse breaker. Curse Breaking as a branch of magic is done really well, as is the exploration of the Mayan civilization and revelation of past events. This is one of my favorite Harry/Ginny pieces.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11128944/1/the-albatross-did-follow][the albatross did follow]] also has Ginny as a curse breaker, though that isn't really the focus of the fic.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=12266&chapter=1&textsize=1][Counting Till Five thousand]]: /One decision leads to an army of consequences, and a lifetime is not too long to spend amending them./

Er... Saint!Ginny. Literally. Wait, don't run. It actually does make sense in context. Harry gives in to Ginny's demands to take her on the Horcrux hunt, and it leads to disaster. Ginny feels responsible and spends the rest of her lifetime trying to atone. A beautifully written tragedy, though I doubt everyone will like it.

** Imho, the best Ginny fanfics generally feature her and Harry as a "killer couple", with lots of sex and violence. Here are some completed samples:

Aspirations, linkffn(4545504): the most evil Harry/Ginny characterization I can still find enjoyable, utterly ruthless, and very successful at that. One dead character made a comeback.

The Bonds of Blood, linkffn(5435295): lots of sex here, in fact a little too much for taste in the second half, but overall very interesting story.

Unspeakable Things, linkffn(6473434): written by the same author as "The Bonds of Blood", interesting characterization of Luna.

Harry Potter and the Godric's Legacy, linkffn(5270746): powerful Harry/Ginny, bad Dumbledore, and no horcrux.

Hail Odysseus, linkffn(10645463): Slythrin Harry and Ginny, uncommon ending.

My Slytherin Harry, linkffn(6160345): it's short, but very enjoyable; no horcrux, and kind hilarious how Voldemort went down.

** Charmingly-holly has a couple entertaining ones that are heavy on humor.

linkffn(Good Morning is an Oxymoron, Usually)

This is just a short one shot but it gives you a feel for her style of writing and I thought it was pretty hilarious.

linkffn(Quick, Grab the Cheese Wheels and Run!)

This one is novel length but a similar style/Ginny characterization. Both worth reading imo.

  Ginny Weasely is stuck as Maid of Honor in two separate, highly unconventonal weddings. She's none too happy about the situation, as it only reminds her that she is Without a Wizard. To top things off, she's hungry, and she's not allowed to eat her hat...

  ONESHOT. Ginny falls into a toilet. Harry helps her out. That's how the morning started. Who knew it could get any worse? Title supposed to be Good Morning is an Oxymoron...Usually.
