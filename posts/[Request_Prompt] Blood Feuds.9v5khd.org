There name, forgotten to the conflict stiring in there blood

There mind, non existent unless focused upon the goal declared by the blood the binds them


** There is a blood fused fanfic on AO3. Though it's a Batman crossover. Pairing is Hermione with Bruce Wayne. But Hermione declares blood feud on Malfoy and other death eaters to eradicate their family lines.
