I don't remember much from it but it basically follows the events of the seventh book from Draco's perspective. There is also an apparent self-insert Mary Sue at the beginning (you know the mysterious girl that comes to Hogwarts due to circumstances and all the boys try to get her), but as she develops a relationship with Malfoy, Draco starts finding her more and more annoying until he actually goes for Astoria.
