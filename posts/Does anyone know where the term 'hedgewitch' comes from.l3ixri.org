Basically the title.\\
Does anyone know where that term comes from? I have now read a couple of fics where 'lesser' witches and wizards were termed as hedgewitches. They are usually just above squibs in terms of power and thus do not go to Hogwarts. They sometimes have their own Hedgewitch Academys (or similar), but not always.

Power Levels (in fanfics) usually:

1. Muggles (cant see anything magical/ potions dont work)
2. Squib (can see Magic, can use/sometimes make potions, cannot use a wand, are usually excluded from the wizarding world (or even killed) and live in the Muggle World, a shame on their families)
3. Hedgewitches (can do lower level magic and use a wand, but no refined powers, have their own academies, have their own culture away from the wizarding world sometimes)
4. Witches and Wizards (can do most magics, use a wand, go to Hogwarts, etc.)
5. Mages, etc (high 'Power level', strong spells, need extra training, (usually Harry is one, and Dumbledore, etc)

I was wondering where this came from. I was especially interested, once I realised that I read about them the first time (conciously) and still knew what was meant.

So where was the term coined, and why is it so common?


** The term comes from either real life history, modern paganism, fantasy novels, or some cross contaminated mix of all three. I can't find any actual source for the origin of the term, but I've seen it used in all three of those contexts.

*** That sounds plausible!

I tried googling it as well, and there were a lot of things that came up, so I wasn't sure how it came to be in Harry Potter fanfic :D

** Hedge Witch is a term used during the middle ages for a person that lived on the edge of a community most near a forest away from town with a Hedge row of bushes fencing their property away from others.

They were the healers and wise women of the community. They had gardens and used home remedies that were taken as witchcraft or magic but were put up with because they were so helpful. It was only after the church of england wrote the pamphlet on how to find and kill witches that they ended up being hunted instead of beloved by their neighbors.

** A bit of digging found references in fantasy gaming and literature at least back into the 1980's- in particular early editions of Ars Magica (c. 1989) refer to Hedge-wizards as an NPC archetype. One discussion suggested that it derived from Elizabethan term 'hedge clergy' referring to uneducated rural priests.

*** Oh thank you! I will have to check that out!

I think it is interesting that the term 'hedge' in some parts seem to indicate some one uneducated and in others someone who just lives behind a hedge and is actually wise :D

**** Well the local wisewoman behind a hedge is uneducated, she didn't go study medicine, she's just using folk remedies passed down the generations which vary wildly in effectiveness (IIRC some actually used plants that we derived modern medicine from, but there's also nonsense mixed in based on incorrect understanding of how disease works).

** Maybe a connection to The Magicians? They have established magic schools and hedge witches who kind of exist outside of this institutional stuff. I mean it's not the origin of the term but the idea could have found its way from there into some Harry Potter fanfics.

*** My thoughts exactly. I would add wizarding families to poor to attend a formal school. Even with the weasleys being considered poor they where still able to afford to send their kids to school. From what I've found 1 galleon is about $10 US and a wand is roughly 17 galleons [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/andyneuenschwander/mo-galleons-mo-problems]]

Highlights

  a) Hedge witch is a term coined by Rae Beth in her 1990 book /Hedge Witch: A Guide to Solitary Witchcraft/. It describes a solitary practitioner of a Wicca-like religion. According to Beth :

  /This is rather like the old-time village wise woman or wise man: one who ‘knows' and worships the Goddess and her consort, the Horned God; one who practices spellcraft for the purposes of healing and teaches the mysteries./
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  b) Hedge witch is derived from the Old High German ‘hagazussa' via the Anglo-Saxon ‘hægtesse' and means ‘hedge rider' -- referring not to a physical boundary hedge, but a metaphysical one. I first came across this definition on Dawn Jackson's site in the early 2000s and have since found it reflected in subsequent books and websites on traditional witchcraft. Sarah Anne Lawless states:

  /The word hedgewitch comes from the Saxon word haegtessa meaning ‘hedge-rider'. The hedge in hedge witchery is not a fence of shrubs and wildlife, but instead represents the border between our material world and the otherworld -- the unknown./

  Both of these definitions, while containing a kernel of truth, are based on assumptions. By examining these assumptions it will become apparent that neither is fully satisfactory in a historical sense, and that an alternative source may be necessary to explain the term.

***** Oh wow! That does actually fit quite well!

Especially if you say, 'low level' witches and wizards are a socially taboo topic (like squibs) in the wizarding society...

Very interesting!

Thank you!

***** *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge%20school][Hedge school]]*

Hedge schools (Irish names include scoil chois claí, scoil ghairid and scoil scairte) were small informal illegal schools, particularly in 18th- and 19th-century Ireland, designed to secretly provide the rudiments of primary education to children of 'non-conforming' faiths (Catholic and Presbyterian). Under the penal laws only schools for those of the Anglican faith were allowed. Instead Catholics and Presbyterians set up highly informal secret operations that met in private homes.

** I suspect these writers have picked it up from Game of Thrones rather than more historical sources.

A common trope is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight-errant]["knight errant"]] - a wandering knight, often depicted romantically/heroically.

In Game of Thrones, George Martin took this concept, gave it a cynical twist and referred to them as "hedge knights" - wandering knights without land, who can barely afford horse and armour. The bottom rung of chivalry, barely worthy of the name.

A number of writers appear to have adopted Martin's "hedge" terminology to refer to a person who belongs to a certain class but is barely worthy of the name, e.g. wizards who are so poorly educated they know very little magic.

*** /A Song of Ice And Fire/ was first published in 1996 (and GRRM started writing it in 1991). "Hedge Wizard" appeared in [[https://annarchive.com/files/Drmg163.pdf][Dragon Magazine #163]] in 1990. So tell us, HOW did people adopt a term from GoT a year before GRRM started writing it?

As a little trivia: the Hedge Wizard writeup was written by Gregg Sharp, who might be known to some of the older ones of you as Metroanime.

*** I didnt know that. I have watched Game of Thrones, but I have not read the books (even though I know they are supposed to be very good and I do have the first one), because I only have them in German and they translated the names of Characters and places, and I just couldnt get through reading about 'Jon Schnee' ^^ It just hurt me.

But that seems like a good explanation for some fics. Even though I think many fan authors use it more for people who just dont have the power level and not as someone necessarily poorly educated...

** Online Etymology Dictionary gives the etymology for hag, early 13th century:

"The first element probably is cognate with Old English haga "enclosure, portion of woodland marked off for cutting" (see hedge (n.)). Old Norse had tunriða and Old High German zunritha, both literally "hedge-rider," used of witches and ghosts."

Wiktionary for hedgewitch: Noun

hedgewitch (plural hedgewitches)

1. A modern witch who focuses on herbalism and shamanic experience.

According to wikipedia article Cunning folk in Britain, historian Owen Davies speaking on modern occultists "noted that many of them referred to themselves as "hedge witches", a term that was first developed by the writer Rae Beth in her book Hedge Witch: A Guide to Solitary Witchcraft (1990)."
