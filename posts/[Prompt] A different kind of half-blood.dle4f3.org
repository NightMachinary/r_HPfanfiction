Severus Snape does not exist. That character was merely a creation by a demon who wanted to blend in amongst humans to learn about humankind.

Basically an AU where Snape is a demon posing as a human because he was bored of immortality.


** "Why did you name your kid Albus Severus?" Ron said, confused. "We /hated/ Snape, even if he did the right thing in the end for the wrong reasons."

Harry mumbled incoherently.

"Sorry, Harry?" Hermione said.

"He needs a host," said Harry. "He needs to rise again."

***** I am fairly sure Severitus still refers only to Snape mentor fics, not Snarry. I don't think most people looking for mentorship fics would be happy coming across that pairing.

The term did change meaning though. It originated from a challenge by user Severitus to write a fic where Snape was Harry's bio father and where Harry's appearance slowly changed to resemble his 'real' father. Severitus meaning since then has moved to include all mentor and father figure fics regardless if they fit the original restrictions of the challenge.

******* That's annoying. Maybe they are tagging it that way because their fics have a mentorship plot? Still, I really don't like that pairing and would hate to see Severitus tag become the same thing as Snarry.

** I can totally see this working as an actual story that starts from when Severus was young and met Lilly. Though if he was a powerful immortal demon capable of flying under the radar and fooling everyone then I don't see him being bullied as harshly as he was by the Marauders because why would someone so powerful take that kind of crap from a bunch of young immature kids on a constant basis? No, I see him being pranked once by the marauders, finding it amusing and waving it off, but then as the pranking and bullying progressed he'd get annoyed and do something in retaliation. Maybe show his true demonic form and amp it up to the extreme to scare James and his crew enough to be afraid of him and avoid him at all costs. I'd also see the marauders make it their mission to try and expose his true identity and put a stop to him because they think he's evil and up to no good when in actuality he's just posing as a human because he's bored and curious about humankind. I don't know if he'd end up with Lilly. I think that part would stay canon, but this time around they remain good friends. Maybe he'd even show her his true form because he trusts her and after getting over the shock she'd still be his friend after a very long explanation of course. If that happened though then he wouldn't join Voldemort so as an alternate I'd have Lilly be afraid of Severus true form and then straight up upset that he hid the truth from her so long. If he does follow Voldemort then again its out of curiosity of what such a powerful wizard has to offer the world and how he'll shape it. There are many things you can do with this idea. I love it!

** How about this, Severus Snape is a demon is disguise who is gaining information about the real to destroy it.

However he gains attachments (Lily) and stops informing the Demon King called Mando. Mando becomes enraged eventually gains Fates side to make the prophecy.

When Lily does Swverus gives up as a whole and leaves both worlds. Years on a Wizard kills squib Harry Potter's wife, and Snape who has given up magic hint wizards led by the all might leader Tom Riddle.

Here it becomes like the amazon prime TV Show The Boys, which is brilliant.
