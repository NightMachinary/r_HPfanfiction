Hello!!

I've started writing a fic with Remus as one of the main characters. I've only published the first three chapters, it features Remus as a loving overprotective father and explores what would happen in a world where Remus and Sirius made different life choices.

If you're intrigued, give it a read and let me know what you think about it!
