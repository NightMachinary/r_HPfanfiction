Not because he's depressed, nihilistic, or anything like that. /Okay, maybe a little/. But you know those people that don't have to try and yet still be the best because they're talented or good at bullshitting?

Basilisk? */Cool/*

Mass murderer and dementors after him? */K/*

Forced into the Tri-wizard tournament? */No problem/*

‚Äã

The kind of Harry that would show up to the tasks hungover and still lead the tournament.

(Cause he's just that good at pretending to be good)


** This is the closest I can think of. linkffn(6466185). Harry the Hufflepuff is a comedy, but with that kind of prompt it practically has to be I think. He is very lazy, but will work very hard to make it so he doesn't have to work hard. Each year is released as sequels.

  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Redone. Follow JKR plot, but Harry is calm, cool, & not cooperative. Harry finally living the role as popular. Parties, drinks, drugs, all the fun stuff in life. Complete. R&R.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

*** Yeah the fic based on the prompt should be a comedy.

But it can be more sirius by blaming his behavior on the Dursley treatment and deteriorating mental health. Making him a lazy, cynical, nihilistic, uncaring, and unempathetic bastard only to be saved by a budding new love interest with <insert female name>

  What if, in fifth year, Harry did just that? An independent Harry story with some OOC, no real bashing, but not a big fan of some of the big players. No pairings. Rating for some curse words. First attempt at publishing on this site... we'll see.

** Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist by ZenoNoKyuubi) might have a bit of what you want.

When the triwizard tournament comes around he outright rejects the idea that he has to compete, despite what everyone says, because he's confident that someone entering him won't result in the normal consequences. Then Dumbledore asks him to participate, and he shrugs and agrees.

And yeah he's just that fucking good, no pretending required.
