:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a H/Hr fic in which Hermione died during the Battle of Hogwarts, sacrificing herself for Harry, after the bad gotten together during the Horcrux Hunt. Grieving, Harry decide to go back in time to obliviate their younger selves, preventing them from getting together in the first place. A lot of the story was told from older Hermione's POV. Anyone know what I'm talking about? Dies anyone remember the title of this fic? Thanks in advance!

**** I was trying to avoid spoiling the mystery for people who haven't read it yet, because op basically tells you the resolution for the mystery plot in his request.

***** Now, if this is the story I think it is, it only spoils about 50% of the mystery

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.
