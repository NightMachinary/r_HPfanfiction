There's a fanfic that I can't remember the title of and would be incredibly grateful to anyone who could help me out, because it's driving me absolutely crazy.

What I remember: It was a Harry Potter Fix-It fanfic. Either Harry or Hermione go back in time (I think it was Harry) to a point after Regulus' death and Sirius' imprisonment. We somehow find out Regulus was alive but in a suspended state of non-living in the lake with the horcrux. The protagonist briefly thinks about how in another timeline Regulus would've drowned to death once Voldemort was killed and the enchantments dropped. They also think about how it made sense for Voldemort to want to take care of any intruders himself and simply have them put to sleep rather than killed by his magical defenses. I also think I remember there being weirdness from Regulus still being young while Sirius has aged.


** I think you mean linkffn(Phantasy by Tsume Yuki). The Regulus part fits perfectly.

  Tom Riddle was fully expecting to stay in hell forever. But the brat-who-lived and friend has, of course, come along with an offer too tempting to refuse. Albus Dumbledore was fully expecting Harry Potter's name down for the next year at Hogwarts. He just wasn't expecting two Dark-Lords to be enrolling as well. Time-travel -sort of- and FemHarry
