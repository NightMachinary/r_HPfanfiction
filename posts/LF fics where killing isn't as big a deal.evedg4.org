Dont misunderstand I dont expect characters to go around shooting of AK's but where people understand that this is a war and that lives will be lost

and rather focusing on killing its focused on the use of dark magic. how it gives power boosts while corrupting the user that sort of thing

Dumbledore being an old warrior and there being others like him who either fought against grindlewald or fought in the first blood war

I enjoyed wind shear but Dumledores characterization is annoying mostly true to canon but annoying


** I love Wind Shear. Where Moody tells Dumbledore, "You're a teacher, stay out of the way and let a warrior do his job."

*** my favourite part of the fic was that there were actual war veterans and it wasn't just that one day dumbledore decided to get of his ass and duel dumbledore and the war was suddenly over but other people who fought grindlewald and his armies who know what it means to properly fight a war

that and the fact that harry was put on same level as tom and albus without him being dark
