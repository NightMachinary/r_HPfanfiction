Harry goes to the pet store and buys a phoenix that becomes his familiar. He goes into Dumbledore's office, and his phoenix and Fawkes bond. Fawkes decides to leave Dumbledore becoming Harry's second phoenix. The two phoenixes have several phoenix children, and create a race of phoenixes to do Harry's work for him. They help him defeat Voldemort and take over the wizarding world.
