It doesn't have to be exactly that, but some sort of variation would be preferred.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual, et cetra. (Doesn't have to focus on a pairing)

No Weasley bashing, if at all possible.

No OP Harry, Harry smarter and/or more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable and because he worked for it. None of those Harry has discovered Weasley's are using him for his fame and fortune and the like stories. If Harry is Lord I'd like him to still help people.

Can be on ANY site, anyone can be the main character, can be new or old, can be canon compliant or AU.

Am fine with Oneshots/Drabbles or Multichapters.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.
