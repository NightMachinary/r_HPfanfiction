The usual is "Harry is born as a twin or has a sibling and they're hailed as the child who lived instead of him until Voldemort is resurrected and he tells the whole world the truth or it comes out another way and everyone flocks to him and Dumbledore tries to get him to be 'his boy'!"

I was looking for a fic where Neville (or Harry's sibling) is hailed as the child who lived, everyone puts their faith in them (or lack of faith depending on which way the wind is blowing today), they get special training, etc while Harry is a secret ignored/neglected genius.

Then Voldemort is resurrected, the new war starts, the child who lived (and the order of the phoenix) is worthless for most of it and then the child who lived gets their butt whooped and Harry defeats Voldemort in a spectacular way in front of most of the wizarding world in the final fight.

I would love to see the fallout and reactions when it's revealed AFTER the final defeat not before. To see Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix lose their cool when they realize they didn't train the savior of the magical world, where the supposed savior's friends realize they haven't been hanging around the actual savior, where people realize the person they've ignored/disliked/whatever for years turns out to be the savior instead, etc.


** I just had a silly thought; 'wrong boy who lived', in the sense that there's a mixup at St. Mungos and James & Lily come home with the wrong child.\\
When a newborn Metamorphmagus happens across Harry Potter in the maternity ward, he thinks nothing of mimicking the newborn child, inadvertently causing a mix-up when the Metamorphmagus is mistaken for Harry and vice-versa.\\
The Potters and the...oh, let's say, Noel and Rennie Kelp, go home with (who they think are) their respective children...after a few months, though, the Kelps realise that the child they've brought home isn't their own after all, and after a bit of research, find out that they're raising none other than Harry Potter.\\
They try to locate James & Lily, but with the Fidelius up, most of the Order of the Phoenix in hiding, and the Death Eaters on the prowl, they have little luck...until that fateful night when Voldemort is destroyed by Lily's sacrifice.\\
With half of magical Britain singing the praises of Harry Potter and the other half seeking to avenge Voldemort, the Kelps quietly decide to keep their child's true heritage to themselves, even as the Metamorphmagus changeling is brought to the Dursleys by Dumbledore...

Ten years later, the two children come to Hogwarts, causing much confusion. There's a boy with James's looks but Lily's eyes, raised in the wizarding world, but claims not to be Harry Potter. And a shapeshifting Metamorphmagus, raised-but-neglected by muggles, who claims to be Harry but doesn't look anything of the sort (except when he does).

** Oh boy. So WBWL bashing, there's plenty of that. But I uhh... don't think there are any post-Voldemort ones because most are incomplete or WIP. And the ones that are complete, aren't the cliched WBWL you're looking for.

** interesting idea. the fic Im writing is one that started off in the wrong bwl vein with a dead James doing the sacrifice and a surviving, spared lily, but when I was writing it I realised how unlikely it would actually be that the wizarding world would think that a baby defeated voldemort when lily was still alive. so I ended up having everybody assume lily was some super powerful vanquisher of voldemort and given that my fic lily got whacked in the head during the attack and didn't remember what happened just enabled that assumption. I always got the idea that in canon dumbledore never dramatically announced Harry was the bwl or anything, just that lily, James and voldy died and Harry survived, and the public (mostly correctly) assumed that it was Harry that did it.

It has been a while since I have read The Art of Self Fashioning; but, what I remember of it seems to fit your request.

*** Ooh, it's finished now?

I really struggle to keep up with updating fics, and most of the time just read until I'm up to date with whatever point the author has reached, and then don't bother coming back. I did really enjoy this one though, I'll have to dive back in

** If you just want some spoiled Boy Who Lived bashing you can get your fix reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886][Strange Reflections]]. As for the closest thing to what you want that I can remember is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11727156][The Dark Empire]], except.. well, they just don't have any opportunities for regret.

** What about if Harry was born on either the 7th or 31st of July 1977 and his sibling was born 31st July 1980. Lily and James were away at an emergency order meeting and Peter was left to look after the kids because he is the secret keeper but he lets Voldemort in and runs away so he doesn't see anything. Harry is woken up to taking down stairs and think his parents are home so he starts to go Dow until he actually sees who it is so he races up to the nursery and when Voldemort comes he refuses to move so he is hit with the killing curse leaving his sibling with protection but it turns out Harry is the predestined MoD so he lives but when he wakes up he is either buried in a coffin and accidentally apostates somewhere, or something else. Or he might be raised in deaths kingdom or something. But there is no bashing of Lily and James cause I'm quite fond of them. And Lily and James fight with the Daily Profit to have Harry named as the defeater of Voldemort instead of his sibling because they watch their memory and see Harry refusing to move and getting killed, leaving (...) protection.
