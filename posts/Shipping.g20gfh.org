These are all quite well written Haphne stories. Some are more plot focused, others more romance focused. And just as a quick tip, this pairing has been reqiested a 100 times on this subreddit. Just search for Haphne inside the subreddit and you'll find the stories above and others recommended multiple times in the last month alone probably.

Where an old betrothal contract gets activated because Dumbledore is too busy to "take care of the Mail". Harry isn't happy but comes up with a unique way of dealing with being married to someone he hates. It's almost 20K words

This next fic has Harry & Pansy bonding (no soul bond etc) shortly after the Chamber of Secrets. It's a WIP and is almost 425K words long.

** For a Harry/Daphne fic (which includes Harry/Hermione. You can try Daphne's Letter from the Future by TomHRichardson. It's where both Harry and Daphne send letters to themselves. It's a Work in Progress and is currently about 61K words.

linkao3(21665026)

There's a story I really like that's a WIP but i regrettably think in may be slipping into the abandoned category called The Fires of Magic by Raolin. It's a little over 151K words and was last updated December 9, 2018. Harry ends up in an Asian monastery prior to Hogwarts learning a different way to do magic. No actual pairings though Harry has primarily befriended Daphne, Tracy, fem!blaise, with Hermione starting to get some interaction.

The author last updated one of his other stories March 11, 2019. I really hope he does get back to it.

linkffa(1928)

The Grass is Always Greener by kb0 has Daphne teaching Harry Occlumency after he helps her against MalFoy and the bookends.

  AU. Two days after returning home from fifth-year classes and O.W.L. exams, Daphne Greengrass finds on her pillow, a letter from her much-older self. Included in this letter is a Muggle envelope addressed to Harry Potter from his much-older self.Daphne's letter reveals that elderly Daphne and elderly Harry, after each had outlived a spouse, got married. Marrying Harry Potter, elderly Daphne assures young Daphne, was the best thing to ever happen to elderly Daphne in her long life.Elderly Daphne also tells her teenaged self---Sirius Black's just-read will emancipates almost-sixteen-year-old Harry Potter and grants him the Lordship of the House of Black. In turn, emancipating the Potter Heir turns him into Lord Potter. Harry Potter gaining two Lordships means he'll need two wives. Young Daphne, why wait till you need a cane before you become betrothed to the best man in Wizarding Britain?This is an alt-universe GreenPot Harmony (H/Hr and HP/DG) story that bashes Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley.
