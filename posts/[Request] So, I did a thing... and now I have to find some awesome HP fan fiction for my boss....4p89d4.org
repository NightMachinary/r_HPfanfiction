So, today at work, I got into a rather passionate conversation with my boss about Harry Potter. He lamented about how sad he was when the series came to an end. In response, I said (fully intending to get a laugh) "Well, it's never really ended for me because I read fan fiction!" However, instead of the good-natured teasing that I was expecting, he was actually pretty interested and asked if any of it was any good, if I had anything i'd recommend, etc. and somehow I ended up agreeing to find a few things for him to read.

However, my problem is that I pretty much exclusively read DM/HP pairing and I wasn't quite ready to divulge THAT information. Since I highly doubt that would be his cup of tea, here I am asking if anyone in this community has any awesome gen!fic or M/F pairings (with mild sexual content - I don't want to be throwing smut his way, either) that is well written and has a fun/canon-esque plot. Ideally it would be post-Hogwarts or post-epilogue, but I don't think I can be picky since I have no familiarity with this area of the fandom. I just want something that makes you feel like you're back in the HP world.

So how about it? Anyone have any great 'staple pieces' or fiction they would recommend? I would very much appreciate the leads!


** I highly recommend linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair), which shows that the war has badly affected them, but they're still moving on.

I also like [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Dear_Tom/Dear_Tom/][Dear Tom by Bobmin]], an amusing short.

** I'm puzzled that nobody linkffn(Forging the sword) yet. It has some of the best young!trio interaction and development I've ever seen, and a new, large chapter may be coming out soon.

Normally I would jump at recommending Emperor too, as has already be done, but I don't think that it's a good fic to start off with. It will likely feel too foreign initially.

Instead, I will recommend linkffn(c'est la vie). It is more or less a feelgood fic, to be honest, but it manages to do so well. Also, I want others to suffer the sadness that it's likely dead.

Edit: wrong c'est la vie, the one you want is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][this one]].

I just am so unfamiliar with what is out there beyond my personal ship, not to mention what is actually worth reading, that I figured i'd cast my net wide and see what came in. Thanks for the rec! I'll definitely check it out. :)

** linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by EmeraldAshes) is what got me into fanfiction. It pretty much follows canon, while poking fun at it in a completely good natured way, and is completely hilarious. Starting with this might be the best choice.

If your boss likes Humphrey Bogart movies, linkffn(Unatoned) is a good option. The first chapter is an homage to the start of /The Big Sleep/, a very famous noir novel/movie. Though this doesn't feel very canon-esque, so you might want to/probably should pass on this.

If you want post-Hogwarts, canon-esque, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian's stories have you covered]]. Dude's got 83 damn stories, all that he tries to get to fit into canon. Hell, he's even going through and making sure that Ron and Hermione's kids are all Granger-Weasleys now that Cursed Child is a thing. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is considered (probably rightly) to be his best work.

I honestly don't think he understands what sorts of things Fan Fiction can contain (and thinking back on some of the things I stumbled across when I was new to the concept) I shudder to think what he could come across... it's just too soon!

Seriously, that one is fantastic, even if a few details are off.

  In canon, healers and mediwitches were seemingly spared from the predations of the Death Eaters during both Blood Wars. St. Mungo's would have been a very soft target, but it stood inviolate. One patient was attacked, but the hospital and it's staff were spared. The question is, why? What could have kept mad killers in check? As with a great many other things, Poppy knew.

** I'd recommend Hogwarts Houses Divided, if he or you are interested in next-gen fics. I really enjoyed Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness, although that occasionally catches flack for being too violent for HP and because of some drama with the author, but it's worth checking out. Arabella has one that's Ginny's first year told through her diary entries that's fabulously written but can be really tough to get through, I can never remember if it's The Very Special Diary or A Very Special Diary.

** I think linkffn(A Black Comedy) could be a great one for a newb. Similarly linkffn(Where in the world is harry potter). Both are cannon compliantish.

On top of those I think linkffn(Oh God Not Again) would be a really good one for someone who's new to fanfiction.

I think you are getting a lot of people recommensing their favourite stories but fanfic is an acquired taste and jumping right into Dark!TimeTravel!GenderSwitch!Harry or whatever might scare your boss off. The fics I've recommended are all comedy so if your boss doesn't like it you can play it off as just a form of comedy you enjoy rather than a whole subculture that you are part of.

And I second Seventh Horcrux as a rec.

** The /Alexandra Quick/ series is what I would recommend, both because of its consistently professional-grade writing quality and because it's pretty far removed from all the tropes that define an unfortunately large proportion of fanfiction.

** Have you ever heard of linkffn(Not From Others)?

It's DH from Ginny Weasley's perspective, and it's insanely well written.

Anything by Little0Bird is pretty good, too, Tell him to check out linkffn(Questions and Answers). It starts after the epilogue, sticks to canon wonderfully, and, even after 97 chapters, it hasn't finished.

My last recommendation here will be linkffn(A Difference In The Family: The Snape Chronicles) This fic details Snape's life from his birth to his death. It's amazingly well written and sticks to Canon.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen. DH from Ginny's POV. Canon.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
