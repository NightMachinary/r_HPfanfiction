and do you think student used to be able to get a permission slip signed in order to visit the forest to do thinks like collect potions ingredients?


** I mean, from an educator perspective, you don't want kids wandering too far off campus into an area where they're not easily tracked.

So It's probably been 'forbidden' for a rather long time. It always struck me as more of a 'this is your campus, this is not' type deal. But I went to school next to a forest and was repeatedly told things of that nature.

** I think the Forest has /always/ been "forbidden". It's a dangerous magical forest, and was already the very type of the fairy-tale "Dark Forest" when the Founders decided to build their castle next to it.

**** Possible, sure!

Though you need more than two to create a colony.

***** True I would saythe absolute latest that the forest would have been made forbidden would have been Lupins first year.(but it probably happened before then)

Although I think that the forest would have been slowly going out of favour for a long time. It probably used to be were they learnt herbology until hogwarts had the greenhouses built.

Then it probably became an area that only upper years who wanted to collect potions ingredients went.

eventually there probably came a permission slip that fifth year could get signed to go into the forest.

Until eventually it became the forbidden forest that we knew when Harry was at Hogwarts

** It goes back to the treaty of 1756, declaring the forest the breeding ground for nymphs and dryads, which of course sparked a big influx of wizards wandering off into it. Just a year and several divorces later the forest has become somewhat of a red light district of magical Britain and was henceforth declared the Forbidden Forest by the current Headmistress, giving her the name Petra "the Prude" of Bamburgh.
