I am currently looking for any non slash creature fic where Harry comes into an inheritance or is changed into a creature.

Also if anyone happens to know the name of a certain fiction I lost track of I would be very grateful.

In this fic Harry was bitten by a vampire. In a bar I believe either way he starts working in a book store.


** There are a couple where Harry is an Incubus. One has Harry living on a off street of Diagon Alley where all the creatures shop and he somehow adopts a royal creature baby.

Another one is pure porn where Harry has to bang a chick every day or he could die.

I'm sure there are others as well.

I think I know exactly which fic you are talking about btw, but the name eludes me. Ill see if I can hunt it down, no promises though.

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter; Harry's going to exploit the system.

** linkffn(We, Harry Potter) is perfect if you want something in a light-hearted, comedic style. A more serious take that a lot of people like is linkffn(Outcast's Alley), which is indeed pretty good but a heavy AU. /We, Harry Potter/ is ongoing while /Outcast's Alley/ is completed with a "on-permanent-hiatus-and-to-be-honest-probably-abandoned" sequel.

EDIT: UGH! Fffnbot messed up. It's obviously not that /We, Harry Potter/.
