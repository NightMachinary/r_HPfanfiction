So I was looking for this hp fanfic and couldn't find it anywhere so... Anyway I'm pretty sure I read it originally on fanfiction net. So basically the premise of the story was most of the magical world was dead killed by a Muggle virus that had no known cure. In order I stop wizards and witches from dying out the governing body of the Wizarding world decided to send those healthy enough back in time they we're deaged to babies. Hermione Granger and Luna lovegood were two of the wizards and witches sent back in time Hermione was adopted by the Lestranges living in the Marauders era and Luna as a Malfoy. So any idea what fic this is ?
