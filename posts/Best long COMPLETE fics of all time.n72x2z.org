I'm so tired of getting drawn into a fic and invested in the plot and then suddenly their last update was may 2019 and it's cut off before the big action... I don't mind any pairings, but I'd prefer no fem!Harry and no Harry's brother fics. Other than that, I can enjoy most any plot points. Thanks!

P.S. if anybody recommends prince of Slytherin I'm setting myself on fire

Edit: wow! I can't believe how many fantastic recs I've gotten! Thank you all for your contributions, I'll be trying to sort through them and check them all out as soon as possible.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][wind shear]] is great, might not be quite as long as you'd like at 126k, but it's one of the best fics I've ever read. The basics is that Harry is sent back to the 70s and would have left the magical world behind, if a group of death eaters hadn't broken in to slaughter the muggles in there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly][Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly]] is also great at just under 200k. Harry is sent back to 1992, as a shade, and ends up possesing Lockhart and ends up trying to make sure that this Harry doesn't go through the same things he did, shenanigan's occurs.

!Edit!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]], just remembered this masterpiece, basics is that Harry decides during the start of the summer before sixth year, that he doesn't think a kid can beat Voldie, so he decides he's going to live first by going on a world troting vacation, shenanigans ensues.

+Wind Shear ends halfway through, IIRC the author passed away.+

Edit: Apparently I must have travelled from the Bearstein universe because I swear this fic was incomplete, but it's finished apparently.

**** The first fanfic I ever read was a certain Sailor Moon/Ranma ½ crossover. It's been over a decade without any kind of update, not even a note to say that it's abandoned.

And while my taste in literature is a lot more refined nowadays, the wooden, slightly stilted dialogue and barely-there descriptions are still leagues better than a lot of what I see in the Ranma fandom.

When it comes to Harry Potter, though, there are so many fics that show such potential and promise, but then Peter out halfway. Like the one where Harry befriends Hermione early because the Dursleys dropped him off at an orphanage/asylum place. That fic's only bad point was that everyone (including Dumbledore) kept being completely floored and awestruck because Harry and Hermione had managed to work out a few bits of wordless and wandless magic, via forcing Accidental Magic with Intent. Was it a cool thing for two pre-Hogwarts kids to do? Sure, obviously. But why would a 150+ year old wizard be stunned speechless by something that is on the Hogwarts curriculum, or at least the NEWT exam (wordless, wandless /Accio Wand/ is credit for both Charms and DADA, iirc).

TLDR I agree on the idea that abandoned fics are still fun to read at times, but man does it hurt getting blue'd so often, if you know what I mean.

** There's a shitload of recs already, so if I duplicate something... sorry? At any rate, here's some good ones I haven't been able to rec in a while:

Hell Eyes - You know how there's a bunch of fics out there that claim to be unique? This one actually is. It's the most unique one you'll find, barring a crossover imo. It's also fantastic. (There's a 'next gen' sequel to it that's abandoned - skip it. The original story is complete as is.) Harry/OC, divergent from... I want to say 5th year? Maybe 6th.

Browncoat, Green Eyes - A EWE crossover with firefly, that does a fairly good job of prepping you for the series if you have no idea what it is. You'll miss out on some in-jokes such as [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI-fiGUjAPY][this one.]] (Jayne is the dude with the goggles.) Otherwise, you follow a rather older-and-wiser with fewer fucks to give Harry as he tags along with a group of thieves and tries to figure out where the hell all the magic went. Harry/River

Fates be Changed - A six year old Harry uses accidental magic to appear in Bruce Banner's path in this MCU crossover, and he ends up becoming Mateo Banner. I'm currently reading this, and I'm enjoying it a lot so far - great spelling/grammar/etc, and a big focus on how Harry/Mateo's presence influences Bruce's personality (and relationship with the 'other guy') and visa versa. No idea about parings.

Grey Space - On the shorter side, but an excellent 'what if Hogwarts started later' with great characterization. There's a sequel in the works as well, and that'll start posting once it's complete I imagine. No Pairing.

The House of Potter Rebuilt - If you need a story with tons of conflict, don't read things from this author. However, if you want a fluffy read about a rather more curious Harry, well. Here ya go. No pairing

One Hundred and Sixty Nine - The first of two Hermione-centric stories I'll (probably ever) recommend. She made a plan, headed to the past, and tried to fix the night of 31 October, 1981. And then went back to her proper time. Hermione/Sirius.

Six Pomegranate Seeds - The other Hermione-centric one. Hogwarts sends her spirit back in time to right the wrongs of a Battle of Hogwarts with more devastating results than canon, and she's shoved into the body of a dying girl from a dark family. Rosier? Rowle? Something like that, it's been a while. And she has to try to mitigate the effects of the war, while in Slytherin - as an orphan with no status - while the golden trio (and her old self) are doing what they do as griffindors.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

It was that feeling you sometimes get when you finish a fic and you're searching fruitlessly for the “next chapter” button, because you just can't /believe/ the author really ended it with that, when there are still so many unanswered questions. That's how I felt!!

******* Oh I see what you're saying! I know exactly what you mean! Sometimes when I'm reading a fic I'm like ‘this is a lot of spinning plates, are they going to be able to draw them all to a satisfactory finish?' Because it's so hard to feel satisfied when there's been that kind of build up!

******** The author is excellent, and I believe certainly had the ability to write a satisfactory conclusion, but for whatever reason just chose - i think at least - to leave various plot points open. After reading hundreds of thousands of words hoping/expecting that certain central points would...come to a resolution in the story, that felt like fundamental issues that had been running through the story from the beginning, it feels so frustrating and unsatisfying, to me at least (and definitely at least some other commenters) for the author to decide for those resolutions not to happen within the scope of the story.

Also, certain other resolutions that did happen felt atypically rushed.

Basically, I felt the whole last few chapters didn't live up to the rest of the story. But it didn't keep me from /loving/ the series overall. And ymmv!

********* Yeah I agree. I also know how hard it can be when you just want to finish a fic. Right now I have a conclusion to a fic that's been ongoing and it's a similarly quick finish, and I have to decide whether to take that cop out and actually give readers a conclusion or continue to try and write a satisfactory end, but the writers block I have now means that I do my know how long I'll be leaving my poor readers hanging and I feel terrible!

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Linkao3(conditionally by lomonaaeren) my favourite fic

Linkffn(a second chance at life by Miranda fairgold) first and still one of the best 'Harry goes to a new school' fics

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/990947]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/591278]]) crossover with Criminal Minds, surprisingly good

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/375683]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2611775]])

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7769080]]) absolutely hilarious

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630]]) love this one

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8051995]]) Dishonored crossover, only about 10,000 words but really good

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14031132]]) basilisks treated as WMD

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24204940]])

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.

Insane worldbuilding. Best OC's I've ever read. Expands greatly on magic. Comprehensive story. There are 7 books, about 1,2 million words total iirc.

** I wasn't sure what you meant by "long," so I went with 150,000+ words. My favorite characters to read about in fanfiction will be immediately obvious. :) I hope one or more of these strike your fancy!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][*All the Young Dudes*]] *by MsKingBean89:* LONG fic charting the Marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24620707/chapters/59480275][*The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights*]] *by CH_Darling:* It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world... but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth. Lily Evans wants a fresh start. James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him. Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story. Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon. Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/4139571][*Remain in Light*]] *by veeagainst:* What if Sirius Black didn't die? It's been done many times. Here's my take on it.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/979182/chapters/1927380][*Cartographer's Craft*]] *by copperbadge:* In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7869079/chapters/17970910][*Blends*]] *by rvltn909:* Words got in the way sometimes, but Remus got the sense Sirius knew what he was trying to say. (FYI this is a non-magical/modern coffee shop AU, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea.)

I've been avoiding All The Young Dudes like the plague because I don't have the emotional stability to go through all that commitment to the story and characters and then have things end up the same way in the end.. it's just too depressing.

**** Haha I definitely get that. I started my fanfiction journey reading Jily and those characters are still my favorites to read about today, but you're right that that means reading a LOT of angst, especially now that I primarily read post-Hogwarts Wolfstar. I mix in a lot of fluffy one-shots after getting through the more difficult stories. ATYD deserves its accolades and I would recommend reading it if you ever feel up to it, but I fully understand your hesitation. I had to take several breaks near the end because I was dreading everything post-Hogwarts so much. The TLE series will go through the end of the First War, but the author said that she plans to write both a canon-compliant ending and a fix-it AU ending. :) Remain in Light and Cartographer's Craft both have happy endings, and Cartographer's Craft is a fandom classic from 2005 (so pre-DH)! Blends uses their backstories and characterizations from canon to tell an AU story that doesn't have anything to do with canon plot lines; it also has a happy ending. Enjoy!

** If you like crossovers, one of my favorites is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][The Inquisitor Carrow series]], by littlewhitecat. It's a Warhammer 40k crossover, but you don't technically need to know much about that franchise in order to enjoy this. Ever wanted to see a giant, OP, extremely violent, political genius but socially inept Harry Potter bludgeon his way through wizarding and muggle society? Find the prospect of third year Hermione toting a minigun in wartime Yugoslavia fighting alongside some Vampire assassins, muggle mercenaries with laser guns, a wizard secretary, a 7 ft tall Harry who wrestles tanks, and a very confused squad of UN peacekeepers incredibly funny? Want to see the God Emperor of Mankind geek out over flying skateboards? Than this is the fic for you. I swear it's only a little crackfic-y.

Technically it's not entirely done, the last story ended on a sort-of cliffhanger, but the next installment should come out soon and there are plenty of completed stories in the series until then. I also liked Through the Veil Strangely by the same author, where he becomes fused with a giant Space Egyptian Space Nerd.

Sorry, I just wanted to gush about this series.

** Linkffn(Renegade Cause)

Didn't see this one mentioned. It's very long (500k words) and covers an alternative 5th year. I'd classify it as Indy/Dark Harry, but not one of those stupidly edgy ones. I mean, it gets edgy, edge is inherent in the genre, but it's employed correctly here.

Features a few developed OCs, but the story is still focused on Harry and how he copes with Voldemort's return and the brewing war. Voldemort is a competent villain.

The fic shows its age, no doubt about it, but I still think it holds up phenomenally for something originally published in 2008. One of my favorites.

  However, several hundred students attended Hogwarts during those years. Many of them went on to live quiet comfortable lives, while a few of them became famous in their own right. However, all of them have their own story to tell, just as interesting and just as important. This is one of them.

But it's genderbent harry (female harry) so.. unless you change your mind I won't suggest it.

I do have another series that's pretty good, the harry black series, it's still WIP but is not abandoned. The author is currently working on the 5th book in the series the first 4 are complete and I wanna say there somewhere between 700k-1m words already written in the series.

*** I was recently persuaded to read The Debt of Time, after previously trying it and stopping. It turned out to be quite interesting, exploring how Hermione changes, and how her trip through time both does and doesn't change things, but there was quite a strong lemon flavour, which I could do without. For those who don't mind that, it's a heartwarming read.

Harry Crow, on the other hand, I literally cannot stomach. I mean what I say; trying to get through the first ten chapters, just so I could say I gave it a fair shot, made me want to puke. Harry isn't just a Gary Stu, though the goblins are on that level; he goes beyond it to Black Hole Sue. And every other character is a completely one-dimensional caricature, either Harry's ally and therefore an extreme doormat, or his enemy and therefore a hopelessly incompetent punching bag.

** I know that the post is almost a month old now, and you have probably already found what you were looking for. However, for someone like me who has stumbled upon this gold mine via search, it's always good to contribute some more for future reference, right?

I'll focus on next-gen stuff (the generation of Harry's kids, since they're what I've been most focused on for almost 10 years. The second one isn't finished yet, but it's probably worth putting on alert since the last update was just two months ago. With that said, Allons-y!

The two best ones (one of them is a trilogy) that I've come across over the 10 ish years that I have read next-gen centric fics are Ignite (and Starfall & Oblivion that succeed it) by Slide linkffn(8255131), as well as Clash by shezwriter linkffn(12383732).

Note that Ignite is more of a POV fic with a few main characters, and Clash is a for the most part dual-perspective fic. Clash is an acquired taste though, for reasons that you can surmise quite early on in the fic (not the writing though, I can assure you that the writing is excellent - not quite Ignite level, perhaps). Ignite, on the other hand, presents its readers one of the best writings - both in terms of plot and of the linguistic commands that Slide has - that I have ever seen amongst the hundreds of fanfictions that I have read over the years.

*** My biggest issue with it is the characterisation. I've only read the first ten chapters, but within that space, not a single character was anything like their canon personality, and they were all pretty one-dimensional; either they worship Harry's (undoubtedly mighty) toenails, or they're hopelessly incompetent and exist primarily as Harry's punching bag.

I guess if someone sympathised more with Harry's grievances than I do, like how he keeps complaining about having been left to the Dursleys even though he wasn't there for even twenty four hours, then they might like it better than I did.

  In a world where soulmates exist, it is possible to have two names printed on your wrist at birth. One will be your soulmate. The other, your enemy. There is no way to tell the difference or, if you only have one, which it is. Little Harry Potter dreams of the day he will finally meet his soulmate, someone who will actually love and want him. But as he grows up, he realizes that nothing is that simple. Especially not soulmates. Especially not his.Long, Multi-Chartered, Alternate Epilogue now added 9.10.18

  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around.

  It was easier for Will to hide his magic. No muggle understood his ‘gift' of empathy. Wizarding kind thought him even more of a freak. No person, magical or otherwise, liked their secrets exposed. While Will was self-taught in magic, it was easier to deal with people without magic, than with it.Hannibal Lecter had an important and rare creature inheritance that gifted him with understanding magic in a way that few could understand. Secret hidden from all, even Will, he slipped under the cover of the muggles, an elusive sort of prey, and killed without magic.Only, when Hannibal asks Will of his magic, that Will understands who Hannibal is: Chesapeake Ripper.So, they both leave. Will leaves Jack behind but brings his dogs, and Hannibal is looking forward to hunting in Italy again. On their layover in England, Hannibal confesses that he needs to go hunting. That is where they found Harry Potter, curled under the cupboard, malnourished and bleeding.The natural thing to do is take the boy in and raise him as their own.This is the story of how Harry grows with a father who is a Ravenstag, serial killer, a dad with too many dogs and an empathy disorder, cannibalism and the value that family has.

  When Harry was 5 he had a pet butterfly. The butterfly could turn into a man who lived in Harry's basement. That man killed Vernon when Harry turned 8. That man is a Death Eater who has been training Harry in how to be a proper Pureblood Heir. Harry was always told he was a bit like a Caterpillar and one day he'd be a Butterfly too. Sorted into Ravenclaw, when he starts Hogwarts, Harry learns that sometimes it's much harder to keep secrets than it is to tell lies. But it could be worse: he could have been a Slytherin.

*** +Good... God. This is like a list of the worst in fanfiction. So much slash, so much Malfoy, so much Dumbledore/Ron bashing.... How is it possible to miss on /this many/ stories? The only ones remotely readable (to me, anyway) are Stages of Hope and A Year Like None Other, and even the latter (which I read /years/ ago) hasn't really aged well with me. Stages of Hope still stands up pretty well, though.+

+I mean, I get it, different strokes for different folks, but I was expecting something more from a list that long than a who's-who on the top five things that make me drop a fic instantly. A little bit more... variety. Alas.+

It was pointed out to me that this was rather rude of me to say. I can only say that it came out of a moment of frustration as I thought I'd hit a goldmine of new fanfictions, only to find that almost all of them were not to my taste. That isn't an excuse, however, only an explanation. I apologize for my harsh words.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break.

***** Slash. That's my issue with it.

Edit: To expand on the above, I think it's actually more about having explicit sex scenes than the slash alone. As a straight male, I don't enjoy such material. That being said, I don't enjoy explicit scenes with heterosexual couples, either. Something about reading characters that were significant in my childhood having sex is disturbing on some level, regardless of the genders of those involved.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.

  Harry Potter died on June 24, 1995, in the Little Hangleton graveyard where Lord Voldemort returned to physical form. As the Dark Lord intended, this guaranteed that nobody knew of his rebirth except for his followers.And Draco Malfoy.(This story is a retelling of books 5-7 with the basis that Harry died at the end of his fourth year. It is named after and heavily inspired by the song "The Iron Sky" by Sunrise Ave. This fic is now complete, and has a sequel coming!)[If you have questions, we can be found daily on Tumblr @minxchester!]

** Brave New World by bellerophon30 [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/vw4f6rg5iwitk62/bellerophon30%20-%20The%20Brave%20New%20World.epub?dl=0]]

Explores the United State in an amazing world building fix. I thoroughly enjoyed it although theres alot of cringe and romantic stuff too.

I'll just reccomend the same thing I always do. I've literally considered writing a sequel to this 100 times. It's my hands down favorite book 5 divergent, noncannon pairing harry, with incredibly OC and world building. It's got some fluff and filler but it's just excellent. The best fred and george writing I've ever experienced. #therealgoldentrio

Warning some ron and dumbles bashing. Basically everyone is manipulative. And Dumbledore just isn't on anyones good list.

It's one of the best fics I've literally ever read, having been reading for more than a decade. Not just best drarry fic, best fic. Period. I don't care if you don't like drarry usually. This fic.

  The universe times it just right. They meet at a certain stage in life where everything is all impulse and curiosity, where you can get away with anything and maybe a scraped knee or detention to show for it, but it never lasts, it never hurts for longer than a week, at least, depending on what you've done. Maybe it's because James Potter is too friendly for his own good, always running his mouth. He sets everything in motion, at least. But Sirius Black has never had real friends before, not like this, and a little brother plus a deranged old house elf don't count. Even if they both let you win at chess every time you play. And Peter Pettigrew is used to playing along, and Remus Lupin just wants to share his passion for Muggle rock n' roll with someone who understands, you know? So they're young and so it means everything to share a compartment on a train on a warm day in September, in 1971, and the universe got something right because that one day stretches an entire lifetime. And maybe beyond that, too. Maybe all the way to the other side. - The story of the Marauders and their time at Hogwarts. [1971-1978]

*** Intriguing premise for the fic. I don't read much on the marauder side of things (I'm just so terrified of all the young dudes that I don't even enter the area), so it'll be a fun new experience. Also, I am just so sick of Prince of Slytherin.. I could say “I want a fem!Hufflepuff! Harry fic with no bashing that's under 10,000 words” and somebody would still recommend it just because..

** I would definitely recommend Through Sand and Sea by Looktotheedges. 100 chapters, 300k words, complete. Lots of worldbuilding, great plot, wonderful characters and definitely worth reading all the way through, and the ending will leave you sad that it's over but satisfied with all the various plot points. bit of a rare pair but still one of the best fics I've ever read, basic premise: Hermione from 2005 is in the Department of Mysteries when she gets sent back in time... to 1996, where her younger self is battling Death Eaters. There, she runs into Bellatrix Lestrange, and after that her life is one crazy thing after another- house elves, prophecies, etc.

linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) Quite possibly the most realistic dark!political!Harry fic out there. One of the best fics of all time.

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

** Sorry for the late reply! I saw this on mobile and saved it for the next time I had time at my computer. I hope you're still looking for recommendations.

Top Three of All Time. These are the three fics that I keep open on my phone's browser so I can easily recommend them.

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/631214][The secret language of plants]] is my number one fanfic of all time. I've been in the fandom for more than fifteen years and this is it for me. I'd like to be buried with it in my coffin. It is complete.
2. Also by the author of TSLoP (see #1) comes [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7693897/chapters/17528833][Life skills outside the curriculum]]. In this, Harry runs away before he gets his Hogwarts letter. He excels at instinctive magic and manages to block tracking magic. I love the feeling I have when I read this. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of an aching nostalgia. It is complete.
3. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. I really don't care for Ginny (just don't find her interesting), but this author writes her very well. True to character and compelling; one of my top three in the fandom. (182,592 words; complete)

Post-Hogwarts

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21468571/chapters/51162523][Twenty-Nine]] is by my absolute favorite author. It is the story that made me realize that Percy could be interesting. Summary: A story about murder, the power of writing lists, the interest of the press, the politics of the Department of Magical Transportation and the struggle of being Percy Weasley. It has a companion piece [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21492193/chapters/51221617][26]] that is also just lovely. They are 84k and 145k words, respectively
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12578866/1/Modern-Romance][Modern Romance]] is a lovely, touching, original work. Every chapter is written from a different person's point of view and seem like disjointed oneshots, but there are stories that continue between chapters. (293,493 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816][Away Childish Things]] is a Drarry fic. I saw it recommended here so frequently I finally read the damn thing and wish I had done so earlier. It is so touching and deals with going through trauma and isolation beautifully. (153,881 words; complete)
- Actually, I've loved most things by the author [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/lettered/pseuds/lettered][Lettered]] (same as Away Childish Things). My favorites are By the Grace, Another Mask Behind You (fair warning: there is SO MUCH sex right from the start), The Fall of the Veils (after war with Muggles and Draco is ace), and The Pure and Simple Truth (Slytherins and Gryffindors are all grown up and off to pubs in various combinations). They are all complete
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15834660/chapters/36872253][Little Deaths and How to Avoid Them (or Draco Malfoy's Guide to Stop Dying and Start Living Instead)]] is a great, nuanced look at an ace character struggling to come to terms with his identity and learn how to set and maintain boundaries. (96k words, complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/741255][The Problem Universe]] will keep you busy! It is complete. The first story in the series has 162 chapters. The main canon divergence in this AU is that Harry fell in love with Potions.
- If you sort Harry Potter fics on AO3 by Kudos, this is the fourth result. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022][Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run]], Harry never received his letter. Voldemort has a controlling interest in the magical world. Hermione and a pack of classmates find Harry, partially to protect him and partially to train him. It is complete.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is an old classic in the fandom. It was originally written pre-HBP, so there are no Horcruxes. It's a response to the Severitus challenge. I've returned to it again and again over the past decade and still love it. (334,522 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875][All Life is Yours to Miss]] is another Drarry fic. Draco and Harry are professors at Hogwarts. Harry is popular and beloved. Draco is a recluse who lives in the dungeon. After a petty prank has consequences, Draco is forced to actually interact with the world. (114,741 words; complete)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852][Turn]] is an extremely popular Drarry fic while also being a bit canon-compliant. Harry does a good deed and helps an old man and, as a "reward" gets a glimpse into another life he could have led. (306,708 words; complete)
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12005755/1/The-Daring-Win][The Daring Win]]: The story you never knew you wanted. The year: 1987. The place: Muggle London. The situation: The Boy-Who-Lived is being treated horribly by his Muggle relatives. A young witch must take him in for the Ministry's good and his. The witch's name: Dolores Umbridge.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] is so popular that I feel embarrassed to include it, but my list wouldn't be complete without it. There is no Harry, only Lord Voldemort trying his damndest to make it through life in Harry's body. It is hilarious.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/2137872][Pandemic]] is an absolutely phenomenal new series. It is a series of stories that take place in pandemics: Spanish flu, polio, HIV, and COVID. I've read the first three and am in love
