Simple question, and while it's undoubtedly been asked and discussed before I thought it was time to bring it back, for the newer members to talk about if nothing else.

Is he just a slightly taller bloke? Maybe 7 foot at most? Or is he truly giant, 8 or 9 foot even? After all he is a *half-giant* since his mother was a full blooded giant. Since Grawp was over 16 feet tall, and was considered *SHORT* for a giant, so on average a male giant would be around 18-20 feet tall, that means Hagrid should be at the very /least/ 9 feet tall, if not 10 or 11 feet!

But if he was 11 feet tall there would be no way for him to fit into most doorways and he would not be able to visit the muggle world at all.

Maybe Dumbledore or some other wizard or witch gave him an enchanted bracelet or something that reduced his size by several feet?

In my headcanon Hagrid is just shy of 9 feet all and has to constantly duck to fit into most doorways, Dumbledore gave him an enchanted necklace, which he wears like a ring that holds a minor confundus charm on it making Muggles think he's smaller than he really is, to them he is around 7 feet tall.


** The movie designers put Robby Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid at 8'6", or 2.6m tall.

I know it's bad form to use movie canon around here, but my mental image of Hagrid is the movie version. He's huge compared to the rest of the cast, but still "reasonably" sized where it's still possible for him to get his head under the doorframe, and his butt behind the High Table for dinner.

*** feet and meters are the easiest to convert. A meter is around 3 feet so that gives you a good estimate. So in your example a 3m tall hagrid is 9 feet tall.

**** It's closer to 10ft because a foot is only 30cm.

***** I realised there was a difference between yards(fancy word for 3 feet) and meters but I didn't realize it was that big of a difference. I kinda assumed the conversion factor between feet and meters was something like 3.05 not 3.28.

****** A meter is pretty darn close to 39 inches, so for every 4 meters, add another foot (that's slightly underestimating it, but it'll be within a few percent of correct)

** Honestly, I think movie-Hagrid is about as big as one could make him and still have it be reasonable for him to be able to get around Hogwarts, and particular through a normal-sized doorway. So I go with that. I could see him possibly a /little/ bigger, but no more than 30-45cm or so.

** 8-9 Feet, but built like a tank so he seems bigger. Think Andre the Giant, he was probably only about 6'10-11 but because his gigantism made him bigger rather then just taller people believed he was 7'4, same sort of thing with Hagrid I think.

** my headcanon matches with canon.

in the first chapter of philosophers stone he's described as nearly twice as tall and five times as wide as that of a normal man.

So for me that's 11 feet but short of 11.5. But I could accept 9.5+, anything less than 9 doesnt seem gigantic enough for me. As for chest and belly, leg, and arm... just big, really really big.

** Hagrid's twice as tall as a person, so like 4m. Yeah, he'd get bonked on muggle doorways and shit, but...

He lives in his own hut at Hogwarts, and then spends all his time out in the woods. So what if he's too tall for inside?

*** Hagrid is canonically about 11.5ft tall. Which honestly makes him wrestling with Grawp way more realistic than the movies.
