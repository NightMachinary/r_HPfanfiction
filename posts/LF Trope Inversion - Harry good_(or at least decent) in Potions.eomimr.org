Practically every story depicts Harry as useless in potions and Draco godlike at potions. Would be nice to see a story where Harry is actually rather good at the subject despite (or in spite) of Snape and Malfoy actually rather poor / average.

Please no bashing/mpreg/crazy age difference ships.


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) major plotpoint is that Harry really likes potions and tries to become a potions master. But he reaches that more through hard work than innate talent.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Where are these stories that you are reading where he's useless at potions? Hell I can't get away from stories where the author over exaggerates Harry's potion skills

*** I know, every fix has Harry nearly godlike levels of potion brewing. It's silly really.

Iirc there is even a Tarzan? cross fic where he is trained by a witch doctor and makes delicate master level potions by the gallon in minutes while dancing. Drives Snape to despair by the end. Wish I could find it again.

  What if Lilly was a little more prepared to escape if Voldemort came calling. She knew that the Floo and Portkeys could be disabled, what if she had found a back door? Just a silly little story of a somewhat different Harry

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Most Slytherin!Harry fics have him decent at potions. I really liked linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). It might not be complete past 6th year, but what is there is pretty good.
