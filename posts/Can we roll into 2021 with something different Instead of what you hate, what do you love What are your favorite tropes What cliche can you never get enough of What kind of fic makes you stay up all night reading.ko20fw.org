** Fluffy rom-com stories that you can tell have some thought put into them. Well-written stories with the twins.

Feel-good family stories usually involving the Weasleys.

Still not sick of 'swapped bodies' stories although probably haven't read enough of them to be sick of them.

Crack like Seventh horcrux or the one where the author deliberately crammed every HP fanfiction trope into it...forget the name

** I love when the main character slowly gets insane. A story where you can see how the insanity slowly grows... each chapter shows you what creates the insanity, how other people are concerned about the main character or (on the opposite) don't see anything. You can see how the main character tries to fight it (the desire of revenge, of blood on their hands), how they hope that nobody finds out. Or maybe you see them being confused why everyone is asking if they're okay and not realising that they are slowly going insane. Resons (as long as they're good) can be any: abuse, lost to much, tries to find a way to bring back their family or friends, etc.

Plus points if old friends face each other in battlefields

I love how sly and twisted Draco is this is so fun to read! I love these characters!! Eugh he's so smart and cold and cunning and cruel it's delightful to read I can really see it on him! My little black heart is grinning maniacally at all the stuff I really shouldn't be grinning so happily at 😈

I love the mystery! I don't know what his motives are at all? I assume good but I don't know how were going to get there. I adore Hermione's fustrations because of how stupidly idealistic the Order is. It's so dark and hopeless and I'm living for it!

I don't read Dramione at all. I think that's working in my favour here because these characters are so OOC that they are HP characters in name only. I love it.

Aurore was wonderful. And James. I just want to hug them oh my.

This was perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Something dark and twisted with cruel intentions and characters who I still don't really like even though I'm sure I was supposed to like them... Hermione is so fustrating and Draco is absolutely terrifying and I don't think I like either of them but I adore the story they were in!!! Eugh Lucius and Astoria! And the Flashbacks were painful! When Harry realises he's a Horcrux? That broke me. Especially because I already knew how the war played out. Having to then watch it play out was just heart breaking...

I really liked how it was almost 3 different stories in one? The opening third is delightfully cruel and twisted. The middle is just a slog of death and destruction. I love it but it was just never ending pain... It was a war. Then the last 3rd was slightly better. I'm glad someone got a happy ending out of it all at the very least.

10/10. I'll be rereading this. Thank you so much for the recommendation!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here]] The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7534131/1/Stunning-Shifts]] During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (Canon, EWE, dimension travel, AU)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13507183/1/How-Like-Home]] When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. What he finds instead is an alternate universe. Harry is recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9649140/1/To-Call-A-Place-Home]] Harry won the war. It's months afterwards and unexpectedly, he's literally picked up off the face of the world and shoved into another. One where Harry Potter died a long time ago. Where the Potter family's still fighting a war against a Dark Lord that's ruling the world one muggle murder at a time. They say he's their only hope. Harry doesn't really want in.

***** Thank you!

Edit: here are some of mine

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12307886/1/Strange-Reflections]] In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16089920]] It was time.

Harry stepped out into the open, breathing in to allow the scent of the forest to calm any nerves he had left. The sky appeared grey in these twilight hours, which he supposed was appropriate for the situation. A dark, but gentle, situation that made Harry feel both serene and frightened at the same time. Nagini was dead, thanks to Neville, and now one curse will win this war.

Harry just needed to die first.

But magic is complicated. Very complicated. So it shouldn't come as a surprise when the killing curse sends him somewhere else.

Somewhere he was dragged from seventeen years ago.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7749775]] Magic could do so much. And also so little.

or; Harry wakes up in a universe not his own.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across_the_Universe]] Not really timetravel, but kind of close. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.

I'm a sucker for Daphne Greengrass, but also enjoy Susan Bones and Katie Bell as love interests. Harry is just so damn isolated all the time that you want more positive human interaction for him.

I want exploration of wizarding culture that isn't superficial or imitation of Victorian Muggle upper classes, and exploration of their history and relationship towards things that are effectively meaningless in the magical world, like race, sex, gender, orientation, and how that impacts their views on Muggles (in such a way that it doesn't become pureblood apologism, nor Mugglewank).

Also I really dislike OOC characters but sometimes when they're given completely different backgrounds than what was canon and they're OOC, i get really intrigued.

** I'm such a huge Dramione fan. I'll read almost anything with draco/hermione. Hurt/comfort dynamic is great, and redeemed!draco is great. Honestly, most pairings of hermione/anyone-not-ron. I just always thought she was too intellectual to be happy with Ron. I could do with less ron-bashing dramione stories. I love ones where Ron is supportive/understanding.

However, you can't really go wrong with time-fravel fics. They're so good! My favorite: The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie on Archive of Our Own. My eyes were so dry and scratchy from all the non-sleep I did devouring this beauty.

I have read a few really great gray!hermione fics where she embraces dark magic as well as light to help the Light get ahead against voldemort.

There's another one where Hermione fakes her parents deaths to save them but....

  They say you always have a choice and I had chosen. I would fight! I was ready to face life with all its ups and downs. I would follow the path of a warrior, not popular but necessary, as I had been part of the war for years. Every year without fail Harry, Ron and I would fight for our lives. Was I, Hermione Granger, a good person and would I still be good after everything was done and finished? This is my story beginning at the end of the holidays after Year Four (GoF), and in the end you'll have to decide if my actions and my decisions were the right ones! HG with SB, DM, SS and LM; HP will play a bigger role as the story progresses!

** Some tropes I enjoy:

1. Prodigy!Harry, in the full sense of the word. Not an overnight power boost but a fic which charts the development of a magical prodigy. Think Santi's "Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived".

2. Powerful, elegant, sophisticated fem!Harry. Think Jasmine Potter from "A Long Journey Home".

3. Expanding canonical-tone magic. Most magic-focused fics go full AU and completely rework the magic system, or go the Mugglewank route of seeking to explain magic in physical terms. It's a rare treat to find a fic which expands magic in a way which is sympathetic to the canonical magic system. Think "What You Leave Behind" by Newcomb.

4. Classism/inequality as a theme, explored through the elite end of magical society. Lord and Ladies not necessary (and indeed they are often a hindrance) but I enjoy fancy balls, formal dinners, and bitchy, gossipy afternoon tea. Plus the more practical side: estate management, magical agriculture, expansion of the political system in a way that makes sense given the size of the society, etc. Hard to think of a fic which has fully realised this, but Android Knight's "The Minister" was promising before it was abandoned far too early.

5. Harry learning magical traditions, especially where they involve what might be called "little magic" - small pieces of relatively inconsequential but aesthetically pleasing magic which hint at the fact that wizards' magic goes deeper than wand-waving. Extra points when these traditions are obscure/secret/forbidden in some sense. Prime example of this is Raining Ink's "Out of the Night".

6. Gen fics or fics where Harry has multiple non-serious relationships. If there must be a "pairing", then one of: Harry/Ginny; Harry/Hermione; Harry/Daphne; Harry/Susan; Harry/Fleur; Harry/Parvati; Harry/Lavender; Harry/Pansy; Harry/fem!Harry.

** James Sirius Potter/OFC. Quality probably doesn't matter beyond a certain level. I've read two good ones, the rest are basically just different variations on the theme.

I also like time travel and alternative realities. But, in principle, it probably needs to be Hinny these days. At the start of last year (2020) I was definitely reading fics which didn't feature Harry as the main character but I may have entrenched on that as well. In some ways I hope not because most of the time travel ones I read were using different POVs to Harry.

I also have a soft spot for the Hinny Muggle AU.

** I really like reading power (crossover or otherwise, maybe just "Power the Dark Lord Knows Not") fics that stay in the Harry Potter verse, where JUST Harry gets reasonable powerups but it doesn't bleed into the whole verse and give everyone powerups. Like if Harry gets a few extra powerups, and Voldemort loses PIS and actually has a brain, where the "70 year old elite Dark Wizard vs 17 year old" fight is actually made interesting by the crossover power, rather than Voldemort being a moron that only uses three spells unless he's fighting Dumbledore, he's the terrifying Dark Lord, and Harry's Crossover power makes it so Harry can win in a way that isn't "My wand not yours GG"

You can add Drama without powering up the Villain, ESPECIALLY in Harry Potter, just by making them competent with their skillsets. Like where if the power the Dark Lord knows not is being immune to magic, Voldemort doesn't think "MORE AVADAS! THAT'LL WORK!" Like the canon one would, he uses the environment, drops boulders, banishes rocks at Harry, traps him under buildings, that sort of thing. And if that's written well, it's amazing.

It's a marauder fic but linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) has the best character development ive ever read. Follows Remus from 1st year to OoTP but he grew up in a children's home so he's real rough around the edges to start off with. Then a bunch of stuff happens and we see him turn into the quiet guy from the books who just wants to help. It's genuinely brilliant and completely engaging. There's development of the werewolf stories and the history of the order. It really gives a canonical history to the books 😊

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise!

** I like reading about the perspective of other characters and other timelines, while sticking primarily with the canon. I like reading about various forms of magic. I like to read about gradual transitions either from good to evil or evil to good. I am not a big romance fan but I like to read fics about dysfunctional relationships, particularly where one of them is emotionally abusive towards the other.

It's PoA from Remus's point of view and how he came about trusting Sirius. It was fun to see a different side to the story.

** I really like the idea of the Wrong Boy who Lived story, however, I've never found one where Harry is revealed to be the real BWL. They are either unfinished, with the story not having reached the point where Harry is revealed to be the real BWL, or Harry actually isn't the BWL. I just want to read about everyone realising how shitty they've treated their real "saviour" while his twin brother has been spoiled for no reason.

** Stories where a genuine mystery is built up convincingly and with enough intrigue and surprise to not spoil it until the end. The payoff has to be worth it though! A good example would be linkffn(The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks) - to one of my previous recommendations of this fic, someone described it as a story you can curl up with it and a hot chocolate on a cold night and just enjoy. I think that fits it well.

** Fix-its, fluff and comedy.

Really well-written AUs, where rules are changed or explored in a depth that just doesn't exist in the original novels. Where magic is interesting and new. Or where canon is just.. tossed out. Totally rearranged.

I really get tired of rehashed canon plotlines. Having characters just go totally off-script is more appealing. None of this stone in first year, basilisk in second, sirius in third, and so on madness for the umpteenth time. Unless it's all done /really/ differently.

In general: Difference.

OCs and self-inserts can be nice. Prefer them not taking over the body of an existing character. Something about that kind of transmigration has always rubbed me the wrong way - makes them an.. imposter. Changeling. I know I'm overthinking that and I /do/ enjoy those stories in this fandom and beyond. But, "prefer".

** I love Harry adopted into a loving family fics I'll be able to read them forever. I also like fics that focus on magic/spell creation though I don't read those that much. Fics with pranks will always be some favorites of mine. I might be the first to admit but when it's done well I enjoy dumbledore bashing since fics where good guys are bad are something I find interesting.
