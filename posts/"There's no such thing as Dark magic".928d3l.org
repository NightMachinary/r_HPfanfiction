I'm sure we've all seen statements like that before in "Grey" Harry stories. Or hell, even straight up evil Harry stories where the author tries to justify Harry's plain descent into becoming Voldemort-lite. It's rampant.

But what I'd really like to see is a story where Harry is an out and out good guy. No ifs ands or buts, and Dark Magic really is dark. It corrupts the user, messes with their mind, warps them, and so on. Whatever happens s in this universe though, Harry is scared. Terrified of what's to come and doesn't think he's prepared. Maybe Dumbledore died early, who knows. So Harry dabbles in Dark Magic, and gets deeper and deeper into it because he just wants to make sure he and everyone he cares about makes it out of the war alive.

Naturally angst and everything ensue, as he tries to battle the corrupting influence of the dark magic, and maybe hiding it from his loved ones. No bashing, or manipulative Dumbledore or any of that shit. Just a kid getting in over his head due to fear and the pressures he feels.

Basically, Good!Harry using genuinely dark magic and trying to make it out of the plot with his soul and principles intact.

I personally wouldn't consider this "Grey" but maybe people have just ruined the "Grey" label. I dunno, but almost every single one is awful.

More Dark magic less cliche ass justifications and hand waives, while keeping Harry's character intact (aka, no Harry in name only)


** For some strange reason I'm reminded of the Dark Chips from Megaman Battle Network. Very powerful battle chips (translation: digital weapons), but they're addictive, erode the connection between NetNavi (personal A.I. assistants) and their Operators (humans who use them), and can ultimately destroy the data of the NetNavi that uses them, turning them into a Dark NetNavi (like, intelligent and highly destructive malware).

*** Coincidentally, while I've never played the Battle Network games, I saw someone talk about the Dark Chips online about a week ago, so I'm familiar with them, haha. Using them permanently lowers health in one of the games right?

Still, I could imagine a plot like that for Harry Potter; in an encounter with Bellatrix Lestrange, Harry resorts to using a powerful Dark Magic curse in order to survive (come to think of it, he did attempt to use Crucio on her in canon...).

Though Bellatrix is crippled by the devastatingly powerful Dark spell, Harry's heart is tainted by its use; he finds himself viewing Draco Malfoy and his cronies with more malice, contemplating torture and murder as solutions to his problems, dreaming of destroying his enemies and conquering the world...

Faced with an army of Death Eaters and Voldemort out to kill him, can Harry withstand the allure of Dark Magic, ignore its whispering hints that it could solve all his problems, and survive the onslaught without becoming a worse Dark Lord than Voldemort?

** Too Young To Die linkffn(9057950)

It handles Dark Magic really well in a way that actually makes sense about why it's "Dark". In most fics and in canon, there is nothing specified about why Dark Magic is actually bad, except that it's supposedly more deadly (though we never really see any actual evidence of this). It really annoys me when I see that focused on in fics and they do it wrong, where people are terrified of a spell that can freeze your blood, but a reducto in the vicinity of a person can kill just as easily and nobody bats an aye.

In this story, Dark Magic is straight up addictive. Like a drug. It makes the user feel pleasure when inflicting pain using Dark Magic on another living being. And Harry actually get's really Dark IMO, but the author seemed to think that Harry was mostly Grey, but had a singular focus and wouldn't let much get in the way. I felt like Harry deserved to die or go to prison for life before halfway through the story and the author kept making authors notes making it sound like they didn't think Harry was all too bad.

*** Yeah that's the kinda thing I would want, Dark Magic wise, but that Harry sounds a little too edgy for my tastes. That's why I can see where authors' are coming from with the whole "it's the intent that matters" conceit, because a reducto to the face is just as deadly as an avada kedavra, but I just think it's more interesting for dark magic to be genuinely corrosive. Kinda like dark side force stuff in Star Wars

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
