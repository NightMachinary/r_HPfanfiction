I read this a long time ago, so forgive me if my description is a bit lacking

-Harry/Ginny and many other standard pairings -It was pretty epic length I believe -The one major point I remember (I'm sorry that I can't remember more, but I do remember that it was extremely well written) was a tournament in the DA, bracket style, where Harry and Ginny ended up facing each other. They had a massive fight just before the match, and instead of dueling, Harry allowed her to use a hex that blasted him with boxing gloves to let her anger out, and I believe they made up soon after.

I would love the help! I remember that story very fondly!


** It's linkffn(Need by iluvfanfics1). The duel happens in chapter 21.

  Their nightmares and demons bound them together. Their love helped them to survive. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley knew they needed each other the trouble was in admitting it.

**** You're not an idiot! Reading so many fics it's easy to not remember which one is which. I only remembered this one by your reference to the punching hex.
