Seven seasons, each following a year of schooling with a group of Hogwarts students. Set after the Battle of Hogwarts, following a mixed group from each House as they go through their school careers. Possibly a movie afterwards as they tackle adult life.

I'm thinking live action, although an anime could be cool.

Start with all these little firsties on the Express, nervous about sorting. They start to make friendships, then get divided up into different Houses; some try to stick together, some are full into House rivalries. About two or three episodes in (around Halloween?) they form some sort of inter-House club or study group, and start working towards friendships again.


** Loool I have the same idea!

Only mine is written rather than acted as a lot of ppl here cone from different places. I for one aren't really bothered to travel from London. An anime could work.

But I think the sitcom should be Friends but with magic, staring Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Draco and Lisa Turnip.

** It would be kinda difficult to get good acting out of 11 year olds. I'd be really interested in parks and rec/office hybrid set in the MoM in the year between the wars. It could show how ineffective fudge is and how government is still shit even when magic is real

True enough, although it's nothing Hollywood hasn't dealt with before - using slightly older kids, for example. The movies didn't do /too/ badly in their casting, after all.

Probably one more element in favor of an anime (or CG), though. Thing is that my thoughts lean more towards a "slice of life" comedy or dreams revolving around the mundanity of magical society as opposed to World!,Ending!DRAMA! as we saw in the books or in a lot of anime. These aren't Chosen Ones, they aren't being raised to save the world, they're just kids in a really, really out there society.

Your idea also sounds hilarious, definitely leaning towards black comedy as things get closer to Voldemort's return.

**** Movies were a series of miracles. Do you know how much of a risk it was, casting 10-12 year olds for a movie series that lasted 10 years and involved a hell lot of character development. These became world famous before they hit puberty. Any of them could have a problematic puberty, ala Miley Cyrus and the producers would have to recast. Thankfully, only the guy who played Crabbe (or Goyle) became a problem and had to have his character switched with Zabini in the last movie.
