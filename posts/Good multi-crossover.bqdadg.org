I'm looking for a good fic that combines 3 or more fandoms including Harry Potter, I've only read *Kaleidoscope of Magic in those parameters and that one is regrettably abandoned*


** I typically have a one crossover at a time policy. It is easy to learn one fandom you don't know, but more than that can get confusing.

"What do you mean the TARDIS is powered by the /Eye/ of Harmony? I swore It was powered by the /Elements/ of Harmony!"

"Harry's wand has a phoenix feather core? I thought it had one of Ho-oh's tail feathers in it?"

"Wait... He-Man's powers DON'T come from the chaos emeralds?"

"So what's the canon relationship between Goku and All Might like?"

*** But I do have one I love, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725354/1/][Gods Among Us]] Is a fantastic Crossover between Harry Potter and Battlestar Galactica with a bit of stargate. Harry and Hermione get flung to the Pegasus galaxy where they are found by the Battlestar Triton.

  Fate is a funny thing sometimes. Harry Potter and his friends survived their trial by fire and defeated Voldemort. A year has passed and Hermione Granger is apprenticed as a Curse Breaker. When she discovers an ancient tomb she talks Harry into helping with the excavation. Now they are trapped and they'll need a miracle to survive. HP/BSG now with quite a bit of Stargate in the mix

** Multi Crossovers are hard to come by, especially good ones. You'd probably be better off just looking for single xovers.

Also, does KoM really count? If so, maybe try linkffn(Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) which, though also having a sharingan!harry focuses a lot on Fate/ magic.

Also, assuming you liked KoM, you'd also probably enjoy linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) assuming you haven't already read it.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

*** I wouldn't say KoM is a crossover in the true sense. A crossover is when characters from different works /crossover/ into either universe, or both universes are merged somehow. Like the Elemental Countries of Naruto being hidden by magic from mundane eyes but are still in the same Earth as the magical world of Harry Potter.

KoM is a story that borrows elements from Naruto but isn't a true crossover. :)
