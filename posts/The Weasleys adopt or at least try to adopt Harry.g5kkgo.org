Remember Molly Weasley saying Harry is as good as a son to her in Order of the Phoenix? Yeah, I can see this woman trying to adopt him.

Tangent: How can anyone bash Molly. I can understand with Ron, but her? That woman was an angel.


** One of the people her boggart showed dead was Harry. I never understood how people can portray her as a greedy pawn who only took care of Harry so that she can steal money from him. Like seriously.

**** Well, her overprotectiveness did annoy me sometimes during my teenage years and still sometimes does.

Harry already was in the centre of the war. He already did some serious things. She was being delusional. As a byproduct, she was also condescending? patronizing? although purely by accident.

I like her a lot, but I can see clearly why someone would get annoyed with this.

Yes, fine, don't send Harry to the war front or on missions, etc. But you could at least not keep him from vital information which includes his very person?

No? No?

***** It also comes across as not recognising Harry's involvement and effort in the fight so far. Harry was important enough for Voldemort to plan a whole school year to get him to use his blood for his resurrection ritual. Do you think that this is going to change and that Harry will no longer be a target?

That Molly ignores this and calls him a child showcases her blindness to reality that Harry is in the center of it and Harry's need to understand the happenings in the war.

***** Another important point is that the Order never gave Harry any way of contacting them in case in he was in trouble and needed help. This is something you tell every one of your kids about; how to get in touch with an adult in cases of emergency, and Harry has already been targeted multiple times for assassination.

The Order was using the Patronus Charm to send messages securely. Guess who can produce a corporeal Patronus as well? Harry should at least have been told about the possibility and to practice it in private at school. (Dumbledore uses it this way in GoF so the Doylist explanation that Rowling hadn't invented it yet doesn't apply.)

Sirius gave the mirror but was very vague about what it did /due to Molly./ And Harry, afraid to use it believing it would draw Sirius out of hiding, never thought of it when he needed it. He was a scared kid who was denied trust and support when he most needed it and suffered for it.

#+begin_quote
  “A way of letting me know if Snape's giving you a hard time. *No, don't open it in here!*” said Sirius, with a wary look at Mrs. Weasley, who was trying to persuade the twins to wear hand-knitted mittens. *“I doubt Molly would approve --- but I want you to use it if you need me, all right?”*

  “Okay,” said Harry, stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket, but he knew he would never use whatever it was. It would not be he, Harry, who lured Sirius from his place of safety, no matter how foully Snape treated him in their forthcoming Occlu­mency classes.

************ I always got the impression that he was unable to do so.

#+begin_quote
  'Get up!' said Snape sharply. 'Get up! You are not trying, you are making no effort. You are allowing me access to memories you fear, handing me weapons!'

  Harry stood up again, his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen Cedric dead in the graveyard. Snape looked paler than usual, and angrier, though not nearly as angry as Harry was.

  'I - am - making - an - effort,' he said through clenched teeth.

  'I told you to empty yourself of emotion!'

  'Yeah? Well, I'm finding that hard at the moment,' Harry snarled.

  Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord!' said Snape savagely. 'Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves, who cannot control their emotions, who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easily - weak people, in other words - they stand no chance against his powers! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease, Potter!'
#+end_quote

This implies that Harry was truly unable to do so. And his current state of being under a lot of stress is one of the major factors as it has a huge impact on someone's emotional health.

As for resisting Voldemort after Dobby's death.

#+begin_quote
  His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.
#+end_quote

He is not clearing his mind of emotion. He is filled with overwhelming amount of grief similar to how he was after Sirius died and Voldemort possessed him.

And about the other quote, read the second sentence, Harry is using the emotional control necessary for Occlumency, which he specifically refers to as what Snape tried to teach him.

************** Lol, what am I even doing... xD I really like Molly and avoid any “bashing” tags like fire, but I feel like this narration is being unfair to Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Why would you give Harry any information about the war when he can't do anything useful with it [...]
#+end_quote

Not any information. Information pertaining to him. It's not about that he wouldn't do anything useful with it, it's about 1) knowing what should make him even more vigilant and careful 2) trust 3) having access to information about yourself.

#+begin_quote
  [...] and isn't even able to protect his minds against anyone who wants that information [...]
#+end_quote

So do you assume every member of Order that knew anything about anything could? Are you sure? If memory serves me well enough, it was never stated that Order members were required to learn Occlumency. Besides, there are other means -- Imperius, Confundus, Veritaserum, torture, even Amortentia could make someone spill all the info. This argument is moot to me, as the only reason Harry was told to learn Occlumency was because Voldemort himself had access to his mind. He wouldn't need to learn it otherwise, as probably no one else besides active spies had to.

#+begin_quote
  [...] not to mention that Harry literally had a mental connection to Voldmort.
#+end_quote

Yes, that. Imagine what would happen if Voldemort found out from Harry's brain this secret knowledge about what he wants to get prophecy from DoM. What a revelation this would be to him.

#+begin_quote
  Again what would he do with such information [...]
#+end_quote

It's not about what he would do with it. I really doubt that every Order member has use of every information they have, it's about knowledge. Communication. Knowing what to expect. Nothing makes people as prone to making mistakes as a lack of information does. Which is exactly what happened.

#+begin_quote
  [...] he was already protected by the Order and Dumbledore.
#+end_quote

Physically, yes. But it was a misdirected effort. Dumbledore knew or strongly suspected that Voldemort will want to work Harry from the inside so he tried to do something about it by sending Harry to Occlumency lessons. Point to him. With Snape. Point withdrawn.

#+begin_quote
  [...] while he himself isn't particularly talented compared to any trained adult members of the Order or the Death Eater.
#+end_quote

Well, yes, but he would not be sent to fight or spy or whatever, he would just know why he should be more wary of visions from DoM... This does not require any skill.

#+begin_quote
  If Harry had been willing to learn Occlumency as Dumbledore told him to, this wouldn't have been necessary.
#+end_quote

You're making excuses for Molly or against Harry yet are unwilling to turn a blind eye to Harry's circumstances. You judge him harshly. So is he a child and should not be given any responsibility or was all this his responsibility, his fault? Neither here nor there. It's in the middle. Information concerning his person should be given to him.\\
Also -- if Dumbledore himself taught Harry Occlumency he'd probably have much better results.

#+begin_quote
  The problem wasn't that Harry was unable to learn, the problem was that he wasn't willing to learn.
#+end_quote

He was. He just wanted to understand why, what's happening. His visions helped, but he's being told they're bad. Okay, why? Because Voldemort can manipulate you? How for example? ... See? At least Dumbledore had an idea of how Voldemort would want to manipulate Harry.\\
But I don't understand how Occlumency argument places in discussion about Molly's denial. So it's okay for Molly and the rest of adults to make mistakes but Harry can't make them? Especially since a big part of his mistakes stemmed directly from the mistakes of adults around him.

#+begin_quote
  Also in Canon Harry literally learned Occlumency while digging Dobby's grave, I don't think the stress in fifth year compares to that.
#+end_quote

As was quoted below, I too believe it's just a matter of strong emotions, like how in MoM Harry "expelled" Voldemort by feeling love. Voldemort as is, is just not built to feel such emotions.\\
Also, are you really trying to tell me that Harry just got insta-good at Occlumency, because Dobby's death and his burial made him all zen? I seriously doubt it works like that.\\
Besides that I think it makes a lot of difference that Harry, while still very much lost, isn't at the same time confused by having information obscured from him. It's still chaos, but at least he feels integrity from within the group he trusts.

So if Harry learned Occlumency telling him important information about himself wouldn't be necessary. I'm turning this around -- if Harry was openly told important information about himself, Occlumency would not be necessary. It still would be useful, but not necessary.

Voldemort already knows what Voldemort wants...

Also would Occlumency really help if Harry's Voldemort's horcrux? I'd think Voldemort's pretty skilled in Occlumency and yet Harry was able to enter his mind. And that was after this whole DoM fiasco, so you'd think Voldemort was pretty aware of consequences.

And honestly, it's not the matter of if Harry would this then that would happen, it's a matter of /Molly not recognizing Harry's center role in this conflict and deluding herself and in process hurting Harry's interests instead of helping them as she meant to do/. He was kidnapped and almost murdered in ritual, Voldemort is obsessed with killing him prophecy or not, Harry already did things that made him Voledmort's enemy through and through, but yeah, sure I guess, if he doesn't know then nothing will happen to him.

I don't think she should be bashed though, but I think bashing shouldn't be done most of the time anyway. Unless it's being done expressly for a purpose that works (eg.

** There are things in the books that lend themselves to multiple interpretations and some of these interpretations do not put Molly in a good light. So it is those interpretations that the various fan fics use to justify the various levels of Molly and/or Weasley bashing.

For instance, in the very First book the first time that we meet the Weasley family they are on the Muggle side of the barrier at King Cross loudly talking about 1. All the Muggles around and 2. What's the platform again. The first item could potentially breach the Statute of Secrecy by drawing attention to wizards and witches. The second one is just plain curious.

Why would Molly need to ask where the platform is considering she went there for 7 years (so roughly between 28 and 42 trips to the platform). Then add all of the multiple trips for each of her kids (obviously trips to drop off or retrieve multiple kids count as one trip). So that means that she had at least 9 additional years (36 - 54 trips) of going to the platform.

So why was she loudly using wizarding terms and talking about a wizarding barrier surrounded by Muggles? Now being nice she could have been trying to keep the two youngest Weasleys excited and involved. Of course, the same scenario gives those who don't believe in coincidences the idea that the entire scenario was nothing more than a setup.

Then to continue. As a mother how could she not notice Harry's neglected appearance (glasses haphazardly repaired, very worn out massively oversized clothes, very skinny undersized 11 yr old etc). Then add the summer where her boys talk about the bars they had to rip off Harry's window (the only window on the entire house that had them), the bedroom door that locked from the outside, the cat flap on the bedroom door to pass what little food in, and then all of Harry's belongings locked up in the cupboard under the stairs.

When you add all those things together it's clear that Harry is being abused but the mother in Molly doesn't see it nor does she do anything to correct it. So again it gives those who believe there is a conspiracy more ammunition for Molly bashing. On the nice side it could just be that she didn't see it or since she would never abuse a child she just couldn't believe it and like many in the real world second guess themselves and arrive at the conclusion that they must be mistaken and Harry can't be being abused.

Then of course you can look at how Molly treats Sirius in his own house and how it often seems that she tries to restrict Harry's and Sirius' time together. It's clear that she really doesn't like Sirius and doesn't think he's a good role model even though he's Harry's godfather and she is officially nothing to Harry. Eg Sirius should have whatever access to Harry he wants. There's a nice little short story called Reclaiming the House of Black by faewm that has Sirius standing up for himself and putting Molly in her place when it comes to Grimmauld Place.

linkao3(15711795)

There's another story where Harry decides he's going to spend more time with Sirius and get the training he needs. It's called Home Schooled by kb0

linkffn(12581279)

There is also her orchestration of who works with whom and who sits where. Again it all could be quite innocent but there is enough room for interpretation to allow for a more sinister opinion eg that Molly is trying to force or ensure a relationship between Harry and Ginny as well as between Hermione and Ron by limiting the time that Harry and Hermione can spend together and increasing the time they are with their respective Weasley counterparts.

Then of course you have Molly admitting to using a love potion on Arthur while they were in Hogwarts. A potion that is considered illegal to have in Hogwarts and depending which specific potion was used (not sure if that was ever identified in canon) completely illegal to brew. Basically admitting that she used the equivalent of liquid imperius/date rape drug to get Arthur interested in her. That gave rise to the whole potion mistress trope and the belief that the only way Hermione would be with Ron would be if she was potioned. And of course the same with Ginny.

I can completely understand that view as for the first 4 to 4 1/2 books I saw nothing but a budding romance between Harry and Hermione and could not contemplate Hermione getting together with Ron. And in terms of Harry getting with Ginny there was so little interaction between them in those books that the idea of them getting together wasn't even a vague thought.

So what does this all mean (besides me wasting a little time commenting). Is that I believe that there is enough flexibility/room for interpretation in canon for folks to assign any set of reasons/justifications for the characters to explain their actions. From the completely innocent and benign to wholly manipulative and evil.

I will admit that I read fan fics that run the gamut of that spectrum but that the majority of the fics I like to read move away from the innocent and benign and tend to spend more time in the manipulative/evil category. And I believe that is due to how the series ended eg with Harry and Hermione not together. So those fics that tend towards manipulative/evil help to explain in my opinion how unfathomably canon ended like it did.

Well that's my two cents on how folks could decide that Molly could be a valid bashing target.

"Loudly" is a very relative term. Harry naturally hears the word "muggle" because "muggle" is not an ordinary word. It means something to him.

If I heard the surname of distant relatives or obscure people I admire, I would naturally become curious and want to know if the people discussing it were kindred spirits.

There are far greater breaches of the Statue of Secrecy that nobody ever seems to be bothered to bring up--Malfoy and his "escapes from helicopters" for example.

Anybody with small children will tell you that that is precisely what is happening.

And bear in mind, this is our first glimpse at a Wizarding /family./ We got to see Hagrid, and the wizards of Diagon Alley, and Malfoy the brat, but this is our first family.

When our baseline is the Durselys, the Weasleys stand out that much more. Mrs. Weasley is actively engaged with her children.

Harry's clothes are second-hand and don't fit him. That could very easily describe any of her own children, who all wear second-hand robes, and it's repeatedly mentioned that they don't always fit because children grow at different rates.

She didn't see any of this for herself, and to my recollection Harry doesn't confirm what her sons report. She has not see these bars, she did not see the cat flap, and keeping possessions under the stairs is not inherently suspicious.

There's also the not unreasonable notion that "my sons stole their father's illegally modified car and /flew/ it to Surrey and back" consumed her mind.

As much as I love Sirius, he is not in any position to be a guardian. He is a wanted fugitive--albeit from a crooked bastard of a government, but he's still a marked man.

And Sirius is very, very reckless with an absolute disregard for the rules. That's not exactly the mark of a good role model.

She's not trying to restrict their time together. She's trying to keep everyone safe. There's a big damn difference and you ignore it.

Molly says that sometimes, she hears Sirius talk and it's like he thinks he's got his best friend back. Whatever his claims to the contrary, Sirius does behave quite a bit like this.

And "godfather" is not a legal term. Traditionally, it means that Sirius is responsible for the /spiritual upbringing/ for Harry. This doesn't mean that Sirius is to raise Harry if James and Lily die.

First, the text never says it was Arthur. At all. You're reading something that wasn't there.

Second, it is heavily implied that this stunt blew up in Molly's face, and it's something she laughs about now.

Love potions wear off, and there is no evidence whatsoever that she continues to dose Arthur, not that she ever did in the first place.

Rowling is a master at Chekov's Gun--and there was no Chekov's Gun towards Arthur and Molly having anything else than the best romance in the entire bloody franchise.

****** This is just my personal opinion, but to me, there's something less awkward, or potentially dodgy about a child approaching an adult to ask for help. An adult going up to a child, and offering assistance could be seen as a potentially far more awkward/inappropriate situation, though. Even an adult that seems to have children could be accused of doing the wrong thing/overstepping the bounds.

As well as this, it also provides a way for the adult that he may have potentially been waiting for, to not feel as though they're having their toes stepped on, so to speak. She didn't know Harry from a bar of soap, so it was entirely his choice to approach and ask.

I know that's not completely logical, but what about Wizards and Witches is? Anyway, that's my headcanon, and I like it. C:

**** Thanks for the response I appreciate it. On some of these we will have to agree to disagree. Though I'll only do a few examples as a complete point by point counter to your point by point would probably be very tedious and not entertain anyone.

However, my main point is there is enough "wiggle room" in canon to support almost whatever outcome you desire. How well someone is able to justify and build a story line from that is dependent on their writing skills.

For instance, on the love potion you're correct that I assumed it was used on Arthur. The canon doesn't support that. But the canon also doesn't support that the stunt blew up on her. Basically all the canon says is that Molly told the two girls that she brewed a love potion and the girls were giggling.

We don't know why she brewed it, where she brewed it, which love potion she made, if she used it, if it worked, etc. We don't know if the girls were giggling because Molly told them there was this cute boy she wanted to notice her etc.

For those that don't think there is "anything" there the simple fact that Molly stated she brewed a love potion in the past is not sufficient evidence to create an entire story line of "Molly the Love Potion Mistress". For those who want to explore that story line that simple fact is all they need to justify it.

As far as the Statute of Secrecy, I wasn't trying to identify all possible violations. And I agree with you that if Malfoy was telling the truth (and not just spinning bs) about out flying helicopters then that was a much more egregious violation.

And you're right that "Loudly" is very subjective. Going by the movie for the "degree" of loudness (which isn't always a good thing to do as they changed some book details), Molly was quite a bit away from Harry and in fact there were people much closer to her than Harry was. So the fact that Harry heard her clearly means that the people around her also heard her.

So again, for the people who don't think there is "anything" there that scene doesn't provide sufficient justification for any conspiracy storyline. Hell even though the books never state it you could simply assume that they have muggle avoidance and muggle notice me not charms up and could basically shout at the top of their lungs and they would only be heard by wizards the muggles would be completely unaware.

As I said I read the full spectrum from benign to evil. And I believe there is enough "wiggle room" there to at least justify almost any story lines (though I fully admit some lines are seriously nebulous and require much more work).

Thanks again for taking time to respond and point out your disagreements.
