I brew a pot of coffee for my grandma and I. Then I turn to the cabinet to see if we have any biscuits left. I have the day off, why not 1 or 2? Then I stop. Cookies! I should be looking for cookies. I'm born and bred U.S. American and we dip cookies in coffee and biscuits in gravy.

Am I reading too much Fanfic if my internal cultural language is shifting?

True, I've dreamed of moving to a European or Scandinavian country since I was a little girl and ensconce myself in the Old world histories, but that ought not change my natural definitions. Besides I haven't studied Bokmål since school started back up so hester are back to horses and I'd like a cheese sandwich not ost smørbrød please.

** I mean, so long as you don't start calling them solicitors instead of lawyers, you're probably okay. The rest of the time, we totes win the slang game, but calling them solicitors is just weird. The phrase "My solicitor is charging me to defend me against a charge of solicitation." is a perfectly valid thing to say in British English.

I admit I had to google what a biscuit was across the pond and had no idea you guys really dip pseudo-scones in gravy. I'd never heard of that before outside of movies and such, and I still have no idea how accurately those represent US culture. I was genuinely surprised to find Solo Cups weren't just a Hollywood thing to make props look more distinctive and visible on camera.

If it's any consolation, it happens to us in England too. As an example, we used to call the teenage/second-level of education 'Secondary Schools', but more and more schools are being termed 'high schools' now. It's cool. Give it a few hundred years and most cultures will have melded more closely together anyway. Change makes life interesting and all that, right? :)

***** Yeah, you're right about that. I still have to pause and think about it whenever I hear the new version, though. Old habits die hard and all that. I've never heard of a Primary School being an Elementary School yet, but as I'm twenty-three and not employed in Education, I don't spend any time around primary schools. I only go past my secondary school because it's on my bus route. :)

Me either. I've never really seen anyone do it aside from linking to other places. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I googled it though, and I have to say it really looks like a scone in Peppercorn Sauce. Our gravy tends to be darker brown. Whatever the liquid, it does make more sense to cover or crumble though. Dipping them is just unwieldy. I think our closest equivalent for that is Dumplings. Doughy-floury, slightly-squished sphere-things. We do dip those and have them in different ways with gravy, but scones are just jam and butter. :)

****** That picture's gravy is very light, I prefer my milk gravy darker than that. I prefer brown gravy over almost any milk gravy though.

I'm an aide at a secondary school, someday I'd love to become a full teacher but other priorities take precedence.

I believe if I ever traveled to Great Britain, I know enough of the differences to not make a complete fool of myself. I want to learn more if you'll teach me. I know what I do from fanfiction (my copy of the HP books are Americanized unfortunately), Dr. Who, and some British classical literature. I will probably never be able to move to Norway, but I'd like to travel to see where my ancestors (according to ancestry DNA website). Even if we stick to Norway, Iceland, and Sweden knowing what they mean in English would make things easier. I'm learning Bokmål (Norwegian) via Duolingo which supposedly close enough to Swedish and Icelandic to be vaguely understood in the other two countries. Honestly, I think I'm too embarrassed to go to England. But seeing Ireland has been a dream since I was 6.

******* Brown gravy and tea will be enough to make you fit in with any British mealtime. :)

Heh. That's quite understandable. Life so often gets in the way of you actually doing what you want with it.

I'd be willing to answer any questions you have, sure. I can only give you a Northern English view, though. I've only been to the South once in my life. Same with Ireland, actually. My family are from Donegal (the North-west) of Ireland and I regularly spend summers there, but I've never been down south there either.

I've also travelled across Scandinavia and between a good map and a good pocket dictionary/guidebook you'll be fine. Knowing English is very common in European Countries generally and Scandinavia is no different. So long as you make an effort to speak the language, most people will be happy and friendly to you. If memory serves, Norway has the most range of dialects and that'll cause some bother, but all the Scandinavian languages are very sing-songy and broadly similar enough that you'll find it easier to move from one to another.

I'm told a couple of good tv shows to watch if you're interested in modern British culture are Shameless and Skins. I've not seen much of either myself, they're a little grungy for my taste in entertainment, but they're very good looks at some of the culture here.

It's like a wider version of the classic french baguette. Soft, round ends and those jagged slashes across the top. I think it's sold as something like 'Mediterranean Bread' in the US? They're usually found in the Whole Foods-type stores. It is great stuff. :)
