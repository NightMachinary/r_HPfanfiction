Title pretty much says it all. Complete and Harry makes nicey nice with the mean ole goblins. Could be as extreme as Harry Crow or just the gobs give him a better interest rate or something, but I'd prefer more closer to the former than the latter.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

  My own response to Reptilia28's challenge. Harry died in the battle with Voldemort. What happens when he meets the Grim Reaper? Especially when the Reaper isn't happy with him. Rating changed to more appropriate one. HHr. Other pairings as they come.
