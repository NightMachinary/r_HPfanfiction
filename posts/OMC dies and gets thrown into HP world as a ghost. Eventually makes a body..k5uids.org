:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic that I read a little while ago; I can't really remember the sweeping story, beyond that it was a pre-Hogwarts fix-it-fic, but I can remember a number of unique details.

The story begins with our protagonist, a British man in his approximate 40s, with children, who is abruptly and tragically killed by unsecured round-stock flying off the back of a truck he was following, and pinning him to the seat of his car. He promptly finds himself floating in a dark room with a little boy. The dark room eventually turns out to be a cupboard under the stairs, about 20 years in the past. The little boy turns out to be HP, and queue sudden Ghost Dad!

Shenanigans ensue and Ghost Dad does what any decent adult should and tries to Make Harry Happy.

Ghost Dad eventually gets to explore the world of magic and starts trying to get a body back, and eventually gets to meet the Flamels and other alchemists, and grows a new body.

At some point Bellatrix gets out of Azkaban, I think they probably break her out, but she's actually not insane, and they ‘kill' her and grow her a new body too.

That's all I can remember, I'd love to be able to find it again; I remember really enjoying it. Also, sorry for the terrible grammar - I am very tired.

Edit: The fic is called ‘The Ghost of Privet Drive' by AndrewWolfe. It is on AO3. Cheers to the great [[/u/nyajinsky][u/nyajinsky]] for the very quick find.

*** I read almost exclusively on AO3 and FFN, so it will be either of them, but I am more inclined to say FFN because I have just been through all of the OMC fics that also contain Bellatrix on AO3, ad could not find it there.
