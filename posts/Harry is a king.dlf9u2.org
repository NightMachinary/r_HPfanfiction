So basically its after third year and Harry claims his title through Gringotts as heir to Arthur Pendragon and king of Britain. The first thing he does is snap Dracos arm and kill Lucius Malfoy for attacking him (I think he may get trained in a time compression chamber.) He doesn't reveal he is Harry Potter but uses his king of Britain disguise to change the politics of the world and fight to have goblins, centaurs, elves and the like in government as well. He uses the hounds of hell (knights of camelot preserved in avalon to serve the king) to kill all those with the dark mark and stop the world cup attack. I don't know if its finished or not but I can't find it. Anyone know what its called.
