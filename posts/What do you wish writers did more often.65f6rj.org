*** I often use names when there's a group of one or more people or the character wants their attention, hence the name drop. I do get annoyed when every line has a name, however. Even more so when there are only two people speaking and in the setting.

As for apostrophes, I was taught to use them differently each year. Some people said that James's was right and other that James' was right.

My mind tends to autocorrect anything I see. I can read my own story 3 or 4 times and won't see any errors until someone points them out and I just shake my head.

*** I'm relating so much with your last thing there--you don't have to have everything explained.

One of my favorite FF authors finished a 400k+ fic, and the ending was... insanely ambiguous; you didn't know if the main protagonistt died or not; there were a few questions that came up in the series that you never got an answer to, but everything just... ended.

And it was a bit frustrating, sure, but it was so refreshing as well? It felt like it had been ages since I'd seen someone intentionally leave things unresolved (her reasoning was because she felt that that's what life is a lot like). It was great. I hated and loved her for it.

******* I mean, I definitely love it, but I also recognize that it might not be for everyone; I was on a deliberate adventure to try and find fics of this pairing when I came across it.

I should probably forewarn: the beginning of the prequel is a bit.. graphic (smutty). She actually only planned on that being a oneshot but then ended up continuing it because (surprise surprise) she left it somewhat open-ended and people wanted to know what comes next.

If you get passed that though, her depiction of characters is probably my favorite that i've seen in ages. (especially her Snape and Luna). There is some action/horror/suspense, and the whole story is building the premise to try and make itself as believable as possible--so there's a lot of other genres+"romance", even though it is the reason for the story. (romance in quotes because the relationship is a bit twisted and obsessive and unhealthy).

It's also a ridiculously slow slow slow burn.

Hope that's enough info for you to figure out if you want to read it or not. (:

Edit and reupload when reviewers point out mistakes.

There are no spinning Portkeys, unless they're central to the plot, and that was in one single fanfic (by Bobmin, I think).

Be careful with the stations of canon. The snowy owl Hedwig is based on Hagrid buying her as a present without the input or presence of Harry. The more AU, the less chance for the same owl and name.

Don't write Disney-like characters where everyone's either completely good or completely bad. With the possible exception of Voldemort, every canon character has both good and bad sides.
