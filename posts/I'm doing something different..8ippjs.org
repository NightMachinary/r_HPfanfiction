I posted personal recs to a fanfic I was working on a few months ago, then after a while I realized that it wasn't as good as it could be. My characters were unfriendly and flat, little personality. I removed it quickly when I realized it wasn't good enough.

I'm now re-writing it, more realistically when it comes to magic and issues. I'm remembering the age-old addive, "write what you know".

I realized that mental disorders aren't discussed in Harry Potter, so I'm wondering if it's purely a 'muggle' thing, or that it's a taboo subject in some sects of the wizarding world, like with purebloods. I can really see that being possible, since magic can cure just about 'anything'. Someone would have to be muggle born or a halfblood to know what anxiety disorders, or even autisim, could be.

In my story, one of my OCs goes through a traumatic experience, her father dying before her eyes. Now, he's always set to die, but I've realized I should dwell on her reaction to the death, her development of social anxiety because of it, and the fact that she's going to go through Hogwarts with difficulties. Considering my own history with social anxiety and autism, I'm considering her slow journey to discovering there's something more. As with me, she discovers her autism later in life. She used to be hateful and haughty, but now she's quiet and nervous. She's no longer a person who could be easily hated, but more relatable. Hermione would befriend her, knowing her illness before it's made light. She would help the girl cope with her abilities, while trying to spread awareness to the rest of Hogwarts.

My other OC used to be flat, no personality at all, but she was always full of love and kindness, giving people chances and trying to bring houses together. I realized that the Wizarding World is pretty far behind while the muggle world is quite advanced in technology. I thought of my father, a computer wizard (teehee), and realized that she could reflect her own father's love of computers. She gets along swimmingly with Arthur Weasley, proves herself to be a very intelligent girl when it comes to electronics. She insists on bringing an old fashioned typewriter to Hogwarts during her second year because she hated the quill method, and gets in trouble with Snape because of it. She excells in Arithmancy and Runes, setting herself into a role as an inventor, and with Arthur's help she creates wizarding versions of modern muggle technology. She introduces Ron to her gaming systems, because honestly I can see Ron getting interested in muggle videogames. His favorite game is Legend of Zelda on the NES.

The story only mentioned their father, in passing. A muggle man born in America, lived in Phoenix and gone to travel around the world, meeting a pureblood witch set to marry into a prominent pureblood family due to her specific family. He's a violin player, a former member of the US Navy who used to box, and proceeds to kick the arse out of Cygnus Black because the wizard thought the muggle was bluffing when he said he could fight. The woman falls for the man and runs away with him, having a wonderful fifteen years with her. She lives as a muggle for the same fifteen years, until her parents - deeply attracted to the dark arts - kills him through blood magic to bring her back home to Britain.

As this is an alternate universe, I also have a villain. A dark wizard, someone more horrible than Voldemort. A metamorphamagus that studied the most ancient of arts, setting forth an ancient pureblood ritual that was banned in the fifteenth century, a ritual that puts children's lives at risk, halfblood children wind up in Saint Mungos when their grandparents attempt to purify their blood through these rituals, a man who wants more than what Voldemort is after, and someone who doesn't hide himself.

I want to bring together magic and muggle, bring light to mental illness while making a compelling story about two young girls in the wizarding world. Please tell me what you think. I'm very proud of my revisions, and I feel good about it.


** That's an interesting idea of tackling mental health in the magical world. Maybe you could bring the idea of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Obscurial][Obscurials]] into it?

***** I haven't watched the movie yet (and the book's fuzzy on my memory), but it's perfect for the girl. She doesn't trust magic at all, because she realized it was magic that killed her father and she does her best to withdraw from it. Her family line is quite powerful for the witches born from it, so I don't think she'll die before 10. It's a good option for her internalized struggle and the fact that she's the target of the dark wizard.

****** Oh that sounds like a really good hook. I have to confess that I haven't seen the movie, either, mostly because the US magical world seems like it's a real downer! I do definitely like the concept of Obscurials and how they add another dimension to the magical world. In the core HP books, magic is treated a bit "everything is awesome" when it very well might not be for everyone. I also have to wonder if JKR hinted a bit that Dumbledore's sister Ariana was one.

** This is nice and all, but we'd be able to prove more useful feedback if we read the actual fic. Link?
