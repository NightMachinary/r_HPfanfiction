I've only read a few fics where the author changes the tasks for the tournament but those are always some of my favorites. It makes things so much more interesting than rereading the same ones over and over.

Anyway, I'm thinking of eventually writing a fic like this and am looking for cool ideas for different tasks (if you don't mind sharing them with me). I might add extra tasks or just get rid of the originals all together. I always thought it would be cool to have tasks where different champions are forced to work together in teams too. Let me know what you guys think! Other authors can use ideas generated on this thread for their stories as well.


** Catch a unicorn in forest like setting (not forbidden forest, cause it would then be too hard), without hurting the unicorn. This task would be challenging because the Unicorns are fabled to be extremely fast and to catch them would require knowledge of nifty spells, speed, and a tactical mind. Note that brooms would be useless (cause it's in a forest setting.. trees would make it impossible to maneuver at high speed)

**** Do keep in mind that there's a distinct bias in unicorn hunting. Unicorns prefer females, and so Fleur (or any other girls participating!) would have a huge advantage.

** An idea I had for the First task was that the Champions had to get the golden egg (or perhaps some other clue item) from a nest of Acromatulas instead of a dragon.

For the fic I was planning with this idea, Harry manages to talk to the Acromatulas and convince them that giving him the egg and letting him go was in their best interest. (This Harry would be a pacifist.)

** In "Patron", I had four tasks, each one with an Elemental theme. An obstacle course on a platform that was slowly sinking into lava (with appropriate security measures taken), with fire drakes guarding the exit. A race through a Seaquarium filled with all sorts of dangers, and a Marid guarding pearls that gave bonus points. A Broom race, with artificial fog, storms, and air-based threats like bludgers, with rings the contestants had to fly through serving as choke points too. And finally, an underground maze, constantly changing, full of dangers familiar to dungeon crawlers. Again, with security measures taken so the whole event was not any more dangerous than a Quidditch match. In addition to that, I added events where the other students who had made the trip could compete as well: Duels, Quidditch, and Curse-Breaking competitions.

The Tournament runs until Chapter 10. The whole story will be finished with the epilogue next weekend.

*** I've had this on my to read list for a while but didn't realize that you did that. I think it might have just jumped to the top of list. :)

Hm yes, I too appreciate it when authors at least go through the trouble of changing the tasks... but IMHO the triwizard tournament has been beaten to death. Unless you do something really original with it (not just changing up the tasks a little bit... I remember a crack!fick where they threw Voldemorts name in the Goblet, that was neat), I don't think it's worth the effort.
