:FlairText: What's That Fic?/Request
:END:
So, I remember a fic where Harry and Dumbledore are working together more actively, and they put on a duel to give Harry control of the Elder Wand. It's set up at a Ministry event and all the Great and the Good turn up to watch. Harry arrives thinking it'll be mostly for show, but Dumbledore fights hard and they end up going all out (and straining the duelling wards). Harry does eventually win and (I think?) knocks Dumbledore out before taking the Wand.

If you know that fic, great. Do tell. But if you know any similar fics where Harry and Dumbledore duel formally, then also please do tell.


** There's a good one in linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity), and it might be the one you're thinking of in the first place.

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Several elements of this request are in linkffn(1709027). The competitive duel was not designed for Harry to win allegiance of the Elder Wand (the story came out originally before book 6 and Horcruxes/Hallows), but rather to give him a chance to go all out in a controlled magical setting.

  Complete! Challenges fill Harry's 6th year: growing powers, Snape as defense teacher, new Potions teacher, a new crush on him, Voldemort, Ginny, Goblins? Lots of humor, drama, action and romance! H:G,R:Hr. Award winner!
