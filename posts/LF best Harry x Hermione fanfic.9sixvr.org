Preferrably a slow burn romance. I've just read Vox Corporis and it changed my views on shipping Harmione. I am now just hopping onto Harmony fics. Time travel, post DH or any era. I don't mind if it's rated M. I just hope for it to be complete! And well-written. Thank you! Your recommendations are appreciated!


** It's not completed but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister by MADharmony]] is, in my opinion, far, far superior to Vox Corporis. Harry and Hermione remain in-character and their interactions with each other is really good.

*** Vox Corporis is better by default, since it attempts to have some kind of plot. Unlike a Sister is nothing but romance (but yeah okay, OP asked for romance, but IMHO a really good romance has more going on).

**** One thing about Vox Corporis is that it's really, really hard to get into. After the first five or so chapters, the story gets better but I remember trying to start it twice and came up short. It does have a rather interesting plot but the final confrontation with Voldemort felt like an afterthought and was rather rushed. Also, to me, Harry acted a bit out-of-character from his canon counterpart and Ron's jealousy (though it didn't last throughout the entire story) was a chore to read. Unlike a Sister is better put-together and better written and was extremely easy to get into. The story is far from perfect but I thought Harry and Hermione were recognizable and seeds were sown early in the story that had bigger implications later on. But one can't say "Vox Corporis is better by default" when coming to terms of what is the better story; it's all a matter of opinion.

*** Does it get left off at a decent point? I don't mind unfinished as long as a decent chunk of story has been told and doesn't die on a cliffhanger.

Cliffhanger is negotiable if it's a decent story, but I am really sick of some awesome world building and then no story gets told.

**** I guess it depends on what you define as a decent point. There are quite a few storylines going on at the same time and those never get resolved. Also, while Harry and Hermione do have several scenes of romance, it's never fully realized between the two of them. There is a bit of a cliffhanger where the story ends but there isn't any world building of any kind. Like I said before, it's a great read as it feels the author really has a grasp on each character she (he?) writes. There isn't any bashing of any kind either so there's no need to worry about that (if it isn't your cup of tea).

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), is very slow burn Harry/Hermione. The story begins after year 2, but most of it happens after Voldemort's defeat.

My favorite H/Hr fic is however [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925). They didn't even get officially together by the end, but the future progression of their relationship is very obvious to me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is a time travel. The adult Harry finished off Voldemort and his supporters without getting any kids involved, but he was a very badly damaged person. It took many years for Hermione to come to terms with his deeds and finally fixing him up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511), is only an one-shot, but very well written. Harry left Magical Britain after the war, and it took Hermione 18 years to find him.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Escape is gold and really fits what this pairing should be linkffn(11916243). The portrayal of Hermione's parents are top notch.

I recall what we are fighting for being good, but it has a long time since I read it linkffn(9766604)

Stages of Hope was already mentioned and well deserved, although this pairing is background linkffn(6892925)

Similarly, a little child shall lead them is grade AAA, but the h/hr is kind of background linkffn(10871795)

+Mystery of Marriage is a fun take on the 'what happened to us' genre.+ Apparently not as good as I remember. Haven't read in forever, sorry!

Finally, I just picked up The Wise One from a rec on this Reddit and it is a grand example of its genre: Sirius man's up and retrieved Harry early; Harry not being famous; A good handling of Harry/Ginny & Harry/Hermione and most important? The h/hr relationship is not perfect and both of them screw up, bad. linkffn(4062601); warning: three fics and over 500k words.

Edit: ohh, and I forgot the cupboard series. Another epic long one, (7 100k+ fics), that I think end in h/hr (and Harry founding his own magical school) linkffn(10449375)

Do you really think this is good? The constant PoV switching is extremely jarring and this has to take the cake as one of the most angsty romances I've ever read:

/"Oh no, she's totally lying when she tells me she loves me, who could ever truly love me, woe is me, I'm just a weapon after all!" ... "Oh Harry could never love me, he sees me like a sister, I'll have to raise this child on my own, it's better this way to stay away from him than get my heart broken."/

Just give it a rest you guys. The characterization of both Harry and Hermione is terrible in this one, Hermione is particularly unlikeable.

**** Honestly? It was added my my favorite list a long time ago and I haven't reread it, so no, I'm not sure I really think its good. Same with Cupboard. Thus my rec on them is weaker.

Stages of Hope and The Wise One were both recent reads, and Little Child / Escape recent rereads, so those are stronger recs. The rest (along with Patron and a MOR and Sympathetic Properties) are older reads that I enjoyed at the time but I can't say if they hold up.
