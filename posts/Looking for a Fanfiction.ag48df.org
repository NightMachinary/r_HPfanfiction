Hi,

I was reading a story during the summer and wanted to see if they loaded any new chapters but can not find the story, I was hoping you could help.

â€‹

It was a Fem Harry story.

Basically Fem Harry was closer to Sirius than in the book and when he dies she wants to mourn him according to pureblood custom. When Dumbledore refuses and she is sent back to the Dursleys she is not happy. When Voldemort tells her how to get to Grimmauld place without Dumbledore noticing she does and escapes.\\
At Grimmauld place, fem harry and Voldemort continue to converse in their dreams and he learns fem harry is a thread witch who loves runes.

I thought the name was something like The runic history or a history of wards

I hope someone can help me out.

Thanks for your time,

Em
