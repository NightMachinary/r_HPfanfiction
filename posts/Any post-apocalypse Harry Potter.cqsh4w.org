  A plague has swept across Britain, wiping out the Muggle population. Ignorant of his heritage and the magical world, a ten year-old Harry Potter is left to fend for himself against two factions, each plotting and conspiring to find him before the other.

  War... War never changes. In the year 2076, Europe is consumed in war. Muggle Britain stands mostly intact, but it will not remain so for long. Concurrently, Magical Britain denies the return of the most feared wizard in generations. In all of this, what is UK-13? And what does it have to do with Harry Potter?

*** Really?

Because the first 5 chapters that I read a few years ago had me convinced that the story is incredibly bad. At least 20 plot holes every chapter, huge ones at that. People behaving totally irrational. And I don't mean understandably irrational, as it is a zombie apocalypse. No, irrational like they are 10 year old kids. And the whole premise is so fuckin idiotic, I can't even begin to explain it. Everybody is constantly taking shit from some pureplood elite that for whatever reason is STILL ruling over everybody, nevermind that they are a huge minority and have no actual powerbase. And on top of all that he writes a Harry that behaves like a kicked puppy for 99% of the time...

Ah well, sorry for the rant, but that story is just really, really, REALLY bad and even after a few years it stands out in my mind. There is a reason it only has ~300 reviews after 8 years, most of which are reviews of early chapters, telling the author how bad it is.

***** Yea, it is not a broad genre so not a lot of fics to chose from, but believe me, it is absolutely terrible. If you want to convince yourself, the first 5 chapters should be enough to do that.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9310847/1/][Future of Ruin]] The fight between Harry and Voldemort in the books isn't the first or last time they fight, they are both reincarnating immortals and the fight goes back millennia. Many centuries after a nuclear apocalypse Harry comes across a time rift that spits out a ~25 year old Hermione.

  Harry Potter has been reincarnated more times than he can count, always to stop a mad man. Now, the world has been ravaged by nuclear war, and nothing will ever be as it once was.
