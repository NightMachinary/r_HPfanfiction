No mindless betrayals, no manipulative Dumbledore who for some inexplicable reason wants Harry out of Hogwarts or directly in Azkaban, no corrupt ministry getting away with it. Basically, Harry does something so unforgivable that it justifies his final expulsion. I don't care what it is, or if the author uses some canonical fact to start the plot. It can be, for example, by getting into a fight and ending up seriously injuring or killing his opponent, it could be for practicing really illegal Dark Arts or for destroying school property, it could be simply for breaking the rules in a big way and ending up hurting someone in the process. As long as it is well written, I accept whatever.

Thank you for reading! üíöüêç

** linkao3(340966) doesn't feature expulsion, but it does feature the protagonist and co getting an actual punishment for their shenanigans (only because the punishment wouldn't just be expulsion, it would be years in Azkaban). I know it isn't necessarily meeting the request terms, but it does fit that "you were a moron and actions have consequences" vibe.

Scrimgeour was all about keeping the status quo, not making the Ministry look bad, and making it look like they were doing something.

Add in the fact that Harry refused /to his face/ to back the ministry? Yeah, Scrimgeur would pull a Fudge in a second just to prove a point and force Harry to help them.

** Yes if Harry wasn't the boy who lived he'd have been out of Hogwarts after like the end of first year (the entire dragon fiasco, illegal smuggling, hiding Ron's dragon bite, sneaking into the locked corridor, being out at night under his cloak). :( Or the start of second year, or third year because of all his illegal Hogsmeade trips...but harry just keeps getting away with it all again and again. Snape is at least right about THAT. Harry flaunts the rules left and right because he's never punished for it like any normal student. I want to read a fic where Harry gets justifiably expelled just from canon rulebreaking. There's plenty he could've been, and should've been, like the start of second year fiasco.

Oh, and sixth year, too, where Harry literally becomes a bully and starts testing the Halfblood Prince's spells out on unsuspecting people, like Crabbe and Goyle, and even Filch, I think it mentioned. Attacking a fucking squib just to test a spell. Sounds a LOT like James Potter to me!

Harry really was an arrogant dickhead sometimes. Snape is right about him.

*** That's really a stretch. The dragon thing was all down to hagrid which would have eventually come out. Sneaking about where they are not supposed to? No way. Sneaking out of school? Also way too common. The car thing is the only one I can think of where they legitimately broke laws but even that has more to do with Ron.

I don't know what went on inside your school but generally boarding school and hostels are a mess when it comes to rule breaking. Plus the school would never expell students who are paying so much money in fees. Suspensions are handed out all the time but no way are kids getting expelled as long as they aren't breaking any actual laws.

Also, "illegal"? Its a school rule, not a law. Somehow I doubt the DLME is gonna show up and slap cuffs on a 13 year-old because he didn't get a permission slip signed.

James and Snape have dealt equally, you thinks Snape was alone and it was 3 (+1) against Snape, it was a world in civil war and it is also clear that there is a kind of civil war in the school]

You're right at this point, although I think the last part was unnecessary, since at no point did I say that I am defending Snape.

[That Ford was Rons !!! Idea and Harry has no better idea they are both 12. If Harry is to be kicked out of school because of the things you said he did, what about Fred and George you should know what I mean.]

Yes, I know what you mean, but I still think the Ford thing was a bigger infraction than anything the Weasley twins did. (1) They almost killed themselves, which is the obvious thing to do. Sure, twelve year olds do stupid things, so that can be forgiven. (2) Damage to school property. (3) They flew through the sky in a car in full view of the world, as if there was no such thing as a Statute of Secrecy. Here we are no longer talking about simple school infractions, we are talking about an infraction that can put them in prison if the worst case scenario occurs.

In my opinion and thinking about it more carefully, that would not merit expulsion, because they were a couple of children who did not know what they were doing and the consequences of it.

[A few more examples what about the "ladies" in Racenclaw who tormented Luna, stole her things, etc., the constant insults from Slytherin students like Draco? We are talking even more examples about how Harry was treated like a leprosy diseased by the majority of the students in year 2,4,5.]

You're also right on this point, although I must say that low shelves in general don't mean bad behavior is okay just because it's "better" than everyone else's.

[FILCH who always dreams of torturing the students gets no sympathy from me, buhu he's a squid.]

I had honestly forgotten that part. It's been a long time since I read the books and didn't remember that Filch had fantasized about torture, I thought he was just a very disgusting character.

[Let's go into special year 5 where Harry is systematically tortured by Umbitch and Snape ... yes and the memories happened to be there random of course. This is then concluded with the double that the only adult who for Harry is a way out of the Dursleys dies and he likes. Yes and of course the perfect moment to say the prophecy to Harry right afterwards, Dark Lord Dumbels. It's a miracle he doesn't rebel more. ]

You are also right here.

[Yes yes Snape can't do anything wrong he is the real tragic hero .... I hope you could see my sarcasm in the last.]

Also here. Although as I said, I do not defend Snape, he makes me an unpleasant and abusive character, I do not justify his behavior in any way or say that having suffered in the past justifies his behavior.

****** I understand your point and share it. The twins thing was terribly reckless too, much more so because they were more aware of what they were doing. I think the punishments towards Harry are harsh and many times excessive, I think I was blinded by the prospect that Harry from the Canon is never going to be expelled, for the simple fact that Dumbledore needs him close by to control / protect him (depends on which interpretation you follow).

Anyway, when I made this request I was not looking for fics of normal Harry being expelled, but of the many Dark or Gray Harry that are out there. You know, in which he does everything and nothing happens to him (either because they don't find out, because apparently a teenager never makes stupid mistakes, or because for some reason everyone thinks he is untouchable).

That would flow better into a story, whatever if Harry does something or not, once Voldemort is in public it becomes less likely. Unless he breeds baselisks and they kill a large part of the students. ;) After whatever incident he can come to Askerban or be banished or he can flee with Sirius, there are then many possibilities.\\
For me it is often a problem when it is torn out of the logical context of the story, which is why I think year 5 would fit better here.

The main reason I ask for recommendations is because I myself am writing a story that, in the future, will have a similar direction, although that will be late in the story. Basically, Harry will be expelled almost finished his third year, because neither Dumbledore nor any of the teachers can turn a blind eye to his behavior, his foray into the Dark Arts, etc. They did it at first, because they didn't want to believe it, but it all becomes a little clearer when someone dies. üêçüíö

******* As I said to Katherien, my comment on Snape was about the general attitude towards him in the fanon. Harry explores Hogwarts at night and the cloak he got from Dumbels.\\
If I were a kid in a magical castle, I probably wouldn't do otherwise.\\
It is also implied in the story that it was Dumbl's intention that Harry finds a mirror, so I assume that he has no problem with Harry's exploring.\\
Fred and Gerorge keep going illegally to Hogsmead with no consequences, they also know about Fluffy and it is implied that several students have visited the corridor.\\
Harry is often punished when he is caught, for example smuggling the dragon you mentioned (helping Hagrid), he has to go to the Forbidden Forest as punished because someone kills unicorns. Good idea to send three first graders and Hagrid into the forest for this assignment, cough.\\

*** You're right! sometimes I have a hard time believing how complacent they are the teachers to Harry (especially Dumbledore, although much of the fandom denies it). In my opinion, if he was a normal student, he would have been expelled at the beginning of his second year, for all the theater that he and Ron did. That's why I want to see a story in which even the power of favoritism cannot save him, in which he does something horrible enough that the scar on his forehead means nothing. Something like what Voldemort did with the Chamber of Secrets or what Grindelwald did: experiment with other students (I'm not entirely sure about the latter; I read it somewhere).

  Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard.

But yes, it is surprising how he goes from being the shy boy who tries not to attract attention and does not look for problems with anyone to this kind of bully. (The Crabbe thing is not so serious, in my opinion, because of all the history between them and because Crabbe was not defenseless, he was also a wizard. But what about Filch? I mean, that would be like going and physically attacking to your school janitor just because you don't like him.

I mean, it's known that if someone is kicked out before taking their OWLS, like Hagrid, their wand breaks and it is understood that it is illegal they got another one. Besides the few expelled students that we have seen none continued their studies elsewhere.
