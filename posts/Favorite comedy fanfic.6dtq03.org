**** All the hype gave me high expectations that weren't fulfilled. I could see how it was funny, but I guess the story wasn't my type since I only chuckled once or twice while reading it. Meanwhile A Black Comedy and My Immortal generate laughs for me even on rereads.

** There are only 2 comedy fanfics that consistently sent me into peels of laughter are linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot; Harry the Hufflepuff by BajaB).

Make a wish has a hilarious plot line that is actually really well thought out. This is, for me, easily the best comedy fic in the fandom.

Harry the Hufflepuff seemingly started out as a funny plot bunny by the author but actually grew into a series of 3 short fics. The humor in this just works.

Other great comedy fics that are fantastic, but were not as funny as the two mentioned above: linkffn(Where in the World is Harry Potter by nonjon; Almost a Squib by BajaB;The Wendall the Wasn't by opalish)

Then there is a category of fics which are really great, and also very funny, but the greatness of these fics is not derived from their humor value. linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon; Browncoat; Green Eyes by nonjon; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The Carnivorous Muffin; Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

Lastly, don't forget that canon was actually pretty damn hilarious at points.

** Well, Seventh Horcrux, obviously. But apart from that, a few that I liked linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate; Make a Wish by Roscharch's Blot; Oh god not again; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; Dear Order). And everything else by nonjon is amazing as well.

I also kind of enjoyed The champion's champion, but that isn't to a lot of people's taste, and I wouldn't say it's a favourite, still fun to read though.

** Well, outside of Seventh Horcrux (who doesn't have that on their favourite list?) and nonjon's stuff (likewise) and some other stuff that's already been recommended, I can throw in:

“Biting the Hand That Feeds You” (linkffn(10287864)), featuring hilarious pairings, hilarious ministry incompetence, /The Loremaster/, and /The Godfather/

esama's “Tumbling HP Crossovers” (linkao3(1647644)), which is basically her dumping bin for whatever ideas about HP crossed with anything she gets. It has some slash (if you want to avoid it, steer clear of the chapters where it crosses with Naruto) and some of those snippets might not be very fun, but on the average it's quite entertaining.

“Inspected By No 13” (linkffn(10485934)), wherein a bureaucrat Harry is getting through the Triwizard Tournament.

  Azkaban Story! After reading so many Azkaban stories, I have decided to write a parody of my own. This is about how everyone is demanding that Harry forgive them for betraying him without actually asking. I am going for humor more than anything

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.
