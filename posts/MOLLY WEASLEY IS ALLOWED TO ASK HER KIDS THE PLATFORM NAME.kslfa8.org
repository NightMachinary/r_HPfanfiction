This post is specifically to try and understand the thought process used behind one of the most common proofs of the evil weasel trope. Molly weasley asking her /10/ year old daughter the platform name. It really annoys me that NO ONE in those bashing stories ever points out that Ginny at that stage is a kid and perhaps is feeling left out and Molly is just trying to make her feel involved and dmart like a good parent does. I remember my parents asking me extremely basic shit regularly as a kid to make me feel involved and to make sure I KNEW the info, not because they forgot.

I am making this post due to seeing this point a few times in recent fanfics Ive read about how the fact that Molly qeasley has to ask her kid for the platform number is proof of a plot-if you want to do weasley bashing fine, but why would you center one of the core propfs of evilness on this which is clearly a parental action.

Just saying I havnt read canon in a while so if this did not actually happen and if it did and Im mistaking the situation i apologise, just addressing a point Ive seen pop up a few times in recent fanfiction.

Thank you for reading my rant!

** Of course she's allowed, and of course she's asking because she has a young daughter who desperately wants to be involved.

I would assume, however, that IF you were a writer going down the Evil/Manipulative Dumbledore route, where he is deliberately planting the Weasley family to catch and hold Harry's attention this might not be a terrible place to begin. There's no doubt probably better ways of going about it, but as is, the Weasleys just happening to be there when Harry has no clue where to go, and the Weasleys just happening to say the platform number is quite the coincidence (if we didn't know they were stories and that obviously they're there or the plot couldn't progress).

Also although I don't see this often or maybe at all (I rarely if at all read a Weasley bash fic) it could be a good place to establish that Molly is the one gaining Harry's attention and loyalty etc. rather than an 11 year old Ron who's totally an evil mastermind out for Harry's money. I mean, I understand a child doing a task his parents ask of him---“Ron darling, Headmaster Dumbledore's told me that Harry Potter hasn't been in the Wizarding World for too long, perhaps you should make friends with him? He'll need someone to help him out”---and of course Ron would be happy to do that without knowing his Mum's true motives. But I'm not really convinced when authors go: “Ron, we're piss poor and Harry Potter is loaded let's exploit this boy and we'll be rich! Here's your new allowance from Dumbledore straight out of Harry's vault! 100,000,000 galleons!”.

TL;DR, Of course Mumma Weasley is allowed to ask Ginny the platform number, hell it makes perfect sense even; however, it can make a decent plot point if actually written well.

But that's insane since there's almost no adult presence: the snack trolley lady, the driver (referenced only, and shouldn't Lupin know that a "train driver" is called an engineer?), and---once every third year---a single teacher (Lupin in 3rd year, Slughorn in 6th year). These are the only adults that I remember being mentioned in canon, and only one of those is in a supervisory capacity. Even if we assume there's a teacher in the years that weren't mentioned, that's one adult for approximately 400 sugar-crazed students (because the trolley only stocks sugary treats).

It really doesn't. No real person is going to notice that sort of thing, and even if they do, they're not going to care, let alone be suspicious. The Statute mostly just means not /doing/ magic around Muggles, or letting them have access to magical artifacts or creatures.

** My favorite positive interpretation is that it's all part of being a parent. If you say she's not yelling (acceptable), you can make a case for her quizzing Ron in particular as it's his 1st time and Ginny in preparation to make sure they know where to go in case of separation. Not only making sure they retained the information, but I would think asking them might keep them focused on the task at hand.

I totally get where you're coming from.

Also it really isn't that big a deal. It's like swinging a kid between two parents as you walk. You're trying to have fun and go about it. Besides, it's a train station. The weird things one hears at a train station go across the field.

Hearing a kid give a weird number to a parent that's looking for a platform wouldn't even faze a normal person. They'd just think the kid is cracking a joke. If I heard it, I'd probably laugh along and keep walking.

  At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.

  “- packed with Muggles, of course --“

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each one of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.

  Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

  “Now, what's the platform number?” said the boys' mother.
#+end_quote

It's pretty clear that both times, Harry only heard Molly because he happened to be very close to her. So no one else is going to catch more than a few words from her, which isn't enough to cause any problems.

The /real/ bigger issue is all these kids walking around with owls. Assuming there isn't any magic involved, that will really draw people's attention. Especially the employees and anyone else who happens to be in the area for an extended period of time and sees a few dozen kids with owls show up over the course of an hour. It wouldn't be enough to actually break the Statute or anything, but it would definitely draw more attention than anything else they're doing.

** First of all remember that there are so many things in canon that are poorly addressed or unexplained that it provides fanfic authors lots of flexibility to look at a scene and place any interpretation on it (good or bad).

Now on the scene where Molly is wandering through King's Cross Station folks who want to use the trope that the Weasley's meeting Harry at the station was a "setup" use certain aspects of that scene as "proof".

1. Molly loudly talking about all these Muggles as she walks through the muggle portion of the station. First off, wouldn't talking so loudly draw attention to them basically coming close to violating the Statute of Secrecy? Which of course assumes they didn't place a muggle notice me not charm on themselves and their belongings (which canon doesn't say occurred).

2. The Weasley's have access to apparation, portkeys and the Floo so why would they use the muggle side /muggleborn entrance. Now as far as I remember I don't think that canon clearly states whether or not the platform allows any other access method. Those who want to use the trope believe there must be other entrances as they can't see malfoy and other deatheater families being willing to interact being around all the muggles that they would have to in order to traverse King's Cross Station. So if that is true then why were the Weasleys on the muggle side?

3. Molly loudly asking where platform 9 and 3/4's is. Along with point 1 above this would come close to violating the Statute of Secrecy. For those who like the trope, they would point to the fact that Molly attended Hogwarts so assuming 3 trips a year (Start, Christmas, End) she had 21 trips to the station then she had multiple trips to take her kids to the station (by my count at least 30 more) before that trip in the book. So she knew where the platform was.

4. Ron stating that everywhere else was full. Now canon never explicitly states but the Hogwarts express is a magical train so it is assumed that it could change to accommodate everyone. Plus with all the empty classrooms etc it is implied that there were a lot more students in the past so if the Hogwarts Express could handle all those numbers there should have been plenty of space.

So the above "facts" are used by those who like the trope to justify it.

Now, for those who don't like or use the trope they look at these same scenes and see nothing nefarious. Asking about where the platform was is simply keeping the younger kids entertained as well as teaching them. The Statute of Secrecy wasn't in jeopardy as they used Notice Me Not spells etc so the Muggles wouldn't be aware. They also believe there is only the one entrance to the station and that there is no floo or apparation/portkey location at the station proper so the Weasleys had to be on that side of the station. And then finally, just like normal trains the number of cars depends on the anticipated number of students. So even though they may have had more students in the past since there are fewer students the train was shortened by removing unneeded cars.

The thing is that both viewpoints are valid as there is enough flexibility in canon to support both interpretations. Fanfic authors just chose whichever interpretation they want to examine/use that supports where they want their story will go. And as a reader of lots of fanfics I'm ok with any interpretation that they care to use.

  Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each one of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.

  Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.

One, it is not like Molly was yelling it out for the entire station to hear. She was clearly speaking to her children. Harry only heard because he was near them and then followed them because he saw an owl and realised they must be like him.

The whole point of this scene was to give Harry the information he needed. It is done throughout the entire series. Hell, it is done in almost all forms of entertainment. Later on, Hermione becomes the answer for all needed questions. Honestly speaking, they should have made it so Ginny got it wrong and Molly corrected. Perhaps, even under the guise that it was the first time coming (despite having older brothers) and Fred and George told her that it was just Platform Nine.

** This is why I like ZebJeb's story *Albus and Harry's World Trip.* A number of tropes from bashing fics are subverted. The passage below tries to explain that nothing malicious was behind Mrs. Weasley's alleged shouting while approaching Platform 9 3/4.

#+begin_quote
  "...The wards heighten people's disbelief in magic so they will dismiss any talk of real magic or mild demonstrations of magic. Though, the protections would likely be insufficient for any excessive displays like say, as a random example, a pair of children flying a car. For minor instances however, any observers will simply dismiss what they saw as being some odd thing that doesn't deserve any extra attention. Well, unless the observer is magical or has been temporarily keyed into the wards like a non-magical guardian of a Hogwarts student."

  "...Outside of being told for their jobs in law enforcement or as administrators at Hogwarts, it is mainly concerned parents who discover the truth. I usually received one or two letters every year where a parent told me how their student spoke about magic while standing near the platform entrance and they noticed a non-magical stranger was standing too close. Those parents were of course scared that their child would have legal problems and they needed advice on how to proceed while protecting their child. I then tell them that the standard Auror response is that the child gets a firm warning, and I inform the parents about the protections at the station."

  Albus laughed lightly as he continued. "Though, in Molly's case, it was a panicked Floo Call instead of the standard letter. She can be quite the force of nature when she takes a mind to do so."

  Harry looked at Albus in surprise. "Do you mean Mrs. Weasley? Did the twins do something?"

  Albus's eyes twinkled in delight. "They do seem like likely suspects, but no. Molly was the one who did something that she thought was wrong. It was years ago, when she was bringing her eldest, Bill, to his first train ride to Hogwarts. She was harried as she was there with all seven of her children, and I guarantee you that handling five children aged six years and younger is a nearly impossible feat. Add a hyper first year student and a nine-year-old younger brother, Charlie, who is throwing a temper tantrum about not wanting to be separated from his older brother... It's fair to say that Molly was not in a great mental state. So, she loudly reminded her children to be calm because the station was, and I quote, 'packed with muggles'. And, just to help calm down Charlie, she tried to make him feel more involved in Bill's trip by asking him which platform they were looking for. Which of course led to Charlie loudly proclaiming the words 'Platform 9 ¾'. That night, after putting her children to bed, she realized what she had done and called me in a panic about how she had broken the Statute of Secrecy. She was in tears about how they couldn't afford a fine, or even worse she terrified of being sentence to prison time."

  Albus smiled wistfully, lost in memory. "It took some time, but I was able to calm her down and explain how the wards. Once calmed down, her mood made an immediate about face, which is very common for her. She then started joking about how talking about muggles and asking the most upset child for the platform number was an extremely effective parenting technique. Before ending the call, she was seriously considering reusing that technique until her youngest child finally started Hogwarts. Of course, I honestly don't know if she ended up following through on that idea."

Parents keep asking their children questions they know the answers to to ensure the child remembers. One of the basic interactions every parent with half a brain is familiar with. As well as people who interact with parents of young children.\\
People keep talking with each others in train stations about all kinds of private things while passing by strangers and nobody gives a flying fuck. And children talk all kind of weird shit.

****** I'm not talking about common sense. I'm talking about behavioural patterns, like how mothers interact with their children, remembering maybe their own childhood, maybe their siblings or even just seeing strangers with children in public. I'm talking about a (historically prominent) commenter in a particular fanfic community who had the habit of going off on rants about his horrible time at school and how unrealistic every scene of student-teacher interaction in any fic coming up was because he was horribly bullied by everyone, students, teachers and administrators alike. So there couldn't possibly exist any time at any school where the student in the scene and fic that set him off was not bullied. Nevermind that his own stories had countless examples of students, classmates of him - who were not him - not having his experiences. Including his bullies.\\
I'm talking about a guy who regaled us with stories how he, when he was a kid in the eighties, had some very rare homecomputer as his only computer that none of his peers had. And who kept raging when authors (often being very forward in admitting they made their choice because those were the computers they themselves used as kids) had their characters use Commodores and Ataris and Sinclairs and Apple ][s instead of the one he himself knew as a kid.\\
I'm talking about the woman who complained about relationships in a fic being bad and wrong - never mind that they had been cribbed straight out of canon - because they didn't mirror the one between her and her former husband.

It's not common sense that is at issue. It is narcissism, it is egocentricity, it is the inability and and unwillingness of people to look around them and notice that other people are not identical to themselves that is at issue.

Or maybe they are not people at all but alien AIs who's only contact with humans is fanfiction forums on the internet.

******* Not everyone has the same type of good parents to understand what good parenting is, unfortunately.

** I remember one fic from years back that used this as a way to catch muggle born who couldn't figure out how to get in.

Harry asks after second year why they didn't use magical means the year before. Molly responded with something to the effect of parents of kids going into first year are asked to discreetly get the attention of lost magical kids to lead them to the train.

** Also: For people with siblings, this was rather normal.

Most of the time, we'd be with our mom. But on the occasion, where we ended up separated, she would tell us a place to meet her.

That was a good thing, especially at a huge place like the fair grounds. We'd often meet at the Ferris wheel, or the ticket booth. And be with the adult in control of it.

It was probably a similar matter. Molly telling the younger kids where to meet. And making sure that they remembered.

Also: If someone said the world Muggle, most people wouldn't care/bat an eye. They'd just think it was a rather strange word.

What's weird is that they have the platform at an incredibly busy place. You'd think if they cared about the secrecy, it'd be more hidden, with less people around.
