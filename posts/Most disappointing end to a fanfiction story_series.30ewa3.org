** It's in the Unsung Hero by MeghanReviews.

SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING OF THE STORY. DO NOT READ BELOW IF YOU WANT TO REMAIN UNSPOILED!

Basically, Harry is killed by his WBWL brother and is sent to the Other World King's Cross. There, he meets Luna's mum and she tells Harry that he can go back and live his life to change the past mistakes he's made; however, he will go back with only half his memories, while the other half goes to Voldemort, because of "the balance" or something like that. Anyway, it pretty much sucked imo.

I can partially agree with this. The notion that one of the characters cheated on the protagonist by being under the influence of a horcrux was a /really/ thin plot point IMO. The developments following that revelation seemed to be page-number-inflating angst with no real character development.

You're absolutely correct that parts of it shine in ways most other fics could only dream of doing.

** One of the stories I had gotten really into had really awesome buildup for 65 chapters or so and it was just getting to the climax... and all of a sudden the author lost interest, summarized all the climaxy action scenes that were supposed to happen, and ended with all the mushy lovey dovey scenes actually written out. It was such a let down. A chapter that had just ended with death eaters infiltrating Hogwarts and everyone gearing up for an epic fight had the next chapter start with "somehow, they succeeded in throwing all the death eaters out of the castle" and then it proceeded onto full scenes of crappy dialog. Bah.

** My initial thought was that the sequel to The Lie I've Lived never got written, and that Knowledge is Power was abandoned. I'm pretty sure that's not what you're looking forward to though. Mine isn't a specific fic, but I hate it when stories end with the epilogue that follows the lines of "Harry is the ancient Headmaster at Hogwarts, his lover and friends are all dead and all he has left is some of his kids/grandkids when he peacefully dies." There's just no reason to have that kind of ending to a story, and if I ever see that something like that is coming, I stop immediately.

I'm really sorry about this, and I know it's immensely popular, and I have so much respect for the author for sticking with it for so long, but it went from "wow, interesting start and concept" and "uhhh, cool!" to everybody having soulmates and perfect love and support, and inheriting houses all over the world and everybody surviving, and equal rights and...

It depends though. If you liked the experimentation chapters of HPMOR, you won't like this story. If you were excited by the Azkaban arc of HPMOR, you will probably like this story.

It was written by a popular Harry/Draco author, but she never outright said what the ship would be. The characterizations in the fic was amazing, and the friendship/pre-slash between them both was so believable. She dangled it in front us for years and then ended it as Harry/Ginny. I raged so hard.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldson Eagle. It's a unique fic, putting Hermione through the Triwizard Tournament in Harry's place (because a protective charm she had cast and a Crouch Jr.'s manipulations interacted in a weird way); and exploring how someone less fearless and less athletic than Harry, but more disciplined and diligent and better at magic, but still quite underage, would handle the tournament.

The ending... It was too neat, too fixficish. The ending of canon HP:GoF was foreboding: Voldemort was back at full strength, Cedric was dead, Death Eaters reassembled, and nobody believing Harry and Dumbledore but their immediate circle. The ending of HG:GoF was Voldemort wounded, his return exposed, and many DEs captured, and making it happen involved character actions even more contrived than those of canon, and Voldemort making /more/ bad decisions than he did in canon.

"Harry Potter and the Black Owl" was the first, and probably the last Harry-Minerva fic that worked for me. Its still somewhat weird, but at least I rooted for the pairing at the end.

Right before... SPOILER

It turns out that the youth-potion Minerva was taking is killing her and she had to stop taking it, destroying the relationship with Harry. And that wanker goes to Dumbledore and asks the guy if he could wipe his memory of the relationship. Fuck this ending, big time. It was one of the few where I'd really love to see a happy ending.
