:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I'm trying to find an HP fanfic and hope someone can help me. Here's what I remember:

-It wasn't on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]

-It was AU Deathly Hallows. Harry hadn't gone to Hogwarts for some reason, and Hermione, Ron, Draco, Ginny, Neville, and Luna left after 6th year to go find him to warn him he was in danger (I think he'd been believed dead up till then??)

-Harry was working in muggle London and ended up joining them and they taught him magic

-At one point they went to a muggle university and a nearby pub, and someone had written "Potter Lives" in one of the bathroom stalls

-Draco/Harry and Ron/Hermione

Thanks for your help!!


** I haven't read it yet but the tags and summary match.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
