Obviously both plots make little to no sense but I just had a random thought to compare them.


** My Immortal, because its explanation is that it was written by a teenager. Cursed Child has no such excuse.

** I think you are less likely to throw up while reading Cursed Child so I'll go with that. But a choice like that is like being between the devil and the deep blue sea (does the british really have this expression?)

*** I've never heard that exact expression and am British. ‘Between a rock and a hard place' would be the version we use.

**** At first, I wanted to translate the one used in my country (/To choose between the plague and the cholera/), but then I thought the expression is probably different in English.

Word Reference said that "/Between a rock and a hard place/" was the US version, and " /between the devil and the deep blue sea/" the UK one. Guess I'll stick to rock and hard place in the future.

** Cursed Child makes more sense as a self-contained narrative. If you never had anything to do with the series before that, it would just be a play about a bunch of wizards who aren't smart enough to use time travel correctly, and who are pretty objectively horrible people. It's only when you understand exactly what they're fucking up that you understand just how little sense it all makes.

My Immortal is the opposite. On its own, it would be a schizophrenic, barely comprehensible mess. As it is, it's a pretty good parody of the series and the fandom.

** I've not read either, but I thought My Immortal didn't really have a plot? Isn't just, like, a collection of things that happen in a sequence? If so, then I'm giving my vote to Cursed Child, on the grounds that, incompetent though it is, there /is/ a plot.

*** It's first person, based on main Character Ebony Dementia Dark'ness Raven Way (yes that's actually her name) and basically all of the main characters are gothic vampires and Ebony is in love with Draco. Countless contradictions, inconsistent grammar and spelling. Never managed to get very far with it but at the point that I got to, Voldemort had taken Harry (who for some reason is just known as 'Vampire') and they were going to go rescue him. Apparently Harry was one of their best friends despite the fact that a few days before that she asked what his name was.

The author is also the proud writer of eloquent quotes such as 'he put his thingie in my you know what and we did it for the first time'. Yeah. It's that bad.
