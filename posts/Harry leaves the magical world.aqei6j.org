Looking for a fic where Harry has left the wizard of world behind and lives like a muggle, until his daughter is accepted to Hogwarts and things happen which leads to his wife dying and him returning with a vengeance.

Also his daughter writes him letters as Harry Potter instead of the name he has been using over the last decade and he writes back as HP striking up an interesting friendship.
