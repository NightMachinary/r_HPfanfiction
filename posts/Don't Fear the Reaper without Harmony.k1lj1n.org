I expect a lot of people here know about Reptilia28's "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge. You know, Harry really dies at the end of book 7, his grim reaper sends him back to the TriWiz with his memory's intact and the information that Hermione is his soulmate.

I enjoy reading the stories that follow the challenge but I'm getting a bit sick that every story like that is Harmony and has Dumbledore-bashing and Ron/Ginny/Molly-bashing. I understand that that's the challenge but I wondering if somebody took the concept but changed a few things (like changing the ship).


** Yeah, many, many stories could be vastly improved by excising the 'shipping and the bashing.

You don't say?

Honestly every time I see one of these "challenges" (Severitus' The Severitus Challenge, Reptilia28's 'Don't Fear The Reaper' challenge, CoastalFirebird's 'Death Challenge') I figure some of the authors were too lazy to come up with their own story and just want free, personally tailored reading material. It's good for anyone who has trouble figuring out where to start in the wonderful world of fanfiction, but the fanon tropes get repetitive.

*** At least when I post challenges/prompts, while there's definite factor of "I want to read this", there's also a lot of "but I don't think I could do a competent job writing it".

** Does it have to be Harry who is send back?

If not, check out "The Bureaucratic Error" by Iniga on ffnet . It is a Remus-centric fix-it fic. He ends up being send to the beginning of PoA and now he has to rescue Sirius and be a better mentor to Harry than the first time around all while he is trying to convince Tonks to fall in love with him.
