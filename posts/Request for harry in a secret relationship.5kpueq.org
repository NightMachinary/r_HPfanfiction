** One of the classics of the Harry/Daphne genre, and what I like to think of as the purest kb0 fic (even if it /isn't/ a Harry/Ginny fic): linkffn(The Grass is Always Greener).

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

** My current WIP, Dating Susan Bones, features Harry and Susan together, with only certain members of the DA in the know (some of the Hufflepuffs), who create/will create excuses for Harry when Ron/Hermione start asking questions when he goes missing for periods of time (usually for a snogging session with Susan.)

Then there is also The Real Us where non of Harrys housemates know he and Hermione are together, but the professors do...(Yes, it's that "Real Us")

  Sometimes no one sees what's right in front of them. Various characters discover & react to a certain surprising relationship. Used to be a oneshot called "What Remus Expected." A series of related oneshots. Rating for implied sexual situations.
