I have read several Star Wars crossovers recently and I was wondering if there were any good comic book crossovers?


** Linkffn(child of the storm; wand and shield)

There's one that's a bit slashy feeling where harry runs a bar and steve rogers keeps dropping in. It's pretty good. Don't remember it's name.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

Both Hermione/Loki, the first one is light and funny, and the second one is more interesting since it keeps both characters in character. But I love both !

  Hermione/Loki. When Loki is finally captured by the Avengers, the Ministry is asked to get involved to ensure he remains captured, and Hermione happens to be the witch they send to do the job.

  When Luna appeared on Harry's doorstep one evening with a job offer from the Unspeakables, Harry decides a change of pace is just what he needs. Getting dumped in a certain alien-ravaged city in an entirely different dimension is not what he signed up for. Post-Avengers (2012), very post-HP AU.

** Ahh SW crossovers, too bad that section is a play on extremes: extremely good and and annoyingly bad. Now for your request:

Notice that it is mostly Marvel; I blame that on the movies. Here is a serious DC crossover that plays off the twin thing. Linkffn(Warm Shadows by Storm0fCrows). From what I understand, the MC is working for a magical equivalent of INTERPOL.

I'm still looking for other good DC crossovers, but all I've seen isn't worth reading, IMO.

  At the age of twenty-seven Harry Potter had a good thing going for him with the DEO, decent pay, odd hours, a good chance for advancement; What else could a Slytherin ask for?... Maybe a few days that didn't force him into questioning his sanity.

** Linkffn(Teeth by Hathanhate)

I really like this one. Takes a while to get to the crossover bit (it's strictly HP for a while); once it gets there, it's focused on Asgardian business rather than the rest of the Avengers (Dr. Banner excepted).

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.
