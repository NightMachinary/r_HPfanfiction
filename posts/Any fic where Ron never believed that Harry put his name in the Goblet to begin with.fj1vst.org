And Harry had his support from start to finish. You know, like the complete opposite of Ron!bashing.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** This one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11534019/1/Euphoria]]). It's the only one where everyone is characterized properly, imo, and has a brief Harry/Lavender before the main pairing. Don't let the summary fool you, this fic is fantastic.

** Technically happens in "Gryffindors Never Die"? It basically follows canon until the future and Ron and Harry get thrown back in time. Ron supports Harry the second time around but is never bashed in this fic.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

** You mean... Ron stan-ing?

The opposite of bashing is to accentuate his strongpoints.

​

This would be so out of character for him. And the whole GoF fallout was a major point in his character growth.

No, that was pretty much in character for him /at that time/. The signs of jealousy were all over the place.

This is nonsense. The whole point of that scene was that Harry would find the idea of Ron being jealous unbelievable.
