I'm kind of bored and haven't found a fic I've actually be interested in lately. I don't particularly care if it follows any tropes---secretly a pure blood or time travel fics are completely fine with me---I just want it to be a decent length without being overhyped and generally not the best. I don't care for slash, but if the fic is convincing enough I'll read pretty much anything tbh.


** The debt of time. By Shayalonnie. Amazing story, and quite long

** linkffn(Honour Thy Blood; Renegade Cause; Imprisioned Realm; Return of the Marauders; Rise of the Wizards; Delenda Est) Though Imprisioned Realm isn't actually completed, its like 1 or 2 chapters away from it, according to the author.

Also, you're using the wrong flair, "Recommendation" is for when you are recommending a fic, the correct for what you want is "Request"

*** Renegade Curse is shit. It can be summarised with:

  "Oh, that cop has completely lost his mind and is abusing his power for a personal vendetta against a teenager."

**** Yeah... no. No one gives a shit about that hitwizard, and even if you do, it isn't as clear cut as you say it is. Its more like, how much the Ministry is corrupted even in lower levels of the hierarchy. Even then, the point wasn't "masterpiece", it was well written, which this fic is. It also has a good world development and plot.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
