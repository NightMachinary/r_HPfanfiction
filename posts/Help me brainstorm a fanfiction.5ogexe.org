So, I have an issue where very often, I have an idea or premise for a fanfiction, but no actual idea for where the plot will go. This the case for my current idea. However, I am very attached to the premise, and don't want to just let it fade away like so many before it - this is where you (hopefully) come in.

Are there any generous souls who wouldn't mind talking over PMs and letting me bounce ideas off them/offer their own suggestions and ideas?


** Sure, I'd love to hear about your idea. I'll only be able to reply in a few hours because I am going out now so send me a pm and I'll see if I can help.

** I wouldn't mind helping but it really depends on the type of fanfic.

** I often find that I make progress when I ask myself 'how will this end?' Gets me past the great opening paragraph I've written and onto the hard work.

** Little late to the party, but I wouldn't mind helping! I love brainstorming fan fiction stories! It's just the writing the entire story part I suck at. Feel free to bombard me with questions and ideas to your heart's content!
