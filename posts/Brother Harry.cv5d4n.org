Any stories where Harry is still the main focus with his younger or twin sibling being the bwl. No abuse, no being abandoned or ignored by their parents, just a normal family. Harry gets stronger to protect his brother or simply because he enjoys learning. Something kinda like HPBWL but like either still being updated or is complete.


** linkffn(7353678) - Fraterculus is basically what you asked for.

EDIT: also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9880708/1/The-Lords-of-War-and-Thunder][Lords of War and Thunder]] - it has Harry who is older and romances Fleur, kind of short and abandoned, but very good.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
