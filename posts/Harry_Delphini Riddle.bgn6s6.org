Ok, I know this is an “out there” pairing at best, and I know I'm going to get A LOT of pushback since it sort of involves the Cursed Child, but hear me out.

I'm not looking for anything that follows cursed child timeline neccesarily (I'll take those too, even if they're just Delphini centric, but it's not my main goal)

I recently read linkffn(10205249) This fic really opened my eyes to this pairing, and though I would've never read it before, this fic was good enough to make me want more (especially as it's unfinished) but there is NOTHING!

Ideally, it would have her born WAY EARLIER and have them meet up during his Hogwarts years, (preferably later, but I'll take anything I can get) and the story goes from there.

I won't even get picky with characterization, just give me anything good that follows what I have, or hell... even if it doesn't, as long as she is either paired with Harry, or used as a main character (preferably the first)

Another reason I want this pairing is because I'm actually writing one, so I'd love to see what others have done.


** I agree that I am surprised it hasn't been done more, which is yet another reason I'm writing one.

** I haven't seen it done much. I totally agree with the 'should have been born sooner' thing. I'm planning to do one where she and Harry are both at school during roughly the same period of time, (though not decided if I'd have them together) but right now I've got way too much other stuff to finish first.

​

Definitely interested to see other interpretations! I feel like Delphini as a character is one of the best developments CC offers us, and as a fandom I'm surprised we haven't utilized her more fully. It's been years by now, you'd think there would be a lot more with her.

*** Cursed Child. While the character brings some interesting points for a cursed lovers plot, people hated Cursed Child enough to not even try to use her. The fact that her description in there could match a bad fanfiction (long blond hair with blue points) didn't help her case.

**** Yeah, I suppose it makes sense. Doesn't make me happy about it though.

** This I feel like would be made better by having her not remember her dad and nobody but dumbledore realizing who she is. So maybe she doesn't get into Slytherin or the Slytherin treat her like a muggleborn. “Delphine I am your father” “yeah right”

** I still stand by the idea that Delphini is a wonderful concept that was poorly utilized. She's the reverse of Harry Potter and her concept would have been way better if they had been the same age and she had been an active character in his school years.

** For what it's worth, this one is pretty good linkffn(10205249)

It's not perfect, there are some things that I don't agree with, and it is overly wordy, like, unnecessarily so. Aside from that though, it's pretty good, the characterization in particular (at least for Harry and Delphi) is very good, the others are a bit questionable, but I LOVE their characters.

Fair warning though, it's unfinished and I don't think it will be finished since it hasn't been updated in over a year and a half. Also, it does touch on some rather real world issues, racism and religion in particular. It doesn't get offensive or anything, but it definitely touches on it.

** This isn't exactly a pairing but I feel like it has the potential to become one, and it was a fun read

** I would be interested in that Pair too. But only Canon wise, meaning: Harry has her as a Younger Lover. But the First idea, that came in my mind was for a infidelity/seduction Fic. So Delphini joins into Harrys Family and slowly over time tries to make him be attracted to her (possibly through little dosings of Love Potion), so she could destroy his Family to avenge her Father/Parents. So yes, a possibly dark Fic. But also a erotic one, as i can imagine.

​

"Neurotic Catharsis" is unfortunetly the only Fic, i found, that Fit the dark tempting part. There is a other one, that have she rapes him, while a TV in there room shows the Girls being raped and violated by the Deatheaters....nah, not for be, also because its contains murdering.

​

But here is the link to Neurotic Catharsis....if you are interested [[https://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1917]]
