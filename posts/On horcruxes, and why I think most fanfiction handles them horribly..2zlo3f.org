Disclaimer: I've wanted to rant about this for a while now. If you don't want to read all this text, that's fine; I'm partially just writing this for me because I can't stop thinking about it. If, however, you do take the time to read the entirety of my post, please let me know what you think. I'm very interested to hear other people's thoughts on this subject.

--------------

You may think that horcruxes are soul containers that require sacrifice and grant immortality. If you're in the world of Harry Potter, that's exactly what they are. If you're reading the story of Harry Potter, that's certainly what they seem to be. But if you're /writing/ the story of Harry potter, you need to recognize that horcruxes are actually *plot devices*.

In the canon storyline, they served to advance the plot by introducing either a challenge that the characters must overcome, or a setting that the characters need a reason to explore. In many fanfics that I've read, the authors have changed the main characters and their story in some way, yet kept the horcruxes identical to canon, which usually results in challenges that are too easy (and therefore uninteresting) to overcome, and locations that don't actually need to be explored.

So if you've changed the skills or resources of your main characters (which you certainly have done if you're writing fanfiction), don't try to use the same horcruxes, because it will result in challenges that just aren't appropriate for your story. If finding and destroying a horcrux is too easy, there's no tension, and your writing will end up boring and pointless. It's not interesting to spend an extended amount of time having a character do something that the reader knows they can accomplish easily. It's not even interesting to spend a short amount of time on an easy challenge.

--------------

Let's take a minute to examine how the horcruxes functioned as plot devices in the canon storyline. The diary will be ignored because it functions drastically differently from all of the others as it's literally just handed to us.

- Hufflepuff's Cup, Slytherin's Locket, and Ravenclaw's Diadem are all /MacGuffins/ that present Harry and his entourage with challenges to overcome. The Locket presents the challenge of breaking into the Ministry, the Cup presents the challenge of breaking into Gringotts, and the Diadem presents the challenge of breaking into Hogwarts. All of these challenges are appropriately tailored to be difficult enough to be interesting, yet still achievable.

  Fun Fact: Since the basilisk fang and Griffindor's Sword are needed to destroy the horcruxes, they become “double MacGuffins,” since the characters need to not only go get the special thingy, but also go get another special thingy in order to destroy the first thingy. So the horcruxes are plot devices that not only introduce plot, but also introduce other plot devices! That's neat storytelling.

  In the earlier books, nearly everything happens at Hogwarts, so we don't require a reason to bring our characters to certain settings. In book 7, our characters are hiding out in Grimmauld Place or camping in the woods most of the time, so we need a reason to bring them elsewhere. The Cup and Locket provide us with a reason to explore a new setting to break the monotony, and the Diadem brings us to Hogwarts to set the stage for the finale. You may notice that the prophecy in book 5 functioned as a plot device in exactly the same manner as the Diadem.

- Nagini functions a bit differently from these three. As she was always present at Voldemort's side, it was impossible to break into Voldemort's lair to kill her, and it was also impossible to kill her without him being made aware of Harry's plans. This required Nagini to be dealt with as late as possible, and it also required Voldemort to be drawn out and engaged in combat. Thus, as a plot device, Nagini necessitated that Voldemort had to be engaged in battle during the finale.

- The Gaunt Ring is also rather different from the others. While all the others are something that Harry must deal with, the Ring is used to kill off Dumbledore, which is a critical event with many consequences. One of the biggest effects is it removes an effective “lifeline” that Harry has had throughout the first six books, making things much more tense and upping the stakes significantly in the seventh one.

- Harry's scar being a horcrux requires him to sacrifice himself, so it serves to demonstrate the courage and selflessness of the story's hero. This one is both unique and straightforward in it's purpose.

  Collectively, the horcruxes also provide us with an excuse to explore Voldemort's past. All of the memories that Dumbledore and Harry go through during the sixth book serve as exposition to help the readers get to know their antagonist. The existence of the horcruxes functions in this regard as an excuse for the characters to spend time exploring this information. (Slughorn's memory is a “double MacGuffin” as well: go get the thingy so we can go get the other thingies!”)

  The overall quantity of horcruxes is also worth taking note of. It introduces a variety of goals that the main characters must accomplish before they are done, without necessarily imposing a specific order upon said goals. Harry Potter and friends trying to figure out how track down and destroy a variety of objects in a variety of locations with a variety of obstacles as quickly as they can is a more interesting story than Harry Potter and friends trying to figure out how to accomplish a singular task.

--------------

So, that's why the horcruxes exist how they do in canon.

Should they be exactly the same in your fanfiction? Probably not.

If you want to retain the concept of horcruxes in your writing (you don't have to, there are other ways to introduce plot devices), consider it carefully.

If Harry is more skilled than he is in in canon, you should probably consider making the “heist” horcruxes more difficult to obtain. If he has a different set of skills, make him have to utilize those skills to get at the horcruxes. If you've spent 10 chapters teaching Harry how to do something, you'd better not have him spend 1 chapter doing it, and you'd better not have him do something entirely different than what he learned.

--------------

Here are some examples of bad ways to write about horcruxes:

- Shenanigans happen with the Black family/headship/vaults in Gringotts! Suddenly Harry can just get the cup from the vault and destroy it. -- Why bother writing this at all? There's no actual challenge here; it's just stuff that happens for no reason. If Harry actually had to work to gain access to the Lestrange vault, it could be worthwhile, but if it's just handed to him there's no point in writing it at all.

- Harry gains the ability to phoenix flash through any wards. He teleports to all the places that the horcruxes are stashed and just grabs them and skedaddles. -- Once again, there's no challenge and this is just boring.

- Harry gains the memories of Voldemort from his scar. He now knows exactly where every horcrux is and how to get past their traps and challenge. He collects and destroys them all easily. -- Boooooooooooooooooooring!

- Harry wasn't strong enough to defeat Voldemort so he travels back in time to do everything again. He spends the do-over trying to get better so that he can win this time. But he did manage to destroy the horcruxes last time so he destroys them again this time with great ease. -- What's the point of making Harry do something that he's already proven capable of? If he didn't succeed in destroying the horcruxes last time, it would be interesting. But there's no point in having him do the exact same thing twice. Fixing mistakes is a challenge, but repeating successes is not.

- Harry spends a large amount of time training his dueling skills to be super cool. Then he goes on a scavenger hunt for a while that doesn't involve any cool dueling. Once it's finished, he uses his cool dueling skills to duel Voldemort and it's cool. -- If your fic is about the combat, don't just interrupt it for something completely unrelated. Keep in mind what your theme is, and keep it consistent. If you want to spend time teaching Harry how to fight, and you have horcruxes in your story, make him fight to get them! Guard those horcruxes with armies of minions!

- Harry stumbles upon the Locket while in Grimmuald place, recognizes it immediately, and destroys it. He finds the room of hidden things one day in Hogwarts, stumbles upon the Diadem, and destroys that right away too. -- What's the point? Seriously, what's the point? There isn't one.

- Someone (usually Goblins) recognizes that Harry's scar is a horcrux and knows a ritual to remove it. They promptly and easily do so and now Harry doesn't have to die. Huzzah, everything is now sunshine and roses. -- Harry sacrificing himself is an interesting thing that can happen, and there's a point to writing it. Harry having to figure out how to get the horcrux out of his head without sacrificing himself is an interesting thing that can happen, and there's a point to writing it. Someone handing Harry the solution to getting the horcrux out of his head without sacrificing him is not an interesting thing that can happen, and there's no point to wring it.

--------------

So, yeah, that's my rant. If the examples of bad uses of horcruxes seem familiar to you, you'll know why I wrote this. It is my opinion that way too many fanfiction writers feel the need to put horcruxes in their story in exactly the same way that they appear in canon. Most of the time, when people change Harry's skills and resources, they neglect to change the challenges he faces to match. Most of the time, the horcruxes are plot points that don't quite fit into the stories that people write in fanfiction, and just seem out of place.

Please let me know what your thoughts on this subject are.

*TL;DR:* Know what NOT to write in fanfiction. If your Harry Potter has no interest in flying, you wouldn't write him playing Quidditch. If your plotline isn't the same as it is in canon, don't use the same plot devices! If horcruxes don't fit into your story, cut them out!


** I feel like.... This would be a great rant for someone writing original fiction, because there the plot devices and story progression and /tension/ and /conflict/ are the most important things. Honestly, that's why I don't read original fiction, published or otherwise.

I feel like you're completely overlooking the emotional aspect of fanfiction. First of all, I think people write about Harry going back and doing it easily, or having the goblins do it, or being able to get through the wards, because it's emotionally satisfying to see him be able to solve the problem more easily the second time around. After all, I'm sure most people wish they had future knowledge/second chances, powerful benefactors, and all the cheat codes to life. Second of all, changing what the horcruxes are, or not using them at all, changes who Voldemort is, because the horcruxes are a huge part of who Voldemort is. Using old pennies that no one will ever find takes away his pride and grandioseness and general drama queen attitude. Using a staff that once belonged to Merlin is drama queen enough, but takes away his deep connection to Hogwarts. And honestly, the objects that are his horcruxes are familiar. I mean, people have charm bracelets of them. And I think that familiarity is part of what makes someone emotionally attached to a universe or story. Changing the horcruxes would be like changing the schools that come to compete in the tournament, or renaming Hogwarts or something. It makes it less like reading in the universe you're already attached to, and more like having to get attached to a brand new universe.

Anyways "" I'm not sure how coherent that was... Just an alternate point of view. With fanfiction, it's not as simple as just using the best plot device

*** I'm with this guy. If we wanted a canon-experience we'd just read canon again.

The whole point of fanfiction is to be different from the source. If we made Harry stronger, and the Horcrux hunt correspondingly more difficult, and made Voldemort rise up to Harry's challenge all in perfect unison, how is that any different from original Harry hunting original Horcrux and defeating original Voldemort?

***** Way late to this discussion, but I'm new to this sub.

Perhaps a different way to look at this is aside from a few select genres of fiction, most stories need a few select things to be interesting, one if which is tension. One of JKR's tools to increase tension was the Horocruxes. By making them hard to get to, and even harder to destroy, she then created conflict, which drove the story.

If your personal fic does revolve around killing Voldemort, as canon does, then you likely should use the Horocrux hunt to create conflict and increase tension.

If instead, your fic revolves around Harry from the future, jumping back in time, going to Hogwarts in the 70's, falling in love with Narcissa Black, as Lily Evans admits that she really likes dark haired men (and this new one, aka Harry, is far less of a prig than James Potter), having to hide where he's from, as he sorts out his feelings for his archrival's mom, and fends off his mother's advances, then provided you maintain proper tension, and character development, you likely have enough conflict to not need an in depth horocrux hunt, as unless written correctly, one would likely detract from the story you have going.

Even the wish fulfillment genre is no exception to this rule, as an all powerful Harry that beds all women, and has no trouble overcoming trials, while fun for a while, quickly grows stale.

To quote the guy's at Writing Excuses, "You can make your character as powerful as you want, provided the challenges they face are outside their realm of power."

Tldr. Horocruxes are a method to create conflict, and provided they add to the story should be considered for similar means, unless by doing so you would detract from the story.

*** Thanks for your reply. You're correct, I ranted quite a bit about literary devices and how they should "correctly" be used in well-written original fiction, but when it comes to fan fiction, sometimes you just want to break the rules and mess around with it.

If you want to write a fanfic where you make fun of certain plot points that don't necessarily make sense and throw easy challenges at your protagonist, go for it! My advice for people writing something like that would be just to make sure everything in your story serves some sort of purpose. Go ahead, make Harry so powerful that he just puts the horcruxes on his grocery list between his eggs and orange juice, that's funny! Or deal with them the same as in canon in order to maintain some sense of familiarity. As long as you have a /reason/ for what you're writing, it doesn't matter what that reason is.

#+end_quote

I really agree with this. I read a lot of Hogwarts Era fics and many of them happen 6th year (where the characters are of age for reasons) and unfortunately, that puts us in the Horcrux timeline of canon.

Personally, I would prefer that a detailed Horcrux hunt stay out of a fanfic that wasn't specifically about Horcruxes or the war. In my opinion, nothing tanks the enjoyability of a school era fic quicker than taking a break from the fic author's original story to deal with the Horcruxes.

An example is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] (Dramione). That story was fantastic except for when the author had Hermione and crew hunt for the Horcruxes. There was too much retelling of canon then that I just ended up skipping ahead until she got back to her original story.

We as readers know how the Horcrux hunt went. Re-reading the Horcrux hunt gets tiresome after several fics, really. The author should do like you suggest - change it up a bit if they insist on keeping them in the story, or really just keep it all off screen or summarize the events and have characters just reference what happened (if the author wanted to stick with how events happened in canon).

** Agree with everything said, though I kinda feel it wasn't necessary to say. Does anyone believe that fix-it fics where Harry easily retrieves and destroys all horcruxes are good? I don't think so.

From a more in-universe perspective, people get horcruxes wrong all the time too. This is, I think, a much more egregious error, because your points are more about good story structure in general, whereas this is a matter of getting the source material wrong.

So many fics just get horcrux mechanics all wrong.

1. You can't directly affect a horcrux. *That's the point of a horcrux*. You can't kill a horcrux with a killing curse, a Dementor can't suck a horcrux out of its receptacle, and certainly there aren't any medical procedures that can extract it. Even when you do something to destroy the horcrux, like stabbing one of Voldemort's horcruxes with a basilisk fang, you're not directly affecting the soul piece. The basilisk venom doesn't kill the soul, it destroys the physical object, after which the soul must move on. *The only way to destroy a horcrux is to physically destroy the receptacle*. This is such a basic point that so many people fail to understand.

2. Horcruxes don't have default invulnerability. Something being a horcrux does not in itself grant that object any special invulnerability to damage. The Dark wizard creating the horcrux must enchant the receptacle to resist damage separately from the process of making it a horcrux.

3. There isn't a default set of horcrux-protecting enchantments that all horcruxes possess. The wizard creating the horcrux puts the protections on the receptacle, and what things that wizard chooses to protect against depends on the wizard's choices and capabilities. *Different horcruxes will therefore be protected against different things*. This is what it means to put a horcrux beyond magical repair (and thus destroy it): *you put the horcrux beyond that horcrux's specific ability to magically repair*, not beyond some abstract concept of magical repair in general. Basilisk venom for example, does not necessarily put something beyond magical repair: if you have phoenix tears, you can repair the damage of basilisk venom. So the horcrux in Harry wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, because he wasn't put beyond magical repair by it, but it does destroy the others because Voldemort didn't protect them against basilisk venom. It's specifically stated, however, that had Voldemort had access to phoenix tears, he would have been able to protect his horcruxes against basilisk venom. *Basilisk venom is not some set-in-stone horcrux-destroyer, it destroys horcruxes simply because the ingredient necessary to resist it is so rare*.

All of this was explained explicitly in Deathly Hallows chapter 6.

Horcrux being tied innately to its physical container:

#+begin_quote
  “But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”

  “Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.” Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all.”

  ”Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure,” said Ron. Harry laughed.

  “It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione. “But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. *The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival*. It can't exist without it.”
#+end_quote

Protections on a horcrux are put there separately by the Dark wizard making it:

#+begin_quote
  “No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because *it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them*.
#+end_quote

Efficacy of basilisk fangs in destroying horcruxes depends on horcruxes not being protected against it, due to the rarity of its single counteracting force:

#+begin_quote
  "From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

  “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.

  “Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”

  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be *something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare* --“

  “-- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione.

*** All of this is fair, but you can take "sticking to the source material" too far. Just because a certain set of conditions was set up in canon doesn't mean that a fanfic is automatically wrong or bad for not sticking religiously to those conditions.

For example, just off the top of my head, I can see potential in fics that ignore point #1. Sure, in canon, the soul fragment cannot survive once the container is destroyed. But it could be possible to create an interesting fic where a soul fragment isn't as limited as Harry thought. There's even canon support for that, given how the soul fragment in the diary behaved!

So it's not that fanfic writers get horcruxes /wrong/ (unless their intention is to do them strictly according to canon). They do them /differently/. The real questions are whether the changes are well reasoned, plausible withing the context of the rest of canon they are keeping, and help establish an interesting story.

And yeah, most don't. But it's not because they made changes, it's because they did a poor job with the changes. Then again, one of the reasons for writing fanfics is to practice writing and make mistakes so you can learn.

I feel the same about the triwizzard challenges , if harry is awesomener than canon so must be the challenges , they must be more and more difficult. I loved a godlike!Harry story because it had innovative and interesting triwizzard challenges (sadly got discontinued in the middle of it) . The problem is not how powerfull the main protagonist is but the ammount of tension and conflict the story has , if there's noone then there's no point on reading.

** This totally hits the nail on the head. That said OP, you didn't mention how to write horcruxes in their same locations, with the same protections, yet still make them interesting. There are ways to write good canon horcruxes.

A good way of doing this is to introduce some new interesting twist. Maybe make the diadem possess someone when they accidentally find it. Maybe the protections around the Gaunt Ring, something never heavily expounded upon in the canon include a multitude of demons from the Lower Reaches of Hell, something Dumbledore was able to clear out quite easily for whatever reason but the protagonist has no good idea how to handle.

Of course, OPs thoughts on removing horcruxes if they don't fit is just as, if not more valid. This is fanfiction, one can be as creative with the plot as they want as long as the story is a somewhat recognizable deviation from canon. Removing horcruxes would be a trifle compared to the crazy stuff other people throw into their stories (Sharingan-Harry? Really?). Or bring up Voldemort's horcruxes, but the protagonist uses some novel way of defeating Voldemort (Obliviation, confining his disembodied spirit to something after defeating him, dementor french-kiss, physical brain damage).

But seriously. Are horcruxes that controversial? I've seen them done really well (much harder to kill) /and/ very poorly (paraphrased canon or superpowered!Harry). I don't really see them as all that different than any other canon plot point, but that's just my opinion.

If you look back on older fics, you'll see a lot of OotP diversion stories that are incredibly varied and wild in their approaches. And then you look at modern fics and they're all about Horcruxes, if it's anything about killing Voldemort.

There's just not as many things you can do with the HP-verse now with the inclusion of Horcruxes, which makes them repetitive, which in turn makes them boring.

So if a horcrux plot point doesn't quite fit into the fic, and you repeat handling that the same way four or five times over, it can end up being a bit too much.

*** It was, but no more ridiculous than prophecies, like in the third and fifth book. It was just an excuse for J.K. Rowling to pit Harry against Voldemort directly, something that seemed pretty unnecessary since the constant death attempts and killing of his loved ones seemed to be incentive enough.

** Horcruxes are a hurdle to a lot of fan fiction. Because they are so intricate to the end-game of Voldemort's defeat, if you're writing a story that eventually involves Harry's defeat of the Dark Lord you /have/ to address it some way:

1. Ignore their existence in canon (largely unsatisfying)
2. Plow through it as quickly as possible to get to the story you /want/ to tell (OP's complaint)
3. Find an interesting angle to address the Horcruxes that is compatible with your theme and unique. (Hard, unless you plan it from the outset.)

*** Unsung Hero was a great fic. I know it seems shitty now, and it is, but you just had to be there. It was great.

**** I was reading some (very) old archived threads on portkey awhile back and had no idea how controversial the fic was for the H/Hr community.

IMO it should have been a Harry/Luna fic but I really like the idea of horcruxes that were different than canon even though many of them were used to advance very strange plot points.

Why do you think it seems shitty now? I'm not trying to provoke an argument, I'm genuinely curious.

***** The ending is one of the all time worse endings I've ever read, Harry is pretty Sueish, the bashing. Take your pick.

Really I like the fic despite the flaws because it's such a compelling adventure the first time you read it. A lot of people dislike it though and I can definitely understand their reasoning.

** I really agree with this, and consider Bungle in the Jungle + Turn Me Loose to be a really good example of Horcruxes as properly used plot devices.
