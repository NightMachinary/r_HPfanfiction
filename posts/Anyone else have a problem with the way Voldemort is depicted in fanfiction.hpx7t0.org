All the fics I've read depict him cruciating his followers left and right, but I would imagine that he kept his servants under control through the fear of the unknown, of what he could do to you and whether he would do it. I think he is far more unpredictable, sometimes cruciating followers for mess-ups and sometimes finding other ways to punish them, such as sending their children on a fool's errand masked as a great honor. I would think that if all Death Eaters would go into meetings with Voldemort expecting to get a dose of pain every single time, no one would want to follow him anymore.

Furthermore, he's always depicted as having some weird speech pattern, such as addressing to himself in plural ("we", "us", "our") or talking very properly but in the books he talked quite normally. The only weird thing was addressing to himself in third person when threatening someone but not even that is that uncommon for highly confident people.

If you have any recommendations that do him justice, I will greatly appreciate it as well.


** The we/our stuff can be explained by authors leaning heavily on Voldemort declaring himself Lord, and so they have him ising the royal we.

Otherwise i completely agree. If he wanted to demonstrate his ability to cause them pain in gruesome ways he'd demonstrate on the people opposing him

** I like to think I did. I wrote one fic that's needs some touch ups and I'm about to complete a second (maybe three chapters away from completion). But full disclosure, I can't see how they'll appeal to you if you're not a fan of Snape, and they both do show him torturing his own people, among other things. My author page:
