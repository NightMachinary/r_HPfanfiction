I read it ages ago and it's somewhat stuck in my head and I have the urge to go and re-read it. As the title states, Harry starts to turn into a basilisk sometime after the 2nd year of schooling (i believe during summer break). I remember he lives in an inn in Knockturn Alley and there was a crow there too and a few vampires he befriended. Any help finding this would be really nice!


** I do believe you're talking about Serpens Armarum and Serpens Arcanum by Evander.

Sadly they've been recently taken down from ff.net and ao3 due to some Seriously Rude people who kept screeching about why hadn't they updated Arcanem like 10 years and the author got sick of it.

But they are thankfully archived on Fiction Hunt

Serpens Armarum: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4385420/1]]

Serpens Arcanem: [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/5237053/1]]

and now i'm going to bloody well save them onto my laptop so i never lose them again

  In the summer after his second year, something unexpected happens to Harry. Changes are occurring, though he doesn't know it. What will he do when he realizes that the Basilisk venom and the Phoenix tears are turning him into something new entirely? How will this change the outcome against Voldemort? What will happen?Under revision!

** Thank you everyone who has tried to find this fic for me. However, I managed to find the old author with the help of a friend and found that she has since deleted the fan fiction due to pestering for updates on its sequel. I suppose I won't be re-reading it after all.
