Heya!

Last year I read the arithmancer series (Hermione is an arithmancy badass spellcrafter) and The changeling (amazing slytherin!Ginny who is cunning but still herself). I loved them! They both have complex female main characters and I am here for it!

So I am looking for some recommendations. I like to grow with characters - not just having them be OP from the beginning and just breezing trough every challange. I like them clever and complex. Could be any female character, so some daphne or luna or whoever, could also be female versions of male characters if they are well written. Bonus points for them delving into alternative or interesting magic.

Thank you!


** Are you looking for like series fics or just one fic because j have a series currently on 4th year and its amazing rigel black is the name it will make sense once you read

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.

** I am reading a really good one atm with Hermione as a main character linkffn(The Gates of Azkaban) hope that works!

And I wrote one from Narcissa's POV. She isn't nice, but I liked writing her...
