I would love to read a long fic that gives a lot of attention to Fred and George, their friendship, twin-bond etc But I really like war fics so that would be a huge plus... and it probably should break my heart at the end... If the main plot is something else it is okay if my dudes get some part of the plot..

Taking an aging potion was Fred and George Weasley's backup plan for getting past Dumbledore's age line in GoF. Their initial idea, though... Well, finding themselves 18 years in the past was not part of the plan. Marauders era. No bashing.

Just finished this fanfiction after seeing it on this platform and created this account to recommend it to you :)
