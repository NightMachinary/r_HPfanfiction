Harry Potter was a proud Welsh son , why the hell would he stick his neck out for England when they could just move the magical community to Cardiff and shave protection runes and security ward into the wooly fleeces of the sheep that roamed the boarder hills to repeal any invaders like the Wepsh had done before 1461.

It would be a handy way to deal with the Death Eaters. Along with highly entertaining as he could already picture Rob trying to pronounce the name of the Potters ancestral stronghold.

** I don't know if this is only for the prompt or if you really didn't know, but Harry is from the West Country, not Wales. Also, he isn't the saviour of England, but of Britain, which includes Scotland and Wales. England isn't named much in the books, because the wizarding community has been mostly united since the tenth century with the establishment of Hogwarts, so well before any national identity as we know today form. Margaret Thatcher also stopped being PM ten months before he even learned about the wizarding world (which really doesn't matter since he lived in Surrey from 2 November 1981 until 1 September 1991 when he started living in the Scottish Highlands for ten months a year until summer of '97).

**** I'm sorry if I have not read all the rubbish you have apparently read: Scottish is just as bad without a meaningful reason. I also said I wasn't sure if this was purposefully done for the sake of the prompt or if it came from ignorance.

***** I think at least for the story I read previously professor mcgonagall ended up raising Harry and that's why he was Scottish. And quite frankly I'm sorry that you feel you are confined to such a small segment of the fandom when it comes to reading stories you should cast your net far and wide to find the true gems within the fanfiction archieves. Quite frankly quite a few authors can surprise you with the magnificent quality of their writing. I hope you continue to find stories that you can enjoy I know sometimes that can be difficult When you are looking for something very particular within the fandom.
