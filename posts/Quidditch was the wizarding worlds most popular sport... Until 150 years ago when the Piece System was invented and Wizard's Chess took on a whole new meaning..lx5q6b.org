Ronald Billius Weasley, 6th Son of The 7th Son of The Weasley family, loved Chess. His older brother Charlie was one of the best Rooks Gyffindor has had in the past 50 years, and even in their second year the twins Fred and George were on their way into the history books as a Bishop pair. Ron always planned on making his way onto the team, but never had hopes of being more than a Knight. Maybe a Rook if he was lucky, because as long as the twins remained at Hogwarts he would never be a Bishop on the Gyffindor team. And where else would he be?

He wasn't skilled or powerful enough to be a Queen, and he didn't have half of the raw magic power needed to be a King.

(Mobile Line Break)

Basically an AU where something like the Evil Piece System from Highschool DxD is in Harry Potter, and Wizards Chess overtakes Quidditch as the sport of choice. I imagine the rules change and become more of a dueling game on a chessboard.

Pawns can move after the other pieces to provide support for duels

Knights are equippd with brooms and can provide aerial support to whatever squares they fly over.

Bishops can provide ranged ground support by being able to shoot spells across the field diagonally from where they end up.

Rooks, if they dont move, get a defensible fort like area.

Queens boost the attack power of any units they're adjacent to.

Kinga meanwhile take the burden of making moves and supplying magic for their pieces, and they can lose in regular chess fashion or if they pass out from exhaustion.

And the point of the story is that the game has progressed that Kings are now essentially batteries that can supply their pieces with the most power with basic strategy, and in a sports anime fasion Ron comes in and uses super grandmaster strategy to win, while only being above average in power as a wizard.


** High School DxD is one of those series with 10% absolutely great ideas, powers, and living myths, buried in 90% garbage

That said, I absolutely love this AU idea. I didn't actually like i.e. much of Hogwarts Battle School or HPMOR in practice, but Quidditch is basically magic-cricket+football, and the idea of pulling on competitions from other media and putting it in an HP-style magic setting is a lot of fun.

A difficulty with writing a story like this for more than 1-2 battles would be in having Ron implement strategy that actually seem smart, reasonable in the setting, and shouldn't have been thought of by someone else before going through the same combat system. The way that they get away with that (in HPMOR, Ender's Game, and DxD) is either in having the "sport" taking place be something that adults simply don't commonly do, make it a recent burgeoning sport rather than something with a long history/give a reason for it to be a changing landscape, or in the case of Ender's Game make it clear why the mentality of children is better suited for it (which I'm not sure how you'd do without straight up ripping off Ender's Game). Also the few DxD rating games we see are largely about raw shonen power, and Issei pulling out an in-character but ridiculous power of some kind.

** I don't know anything about evil piece system but this sounds more interesting than quidditch. What position do see for Harry if Ron is King? Will Hermione be interested in playing?
