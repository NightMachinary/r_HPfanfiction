[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11859282/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Darkness-Ascendant]] edit: name change, can't change title

When Harry Potter's parents died, his father's inheritance fell to him. For a decade, it had to wait. Then, on the eleventh anniversary of his conception, the Darkness flared and Harry was imbued with great power and a family member long dead reentered his life.

The Darkness isn't just a tool, though. It marks its wielders' as its own, creating a fertile field for itself by submitting its Wielders to the Dark action of their ancestors in their dreams, preparing a Wielder for their needs.

poly, not harem. No soul bonds. No magical cores. No lords.

Darkness comic influenced storyline

I saw the screwed up italics in c2, will fix in a min

*** Yeah. If there is already a popular fic with your title you should probably get a new one.

** Just one thing: Maybe put the Prologue with the rest of the chapter? Its really just a subjective thing, I don't know if other people feel the same, but I tend to close the tab when the entire chapter fits on my screen. It was a mere spur of the moment thing that I didn't click X, but "next chapter" to see if there is more.
