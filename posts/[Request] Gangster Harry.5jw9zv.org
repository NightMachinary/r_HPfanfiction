Looking for a crack fic where where Harry is a gangster that corrupts Hermione. All I can remember of the fic is that in one chapter Hermione shoots him so he could not run away.

** "Mother fucker! What the fuck was that for?" He clasped his thigh, trying to stem the bleeding from the gunshot wound he'd just received.

"You can't escape if you can't walk." Hermione told him, grabbing one arm and tugging him behind her.

"What the fuck are you talking about?"

"You are riding the train home, Harry. I'm going to make sure of it."

"I don't understand your fascination with the bloody train ride! And god-damn-it, you didn't have to fucking shoot me you carpet-munching-cum-dump! It fucking hurts to get shot! And quit dragging me! Fuck!" He was pulled down the stairs, and almost fell flat on his face. "And I'll show you fucking escape!"

** Not directly related to Harry Potter, but I find the story behind Lucky Luciano fascinating:

Lucky Luciano formed a Trio with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. Eventually they took out Joe Massaria and Salvatore Marazano, older crime lords who fought viciously against each other.

The attitudes of Massaria and Marazano are remarkably close to British purebloods: /older, traditional Mafia bosses who had started their criminal careers in Italy. They believed in upholding the supposed "Old World Mafia" principles of "honor", "tradition", "respect", and "dignity". These bosses refused to work with non-Italians, and were even skeptical of working with non-Sicilians. Some of the most conservative bosses only worked with men with roots in their own Sicilian village. Luciano, in contrast, believed that as long as there was money to be made, the ethnicity of your partner didn't matter. He was thus willing to not only work with Italians, but also Jewish and Irish gangsters./

In the 1990 film Mobsters, Maranzano is portrayed by none other than Michael Gambon.

** Nevile: "Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!"

On the monitor we see Neville suddenly spin and hex down into the foyer. Return hex's decimates him. A spell connects, blows him up against the door.

Harry

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his sideboard, hauls out a large enchanted log. He looks up at the monitor. On the monitors, the Aurors are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.

Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around the corpse of Neville, motioning to-each other, laying an explosive potion at the base of the door to blow it out. Harry reinforcing the enchantments on his log, intends to beat them to the punch, talking to himself.

Harry: (in latin) So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.

#+begin_example
    Karroooomph!
#+end_example

The spells in the log are activated, The log tears down the door and blows the Aurors like punks off the landing into the foyer. Kingsley Shackbolt, one of the aurors screaming, smoke billowing wildly. Harry, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex of the stairs, firing his log wand and yelling.
