For example, I don't normally read Harry/Luna and fics where Harry randomly runs into the Dursleys can feel really contrived, but JJ Rust's one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133728/1/Family-Reunion][Family Reunion]] is really great.

Or I don't normally read Harry/Bellatrix, but Delenda Est is the exception.


** Self-inserts are generally so bad as to be unreadable.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9399640/1/In-Bad-Faith][In Bad Faith]] is an example of how to do it and not completely suck.

** I've tried reading Bellamione, but none of them are any good. /Except/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]]. It's stellar.
