I hate to sound like every patronising parent who ever drove me up the wall, but I find that a lot of fanfiction writers are incredibly bad at writing an 11 year old. They go far too mature, or far too immature.


** I find it amusing but highly frustrating. I have no kids of my own, but I have little siblings, we're all a few years apart, so I've had practice with all age groups younger than myself. Plus friends' kids.

The children I see written in fics aren't... Right. It's like a five year old masquerading as an eleven year old, or an adult in an eleven year olds body. Weird. Kids don't talk like that. Kids don't regurgitate a thesaurus when they open their mouth, speak in metaphor, or profess their undying love (usually) until they're at least in their dramatic mid teens.

** Writing kids is hard, full stop. Most people screw it up. I've personally found the writers who I happen to know are parents to have almost universally /terrible/ representations of kids in their stories, even compared to other writers. Maybe those terrible ones are just the ones who brag about it. Who knows.

Most people screw up writing kids from ignorance, but parents seem to do it from some ideological position than sends things into weird places. They usually massively under-age kid personalities, making a 12-year-old sound like they are eight or nine, and so forth. In writing teens, they usually also avoid the scary and gross parts of that age, making the characters either mature twenty-something date machines with only honorable intentions, or sexless child drones confused in all the wrong ways by adolescence. In those stories, no one ever giggles to their girlfriends about hearing their older cousin talking about blow jobs, or gossips about which girl in class has the biggest boobs with the other guys, like real thirteen-year-olds do.

Writers who happen to be parents rarely confuse kids with adults, true. But the odd moppets they so often write usually have more to do with personal fantasies of perfect little kids staying perfect forever than actual adolescents. This often means loving scenes of children being held and snuggled by parents well into their teens (this doesn't happen), the characters being oddly physically tiny and emotionally fragile (the better to hug), and all teens and tweens wanting maximum time hanging out with their cool parents (nope!).

I once suggested to someone wanting to write realistic modern kids that they search for boy band fans and videogamers tweeting to get an idea of modern youth culture and terminology. I never heard from them again, so either it worked or their brain exploded. Either way, that is the sort of level of dedication and attention to detail required to actually write kids and how they interact with each other. Brain exploding levels of attention to detail.

** I don't have any kids of my own. I am around them on a daily basis though and have my degree in Human and Family Development, so I know what you mean when you talk about writers not doing well with writing different ages. I read a fic once where a four year old Harry was making an elaborate plan and I was like a four year old is not developed enough cognitively to even think of planning their day tomorrow let alone months from now. I don't think I would do well writing from a child's perspective even knowing how children develop. Their minds are so limited until they develop their own autonomy.

I try to make it a point in my fic to write the teenagers as teenagers. Granted they are teenagers taking on adult tasks in a war, but emotionally and maturity wise I make sure they think and act as a teenager would. Or I at least try to, I'm told I do a good job with that, but who knows.

Unless the problem is particularly egregious, I typically don't care. Probably because I don't know much of kids, along with reading of a protagonist on such a simple level is rather dull.

** I tend to write my 11 year olds as naive adults. Similar thought patterns, but they don't know much about the world (obviously) so they don't make rational decisions. Make more and more rational choices as they get older.

Might be a simpler way of doing it, but it works for me.

*** It is a lack of /social/ intelligence that really differentiates kids 12 and younger and adults, outside the obvious practical world experiences. Before then, kids often act like cute little Hannibal Lecters because they /can't/ know any better.

Their brains literally aren't developed enough to have adult levels of empathy and socialization, regardless of their personal experiences. It just won't stick very well before then, even if they are raised well and with kindness.

That's hard to write, because it makes little kids seem selfish and mean when their internal motivations are exposed in prose. And they are, by and large, realistically speaking. But that doesn't read very well. So kids are often romanticized, unfairly whitewashing their flaws in favor of more sympathetic and appealing portrayals. More adult ones.

** Eh, while I'm sure there are many theories on the subject, I don't think you can really apply them to every individual. It's not like there's a universal way that all 13-year-olds think and speak. As long as the characters feel like their canon selves, or if they don't it's because of an AU change that makes them interesting in and of themselves, I'm fine with it.

*** Writing Kids with realistic kid-like voices and thought processes is a rare talent. I always thought Harry in your story felt more like a twenty year old than a kid. Stories like /Hogwarts Houses Divided/, /Prince of the Dark Kingdom/ and /On the Way to Greatness/ actually make kids sound like kids.

Most importantly, there is a sort-of satisfaction in watching characters mature from their childish selves to adults in multi-year fics. While your story has plenty of positives, this is where you miss out, I'm afraid. This is also where stories like AQ fail as well -- Alexandra is immature and reckless, which is great, but she never /learns/ and never /matures/. She hasn't till now, at any rate.

In contrast, /On the Way to Greatness/ does this incredibly well. Harry in his first and second year is noticeably much more child-like in his thoughts and actions, and his evolution as a leader in Slytherin and in school is organic and very well portrayed. One of the many reasons it is my favorite fanfic.

**** Alexandra has almost textbook ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder). It's seriously as though the author opened up the DSM-5 and wrote the character. I think she's VERY realistic...because those kids exist, and they never /learn/ and never /mature/ unless you intervene. The adults in AQ are horrible people (seriously, I would say that's my biggest complaint about AQ...not a single one of them see a struggling child and think "hmm, gotta do something about that". Maybe it's a critique of the American education system...), so by the end of the fourth book, she's hit rock bottom in a fiery crash...which, sadly enough, is pretty much what happens to children with ODD.

I'd agree with that. You could say the same thing about ice dancing or juggling or country music, though. Just because I can appreciate the talent and effort it takes doesn't mean I necessarily want to experience it. For me, stories like PotDK are a struggle to read and enjoy precisely because of Harry's "kid-ness." While I appreciate the writing ability it takes to make Harry realistically eleven, I don't want to read about real eleven-year-olds, I want to read about heroically or dramatically or narratively /special/ eleven-year-olds. I want to read about the parts that make them different or interesting.

Well, forget PotDK. Try to emulate canon in that respect. I always loved eleven year old Harry's voice in canon, and his growth as a character is realistic and well done. Surely you enjoyed the HP books despite Harry's "kid-ness"? If you want your Harry to be more mature, try to emulate PoA Harry instead. Your Harry is /way/ too mature for his age.

Then again, may be it's only my personal preference. I certainly won't begrudge you your preference, and I enjoy your story despite the fact. Still, give me a canon-like kid over a super-kid any day of the week.

****** To be honest, Harry's "kid-ness" in canon isn't something I particularly enjoy. JKR is a good enough writer that it doesn't outright bother me, but the last time I re-read the series I skimmed pretty hard over the examples of this. The times I like Harry most are the times when he's cool and collected: slipping Ron fake Felix Felicis to pump him up for the game. Putting the pieces together at Shell Cottage in DH and deciding to go after the Horcruxes. Standing up to Rufus Scrimgeour. The last duel with Voldemort where he's explaining how he's already won.

Anyway, personal preference, yeah.

With respect to my fic, it's kind of a moot point, anyway. Even if I did agree that Harry (and Cho, and Cedric, and Fleur, and all my characters I suppose) are written too mature, it's not like I could suddenly change course and have them start talking like "normal" kids. It would require a systemic edit, and I'm not even sure how I'd go about it. Parse every line of dialogue and add a bunch of "likes" and "ums"? Take out all the parts where Harry is emotionally mature enough to think in shades of grey? Take away all the lessons he learned from his AU upbringing and make him more emotionally impulsive?

I'm not trying to be hyperbolic, I'm honestly asking. If I did want to write the characters in my story with more realistic (or canonical) levels of "kid-ness", how exactly would I go about that?

So do I. But the reason I like him at those times is because that is not the way he normally acts. If Harry made himself out to be one the "Cool Kids" and generally acted like he does in the ever-popular indy-Harry fics, I probably wouldn't have cared much about those moments either.

Hmmm, I don't like what you're doing here. You basically smooth out any imperfections Harry had in canon and give his alternate upbringing as an excuse. I do agree that it would make Harry a bit more outgoing and confident, but being raised by Sirius and the ever-passive Remus should come with complications of its own. Sirius is hardly the paragon of virtue ...........\\
 

(/"I was watching him, his nose was touching the parchment. There'll be great grease marks all over it, they won't be able to read a word.”/)

( /“What're you going to do, Snivelly, wipe your nose on us?”/)

 \\
.......and doesn't really strike me as an ideal parent ideal, regardless of how much he matured from his teenage self.\\
 

Regardless of what Harry's alternate upbringing would entail, with no insecurities or internal conflict or guilt or any real challenge (yet) for that matter, your Harry doesn't make a very compelling protagonist. What made Harry's first year compelling was that Harry was experiencing a good life for the first time, and with all his insecurities, every class and indeed, every conversation held some sort of challenge, and Draco made for a worthy antagonist in those early stages.

 \\
Now, it would be pointless for you to have attempted to rehash the same story JKR was writing, but I do think that other stories -- /Boy Who Lived/, /The Last Avatar/, PotDK -- managed Harry's school life better than you did. Your story has other points where you have them beat (your descriptions of magic, for one) but not in this.\\
 

Your Harry lacks a Draco Malfoy. Perhaps you didn't intend to focus much on schoolyard rivalries, but when you /do/ end up writing so much about Harry's school life, you should have included more challenges. Perhaps some upper class men, like in Santi's fic? Zacharias Smith doesn't really count. I would also point out that many of my problems with Harry's characterization extend to Cedric and Cho as well, and that your insistence in making them strong, intelligent characters makes them less exciting than Ron and Hermione, or Viktor and Calypso, for that matter.\\
 

I would add that all of the above is purely personal opinion and what I dislike in the story. I would hate for you to take any of the criticism personally.\\

#+end_quote

The "kid-ness" ship has long sailed and really, is a nitpick more than anything else. I would prefer it, however, if you do find some real challenges for Harry, because right now, his character seems to be he loafing about, waiting for Voldemort to return and for him to finally get to do /something/.\\
 

I think it would be good idea to add to the hints of arrogance and general disregard for his housemates, to make it a substantial character flaw and for it to come bite him in the ass and force him to change. This whole "maturation" can make for a pretty compelling story. Hmmm, have you read /The Phoenix and the Serpent/? Harry's journey, and his interactions and conflict with Dahlia in particular, make for some excellent character growth. /Hogwarts Battle School/ too, where Harry realizes that ordering his housemates around did not make him a successful leader. Teddy Lupin, when he goes too far with his showy protests in /Hogwarts Houses Divided/ and pays the price the time he's attacked. So yeah, flaws, insecurities, conflict, maturation. All that stuff.\\
 

Alternatively, you can just make Voldemort return soon. That works as well as anything. A bit of desperation and challenge is just what your story needs.

******** Good thoughts. Don't worry, I have thick skin - I've written a couple original fiction novels, and I've long since learned to be able to talk about the strengths and weaknesses of my writing without getting all defensive or taking it personally.

I do think you're right about the fic needing more opposition, more things to challenge Harry and his friends. This will ramp up in the next few chapters.

** I'm a parent of a thirteen year old and a sometimes-author (though I've not written any child-Harry stories since my son was older).

It's a challenge to write children of that age. Even classrooms of similarly aged children are highly diverse inhow they act and perceive the world as they navigate puberty. There's no single tween/early-teen mindset. Even a given child can be expected to change so much from day to day that unless you took role it'd be hard to identify him or her as the same person.
