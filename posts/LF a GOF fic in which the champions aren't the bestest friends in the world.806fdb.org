** I am writing that kind of fic (although I haven't gotten to the tournament part yet). The premise is that Sirius asked Andromeda to take care of Harry after Pettigrew was kissed and therefore couldn't clear Sirius' name. I guarantee no "new best friend Neville", no "champions are best friends" and no "graveyard scene". Instead, there will be a different path to solve the tasks since Harry now has competent adults behind him, a manipulative Dumbledore who is neither moron nor Dark Lord in disguise (so basically his canon self), Harry dumping Divination and taking Muggle Studies (as opposed to Runes) and as little canon rehash as possible.

  Unable to clear his name, Sirius asked his cousin Andromeda to take care of Harry. This turns out to be the best decision Sirius ever made. Eventual Harry/Lisa Turpin.

** I'm outlining something like this, but I've never written anything longer than a few hundred words before and I want to put it and edit it like a real book. So it could be months before it's posted. And I doubt very much diggory will be involved. Krum might be an unnecessary character since I'm not sure I'll do the World Cup. If I kept Fleur it would only be out of convenience.

Also it's a year 4-7 AU so I need to set up a completely different method of immortality, different betrayals, completely divergent plot lines, etc.

** During the tournament in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434/1/Unspeakable-Things][Unspeakable Things]] the champions are trying to kill each other, if that's enough conflict for you.
