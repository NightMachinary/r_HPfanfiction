The golden trio are rogues of the first degree. Almost every notable thing they do in the books is illegal, against school rules, or both at the same time. This is good. I like this. One of my favorite archetypes is the lovable/dashing rogue, a ne'er-do-well with a cheeky smile and a heart of gold. If any of y'all can throw a few fics in which the main character is like that my way I'd appreciate the hell out of it. I tend towards long fics, and strong combat scenes are great, but Id appreciate really anything that fits the above. Thanks in advance, cheers


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief by Starfox5): Harry's a ladies man, and Hermione's a swashbuckling woman of mystery.

Actually, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis by Starfox5) has a pretty swashbuckling trio.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) - Long✅, excellent combat✅, James Bond!Harry✅. Probably the best example of what you're asking for.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) - Raunchy humour that not everyone likes, but it's got plenty of sauve, smooth-talking Harry and Sirius.

linkffn(Gryffindors Never Die) - A bit weak in the later chapters, but there's a lot of cool!Harry and Ron.

linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) - Not much emphasis on it, but Harry is cheeky as fuck in this one.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1978, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter.

** This seems to tick your boxes. Cedric Diggory's the MC. He is definitely a dashing ne'er-do-well. He's very good at portraying a false-front of being decent, noble and honourable. Which he is absolutely not. A fun retelling of the Triwizard Tournament from his PoV - which he survives by being not very noble or honourable.
