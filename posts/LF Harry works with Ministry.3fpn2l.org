Basically, something where Harry has to play politics (not just insta-win because inheritances, or where Goblins or Amelia Bones or Merlin shows up and wins politics for him). Preferably focusing more on the government side, less on the pure-blood shenanigans, though I recognize that is kind of part and parcel given what we know of Wizarding culture.

For whatever its worth, I liked Dirty Harry and Junior Inquisitor. Things where Harry finds a unique niche in that government structure based on his skills and abilities, or where the divergence from canon is at least moderately interesting and well thought through. Or both. Or something else all together!

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

  Harry was sent off to live in a muggle orphanage, after Voldemort failed to kill him and his twin, Jaina Potter. Now, as a first year at Hogwarts, he has only one goal, one dream. To do what no one has before: Rule the World. Harry/Harem, some stolen characters, influences from other Fics, Darkish/Evilish!Harry, mostly later. Hogwarts begins at age thirteen, silly with plot, edited
