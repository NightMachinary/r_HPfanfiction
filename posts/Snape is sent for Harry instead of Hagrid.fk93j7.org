I'm looking for good, finished preferably, fics about if Snape fetches Harry from the Dursleys instead of Hagrid. Ones where he realises how they treat him/ takes him. I'm pretty sure I've read one before in the same vein, I'd just like more. Tia x

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** +The King's Indian Attack comes to mind first. It's excellent. linkao3(6975322)+ Wait no, Snape retreives /Hermione/ and Sinistra 'bumps into' Harry before Hagrid gets there.

To Shape and Change is second, but I'm also a time travel junkie. Snape goes back in time and tries to fix things. I believe that most of it is narrated by Harry, but I might be remembering it incorrectly. linkffn(6413108)

I'm positive that I've read more, and I'll reply to this if I think of another, but I'm drawing a blank atm :(

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.

** This only somewhat applies to what you were looking for, but Snape does go to Privet Drive to retrieve Harry and quickly realizes that the way Harry gets treated isn't how a normal muggle child gets treated. It's well-written and complete (one-shot).
