If one of the main characters (MC1) in my fanfic has a sort-of chemistry with a secondary character, but it doesn't get serious, should I tag them as a pairing?

MC1 has no pairing otherwise and you can call it a dalliance of sorts, but they don't end up together.

In the same way, MC2 has a dalliance with one person, but they "break up" and soon MC2 is pining for another character with whom it will be a pre-relationship. Should I tag them individually as well?

I fear people will mistake it to be a harem fic with too many relationship tags, which it's not. Romance is secondary in the fic, so I wonder if it should be necessary at all.

Clearly, I'm inexperienced with this tagging business.


** If you want to lure shippers, tag who your mc is eventually going to end up with.

If you want to write a good story without succumbing to ffnet fan service then don't tag pairings at all.

**** Keep in mind that you might get some bad reviews once those of a brainless variety discover that the pairing isn't what they want it to be. Shippers can be pretty obnoxious.

Lots of authors seem to be afraid of such reviews tho, so they do their best to drive off the haters by pretty much telling how the story is going to go right of the bat and thus removing any suspense or mystery from their story.

***** I think even my readers will agree with the way I'm taking the story. There's no slash and the romance is very light and natural, so it won't bother anyone.

I have a small base of very like-minded readers. They haven't had any qualms so far. Still, I can't change the story now no matter what anyone says.

** From what you say it doesn't sound like you should tag either relationship. 90% of the time, people searching pairings want to see what stories contain who they wish to see together at the end. Of you tag any other way it will just feel like a lure, after which you fridge the relationship. And that doesn't help anyone, so it's best just to let the tags reflect that.

** I only tag pairings if they stay together at the end. And I only tag relationships between major/POV characters. Less is more with tags.

** I wouldn't tag until there's a clear relationship honestly
