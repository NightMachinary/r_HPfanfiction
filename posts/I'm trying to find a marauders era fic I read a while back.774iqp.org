all i remember about it is that sirius was expecting to go into slytherin and was initially disappointed by his placement in gryffindor, and that one year they had this ex auror with no legs and a flying carpet for a wheelchair who singled out remus and snape as potential aurors. sorry about how vague this is, ive just been racking my mind over the last couple of days trying to remember the name of it.
