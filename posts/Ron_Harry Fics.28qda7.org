Looking for Ron/Harry slash with plot.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4186278/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Soul-Gems][Harry Potter and the Soul Gems]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4507997/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-City-of-Tents][Harry Potter and the City of Tents]]. It's not strong on the slash, and the Harry/Ron doesn't happen until the second story, but maybe the mpreg makes up for it? However, the author, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/578324/shedoc][shedoc]] appears to have more slash, some which appears to be Harry/Ron.

Never thought I'd be suggesting slash stories ... I just happened to have read the above in the last week ...

*** Wait there's Mpreg? Ughhh. That is one of those things that squicks me.

**** Meh. Not my thing either, but then again, neither is slash. But, it really does seem that if you want to read slash in a world of magic, mpreg seems appropriate.

I must admit, I remember reading ages ago a Harry/Luna with mpreg. They delivered at a muggle hospital, and then Luna uses the Jedi mind trick to confuse the doctor. Does this ring a bell with anyone? I wouldn't mind re-reading that story - or at least that part.

** I thought [[http://hpfandom.net/eff/viewstory.php?sid=25827][this one]] was very cute. I'm usually a little weirded out by Ron/Harry stories, but really enjoyed this one.
