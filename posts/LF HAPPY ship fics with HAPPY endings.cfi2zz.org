God has never before been so cruel to me. I'll explain briefly. I recently underwent a bad breakup, and lingering too long on negative emotions tends to make me spiral. I've been coping by reading tooth-rottingly sweet fanfics but 4 out of 5 of them have either included some forced infidelity subplot or ended on a sour note that sets up some sequel that I don't want to read cause it's mired in politics or otherwise dredges up horrible feelings in me.

Let me be clear. I'm not adverse to conflict in a story, be it greater than or within the primary relationship. But I would very much appreciate your sweet and happy ship fic recs so I can cope in peace.

Harry centric please. No smut - although sex can be included so long as it's not the fics purpose. No slash. Thank you.


** I typically don't self promote but bad breakups suck. If you haven't already read it and can stomach Harry/Daphne stories I would recommend mine. My story pretty much ticks every box of what what you are looking for and avoids the stuff you mentioned hating.

Hang in there!

*** Can't believe you are in Reddit. Your story is nice.

How are you doing with your side stories? How many chapters do you plan to publish or you have no set number and you are going to write as the ideas come?

Btw, write more Harry/Daphne stories please. Perhaps one when they know each other since first year and become friends/acquaintances?

**** Thank you! Never say never but I don't think I will be writing another Harry/Daphne story. It is ridiculously corny but that story is my Harry and Daphne and I don't think I could write them well in a different/unique way.

*** Harry/Daphne happens to be exactly what I am in the mood for. It's a favorite. I've written a couple myself. Short little things. Thank you very much.

*** I just finished reading your fic a day ago. Pretty great story. Are you planning on making any more? Besides the after-story oneshots (which are also pretty great, can't wait for the next update!)

**** Thanks! I have an idea percolating on a Susan Bones/Harry story so we'll see. I've got a couple more chapters of the 'after-story' to do and then I will see if there is enough to merit a story.

I legitimately cannot comprehend how some authors write multiple stories at once. It breaks my brain a bit to even think about trying that.

***** Great! Susan is one of my favorite pairings. I hope that story comes to fruition!

And i agree, it's ridiculous how some authors are updating multiple stories. Fingers should start falling off soon haha. Sadly, it often leads to a burnout and unfinished stories.

*** A truly unique approach to Harry/Daphne I enjoyed this fic a lot. I Also liked the magical theory behind the main plot development.

Wonderful fic. Thanks mate

  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

  If pressed, later, she'd say it was exhaustion that caused her to forget who she was talking to, and it was that same exhaustion which prevented her from foreseeing the inevitable fall-out of telling James Potter, "Ugh, no thanks, I hate flying." / Lily/James, seventh year.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.
