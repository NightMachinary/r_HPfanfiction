Because I'm fed up with stories where Hermione resigns to the fact that a pointy faced ex-Death Eater has become her fellow Head despite all of the atrocities he committed.


** Any fic in which Draco is an ex-Death Eater and somehow becomes headboy is going to end up as a shitty Dramione.

** Draco: "I'm a thug who actively joined the magic Nazis and conducted assassination attempts in a school. Beyond that, I organized multiple bullying campaigns."

Hogwarts: "This is a perfect person to be a moral role model for our students."

******** Other than the fact that it could've stopped a Dark Lord from rising in the first place? He was suspicious of Tom Riddle from the moment they met. He knew it was Tom who opened the Chamber of Secrets and did nothing.

********* I'm saying that they couldn't have stopped Tom Riddle from becoming a prefect and head boy if Dumbledore didn't tell anyone his suspicions. I don't see how ways Dumbledore could have prevented Voldemort from rising is relevant to the reasons behind Tom Riddle becoming a prefect.

**** Snape was a spy though, it was probably Dumbledore's way of making sure he didn't stray back to the 'dark side' and to keep an eye on him. Remember that Dumbledore always thought that Voldemort would return. He couldn't risk losing his spy.

******* I may have phrased that poorly.

From the professor's persepctive, Daphne's assholeish Ice Queen exterior is all they know of her which would be a negative mark against her while picking Head Boy/Girl

** I've seen one or two where Hermione rejects being Prefect because of Malfoy, but I very rarely read a fanfic(I tend to read a lot of fanfics covering the same time frame as the books, not a lot coming after the Battle of Hogwarts) that actually goes far enough into the Hogwarts years to actually see Hermione even have the opportunity to be made Head Girl, let alone Malfoy.

*** I think it's the same reason people periodically ask for recs like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ar3sc1/subversion_of_dumbledore_bashing/][this]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/h9lqmc/any_indyharry_fics_where_hes_completely_wrong_in/][this]]. OP probably doesn't care for them but keeps seeing them whilst browsing and wants to ease their frustration by reading a fic in which the trope is bashed.
