** This happens frequently in dimensional traveling fics, such as:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052): Harry died, everything seemed to be lost, until "the Fucker" showed up to derail Voldemort's plans in that dimension. So the low intensity war dragged on until the other Harry and Sirius showed up.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): No Voldemort, No Harry, Tom Riddle was a good guy here and occupying an important position.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): this story is finally near completion after 12 years!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World as We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): No prophecy, local Harry was quite a non-achiever and fighting with Ron over Cho. Hermione was nowhere to be found, and Voldemort was very close in a complete takeover until canon Harry showed up.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

** This sounds so interesting! :) You could even make it like the Matrix, like write Dumbledore and the Order as thinking they had misunderstood the Prophecy and had the wrong Chosen One, and that was why Harry just died as a baby like that, so Dumbledore searches for the /real/ hero of the Prophecy and finds them years later, and that real hero could be an actual character or an original one and they fight Voldemort and overthrow his reign finally!
