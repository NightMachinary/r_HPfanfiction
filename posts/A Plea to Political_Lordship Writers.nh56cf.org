Hello!

I know that political/Lordship AUs are a divisive thing in the fandom and I'm not here to weigh in on that debate. Please don't comment if you're just going to say the entire genre is trash.

With that being said, I would love to see some more originality in characters/worldbuilding. While I do like and want unique takes on things like "Harry is Lord of X,Y, Z and Zimbabwe" or "Harry gets a harem", I mean in the OCs of the world, the hierarchy that you're establishing by default in the AU and in politics.

Even in these elaborate codified fics that differentiate between every Most, Ancient, and Noble differentiation of all of these houses and go full-Victorian in values and setting, we rarely see the complexity of this. There will likely be bastard children who can't inherit, children who are the third daughter of the second son, probably some sort of entourage/retainers, families who are proudly mixed and ancient (more than the Potters), and families that don't have any kids anywhere near Hogwarts age.

My general point is that this subgenre has the option to be written much more compellingly than the standard "Harry becomes aware of the Lordship aspect of society and now he's mingling with the heirs in school and all the power-players of pureblood society". Give me a half-blood bastard Daphne who wants to become Lady Potter to have stability when her step-mother gets her kicked out, give me trading favors at Hogwarts for introductions to older siblings and cousins, give me 'The Blacks of Manchester' that are a semi-exiled but moderate branch of the family with its own drama, give me a Lord that Harry NEEDS the support of that's AWOL in Uganda, give me a Robber Baron family as an ancient magical dynasty that decided to make a name for itself and live in the Muggle world and now only interacts with wizards irregularly but are richer than the Malfoys, or give me families on the verge of collapse that become desperate.

There's so much variety and nuance is my point! We don't need every third child at Hogwarts to be an heir for the society to be compelling. It also adds a way for Harry to really expand out and make new friends if there are only a small minority of students who participate. This also avoids the repetitive courtesies of "my lord" etc every paragraph if it's only a small and formal thing.

Also, as an aside, please NEVER NEVER NEVER use the 'Sacred Twenty-Eight' as a political tool. It was a biased book written in the early 20th century. It most definitely is not a comprehensive guide to how the Wizegamot should be set up.


** I just wish they didn't destroy Harry's character most of the time. The entire time he's shown in canon, he resents being known as the Boy Who Lived as he didn't do anything, but now all of a sudden he's ok using his name to get his way?

*** TBF, Harry would have a lot more pride in the Potter or Black name than in the BWL moniker. Though he does never really seek out info on his parents and family that we see, so who knows?

I do think participating as Lord Potter is much more in line with canon!Harry's character than participating as a celeb BWL whose endorsing things on that.

**** I do agree to an extent. With the love and respect he has for Sirius and his parents, I think he would be proud to represent them. I just don't think he would try to flaunt that status for personal gain.

***** Do you consider personal gain to be steps taken towards "freedom''?

Genuine curiosity- I agree that Harry wouldn't abuse a position for greed but I could see him using it to secure something better for himself. I think that's human nature to a degree. Like a "if you become Lord Potter, it'll suck but you don't have to live with the Dursleys". I think Harry jumps all over that

****** No, I'm ok with that, though a bit tired of seeing it. The mandatory chapter where he goes to Gringotts is about as stale as the mandatory clothes shopping one for me now, haha.

But stuff like using that name to get Malfoy and his cronies to leave him alone, which is frankly just more boring compared to his normal sass. That and getting professors in trouble, usually Snape as well as Dumbledore. I guess most of this is just a side effect of character bashing since those are some of the more common ones.

I really like the idea of your main post though. Have people stab him in the back or use him in this situation. Sucks, but it's more believable to me than him becoming a mega Chad who knows everything about it just from banging Daphne.

*** Well, he actually doesn't. He's kinda ... indifferent. Perhaps a bit resigned. But not resenting. In any case, he doesn't make a big deal out of it, which is fairly typical, I guess. Harry's laconical reactions to presumably extraordinary events are one of his core traits. Of course, this also does mean he's not seeking to exploit it. That much is pretty obvious -- and it's also one reason why he never was Slytherin material.

But the more relevant question is; in a world with AUs that literally have Harry as Voldemort's son and commiting genocide, /this/ is what destroys his character? :P

**** Well more that he wants to make a name for himself based on what he can do, not something that happened because of his mother, which to me is in the same vein as not pulling the "I am Lord of House Black-Potter-Stark and therefore..."

Most of what I've been reading lately is mainly canon compliant until the events of the story, so not expecting too much variation on characters. That sounds like an interesting one, though I'd say it ruins Voldemort's character more than Harry's haha

** What I basically don't like with the lordship fics is basically that the nobles forgives Harry actions before he is aware of his status. I would like more fanfics where Harry lack of knowledge and actions have consequences with his standing like House Potter losing alliances, losing power or even losing its seat upon the Wizengamot. Simply House Potter being driven to the ground because of its heir being basically a disaster because of being raised by the muggles.

Why it is only Dumbledore that enjoy the power to manipulate a vulnerable House Potter ?

** Definetly needs to actually have something like pepole trying to use him as house Potter is vulnerable and have his actions or inactions actually have consequenses.

Eg loosing allies, money or his family voting rights
