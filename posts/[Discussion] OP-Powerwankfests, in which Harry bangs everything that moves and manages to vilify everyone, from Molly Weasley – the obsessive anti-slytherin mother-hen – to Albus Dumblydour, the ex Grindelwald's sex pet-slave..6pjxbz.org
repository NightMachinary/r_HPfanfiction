Why do people love reading them?

How do people write them?

The teenager excuse, although probably applicable shouldn't be used.

In many fandoms (this is definitely not HP exclusive), people manage to force such irregularities that demand the reader to suspend his or her disbelief to untold proportions. In my short time in the HP fandom, I've found such stories; ranging from incomprehensible harems, to badly written random lemons, above the canyons of extreme bashing, and large stretches of 'don't like; don't read' summaries and phoenix animagus forms, etc.

Ah, but I'm only partly here to rant; this post is more of a request for advice for me and hopefully others. I find writing a HP fic challenging (coming from Naruto fics), canon is but a far away memory for me, and rereading the books is not something I'd enjoy...

What's the best way to get into writing a story? What's there to avoid and usual newbie pitfalls to beware? Furthermore, if you are a writer, is there any advice you'd like to share? Or as a reader, by what standards do you choose stories to read and what turns you off the most?

Cheers!


** While many of the issues can be attributed to angst many of the things you find incomprehensible can also be attributed to a lack of command over the language.

Not every fic is written by a native English speaker. With many of those you don't even notice that they aren't written by one (linkffn(Stages of Hope)), but with others you notice it pretty fast.

Also most authors of fanfiction are amateurs. Writing is a skill that takes practice - a skill amateurs are less likely to have. And even with some practice you often find errors only after going through the document 4-5 times. This process isn't enjoyable as it is very technical compared to the creative flow of writing forward.

This also leads to many plotholes, becauese ideas always sound better in your head than on paper.

So a lot of what you said can be attributed to "lack of investment into the editing process" - the tedious and boring part of writing - yet one of the most important ones.

**** Curious (not trying to be rude), could you list some fics that you'd consider better written than SoH? I still view it as superb, even after having been reading FF heavily for a couple years now (though it's hard to say if that's the writing or just when I was introduced to it), so I'd be interested to see if it's just a taste difference or if there's something I'm not seeing about the fic.

***** Well, if you want prose that evokes powerful imagery and is poetic, check out Charity, Thou Art A Lie, linkao3(9496913). If the idea of the fic itself squicks you out or doesn't sound interesting, just read the last chapter and skip the rest. It's a great example of the writer's prose without including any of the parts of the fic that would bother people. To be completely upfront, it's a fem!Harry / Voldemort pairing and there is some non-con in the 2nd work of the series.

If you want something that is emotionally evocative, I would check out Session Transcripts, linkao3(270848), while I personally related a lot of Hermes, I think anyone with an ounce of empathy would care for Harry in this story. I read it in one sitting and cried more than once.

For a one-shot, check out The Girl Who Lived (Again) linkao3(7900501), it features a trans!Harry and gives a powerful view into the life of a transgender person. When she asked Sirius how her parents would see her I sobbed.

If it isn't clear from my recommendations, yes I'm trans lol, but these stories are good examples of writing skill regardless.

If you want something (almost) canon-compliant, try a life of smoke and silvered glass linkao3(11457669), the only big difference is that Snape apologizes to Lily later and this affects his opinion of Harry, even if it doesn't affect his actions. It's basically a retelling of canon from the perspective of a Snape who doesn't hate Harry for his father and instead loves him for his mother. I think this fic in particular is noteworthy because if I remember correctly the author was not a big fan of Snape before writing this, so it's an interesting spin on a redeemable Snape.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

  "I'm sorry," he said again."Sorry's not enough, Sev. Be fucking better." Lily shut the door in his face. He spent the summer reading in the library, the park, and then sneaking home when he was hopeful his parents would be asleep. He tried to think about bravery, but sometimes he just thought about Lily's hair, the way it went more golden in summer. He tried to think about nobility, ethics and grace, but the clouds chased each other, fat and white, across the sky and he wasn't sure what any of this had to do with him.His father took him fishing by a dreary brown creek and they sat in silence. Severus could hear every creak, every lap of the water, every inhale and movement his father made. He thought maybe if he just said nothing, nothing ever, he'd never say anything again that made Lily's face go so flat and distant. If he said nothing, maybe nothing would hurt.His father reached for a beer can in a swift movement and Severus froze himself unflinching. He sat in that silence afterward, slowing his heartbeat, picking apart the sudden rigid shell of his shoulders. His father hummed, cracking the can open like a gunshot.(slight AU in which Sev is better at life)

****** In this case, it may very well be taste. I've read most of what you listed (only one I haven't is ffnbot!slim(The Prisoner's Cipher) and ffnbot!slim(What Lies Beneath) - and maybe ffnbot!slim(The Accidental Horcrux)? They sound familiar but I don't remember reading them) and I wouldn't rate any of them higher than SoH, at least for me.

Reasoning: Firstly, for SoH, I don't mind the angst. As I remember it, the second half of canon (book 4.5ish onwards) is pretty damn angsty and having read it as a teenager, I identified with that. So even while my angst tolerance is a lot lower nowadays, it feels in line with canon. Don't remember there being that much telling, so I'll need to go back and reexamine that, as I feel sensitive to that issue nowadays.

For the others:

-I found ffnbot!slim(Circular Reasoning) interesting, but read it way back (2ish years ago) and have never felt compelled to read it again. I felt like the story was going nowhere and Harry wasn't really changing as a result of being sent back. While that might be a realistic portrayal of what happens to someone like him getting a second chance, it wasn't interesting to read.

-It's been a while since I read ffnbot!slim(A Study in Magic), so I'll go back and read it again soon, but it doesn't stand out in my memory especially. I think I had trouble connecting to the characters? Will edit once I can provide more info.

-ffnbot!slim(Applied Cultural Anthropology) is awesome, no dispute there, but it didn't hit me in the feels like SoH. I read it much, much later though, so maybe I hit a saturation point on favorite fanfics?

-ffnbot!slim(Back Again, Harry?) is probably the most readable TT story I can think of (besides ffnbot!slim(The Unforgiving Minute), but it's a one-shot and different from most TT due to the time constraint) and I very much enjoy it, but I don't remember loving it in the same way as I do some other fics, SoH included.

TL;DR: Ya, it's probably just taste. I think* that once a work hits a certain level of technical quality (not breaking basic writing rules), whether it's well-written gets a lot harder to define, because the format of the writing starts to blend with the content and depending on how you like the content, that may affect your analysis of the writing.

*As someone without an English or writing degree. I'm sure if I had more exposure to the rules of writing, there's more classification on the technical side.

Double Edit: Forgot to mention ffnbot!slim(What You Leave Behind), which is in fact stupendous, and perhaps higher than SoH in my rankings.

I also had NOT read A Study in Magic, and stuck with it for a while, but I gave up when it got to fourth year and the author was stealing dialogue and description straight from the books AND putting it into OC's mouths instead. I can handle some canon rehashing, but that was egregious.

********** Apologies for the delay, haven't been reading much lately. I just finished linkffn(Time To Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is) which I thought was just okay. Probably won't read it again. I like to try recently updated fics, so I gave linkffn(The Bond of the Orphans) a try: first few chapters seemed alright, but then it got really OC heavy and I found it very tiresome. Would not recommend.

I would recommend linkffn(The Phoenix and The Serpent) though; this isn't a fic I see rec'd very often, probably because it's real old. It's very AU because it was started before OotP was released, but it's very well done. It introduces an OC antagonist who's got a rivalry with Moody, with an excellent battle between the two. It also manages to have a "Power He Knows Not" that is diametrically opposed to Voldemort's abilities and believable for Harry to learn in the time frame. This is probably even with What You Leave Behind for how much I want an update, but the author hasn't been active for years, while I know Newcomb still shows up on this subreddit at least sometimes.

They can honestly be fun, in the right mindset. You know its trash, I know its trash, everyone knows its trash. But so is Transformers and people still watched the shit outta that. Sometimes you just want trash.

People cross continents for sweet sweet internet points, may that be reviews or upvotes.

#+begin_quote
  any advice you'd like to share?
#+end_quote

- Harry Potter isn't an Anime or Manga. No Magical Cores or other such powerlevel nonsense.

- General writing advice: Plot out your story before you begin writing it. Its should be finished in your head before you can finish it as a document.

- Be wary of fanon, but not afraid to use it should you feel like it fills a legitimate hole in canon.

- If choosing fanon or canon doesn't make a great significant difference, use canon in order to save yourself the time and lines to explain the fanon.

- Also: Canon needs no long (,or any) explanation. We all read the books.

*** I failed to plot the story before writing with a story I started. After 40k words, I found the plot was too complex and not going anywhere. I discontinued it for that reason.

A seconday advice, make a summary of the plot and look for anything that can be cut away without removing anything significant. A second tip, repeat yourself but don't repeat yourself in the same way. Refer back to previous events and foreshadow future events.

** What turns me off the most is when people whitewash Death Eaters and obvious evil aspects of Wizarding Britain. Reading drivel that's effectively "the KKK has a point" and "slavery is not evil if the slaves are not white" makes me sick.

With regards to canon, don't fall into the stupidity of worshipping it. Too many here are unable or unwilling to admit that canon is not perfect. JKR all too often treats her characters as plot devices, who act as the plot demands, not as their character would. Try to take the characters as they are described, and go from there - don't look at their actions in the books to form the characters, since those actions are often OOC.

*** Yeah, there is "viewing things from another side" (and using shades of grey instead of JKR's often unintentional black and white) and then there is wanky-devils-advocate. I enjoy stories where villains are shown as people instead of presented as cardboard cutout monsters (ie: Lucius Malfoy was a DE, but he also loved and cared for his son and wife very much), and I also enjoy stories where the heroes are not saints (ie: Hermione wiped her parents' memories without their permission and sent them away, removing their agency and potentially fucking up their minds permanently). I like complex characters and difficult choices.

** The problem is Anime. This is a trope commonly found in shit-tier anime that many people watch for wish-fulfillment which was in turn based off of a light novel that the writer wrote as wish-fulfillment. The only problem is, those shit-tier animes build their own world, in which the Power scale can be reasonably tipped, etc... for the main character to be both weak and powerful. In the Potterverse, Harry who has some kinda hidden OP Magus Golden God Power will have a hard time seeing a challenge in any enemy that doesn't equal him in terms of power. So, short of Yahweh himself, you gotta make Voldemort equally as powerful. But the authors don't like seeing Harry lose at all, so he is probably going to win any battles with minimal tactical use of Magic and minimal intelligence. Despite us all hearing, it banged into the back of our heads that HE IS Intelligent and OP Prodigy at Magic. We rarely see any fields of Magic in use other than Curses and Hexes and whatever Eldrich Abomination Field of Magic 'Dick Increasing Spells' and 'Avada Kedavra surviving shields" fall under.

I would be able to handle it all, but Harry doesn't even go into depths why someone is the 'love of his life' normally only being the girl that shows emotion and Harry saying something idiotic or useless.

*** I don't think the problem is power levels and magic cores, per se. Rather, as you mentioned, it's that authors seem incapable or unwilling (or both) to balance things out so as to still create realistic conflict and tension. Or to put it in simple terms, if you give Harry a lightsaber, you must give Voldemort the Death Star. If Harry has a magical core of 9000, Voldemort better be at least two orders of magnitude above (in the beginning).

For example, in spite of all of its other flaws (e.g. the author peddling his transhumanist philosophy at every turn), Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality did this very well: it made Harry a genius, but Dumbledore and Quirrelmort were no less intelligent, in fact outwitting him on several occasions.

Completely agreed on the problem of god-like Harry's relationships---it is never quite explained exactly what this newly-minted demigod sees in those mere mortal 2-D cutouts of girl characters. Then again, I think writing romance is much more difficult than basic action and adventure, so to expect them to get this part right is really to expect running before walking has been mastered.

**** Harry with a lightsaber (figratively or literally) is still outclassed by Voldemort. You'd still have to glue an idiot ball to Voldemort, as happened in canon, for Harry to win. You could boost Harry massively, and all you'd need to do to compensate is to make Voldemort act a bit less stupidly, and things would be even. People don't really seem to realise just how contrived the original plot was.
