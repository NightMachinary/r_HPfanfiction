Hi! I am very picky with my FanFics and I wanted to see if you could help me find some fics that meet my (highly) selective tastes.

I wanted to see if you could recommend a Fanfic that would meet these criteria (it can be a Fanfic based around an OC as the main character if it meets the majority of the criteria):

- Over 100k words preferably. I like long reads. If it's separated in multiple fics (like Second Chances), I like it even more.
- Rated M or T with violence, preferably with romance, smut is welcomed. I really like romance in my Fics, and sex doesn't not have to be very explicit. Bonus points if it's with an OC. Older women only if its kind of like in Summer of Change's Tonks relationship, don't want any smut/romance with a woman that is like 60.
- I don't mind if the romance is slow burn, I actually like it. Bonus points if its slow burn.
- Rated below M is acceptable if it becomes rated M when the story progresses in the series (kind of like the Second Changes series). It also would make sense since Harry was 12 in the early books, so there wouldn't be any rated M stuff early on.
- Probably the only slash I don't like is Pansy. It's something about her name that I don't like.
- Definitely no gay Harry (not homophobic, just that I'm not gay, so it breaks the immersiveness, and I love immersiveness in my Fanfics)
- Powerful/Talented Harry, also (doesn't have to, but it is gratifying) smart (kind of like Blindness Harry). I like when Harry is talented and by working he becomes a very powerful magician. I don't like stupid Harry, it is painful when he is written as stupid or just like a common man intellectually)
- No salty bash of Dumbledore or manipulative Dumbles (unless it's really well done, like in Second Chances, but this is the only fic where I have liked Dumbledore Bashing)
- No FemHarry (Unless it is really, really good)
- I really like when Fics bring in their own takes on magic (elemental, and any other branches of magic that are not explored that well in the books). I especially like it when Harry has a talent that no other magical being has (the power the Dark Lord doesn't have).
- Well written. I don't care that much for silly, small grammatical mistakes, but I do care when I cannot understand what the hell is going on in the Fic.

Edit: I also like romance with characters that are not so well know (AKA women that are not Ginny). I like a lot the pairings with Hermione, Fleur, and Daphne, as well as Tonks.

If you have any fics that do not meet some of the criteria but do so with the majority, feel free to suggest it!

Some FanFics that I like: Blindness, Second Chances series, Summer of Change, Honour Thy Blood, The Mind Arts, Eclipse of the Sky

My own fic. It is about a version of Harry whose natural curiosity is supported by Sirius, Remus and Dumbledore. H/Fleur. WIP.

Hope you like it. (And no, I feel no shame about promoting my own fic. It is fun.)

**** I plan to update within a week. I'm struggling with this chapter because it involves a lot of duels and I find making each unique difficult but I think I'm getting there.

And thank you for reading my story.

  I am not what you think and life isn't always sweet to me. But I know, I will always carry that single magical moment with me, even when I'm broken. [A love story of a broken prodigy and a beaten down flower.]
