You guys know of any good Blood Magic fics? I mean fics where Harry or some other character uses Blood Magic to empower themselves, either by carving runes into their bodies or sacrificing magical creatures (and maybe other wizards if you wanna go down the Dark Path) to gain their abilities and traits.

So like, imagine the MC uses some of Fawke's ash from one of his latest burning days to give himself the ability to teleport using fire like a Phoenix, or uses Dragon Blood to make his skin resistant to spell damage.


** For carving runes/blood magic, the best I've found is linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - it's quite long, /very/ well done, but also unfortunately unfinished - but it's hard for me to think of a better implementation of powerful, blood rune based magic.

  A young Harry Potter, abandoned on the streets, is taken in by a man with a mysterious motive. When his new muggle tattoo suddenly animates, he is soon learning forbidden magic and planning to infiltrate the wizarding world on behalf of the "ordinary" people. But nothing is ever that black and white. (Runes, Blood Magic, Parseltongue, Slytherin!Harry) (SEE NOTE 1st Chapter)

** Stars by the one I recommend the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex]] has the main character use Re'em blood to augment their body(ies). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort]] has blood magic used liberally. *

Cadmean Victory has nominal blood magic though it's more sacrificial magic with blood as an identifier. Honestly, in my opinion, overrated as well. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer]] has blood magic as well.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/]] has blood magic in an interesting way, though it's different from the examples you gave. *

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5866937/11/Control]] has blood magic as well (haven't read but it's been recommended for blood magic by others - looks like it's of dubious quality though).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/19/Wind-Shear][https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear]] has one spell that manipulates blood. Not the focus beyond the spell though the spell is quite important. *

Incidentally, those who are looking at this, if any of you remember a story where Harry placed drops of blood on his wand to increase the power of his spells (blood consumed as he cast), please link it.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.
