** I feel like this was posted after reading a bad Indy fic.

Magic can do some crazy stuff in canon. Conquer minds, break the laws of conservation and time travel.

Why not have a spell for fixing eyes?

*** Like I commented before, Polyjuice potion affects eyesight, so it's only a slight stretch to imagine that there might be spells or potions to fix one's eyes too.

*** If there was one, why would wizards wear glasses, given that Harry's not the only one who does? If you can answer that question, then I'm fine with it, but otherwise, that would bug me.

***** Not as far as I recall, and there's plenty that Harry doesn't know, but Dumbledore, McGonagall, Rita Skeeter and Percy Weasley (off the top of my head) also wear glasses, so if there's a spell, there should be some explanation as to why those people aren't using it.

****** First thought off the top of my head is that glasses are almost certainly easier to charm than eyes. Rather than restorative, bringing your vision to normal, they could be enhancements. See normally undetectable vapors, things like that. Would be handy for a talented witch or wizard to have on them. A quick tap and anything you need seeing or highlighting will be shown to you.

**** Maybe it's just not that big a deal to them. Honestly, I like my glasses, sometimes I walk under things that would've poked me in the eye had I not been wearing glasses. Like tree branches on a windy day. I don't like the fact that I can't see without them, but I'd probably wear sunglasses or something if I didn't need corrective lenses, so what does it really matter?

Maybe there is a fix but it's really expensive or time consuming to make. Heck wasn't polyjuice supposed to be expensive to make? I know it was time consuming, it took them a while to make it in the book.

** Well, polyjuice can affect one's eyesight, so it's not exactly a big stretch to imagine that a similar, more specific, effect might be achieved through magic

** I don't see why not. Three of the four types of eyesight problems are caused by the SHAPE of a certain part of the eye. The fourth type is stiffening issue. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to transfigure the eyeball or cornea into the proper shape.

- Nearsightedness (myopia) is caused by an elongated eyeball.
- Farsightedness (hyperopia) is caused by a shortened eyeball.
- Astigmatism is a mis-shaping of the cornea.
- The farsightedness that you get from aging (presbyopia) is caused by the lens of the eye losing elasticity. One spell should fix that. Granted, curing this AND one of the others would require two spells.

*** That's not how that works. Sure we have Lasik but that doesn't work on everyone. First you would need to figure out what is wrong with that specific persons eyes. It will be different for everyone, and it's not like they'll have a spell for every possible eye. Now you could make the case that they could just replace the eyes entirely akin to mad eye, but that's probably way too expensive when you could just wear contacts. Oh wait contacts don't work for everyone what the fuck eyes? If there was a surgery that could fix my eyesight don't you think I would take it at this point. I swear to God if one more person why don't you just get Lasik man after they hear an ad on the fucking radio I'm gonna lose my shit. What was I talking about?

** If you want some justification, it could be excruciatingly painful and you wouldn't be able to see for a while and only licensed practitioners would be allowed to use the spell along with it being expensive for the procedure.

** The shape of the eyeball has the most to do with many vision problems as it impacts how the eye focuses so i can see a spell that diagnosis the problems with the eye and then spells to correct it. For instance cataracts are simply the lens getting cloudy (eg turning yellow versus remaining clear) so I can see a spell to clear the lens.

I would agree that since it is so sensitive that it only be performed by experts and i can see it being quite painful.

I know plenty of people who prefer wearing glasses and refuse to wear contacts or have surgery even though they've been told that they are great candidates.

And I agree with other posters that it's much easier to charm glasses than to charm eyes.

As far as canon do we actually know if whether anyone besides harry are actually wearing prescriptive lenses versus clear glass as either a fashion statement or because they are charmed?

** O feel like this is a thing only a potion could do but it would have to je very experimental. The polijuive potion after all van change your appearance and therefor the size of your eyes and thus eyesight. I think you could probably experiment with that though a permanent change might not be possible

** Polyjuice potion can transform your whole body (including your eyeballs, temporarily fixing your eyesight) for an hour. It can also be brewed by an especially gifted second year student.

Obviously it wouldn't be canon, but we're not exactly bursting through the fourth wall, here.
