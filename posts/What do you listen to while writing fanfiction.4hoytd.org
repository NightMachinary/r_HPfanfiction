** Usually nothing, but I do need to be in a fairly quiet place with a little background noise. On a train or a coach, or when I'm at home with the tv on at a very low volume.

The exception is when I'm trying to write a very intense scene. When I was writing the battle scenes in my DH fic I listened to the extended courtyard apocalypse theme on repeat. If I'm trying to write and it's too noisy, I'll play Lily's Theme on repeat.

** Usually lots of Sabaton, Powerwolf, Amon Amarth, stuff like that. Makes it pretty easy to get inspiration for a story.

** I tend to just put my iTunes on Shuffle, so recently it's been a lot of showtunes and Lana del Rey, but if music with lyrics is too distracting I'll stick on some game soundtracks. FFX, Xenoblade and FXII are all great scores to have in the background whilst writing.

*** Video game soundtracks are good, I used to have a huge playlist that I used when writing. Don't use it anymore though.

** Music can get me in the mood to write, but once the writing starts the music has to be off (along with anything else). Even the smallest distraction can lead to no writing...

*** For me, music is how I escape distractions. I have noisy neighbours and a noisy family.

** When I get into really intense writing (I know exactly what I want to write and how) I need silence. I usually recite and type to keep me focus.

But usually any music that I've heard before. OSTs, nightcore, anything. If great inspiration strikes I'll mute, write, then unmute when the moment is over.

** Nothing with words, because that will distract me. Usually, I will find a playlist of videogame soundtracks. The music in videogames is designed to help you concentrate without being a distraction, and I find it works really well for me.

** Many different things depending on what I am writing. I was working on a sad story a few weeks ago and listened to Sound of Solence by Distirbed. My go-to is usually anything by 30 Seconds to Mars but Nightcore really has me hooked right now.

** I normally don't need to listen to anything specific, but I've found that for my writing in general, I tend to default to piano/classical music. It makes me actually feel somewhat productive haha. But I'm just as likely to put my music on shuffle and go from there - it really depends on what's going on - and due to the fact that I listen to just about anything, that playlist can get a little hectic.

As of late, I've been putting Mozart on when I'm reading a textbook/dabbling in writing/anything of that nature, and I'm sure this will hold true until I get fed up with the one piece I've kept on repeat haha.
