So, I've been going crazy trying to figure out these three stories, but I just can't!

1. Somehow Harry ends up in the past (a few years after the Dark Lord's defeat). He goes by the name Harry Houdini and creates a big company to help prep for later events. Remus is a big part of the story.

2. My details on this story are a bit more vague. Harry lives with the Dursleys, but somehow ends up transforming his room into something much better. He has some sort of password so that he can change it back to the way it was so no one will notice. For some reason, I was thinking this was written by Athey/Athy, but I've looked and I think I was wrong.

3. There was one story where James Potter gave so much money to the war effort that his father never game him access to the actual family vault. I don't remember much about this except that Dumbledore is upset when the Potter will finally gets read because he discovers that he really gets nothing from it since James didn't have access and he tries to convince Harry to give money for the war. Also, Harry attends the will reading even though he was supposed to be with the Dursleys. This story may also be the story in number 2.

*** It is! Thanks ! (I feel like an idiot since I could have searched for Harry & Remus, but I didn't think it was listed that way. I thought Harry was listed alone.

**** It can be really easy finding something on google if you know phrases from within the story itself. All i googled was Harry Potter "Harry Houdini" fanfiction.
