Exactly what I said in the title, are there any good, >50k word fics where Harry (or fem Harry) are raised by marvel characters? Except the vaguely MCU flavoured Avengers, Tony Stark, Or Loki, because that's done to death. Prefer gen or f/f but will read anything


** Would Aunt May, Natasha, Bruce count? Who are we not allowing to raise Harry? I certainly can cook up something if I have that criteria.

  An orphan and an outcast, living two lives that should never have intercepted. However what could happen if a nudge forces these worlds to collide? With a new name and a new father will the Boy-Who-Lived accept what Fate marked him for? A Bruce Banner/Harry Potter father/son relationship. Skip to Chapter 13 for the start of the Avengers.

I'm not really the arbiter of can and can not, wrt fanfics, but Indian!Harry and Black!Hermione are AOK in my opinion, and so are in-universe name changes.

Wrt ships, I'm a massive lesbian so anything outside of f/f holds no interest for me. That being said, a student being shipped with someone more than 2 years older than them is an instant “don't read”
