The reason why I don't want DE pairings is obvious, DE apologists, same as with Voldemort. Draco and Snape count as DE in my book btw (as they should). I dislike any of the twins as pairing because I don't even need to know the fic to get what's going to happen, same as with Cedric, whose an unlikeable character to me, in general. A Ron pairing would be great though.


** If you want to have fics who are only on AO3 and not mirrored on FFnet, I can recommend these:

linkao3(12746520) linkao3(17241749)

Breathe (Don't Falter) is an ongoing rewrite, but the original story is mirrored on FFnet so I didn't include it. If you decide that mirrored fics are ok, I might have a few more. :)

Then she finds herself a family in the leader of a small but prosperous country and his two children. When their peace is threatened, Harriet agrees to an arranged marriage with the head of the infamous Nara clan of Konoha. Or: Harriet becomes an actual magical princess.

*** The reason I didn't ask for mirrors, is mostly because I think i might've read most of the good ones already. But if you want to link it, be my guest, who knows, I might be pleasantly surprised.

And thanks for your suggestions.

**** You're welcome, of course.

linkao3(6275080) and linkao3(6552127) for the first iteration of Breathe (Don't Falter), the author is much less experienced at this point, but it's still quite captivating.

Also linkao3(20866319) and linkao3(13984629).

** i have no idea which of these has been crossposted, so i'll just yeet these in

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13795605?view_full_work=true][Victoria Potter by Taure]]

- easily my favorite, and has very good worldbuilding

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by The_Carnivorous_Muffin]]

-first in a /very/ long series

-very weird, also the tom riddle/femharry isn't /really/ a thing, so i recommend trying it anyways

and it's sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15685944?view_full_work=true][Minato Namikaze and the Destroyer of Worlds]] is also good stuff

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17241749?view_full_work=true][Breathe (Don't Falter) by silenceia]]

-i know it's already been recommended but this. fic. is. amazing.

*** Oh my gosh, I just read Victoria Potter on your recommendation. Loved it so so so much. The characterization of magic in it is honestly the best I've ever read. The author took JKR's ideas for how the magic of the universe should go and somehow managed to make them better--more polished. Still consistent, just better. I love the dialogue throughout--it's all so spot on. And I really like this Dumbledore. He's powerful, not perfect, but also not evil or stupid. Love him!
