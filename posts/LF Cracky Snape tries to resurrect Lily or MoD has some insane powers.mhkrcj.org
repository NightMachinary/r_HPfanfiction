Yeah this is directly inspired by a very recent post here, I'm the mood for some crack so let's focus it on either Snape trying to resurrect Lily or having the Deathly Hallows is believed to have insane powers if you become MoD. Doesn't have to actually have those powers however. Or both if a random fic manages it.


** While not what you asked for, your mention of a resurrection crackfic reminded me of linkffn(Bad Oracle). It has Delphini resurrect Lily, not because they felt she or anyone knowing her deserved it, but as a /distraction/ to Snape to avoid him interfering with their plans which I found rather amusing.

(There's no Snily in it beyond Delphini teasing Snape about it once or twice, in case that was a concern for checking it out)

  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them.
