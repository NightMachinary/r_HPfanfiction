I really want to find a story where the Weasley learn about Harry's life under the dursleys and are going out of their way to help him. Maybe adopt him, or confront the Dursleys,... If possible, no bashing in general. (I know it's easy to bash Dumbledore on that.)

EDIT : Also wow, sorry about the unnecessary "e" on Arthur on the title... oops.


** It gets a while to get there, and there are a bunch of Peggy Sue tropes besides it (most of them relatively mild, though), but this does become a significant plot point in /Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past/

Edit: Oops, I forgot the link

** There was Broken Beyond Healing by Lady Russell Holmes, which featured a badly abused, crippled Harry being adopted by the Weasleys. After a whole mountain range of abuse, it got fairly interesting, with Harry becoming a Diviner and developing other esoteric powers.

Unfortunately the author has removed it from their ffn page and I haven't been able to locate a copy.
