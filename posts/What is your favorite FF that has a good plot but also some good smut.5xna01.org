Looking for a good story to read that has some decent smut but not the main part of the story! Preferably a good length, no HarrySlash please. But Harry as a main character. Would love some recommendations from you guys!


** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]]. 386K, several x-rated scenes (Harry/Hermione), plenty of plot. Refreshing attitude toward teenage sex (kids have hormones! And, the best way to avoid being a virgin sacrifice is to not be a virgin). Little bit of Ron and Ginny bashing. Lots of ritual magic (skyclad, even), parselmagic, Lord Potter, political maneuvering. 6th year, but post-Voldemort. Very AU.

****** That extension is invaluable because it works on password-protected sites - like Livejournal, if you still get things from there. No other automated downloader I've seen works on passworded sites.

It maintains the formatting pretty well, too, and lets you do some editing before you save.
