I've read Behind Blue Eyes, Adele Polkiss and that other fic where Harry ends up having a child (he was obliviated and didn't know about the kid till he was married with Ginny and the kid went to Hogwarts) his old school teacher after fourth year.

Can be romance or not, but I want is actually companionship from an outsider. And I love fics with Muggles finding out about magic.

EDIT: Also read that one where he ends up with the girl from the coffee shop from movie 6.


** links to the ones youve read?

*** Fuck, I don't remember the name of the last one, its something about "10 minutes later" or something. The others you can just google and you'll find them. Oh, the one where Harry has a child with his teacher... I don't remember either, but I do remember it was written before book 5. I'll check and see if I find the fic on my files.

EDIT: Yeah, forget about being written before book 5. I'm dumb. Its called Replay by Barb LP.

  What if Harry had waited ten more minutes and said goodbye to the waitress in HP/HBP? Prequel, "What We Had," is now up on my page!

  In a rash act of self-sacrifice, Harry saves a dying Muggle by magically transfering the man's cancer to himself. Now, going through his fifth year with a terrible secret, he begins to realize just what he's given up. H/G, R/Hr. Warning: abuse
