I honestly feel frustrated when I have to redo a scene from Canon instead of doing an original twist. Is that just me or do other people feel this way?

*** Good ol' readthrough fics. I've only ever found one of these I liked, and it kept most of the actual recitation of canon well away from the screen, instead focusing on what 'we woke up trapped in a separate dimension with people we don't necessarily want to spend time with, with no way out, and all we have is a letter to read all seven of these goddamn books out loud for god knows why' does.

​

By the time they start on book three everyone is noticeably more snippy than they were, and they already weren't on very good terms (Harry, Sirius, Weasleys, Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape).

I'm going to try and find it, see if it still exists on ffn and refresh my memory.

**** There was one I found that actually had a plot- Umbridge found the books and is trying to use them to discredit Harry and Dumbledore by having people read them out loud in the Great Hall, while Harry and friends are trying to run damage control as some of their less than law abiding canon escapades are publicly brought to light while still getting the books read, as they vindicate everything Harry was saying about Voldemort being back. It was the only good one I ever found, because the focus was on the consequences of the readthrough, instead of the readthrough itself.

This specifically is rare, unless you mean "entirely away." In my experience, if writers even try to do this, they usually fall off the wagon and start quoting word for word by the end of Book 1. Or else they try to avoid the mods by refusing to include /any/ quotes (sometimes including page and paragraph numbers instead!), and then it's even more unreadable because you're completely lost.

**** It isn't, which is why I do hope that if or when my story gets to that point I've found a good reason to make more of year 1 diverge from canon. Seriously, the characters really don't have a whole lot of power over the plot at that stage, and it's hard to give any of the protagonists that control without making them come off as a mary-sue-edition.

I figure the real derails can start with the dragon if someone finds out about that little issue in advance, but I don't have much before that. The Troll scene can diverge a fair bit, but that doesn't impact the arc plot at all because nobody has enough info to figure out that quirrellmort did it until near the end of the year.

Edit: There is a notable divergence around christmastime courtesy of the Mirror of Erised, but the impact of that divergence doesn't really become clear until much later.

***** My solution is honestly to have that all going on in the background and show only the changes. Perhaps the odd snide reference to some canon scene going on elsewhere. Perhaps focus on things that logically must have happened, but weren't part of canon focus.

There's also the Problem of Sirius Black, and What To Do About Wormtail, and Looming Dobby, and Do We Do Something About Neville, and...

Loads, really. You can derail quite a lot of things. Just not the plot with the stone and so on.

****** All that stuff IS derailed... after the end of the first year. Except Neville, he's derailed into becoming part of the Golden Group when the crossover character drags him along as backup against the Troll and he contributes meaningfully to its defeat with some quick thinking.

Until that happens, I've mostly made do with showing canon events from the perspectives of characters other than Harry and expanding on some of the background a bit more.

**** Have you tried my fanfiction, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12550911/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dogfather][Harry Potter and the Dogfather]]? Harry lives with Sirius, so he doesn't have his mother's blood protection, which leaves a lot of room for canon divergence. Lily's sacrifice was mostly luck on Harry's part, but in this story he doesn't have that protection and it results in a more empowered Harry. The first few school chapters are similar, but things begin to become much more AU after Halloween, and the twist at the end is a pretty monumental game-changer.

** I don't mind if it starts off following fairly closely, if the premise is something small like a different house for a character, different gender etc. then big changes don't make much sense, particularly in the early parts where few characters have much control of the plot (very little could stop Voldemort possessing Quirrel and seeking the stone, for example).\\
I definitely want more divergence as the story goes on though, different students falling to the chamber if it still opens (and it may well, unless something happens to Lucius), and by third year we should have big differences, Sirius can still break out if noone's found out about all that yet, but the rest of the year certainly shouldn't be the same (e.g. no blowing up Marge, catching the knight bus, Buckbeak). 4th year certainly shouldn't be the same 3 tasks and the graveyard with a side of Ron ditching Harry while Hermione annoys elves with knitting. 5th+ really shouldn't be all that similar at all, none of the big plot points are based on characters who should be in the same position affter 4 years of change.

** The thing is, to make it interesting you absolutely have to change things, if not why bother, we could simply read the books. I don't mind read a long fanfic that follows the Canon BUT ! In my opinion to justify it and get me going, there must be one of those : - Add another dimension in the war (a form of magic, another horcrux, some kind of other aspect from the war that wasn't explored in the Canon) Or - The point of view of the characters change how we perceive the story line. It might stay the same but from the character experience, you discover other perspective, other understanding of the war/it's repercussions Or - a love story (a good, logical, well structured one) that evolve with the story line. So the events doesn't change or only slightly, but you see how the characters, with their relationship, will act and play in this was now that they have a lover

*** Years 1 and 4 are the offenders in that regard. Year 2 depends a lot more on what exactly which characters do (it's pretty easy to write a coincidence that gets the diary revealed early or put in someone else's hands, honestly Lucius that shouldn't have worked you idiot), Year 3 depends on an absolutely ludicrous-tier misunderstanding involving Sirius that could have been cleared up if certain people had done certain things even slightly differently (like bothered to explain what the hell was going on), Years 5 and up are usually sufficiently butterflied that it's easy to find an excuse to completely throw out the Stations of Canon or at least do them very, very differently. Year 1 has the Stone plot - changing the Troll isn't enough to derail Quirrellmort's plans, nor is changing the Dragon (though that can have different long-term impacts depending on what you end up doing). Changing the outcome of the unicorn rescue COULD be grounds for changing it, but more likely he'd just go back and try to find a different unicorn or something. Year 4 has the whole Triwizard Tournament, which is a whole nother kettle of fish.

**** Ginny got the diary for a reason. Lucius planted it with her because he was using her as a pawn to discredit Arthur Weasley. Think of Ursula in The Little Mermaid and how she used Ariel to get to King Triton. What would everyone think if Arthur, supposedly a champion of Muggle and Muggle-born rights, had a daughter who was killing the very people her father claimed to love? He'd be ruined!

** One scene is fine, it's when you literally get taken through all 7 books but with snarky comments from an OC insert, or a time travelled Harry that changes literally nothing.

It's like what was even the point in writing it.

** If there is a good reason for it (showing a point of divergence setting up a fic, or a canon compilant fic showcasing someone else's POV including canon scenes), I don't mind. Otherwise it's pointless and silly, and I skip them.

** I don't even really remember what IS canon anymore. I never read the books, never even saw all the movies. I've seen most of them, but not HBP or DH1.

I know vaguely what happens in canon, of course; but I've invested thousands of times the attention in fanon. So I don't really know what's a rehash of canon and what's a popular fanon trope.

You know how they say your mind can play tricks on you? When I think of the HP movies I picture the Lone Traveler, Core Threads, and The Arithmancer; and many more, as if I'd seen them play out in front of me. They're FanFiction. They were never made into movies, but I remember them as imagines, just from the sheer time I've been reading them. I even bought the whole HP collection on Xbox a while back, in thanks to JKR for the years of good content (even if little of it was actually hers). Still haven't watched those two, though. I feel no need for them. I just don't like the canon all that much. It feels unimaginative and vague to me.

**** Okay, Let me addendum.

I don't see what the big deal is with canon. Why is it important again? (Besides being a fine base with which to biuld apon)

***** Canon is important because the hundreds of thousands (800k just on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], probably more than 1 million in all) exist because people read canon and decided to write their own version of it.

It's also important because it gives a base to the reader, from where divergences appear to create a new story. For example, having a goog guy Voldemort is fine if it's the divergence. Having a full canon Voldemort (mass murderer, tried to kill harry in PS and all), leaving the cauldron and saying (yes I'm a Dark Lord and my Follower and just the magical equivalent of SS, but I was a goog guy all along) would make the reader crazy and should never be done (unless maybe in a crack fic).

****** That was a rhetorical question; and I know. I've read plenty of hell'a confusing fics, and I tend to drop them fairly quickly. And I did say “besides as a fine base with which to biuld apon”.

I knew most of canon at one point or another, but because I've not looked into it in ten years, and I've read fanfic's daily (or near to) all that time, I confuse it with fanon all the time. Sure, I “know” that canon is the only legitimate story, but I just don't care anymore. Canon doesn't provide me with thousands of hours of enjoyment, beyond in a roundabout way.

I will forever be thankful to JKR for allowing fanfictions to exist, if it's up to her, but canon is just to bland and indescribtive to me..
