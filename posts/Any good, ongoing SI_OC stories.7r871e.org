Preferably Male SI/OC, but definitely no romance. Tanks and thanks.\\
Edit: By "Male SI/OC" I meant a male SI or a male OC (from our world) as the main character, not slash.


** The Devil's Covenant linkffn(11399001) is an interesting one. I'm not saying that because I wrote it. I mean, I did, but I still think it's quite gripping. Sequel's up, too. Does this sound like blatant advertising? Is it working?

  After Voldemort's return, Harry finds an unlikely ally. The Child of Light made a deal with a demon. A snarky, sexually promiscuous, slightly insane, possibly incompetent demon. Rules are going to be broken (as well as the fourth wall, and probably some bones). Yep, the Wizarding World is screwed. Reviews are welcome! Sequel up now!

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

** Wait, so a slash fic with an SI and an OC, but there is no romance? /s

That being said, crossovers are a good place to start looking, have a lot of the same sorts of vibes going on, not much more to recommend beyond that unfortunately.
