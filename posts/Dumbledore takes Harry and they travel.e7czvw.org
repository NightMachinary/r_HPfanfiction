So basically Harry is expelled in the aftermath of CoS as he fails to save Ginny and Dumbledore is not reinstated so they travel. That's what I remember, but I could be wrong. Help is appreciated


** Kinda.. but not really. In Albums and Harry's world trip, Harry gets expelled after killing the basilisk and dumbledore takes him on a ,well world trip, I guess. /Linkffn 13388022

** Magicks of the Arcane by Eilyfe Here Dumbledore does take Harry on a tour after the 4th year. Fair warning though it has lemons
