I'm looking for fanfics that have good world-building and have an interesting theme or idea behind them, with Harry as a main character. I've read a lot of the fics that get recommended here and have been reading fanfic for several years so I'm looking for something that is uncommon and that I probably wouldn't have seen. Some of my favorite fics that are like what I'm requesting are Emperor, fanfictions by Enembee (I've read them all), and vitam paramus by TheEndless7.

Side note: While romance isn't necessary, if there is some romance I'd prefer no slash.

Thank you!

Post-OttP, finished before HBP. The writing shows its age and it's not so great on the worldbuilding, but this is one of the few fics where Harry fixates on getting Sirius back from the Veil.

Features a Harry that is fiercely determined, that clashes his with his friends and the Order frequently (without coming across as a ranting asshole brat) and Harry/OC Slytherin girl. And Vampires.

  Yr 6..Harry deals with the loss of Sirius along with Ron & Hermione's relationship. There are things he can't share with his friends but help from an unexpected source puts in motion the key to Voldemort's defeat.
