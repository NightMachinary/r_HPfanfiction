I highly highly HIGHLY reccomend They Shook Hands. I'm on book 4 right now. It's obviously not JK ROWLING quality, but it's curbing my curiosity on Harry being in Slytherin with a very canon feel. L Also, it kind of makes sense. Draco is the first kid Harry ever meets in the magical world so why wouldn't he try to make friends?

It's a really good read guys. Give it a shot. Especially if you have a lot of time on your hands.

Note: Im in love with the illustrated version of SS. I'm excited for the next 6. There will be more right?


** I've read this one a while back...

The writing is solid, and it's certainly one of the more realistic stories, but it was by no means “fun”, if only because the cast was so painfully unlikable to me, and I really disliked the story's themes. And then I've heard that [[/spoiler][Hermione, who was bullied by Harry and Draco and co. through pretty much the entirety the first book, ended up dead in the second due to the Basilisk]]. I thought that that would have been a bit too much of a gut punch, so I just quit (even though she's like, a background character or something).

I get rather upset at things a tad too easily.

*** Yeah that part made no sense to me and seemed to be unneeded, but I'm on book 4 and its not terrible. I've also been on a Slytherin! Harry kick recently. It's interesting to see Harry work out things from another house, especially with draco as a side kick.

** I imagine one of these are what the OP is talking about, I guess the author has the original version and a revised one. linkffn(6378694) and linkffn(7659033)

  Suppose Draco Malfoy introduced himself before he started acting like an ass. What if he had asked Harry's name before insulting Hagrid? A friendly handshake in Madam Malkin's leads to an alternate but realistic universe which is eerily like the canon,

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** Well, I don't want to be mean but the original story had already answered this question: Draco /is/ the first kid Harry ever meets in the magical world and he doesn't try to make friends because Draco is ... being Draco.

Also, it's “canon”; I don't particularly care because pretty much whatever but the misspelling doesn't make people more likely to listen to your recommendation (in fact, it has the opposite effect, making you appear stupid to some and thus casting doubt on your ability to know good literature; that is just to some, but there are people who actually think that way, even though that is harsh).

*** Well, autocorrect doesn't always have the right answers, eh?

Despite draco being draco, if Harry would have been as shy and shut in as any other kids would have been (emotionally speaking) they would have been looking for acceptance anywhere.

**** I am not going to discuss the whole “Harry being as [insert whatever] as [insert whoever]” because that's a whole can of worms for anyone with an understanding of psychology, and while I admit it is a possibility, realistically speaking it would require either Harry to become something close to a psychopath (no, thank you) or the Dursleys to be different (which changes one of the baseis of the story). But maybe I'm just being too inflexible with that, it is a possibility since I basically just woke up and it's really early.

But yes, I do agree that autocorrect sometime does terrible things to the text (I do remember it once changing every word after “and” in a message into another “and”, because ... I'm not even sure why because it made no sense then and makes no sense now); hence just noting and adding a short explanation to motivate you to change it, rather than assume you simply don't have it and don't care and chew you out.
