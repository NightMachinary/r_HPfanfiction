** Idk what this fic is so sorry for commenting but do you remember wtf his rationale was? Is he suicidal but too prissy to do it the normal way? Does he hate Remus or something? Or is he just trying to make a paradox and chose the not murdery way?

*** Basically after they both die harry raised him but he blames remus for getting tonks killed and ginny uses love potions to get harry to marry her so teddy doesn't like her either he's like 6 when he accidentally goes back in time to after harry's fourth year he kinda just wanted a family.
