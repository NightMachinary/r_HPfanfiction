It may be headcanon but I've always thought Ginny was the reason that no one died to the Basilisk (The Mirrors/convenient reflective surfaces stopping the instant death gaze aside) as really, a giant Snake with the most potent venom in the magical world that has literally one not easy to come by cure, as well as the whole giant heavy snake that could have crushed or eaten them part. Ginny must have managed to force Tom back a bit.

It's not like the Basilisk was playing peek-a-boo, looking round the corner like "SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER!" before dashing off. It could have had a tasty student-sized snack before leaving just as easy. It'd make sense, Ginny managing to exert some will to prevent the deaths.

I admit I now want to see a Basilisk that was just a kid playing Peek--a-boo and wondering why everyone kept dying, not knowing about its own death eyes.


** I think Riddle didn't want anyone to actually die before Ginny did, because then Dumbledore and the Ministry would be forced to actually do something, start investigation, look more closely into students, even close the school (see Myrtle). After all, Tom's main goal was draining Ginny of her life force and gaining a body, and he opened the Chamber for shits and giggles basically, because that's how original Tom entertained himself when he was 16.

***** I read a story that redeemed younger Riddle, where he was horrified at the actions taken and the costs, and the insanity that was old Voldemort missing 6 more pieces of his soul.

I even have a plot bunny about Harry becoming friends with a reformed Riddle and defending him in the Wizengamot. "You all believe Voldemort died 15 years ago, show me the proof that Tom Riddle is Voldemort? Even if he is, he has already had the ultimate punishment in being killed. Double Jeopardy!"

I think the plot bunny stemmed from one of those stories where Harry decided to write Voldemort a letter, and they ended up being penpals while he was stuck at Durzkaban.

Fair warning that it's got a very fratbro style of humor (a running gag is made out of Harry and Sirius's frequent sexual escapades and how their girls of the night /always/ have something linking them together for some reason, for example), but the underlying plot is pretty good.

** My headcanon is that it was Hogwarts itself that protected them. This argument basically goes as follows:

1. We know that Hogwarts has powerful and ancient magical protections designed to protect its inhabitants (see e.g. Snape's statement in OotP Occlumency class).

2. However, we also know that these powerful protections do not take the form of barriers to entry: in HBP, we see the Ministry implement new security restricting access to Hogwarts, and in DH we see the teachers cast spells to close the castle off. So as of HBP, there was no pre-existing shield-like spells around Hogwarts.

3. The protective magic of Hogwarts therefore must take a more subtle form than simply preventing hostile forces from entering.

4. We know that fate-altering magic exists. The Defence curse manipulates events so that they work out "just so" to always eject the Defence Professor by the end of the year; Felix Felicis makes events work out so that your endeavours are successful.

5. We frequently see events work out "just so" at Hogwarts so that students survive situations which logically would result in their deaths.

Conclusion: the protective magic of Hogwarts is a powerful fate-altering magic which results in events working out so that the good guys generally win.

It takes a powerful wizard to be able to overcome this protective magic.

  “Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”
#+end_quote

I think this quote from Dumbledore in CoS gets close to the heart of this. Hogwarts is an ancient magical place, undoubtedly imbued with not only explicit magical wards applied throughout the centuries, but also likely with acquired or inherent magical properties that are less well known but potentially more powerful and important.

Dumbledore in that quote is alluding to more than just the fact that Fawkes is around, or that loyal students and professors are around. I think he is trying to reinforce a lesson that magic can work in intuitive yet unexpected (especially to those who are singularly focused on wand use) ways. One of the themes of the series is that effective magic is rooted in intent, will, and honest desire. We see Harry win out through sheer grit and “moral fiber” on multiple occasions.

Hogwarts has a force of its own: moving staircases, trick stairs, and Room of Requirement, and all kinds of other secrets (passages, exits, conveniently placed niches, suits of armor, broom closets, empty classrooms, ghosts, etc) that are there to be plumbed by those who are really dedicated to getting to know the place (the Marauders, Riddle, Dumbledore, the twins, Harry). Hogwarts is also imbued with the forces of will of its inhabitants, and for centuries the major commonality there would have been /make this a safe place for learning./ Hence, as you said, there are far far fewer catastrophic injuries and accidents at Hogwarts than one might expect of a school in which adolescents and teenagers are learning to manipulate magic. Even Quidditch is at least a smidge “safer” (in terms of casualty/fatality record) at Hogwarts than it is elsewhere.

All this to say, I think Hogwarts' magic did have a role in protecting student life. There were numerous students petrified in the 40s, and only one fatality. In the 90s, there were no fatalities but at least a couple of the victims were saved from death by sheer coincidence (possibly Hogwarts at work), such as Justin seeing the basilisk through a ghost (who just happened to be in that exact spot) or Mrs. Norris who saw the reflection in puddled water.

I also think it's possible that Ginny's intentions and internal struggle to resist Riddle's will could've had something to do with the outcomes as well. After all, when Riddle did it himself in the 40s, the basilisk petrified numerous students and killed one. In the 90s, nobody died and two of the petrified victims weren't even human/mortal (cat and ghost, respectively). It's impossible to say whether or how much her intent mattered, but I can't completely discount the possibility that it did.

If you follow the calendar, there were no attacks at all for more than four months between late December and early May. That's a long time, even accounting for Ginny getting rid of the diary.

I think Riddle initially went back to his old plan of getting rid of muggle-born students. (My headcanon is that Mrs. Norris was an accident.) But then he thought better of it and laid low to drain Ginny and then go after Harry when he was ready.

** There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that without Ginny, the Chamber of Secrets plotline would have been a lot worse, and indeed, perhaps Voldemort might have won, or the war might have lasted decades or centuries. Whether or not Ginny was responsible for the seemingly blind luck of people missing death, I'm not sure. What I do know is that whatever Riddle was up to, he had to fight tooth and nail to get any control over her, and she was an eleven year old completely unaware of the danger, yet she wrested control away from him once, permanently. I'm also quite sure that stealing the diary back was to try to protect Harry, more than it was self-preservation.

But she goes and ends up in the Chamber of Secrets anyway, so she can't be that strong?

No one, aside from Harry, though through different circumstances, resists Voldemort or a Horcrux as well as Ginny did, and Ginny did it all by herself, whilst doing everything that the Horcrux would be helped by, unaware of the tremendous danger, whilst she was emotionally compromised, and for all those months, the most control Voldemort got on her were a few hours, if that, every few weeks.

Contrast this with Quirrell, who was taken over by Voldemort in a few seconds. A Horcux caused Ron, Hermione and Harry to fracture, and they were adults who knew what a Horcrux was and how dangerous it could be. One compelled Dumbledore, even.

I really wish there had been a little more Ginny in Prisoner of Azkaban, exploring her recovery from the trauma of Chamber of Secrets. It would have made sense for her to help Hermione with Buckbeak's case, as a narrative example, because we know Ginny is an animal lover, and a writer. On the other hand, she might have felt guilty for what happened to Hermione.
