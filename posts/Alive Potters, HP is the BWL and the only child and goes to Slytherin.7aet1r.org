*** /Alive Potter/ (pronounced like olive but with Ah instead of O) /is a mysterious new transfer student in Harry's fifth year with a tragic past. Why does she have the same name as him? Why does she nearly burst into tears everytime he tries to talk to her? Why does Dumbledore look so guilty? Why does she seems so close to Draco Malfoy?? ps I suck at summaries/

Is this where the Potters are flying a magic carpet over the Andes, it crashes, and they are forced to eat each other?
