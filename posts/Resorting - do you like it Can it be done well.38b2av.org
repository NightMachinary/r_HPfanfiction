What is your opinion of Harry or anyone being resorted to a different house? He can start out as a Slytherin and gets booted for being too nice or as a Gryffindor and accidently gets resorted when he puts on the hat again. What are your thoughts on it? A gimmick, a cool plot device, or just something that sometimes happens.

Any recs where you think it works well?

Edit: grammar


** I'm sure it could be done well, as can most things really. I have yet to see it done so though. I'm not too sure what I actually dislike about it though, maybe the fics I've read with it were just bad.

Edit: Actually if anyone can give me any recommendation with this done well that'd be cool.

** I am on the fence about it. I have yet to read a fic that justifies it well but I know its not impossible.

Harry is very loyal to his friends, easy shoe-in for Hufflepuff. Hermione is quite intelligent, would make sense in Ravenclaw. I don't think Ron fully qualifies for either but makes a good Gryffindor.

None of them would work well in Slytherin except at the end, taking on Voldemort and evading a militarized magical society is certainly ambitious. They just didn't have much cunning or ambition when first sorted.

*** According to canon, Harry would've been a prime example of a Slytherin. At least that is what the hat said.

**** Yes, but when did he exhibit any traits that would give cause for him to be a Slytherin? I personally think it was the Horcrux in his scar that the hat was reading as part of him.

***** For me it always was the choice of friends he made early on. Ambition and cunning are not traits you're born with. You learn both. Just like bravery and heroic traits are learned.

The influence of Hermione and Ron certainly didn't nourish his Slytherin side. But if the hat would've decided on Slytherin, Harry would've made some different friends and furthered some different traits.

The Sorting Hat seems to think not just in present traits, but also in potentials. I have no doubt that Harry would've the potential to be a perfect Slytherin.

***** Most fics I've seen where he gets sorted Slytherin it's because of his upbringing with the Dursleys. He's had to be cunning to survive, sneak food, avoid Dudley and pals, etc.

*** I think Ron is a slytherin. When he looks in the mirror of erised he sees an ambitious goal. He doesn't see knowledge, as I imagine Hermione or any raven law should, he doesn't see family or Honor or love, he sees a rather selfish personal ambition as the deepest desire of his heart.

**** I'd argue that everyone has wants and desires, but it's what you value that makes the determination of House.

In Ron's case, he values the popularity and approval of having those titles. If he were more Slytherin, it would be about having control of himself and/or others.

#+end_quote

If its an accident and Harry has to deal with living in another house, I can see it being a fun read.

If its done by request, I don't see how one would uphold the House system after the first resorting.

** I've seen fics with obscure rules about changing houses that Hermione takes advantage of (and Harry follows suit). The one I'm thinking about in particular has them determining that McGonagall is acting as Dumbledore's hand and not her students' advocate.

**** I think the complaint is more that she follows blindly.

Let's put it in a real life example. A teacher sees obvious signs of abuse/neglect/whatever and the headmaster says it's okay, ignore it. Then teacher does what, follows the headmaster's orders?

In fanon she often does exactly that. Harder to say about canon though.

***** In canon, Harry displays no signs of abuse. If you don't see that the Dursleys have a nice house, you'd think he were living with a poor family that couldn't afford to buy him better clothing or new glasses.

** Resorting (or the promise of it) is a major plot point in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/32/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts House Divided]], a next-generation fic where the Sorting Hat announces that it has placed some first-years into different houses from those they ought to be in to encourage the Houses to start acting less divided, and promises that it will re-sort those who want it if they are able to cooperate by the end of the year. Very high-quality fic, generally touted as the best next-generation fic around, so I'd encourage anyone to read it regardless.

I haven't seen any well-done ones involving Harry, though as Vestarne said, I'm sure it can be done well.

** Just about anything can be done if it's written well. I think that a lot of characters in canon have traits of more than one house like Harry/Slytherin, Hermione/Ravenclaw, Ron/Hufflepuff (probably), Dumbledore/Slytherin, etc. Sure putting a character in a different house is AU but so are the fics where Harry is raised by Goblins or Sirius or attending Durmstrang, etc. It's just another exploration of 'what if.'

As far as recs, if you don't mind slash, I read a pretty good Ravenclaw!Draco called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1521479/chapters/3217202][Chaos Theory]] (Draco/Harry). Of course the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning_on_the_Wave][Sacrifices Arc]] is a Slytherin!Harry 3 million word epic AU that gets mentioned a lot around here.

** As often happens, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][my own story]] is a candidate for this. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/39/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Chapter 39, 'Red Light, Green Light']] puts the main character in the position of changing from Gryffindor on the basis that she's being readmitted after serving time in Azkaban. The reasons why the Hat changes direction are also plausible, and mostly a consequence of earlier plot developments.
