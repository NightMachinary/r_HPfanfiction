Looking for fics about characters as pro quidditch players, preferably characters who play on the house teams but not Harry or Ron. What can you come up with for me ?


** Seeing as no one else has posted, here's a short one-shot to maybe tide you over: linkffn(how ron weasley rescued the chudley cannons). It's the only pro quidditch focused story I could think of.

The next best thing is the linkffn(naked quidditch match) which is just pure crackfic, set during a time when Oliver Wood was still captain.

  Among the assets left behind by the Death Eaters, Harry Potter learns that he now owns the Chudley Cannons. And they need help getting back up and running after the war. Fortunately, Harry knows just the wizard for the job. What do you get when you mix Arithmancy and Quidditch? Hopefully, wins. (Post-War One-shot)

  When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.
