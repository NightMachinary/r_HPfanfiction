One of the things I love about Harry in the books has to be all the sarcasm and snark filled remarks. He isn't just full of angst. When he is faced with trouble often be just sort of uses sarcasm to handle his frustration, or just make smartass comments.


** I love sassy Harry. Whenever I write him, I'm always desperately trying to think of how I can slip in a sarky remark from him. We just don't see it enough in fanfic.

*** No you don't see it often. I really want to read a good one. Sassy Harry is just awesome. Sometimes I see it in femHarry stories. While that's cool he is sassy already as a guy.

** Ron's at least twice as snarky, but you'll never know it by reading fanfiction. Same for McGonagall and Ginny. And Phineas Nigellus Black!

I think plenty of fanfics try to make Harry smartass. Most 'independent' Harry fics, really, after you get past the first two or three chapters of the obligatory 'I miss Sirius' angst. But since most of them can't write snark at all, it comes off as heavy handed and makes Harry look like a jerk.

*** I think the people get the tone of Harry's snark wrong, and that's why this happens. They just have him running round being a rude twat to everyone, but generally he's quick in response to people trying to antagonise him. He doesn't make the first move, whereas Ron often does.

** Because most of the Harry interpretations you see in Fics are either a self-insert of the author or what the author wants Harry to be. It's the dictionary definition of wish fulfillment. Similar case with Hermione. She's shipped with so many characters, cos author's self insert their personality into her and pair her with whoever their crush is.

*** I agree that there is a lot of projection. That after all is part of fanfiction and like it not it's not necessarily a bad thing. On the other hand I just wish there was a little more sass.

** Ive always been disappointed by the limited numbers of serious and mature rated fics, that still manage to incorporate humor and sarcasm well into their plots, and do it where it works with the characters well.

** Why should Harry be snarky when he is literally the smartest and most powerful being there is? Not to forget the master prankster and heir to the marauders.

Harry in fanfic has no need for snark unfortunately.

**** Yeah but there is a huge difference being snarky and sarcastic because you are on top and so much better than them or you are , like canon Harry, the underdog who gets kicked while he is down. See dursley interactions, see fifth year and the order of snarky.

** I think that, in general, fics that actually keep Harry's personality reasonably intact are a small minority. I think that, ironically, it is the fics that don't focus on Harry as the exclusive point-of-view character often have the best snark from him. (I'm thinking of linkffn(Weasley Girl by Hyaroo), linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), and linkffn(In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life by SilverWolf007), in particular.)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** I like snark, but I prefer stories with no snark where the author's basically said 'I can't do this right so I'll just leave it' to stories with snark that's either completely over the top, where Harry walks around shitting on everyone he meets, or mostly non-existent and then randomly shoehorned in whenever the author remembers that 'oh yeah, I wanted snarky Harry'.

It's hard to do in a natural way, and it doesn't add /that much/ if done well, but can completely wreck a character if done poorly, so I think on balance the lack of snark in fanfiction is better than the alternative. That said, if a few of the better authors started adding some, I'd be quite happy.
