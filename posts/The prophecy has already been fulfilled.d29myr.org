As it was made before Harry's and Neville's birth, this is accurate, as both will be born by the end of July.

#+begin_quote
  Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...
#+end_quote

Same here, both L&J Potter and A&F Longbottom did in some way defy him three times, though there are probably a lot if people that did. Albus Dumbledore for instance.

#+begin_quote
  And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...
#+end_quote

This is where the prophecy narrows itself on Harry through Lord Voldemort's actions - he will use the curse on one of the children, and that will be the mark.

The "Power he knows not" is the magic that saves Harry, be it a sacrificial protection by Lily potter, "Love", or something else. All we know is that it is something that LV can't cast/know/understand. (he's not a woman/mother, he can't feel "love", something else)

#+begin_quote
  And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...
#+end_quote

Either MUST die, is what LV interpreted as immortality if the child is dead (nevermind the fact that a new child could be born every year, or has been born in the past but is coming nearer now, geographically)

However, the prophecy isn't as literal - seeing as both lived at the same time for quite a while after the resurrection. It could mean that neither would live /in peace/ while the other is around - LV because he's insane and could never leave a person capable of killing him alone, and Harry because with LV around, life is pretty shit. If either dies, then the other wins the world and instigates some measure of peace, but if both live then there's an endless war. "Live" can mean many thing, the least of which is "alive".

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies....
#+end_quote

Vanquish, not kill, or end. The power to vanquish is the power he knows not, for if he knew, it would not be able to vanquish him.

Every condition has been met, the child has been marked, gained the power and vanquished the dark lord. It explicitly doesn't say "kill forever", or "end", or "stop".


** I think fic authors need to stop taking prophecies so seriously.

It seems that the literary world is infatuated with prophecies these days. We are now in 21st century, and every sci-fi or fantasy flick has a prophecy. It doesn't matter whether it's in a Galaxy Far Far Away, in Middle Earth, in the cyberpunk Matrix simulation, or in some other lost realms of nowhere. Don't people get tired of it?

At least in HBP, JKR made Dumbledore say that prophecies are at best self fulfilling. This Prophecy is IMHO totally a con job, and only set in motion because that sadistic genocidal maniac chose to act on it.

I really want to read fics that completely and totally shit on prophecies.

*** the starwars one is decent, because its due to palpatines own master attempts to create life that the prophecy happened and then palpatine managed to corrupt the chosen one

and then palpatine lost barely

Minor case in that the prophesy is fulfilled, but in a really stupid way.

Ron defeats Voldemort. While polyjuiced as Harry.

#+begin_quote
  >! Looking down upon the world, the Goddess of Fate's eyes flew open wide when she realized what had happened. She turned her gaze upon those around her as she muttered. "Whoops!"!<

  "WHOOPS! What do you mean, 'Whoops'?" A very angry older god asked the smaller Fate. "All of the heavens have been working to put Harry Potter where he is because you predicted he was the one to kill Voldemort! We allowed his mother and father to die and for him to be abused all because of your prediction! We allowed him to be manipulated by the senile old puke because of what you predicted!"

  Fate shrunk into herself a little. "Well... uh... how was I supposed to know it was polyjuice potion?" She pointed to her scrying pool. "It only shows pictures. I clearly saw Harry Potter do some kind of magic that totally destroyed Voldemort and his horcruxes."

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** I have seen that approach in a few fics and generally liked it because I am not fond of prophecies of any kind, since they tend to be cheap plot devices which end up being self-fulfilling (which makes them predictable). So spicing things up is always welcome.

And it is certainly a viable interpretation.

#+end_quote

It could also mean 'neither can live while the other survives this prophecy,' which means that it's just a matter of time until one of them kills the other, at which point the terms of the prophecy are complete. 'Survives' doesn't have to mean indefinitely, it just means 'survive a specific event,' in this case the completion of the prophecy.

#+end_quote

Harry's power didn't, Lily's did. On the other hand, you could argue that Harry 'vanquished' Voldemort during the confrontations at the end of the first, second, and fourth books, since he was actively attempting to stop Voldemort at that point.

** This might be me confusing canon with fanon but don't prophecy orbs get dark when they're fulfilled? Like the orb in the DoM should have been black if it was over?

*** I don't remember that from the books, but I the movie might have had it a bit. the orbs were many different shades there, I think.

If that's the case, then the movie shows a decidedly cloudy and grey orb, indicating a largely fulfilled prophecy, which could just be that the conditions for it are vague and could happen again in the future, or that the DoM people/prophecy orb enchantments thought it was partly fulfilled.

I don't think the orbs are a natural mechanism either, Trelawney didn't sneeze out a marble, so whatever turns them cloudy could simply be reliant on the DoM's interpretation of events.
