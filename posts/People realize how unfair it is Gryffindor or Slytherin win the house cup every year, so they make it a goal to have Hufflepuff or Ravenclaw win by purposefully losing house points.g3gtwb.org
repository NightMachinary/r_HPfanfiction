Except Dumbledore still finds a stupid reason(s) at the end of every school year to give Gryffindor enough points to beat every other house.


** "Yes, yes, congratulations Ravenclaw. However, before we can tuck in, I have some last minute points to give."

Loud groans were heard throughout the Great Hall as almost all of the students expressed their displeasure at this bit of news.

"To express my thanks to Harry Potter for saving us from Lord Voldemort fifteen years ago, I award 350 points to Gryffindor."

** "Good work, Harry, 30 points to Gryffindor for protecting the Stone"

"Sir, I am in Ravenclaw" he looked to Professor Flitwick for help, who just shook his head resignedly with a smile.

"Oh, and 10 points for House Unity, though you must wear the correct gold and red, my boy"

"Harry, for your saving of young Ginevra, I award you 50 points to Gryffindor"

"It's Slytherin, Sir" Harry said in a very tired voice while gesturing to the green and silver tie, robes, and the snake crest. He almost told him about the whole Slytherin Heir stuff he learned at the Chamber, but Professor Snape said that was a House Matter.

"How wonderful of you to wish to integrate with those who dislike you, Harry, but there's no need to accept how they call you"

"They are my friends, Sir" Now he just wanted to sleep, he wondered if Draco still had some of the chocolate his mother sent him.

"Of course they are, my boy" Harry just looked at Snape, who just shook his head.

"Now run along to the Tower, I am sure your friends are waiting for you, the Weasleys must be worried"

"Sir, I live in the Dung-" he stopped when Professor McGonagall put a hand on his shoulders and guided him to the door.

"Back to your common room, Mr. Potter, we will deal with the rest, 50 points to Slytherin" she said softly, he looked at Snape who nodded, before running to the Dungeons.

** "30,023 points to Griffindor for dressing in red and gold to honor one of the hogwarts founders"

​

"Why are you doing this?" Whispered Professor Mcgonagall harshly.

​

"Well, the house points system has been made a mockery of by Snape, so at the start I was just getting revenge on him, but now? Look at them. Look at the sight of all four houses all working in concert to attempt to get one of the other houses to win. I must continue this now, for who am I to prevent such a show of unity between the houses."

​

Mcgonagall looked shellshocked, then pensive.

​

"Next year, give them points for all sitting at the same table."

​

"Marvelous! Then the year after, when they all sit at other tables I can give them points for promoting friendship between the houses!"
