Does this quote not explain why nearly everybody loves Luna?

** I adore Luna and want nothing more than to pat her on the head and give her a bowl of ice cream, but she's insanely difficult to write.

** However, it also explain why it is so difficult to write her, because she really is not real friend to anybody: sharing her dreams, fears, hopes, being real to her friends.

If this is the case, she and Harry are real friends post DoM battle.

**** Oh yes, Harry & co. try to be /friendly/ towards Luna, but her statement that “it would be like having friends” is pretty exact, they are never real /friends/, mainly because she is not. It is very similar to [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][my problems with Ginny]]: friendship (and love) in my opinion should be measured in kilobytes, it is about sharing information (yes, in the case of love up to the level of sharing generic information, but that's just the top of the iceberg). If Luna ever revealed her true self to Ginny and Harry (even post-DoM-battle, or to Mr Ollivander in the Malfoy's cellar), it is never shown in the books, it happens (like that case of Ginny) somewhere in the background and we never learn about it. It is the reason, why it is so difficult to write her, because we never learn what she is really about.

***** I think we learn so much when she's on the page. She's the kind of character who's told through the scene rather than the dialogue. It gives her this kind of vibe where you understand her, but at the same time, the characters don't. She's open, but no one listens. It's what I like about her, and I think it's the hardest thing to carry over to Fanfiction.
