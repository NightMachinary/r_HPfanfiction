So basically Harry goes back to the past and ends up somewhere in Africa. He ends up helping out a little village and meets Newt not much later. They travel and categorize animals together, and I remember Harry has this backpack with an expansion charm inside where they keep a bunch of animal habitats. Towards the ends they adopt a kid as well.

I know I'm sparse on details, but the author was Araceil. She took the story down, I think (couldn't find it but I also only skimmed her stories). Does anyone have a copy?


** I had to go digging for this one. I hope it's right cause it's a good read. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296472/1/Against-My-Nature][Against My Nature]]

*** Forgot to add that you can Google "Against my Nature by Araciel" and it'll pop up.

** This is the best thing I have read in months. I seem to have read almost everything in the fandom so this was nice and fresh. Very angry it's not completed as I hate waiting on fics that will never be complete.

*** Unfortunately it's a bit unlikely it will be finished. Araceil writes amazing stores but she doesn't finish most of them. I'm still waiting on a couple from five years ago to update. Still, fantastic writing!

** I know this is a long shot but does anyone happen to have a copy of this story? I was on chapter 3 before author took it down from ffn. I have no intention to post it anywhere online, it's merely for my own read. Thanks in advance.
