The premise here is that the world of the series instead of being stagnant or lazy, as in many fanon interpretations or simply undeveloped like some may think from canon, is post apocalyptic. The 20th century had many conflicts and tragedies and the magical world suffered much. Old magic is still working and protecting world's secrecy, but no one really understands it anymore and while wizards could make real wonders happen, they don't know how. That is why magic or Hogwarts may seems underwhelming. Simply everything is in ruin.


** I believe Vekin87 plays in his Albus Potter series with the idea that the wizarding world used to be much bigger and the part we see in the books is just a ruin of what remained from it following Voldemort's war. Also the generations immediately following the second war didn't receive formal education since the records with upcoming students were destroyed in the Battle of Hogwarts, as well as the records of the Muggleborns who were children during Voldemort's reign.
