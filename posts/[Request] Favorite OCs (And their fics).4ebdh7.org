Looking to meet new characters.

I like long walks on the beach at sunset. Cuddling up with a good book during a storm... Er... I mean...

Seriously, just looking for a new group of witches/wizards. I'd prefer something that doesn't focus on the OGs.


** I like the main characters from linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided). I believe only Teddy is not an OC, the other 3 are.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

Edit: Also James and Lily from HP&BWL are great OC Standins. Also the two of them from linkffn(C'est La Vie), which also has a good OC in Orion Black.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

The Potter sisters in *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), and their interactions are kind hilarious.

Finally, Abigail Waters in *Grow Young With Me*, linkffn(11111990), is the best OC I've read so far.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

** Do characters that are wildly different from their cannon counterparts count? If so, gilderoy Lockhart in linkffn(applied cultural anthropology) he's canny and roguish, not buffoonish. He makes for a great mentor go Hermione. Now that I think about it, gilderoy Lockhart from linkffn(harry potter and the Prince of slytherin) has a similar gilderoy. I love both of them.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** I had another one for you. It's an older fic, written before HBP (keep that in mind, because I had a hard time adjusting to the fact that there weren't any Horcruxes). It's Ron centric (he can see the future). The seventh year defense professor was a pretty great oc. Linkffn(the book of Morgan le fey) is the first, but I don't think the oc I mentioned shows until the sequel.

  A sixth-year adventure told from Ron's perspective. RonHermione; HarrySusan. The Trio must stop Voldemort from wiping out Muggles. THIS IS A RE-WRITE. Rated R for language, violence, and sexual situations.
