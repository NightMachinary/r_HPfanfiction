Yes please help me it was about Harry being kidnapped by Death Eaters in like 5th year summer, and Lily and James were resurrected and they ended up in the same prison as Harry and Snape helped them escape, and Voldemort was really mad and afraid wondering how they'd cheated death when only he was supposed to know how to do that!


** I FOUND IT ALL ON MY OWN!!! :) It was in a fanfic.net community group of stories about Lily and James resurrecting. :) :) :)

#+begin_quote
  After GoF, starts going AU from OotP's chapter three. After attempts to escort Harry to safety fail and he ends up in a cell in Malfoy Manor, all seems lost. He gets some surprising company in the cell; his parents, supposedly dead. Is their elation at being reunited short lived, or can Harry finally get to know his parents? Rated M for violence and bad language.
