#+TITLE: Boggarts are actually very common in muggle areas, but due to low amounts of magic in these areas, only children can even see them, and even then, they can only manifest their scary forms for a few moments, typically when a muggle child peers under their bed.

** From the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Though they cannot see other non-beings like Dementors, Muggles can sometimes see Boggarts; however, as most Muggles refuse to acknowledge anything that might even be considered somewhat magical, the glimpses they catch of Boggarts are usually dismissed as mere hallucinations or figments of the viewer's imagination. This denial is helped by the fact that Muggles rarely see Boggarts plainly, due to their favoured haunts being dark places away from the public eye.

  ...

  Boggarts are particularly fond of inhabiting dark, confined spaces, such as...the gap beneath beds

Basically, your prompt is at least pretty close to being canon.

*** Huh. I never read that page on the wiki. I've just been playing a lot of The Sims, and one of the mechanics is a monster under the bed that's only visible to child Sims, and it just got me thinking.
