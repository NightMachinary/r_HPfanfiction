So this isn't my fic, but there are frequently requests for Harry/Daphne stories on this sub, so I wanted to make a thread to give more awareness to this story.

It's a very solid romance coming of age story, bucks some of the tropes common with the pairing.


** Huh, looks neat. I'll keep it in mind for my next read.

I'm pretty much always down for solid HP/DG fics, and that one has an interesting idea.

Anyone know if it's on FFN also? I prefer to read there.

** Promising start so far.

I like how this Daphne talks and how it incorporates art and literature into the story.
