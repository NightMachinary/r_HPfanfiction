:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It is about post war Auror Harry going to ?Diagon alley and runs into Draco selling potions I think. Harry is suspicious of him and decides to follow him to his house to search for Dark artifacts. Draco is living in a rundown flat , poor and barely makes ends meet by selling potions . Harry comes every week to search him and they slowly hit it off.
