Hi everyone.

I'm looking for fics where Harry finds alternatives to keeping dementors at bay. I am specifically looking for one where he uses something called the knot of misery. Any help would be love!

Don't know anything about the "knot of misery", but this fic features Harry using legilimency and occlumency against dementors.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

*** He also uses his fists to combat them, because there is at least one scene where Harry gets to punch a dementor. ( It might sound stupid on paper, but the author makes it work. )

  Harry Potter becomes a vampire. Which struggle will be the most difficult? The war with Voldemort, or the struggle to hold onto his own failing humanity? Takes place right after HBP and makes an immediate detour into the Twilight Zone. Beware a HHr story.

** You guys are great. None of these are the particular fic I'm looking for, but I have added them to my list to be read. Here is some more info that I remembered.

Someone--I can't remember who, but maybe Tom Riddle or Draco Malfoy, help Harry create a necklace with a "knot of misery" on it. This "knot of misery" was created by Harry putting all of his bad memories of his time with the Dursleys. I also think it had something to do with organizing his memories and helping him with at least dementors but maybe occlumency as well.

Thanks again for the help.
