How do you write your character having a crush, on a cannon one? Any tips is it the same as oc?


** First of all, I am not an author, so I'm clearly not the best person to give tips or advices. Now that this is said, I think that you should give more informations about the said crush.

The way to write a romance will change depending of the kind of fic you are writing (a central plot in a romance Vs a side story in an action fic) and the characters involved. A character like Snape (the adult one) would never blush, stutter or flee when confronted to his crush, while these reactions are totally plausible for Neville. In the same way, an adult would be way better at handling his feeling that a 6th year or worse, a 4th one.

Anyways, as long as the crush is just secondary to the main plot, and that your MC is a pretty normal teen (and not some sociopath like a young Riddle), you can probably stick to the classics.\\
Lines like "MC first thought about [Crush] when he heard about the Yull Ball" or "MC saw him/her and felt butterflies in his stomach" are a bit corny, but they still do the trick.
