  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

**** Yeah. I saw it on a post and I was really bored so I tried reading it. I didn't know it was just smut. Of course I stopped reading. Someone should make an actually good one with actual plot and not just a horny teenagers mess. I really would read that.
