And if the Death Eaters were far more subtle in their coup, and their actions taken after it?

- Instead of trying to accost Harry, Crouch Jr kills Moody and escapes. Moody's body is never found, he's blamed for all the Triwizard fiasco and a lot of blame falls on Dumbledore for hiring him (along with claiming that Voldemort's back).
- Crouch Jr also puts Trelawney under the Imperius and she also leaves Hogwarts during the mayhem after the Third Task. Voldemort tortures her, breaks into her mind and learns the prophecy.
- The Death Eaters, especially after the Azkaban escape, conduct mass attacks against muggleborn but stop sometime after the coup succeeds, after which the govt takes over that activity, but subtly.
- After the coup, convicted Death Eaters don't go out openly in public. They continue attacking their enemies, and when those are pureblood, use the media to blame "Muggleborn fanatics" for it in reprisal of attacks against them.
- The media slowly focuses on the "muggleborn" reprisals (which are actually Death Eater attacks in disguise) instead of real Death Eater actions, since the Ministry would claim that their efforts are keeping DEs in check and suppress info against it.
- Eventually it would swing public opinion against Dumbledore/Order/Harry and the oppression would become govt policy fully supported by the public majority.
- They also take hostages amongst families such as the Weasleys right from the start to keep the rest in line.

Edit: To clarify, see below...

  By "*come into the open*" I mean that Voldemort is never seen in public by Fudge, so the Ministry never believes he's back. He never calls for Fudge to step down, threatening a mass muggle killing in retaliation if he doesn't. The war is never openly fought, the Death Eaters don't declare their intentions etc. I mean that the fact that Voldemort is alive again is never proven and isn't taken as fact by the public.

** The third volume in series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]”, which is “Return to Neverland” linkao3(1143960) (it would probably work as a standalone story, but I would strongly suggest reading the whole thing).

** Isn't that sort of what happens in canon.

  ‘The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,' said Lupin. ‘The official version of Scrimgeour's murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.'

Voldemort doesn't come into the open until the final battle, the children at Hogwarts are hostages and Harry is framed for Dumbledore's murder.

I'll post the clarification in the post as well.

Edit: Also Voldemort is hardly subtle in canon. Just a week after the coup, a blatant Muggleborn oppression law is passed. Then Snape, formerly accused of murdering Dumbledore is elected Hogwarts headmaster, Harry becomes Undesirable No 1. It is blatant in all the wrong ways.
