Is it just me or does smut feature an excessive amount of absurd and unnecessary plots?

Without naming stories, there are countless examples where draconian laws (marriage laws, free use laws, muggleborn slavery) are casually thrown around in order to facilitate a pairing when "There's a free for all sex room" or "someone messed up a prank with lust potions" would have done. I get 100k words of teenage drama with sex in between, but 100k of badly thought out and horribly implemented politics in stories about sex? And very often, authors cross lines not even Stalin nor Hitler dared to cross. You know what the Third Reich used to massively increase birth rates? Tax benefits, propaganda and PR events.

Tl;dr: Why invent ridiculous justifications when "I'm horny and open-minded" would do?

Edit: Since people seem to get the wrong idea. I am not complaining about smut with plot, I am complaining about bloating stories with adult scenes by adding entire arcs which add nothing to the story, not even world building or character introductions.


** Kinky fantasies mah dude!

Or at least that's my guess. The three examples you gave had some degree of dubious consent in it and for some reason people like that. While I don't particularly care about the plot in smutfics, it's important to some people. There's also no real logic in marriage law fics. It's a convenient plot device to put two unlikely people together and as such, it will never die. ...Maybe. I've no idea.

The point of your thread seems to be more of a "FYI: Marriage Law fics are illogical and impossible and immoral" rather than "why do people write them".

**** Authors also have preconceived notions of how the character should act, and going OOC too much turns them off of writing. Authors in fanfiction write what THEY want to write because they aren't getting paid to do it. If they write a one-shot kink fic its because they wanted to explore the kink.

If a person (such as you) wants to see more "plot" and less PLOT and even less OVERLY AMBITION PLOT WITH PROBLEMS.... then take a shot at writing it yourself.

That's how I got into writing fanfic, I wasn't seeing what I wanted to see so I wrote it myself.

** The thing is though, that reluctant or forced marriage is a popular trope even outside the world of fandom, although most pro authors don't use an actual law to force characters to marry characters that they otherwise would not. Pro authors tend to use blackmail/revenge most often in contemporary romance while politics and/or revenge are very popular in historials, rather than laws, but it's basically the same thing.

So the marriage law and free use laws are just fanfic adaptations of a trope that's basically as old as romance. All you need to do is look at the profusion of bodice-rippers and old-school romance to know that women /like/ to read that sort of thing. Women, and the majority of people who read romance are women, like to read about relationships that start bad and end up good, about reluctant spouses who become devoted.

Personally, I believe it has something to do with the fact that women are socialised to believe that enjoying sex is somehow bad, which means that the man who makes them take it and makes them /like/ it is a nice way to get their jollies guilt-free.

I've noticed that since there's been a movement in favour of being positive about female sexuality, the popularity of the very forceful alpha male has gone down a bit (which is part of why FSoG pisses me off - it's a regression, and it sucks) but the whole idea of being forced into a relationship, whether by the other person or by outside forces, is never going to go away.

As for the point about not spoiling stories with plot-personally, I like some plot with my porn. Maybe it's because I'm growing up a bit, but I find that stories that run 'they met, they fucked, they moved on' just don't satisfy me any more. I prefer drama, and I prefer romance - in the sense that no matter how reluctant the parties involved are initially, I want them to have a believable happy ending.

That's just my take, as someone who reads a lot (A LOT) of romance and a comparable amount of fic.

** Eh, it makes sense to me. The context in literary erotica matters a lot, particularly when it comes to certain fetishes. For example lots of women (and some men) get off on rape fantasies (or dubious consent fantasies), so it's really important that Hermione has to marry some Death Eater and then entertain him and his friends with sexual favours or something along those lines to really get the blood pumping.

I'm a man myself, but I identify your post as a particularly male perspective: "Just get on with the smut/porn please!", which is not how pornography works for most women.

I'm also not surprised that anyone who goes so far as to write smut in literary form - no matter the gender - tends more towards the "I want a bit more plot in my porn" category.

** I, personally, am invested in the characters and their relationships beyond the smut. To me, the relationships, the build up, the fall out, makes the smut that much better.

I'm also a fan of the enemies-to-lovers trope, and generally, yeah, there will be a lot of ridiculous, over-the-top, non-sensical, plot lines used to make that trope happen. Marriage Law is one of the easiest mechanisms to use when writing that trope, which means that it's a good place for amateur writers to stretch their legs, and what is fanfic but a bunch of amateur writers exploring their passion.

Also, if you try to apply or compare/contrast historical politics to fanfiction politics, you're gonna have a bad time. For the most part people don't write fanfiction politics based on whether or not there is historical precedence to support them, and it's silly to expect them to. You're willing to suspend disbelief when it comes to the entire Harry Potter universe, but not when it comes to it's non-canonical politics?? That's just silly.

It's fine to not like a trope, heaven knows I have plenty of tropes I hate, but if you only want smut, there are tags for that (one-shot, two-shots, porn-without-plot, or really any E rated fic that's complete and under 6,000 words). If you've run out of those, you can always skim through the narrative to find the smut, I've done that before when I'm not particularly keen on a story's plot line.

The tropes you mentioned are often mentioned in the summary or made clear from the beginning, so it's not that hard to avoid them, if you don't like them. Just don't hate on the people that write them or the people who like them. No one is making you read them.

That's a familiar problem for me as a reader of both fan and pro/published fiction. Most of the decently-written, yet terribly plotted romance or smut I've run into tends to have largely structural issues -- the writer is new to or unfamiliar with the beats of erotica or romance, or can't quite hit them in the right way.

It's why I can't read a lot of romance or pairing-centric fan fic -- as a romance novelist, I'm unforgiving of badly written romance arcs. Most shipping comes off as idealized and romanticized instead of romantic, or thinly-veiled excuses for a lot of sex that isn't all that sexy.

Granted, fan fic has a luxury of space that pro fic does not, but sometimes that's to the detriment of the plot. The flood of words strangles the actual story.

--------------

*For the curious here is what a (traditionally published) romance novel generally consists of:*

About 70-100k, with a Happily Ever After or Happy For Now ending and a "formula" plot that could be considered more like a time-tested guideline that you ignore at your own peril. You can play in that formula, or even subvert a few expectations, but romance readers are vicious and will rip to shreds anything that does not contain an HEA or HFN. They also hate cheating and infidelity.

Some subgenres/niches of romance are longer or shorter than others -- a historical romance will likely be longer than a romantic thriller. Some don't contain sex at all, while others fade to black. Some could be classified as erotic romance.

Erotica is a slightly different beast, but, like romance, there are plenty of outlines, templates, or beat sheets out there on the internet that can be used as helpful guides for the genre.

**** I'll probably just be parroting a lot of advice that others have said better, but the best things anyone interested in writing romance can do is:

- /Familiarize themselves with a romance arc and the story beats that go into one./ Knowing story structure cuts down on clutter, "I don't know what to do next" feelings, and plot misfires. Writers who like winging it don't have to become outliners, but it's important to know and use what's necessary for the genre.
- /Read a lot of (pro) stories./ These will have more editing and polish than most fics do. They will also adhere to a romance arc.
- /Read different subgenres./ What someone likes to read might not be what they're best at writing, and it's always good to expand horizons.
- /List likes and dislikes when reading./ The character types and plots that appeal to a writer might end up being the ones that they want to write. Lists also give ideas on what to avoid, research, or subvert/play with.
- /Write to market, not to trend./ That is to say, write what appeals to readers, not whatever the latest shiny fade is. No one can ever say when readers will suddenly get sick of something, but it's more likely to happen when every other book for sale offers the same over-saturated characters, plots, niches, etc.
- /Play with the trend./ This looks like it flies in the face of the advice just above, but only a little! Taking popular stuff (or even unpopular stuff) and switching it up a little can breathe new life into old tropes. I'd only recommend doing this after writing a standard romance -- knowing the rules makes bending or breaking them a lot easier.

It's not groundbreaking, but it's worked for me.

For anyone not interested in writing romance, most of the advice above still stands. I'd swap out "romance arc" for "act structure" instead, though.

In romance, it's very important to stick with an arc.

That said, the priorities of fan fic and pro fic are a bit different, so with a romance fan fic, you can definitely write it well over 100k and with a more complicated plot. Or it might just be a different genre with a romance subplot thrown in; it all depends on how much focus is given to the pairing.

If it's a romance, then everything else is secondary to getting the main characters together. The romance /is/ the main plot. In a really long fic, though, it's a struggle to keep things interesting -- throwing in hardships, like you mentioned, could prevent the plot from going all squishy in the middle.

So a romance fic could be about getting A and B together, then the struggle to keep them that way. It'd still be a regular romance arc, just stretched out.

Yeah, I know what you mean. "Love at first sight" is a bit much after reading it for the millionth time, and a bar meet up is frankly grounded to some of the stuff I've read. But the romance genre is so huge that there is probably a book out there for every person, and there are definitely "lust at first sight" novels out there.

The sorting ceremony in 2009 (11-12 years after Voldemort's regime)

"Voldemort Avery!" Neville called.

"Slytherin!" the Sorting Hat shouted, to nobody's surprise.

Little Voldemort was followed by two muggle-borns called Megan Byrne and Jake Chadwick, but then Neville hesitated a little before calling Voldemort Dolohov, and soon there were two little Voldemorts in Slytherin.

Just a few minutes later, a third Voldemort was called up, this time Voldemort Goyle. The Sorting Hat placed him in Hufflepuff, to the amusement of everyone in the Great Hall.

Voldemort Lestrange ended up in Ravenclaw, as did Voldemort Nott. Voldemort Rosier was a girl, but that hadn't stopped her parents from calling her Voldemort. She joined Voldemort Crabbe in Hufflepuff. Finally, Voldemort Yaxley ended up in Gryffindor, which until then had been the last Voldemort-less house.

** Preach it, brother!

I'm dismayed in how often the purpose of magic in these sort of stories is 'to overwhelm a witch's restraint'. As if they have to be coerced by forces beyond their control in order to justify being attracted to the MC. Even more disturbing is the tendency to make the MC the /only/ acceptable lover for the witch or witches in question; moving beyond dominance into abject ownership.

I can't quite get my rant rolling here, but there's so much wrong with it.

Rape fantasies are absolutely a kink, and a very acceptable one in written works, since it doesn't involve actual people being put in the situation while still indulging the kink. I'm just pointing out that the convoluted shenanigans of having Magic force the conditions in order to indulge that kink is bogus, because they're not owning up to their kink.

When you say paedophilic, I'm thinking of stories where the adults get it on with pre-pubescent children, because they like them that way. It's not my thing and I find it distasteful. Still a valid kink (and better exercised -- or exorcised -- within the context of a story). I don't approve of it in real life in any way.

Many people categorize any sex between an adult and someone less than 18 as paedophilia, and that isn't the case. In the real world it is classified as Statutory rape, but the rules vary between States as to where the boundaries lie, and the purpose there is to protect the rights of the underaged from being bullied or coerced. As if somehow the magic wand of State-approved adulthood granted some people more wisdom than they had a week prior to that.

I would not go that far, but I also prefer amateur stuff over hardcore.

More like, there are (many) people who simply want to see stuff they can't do themselves (eg m/f/f/f/f/f/f strap-on orgies or harems) instead of something where they can immerse themselves into. They do not want to have something that hits close to home (like the sex they have, but better), but rather something abstract to watch like 40 guys trying to impregnate a woman. And I get the appeal of that abstractness, but just the detached stuff is not the way to go IMO.
