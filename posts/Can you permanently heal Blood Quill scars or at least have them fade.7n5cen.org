My main OC Josephine Cracknell is a healer. Do you think it's possible for her to heal Blood Quill scars? Or at least help them be not so painful. I was picturing her interacting with Lee Jordan (who is the only other canon character we know that was forced to use the Blood Quill).

She may come with Charlie when Arthur gets attacked before Christmas of 1995.


** I don't know if Blood Quill scars count as curse scars. If they do, then I don't think they can be healed. I imagine they'd fade over the years, but never truly disappear. In my stories, Harry still has the scar on the back of his hand.

*** Yeah, that makes sense. Lee still has the scars in the stories I wrote about him.

** Skin transplant together with other magical means maybe? I always though of mixing muggle means with magical ones to get rid of magical shit like curse scars.

*** Even though she's a witch, she's rather familiar with muggle means of healing seeing as she's the daughter of a squib and a muggle.

And I always write Lee as a half-blood with a muggle-born American mother.

** Its dark magic, damage done by dark magic is hard/impossible to heal. But Snape healed Dracos damage done by Sectumsempra a curse he created. So it could be possible if someone understands the magic well enough. Umbridge most likely would know how one would at least learn how to heal the damage done by a cursed item she created.

If you want you could also just say that Umbridge placed a variation of some curse with a known countercurse on the quill, and have it healed that way.

*** She did get top marks/grades in Healing while she was studying at Ilvermorny (she's American). Maybe she just notices the scars on his wrists. I don't think she's seen Blood Quill Scars look like. so he would have to explain to her what they are.

**** Just abduct Umbridge, pump her full of Veritaserum, and depending on situation, either obliviate her or vanish her body.

***** Her younger sister Clarissa is a hit witch in America. I could bring her in.

If anyone cares to look up Umbridge. The three sisters have a connection to her.

****** That's even better. With respect to Umbridge, I would drop any pretense of niceties. Furthermore, the Ministry was actually a paper tiger that anyone with reasonable skills could shit on.

Capturing and interrogating Umbridge should also yield valuable intel on the rest of the Ministry.

******* They actually don't know about their connection to her since their grandma burned all memories of her ex-husband and daughter except for a picture that the three sisters found when they were younger.

I can picture my OC wanting to be nice to Umbridge at first but her younger sister Clarissa just wants to hex her into oblivion. The youngest sister Priscilla is still in school so it might be just the two older sisters who confront Umbridge.

** I think the difficulty would be a build up of the curse with so much use of the blood quill and time. As in.

Why would I need to heal you from use of a blood quill, your natural healing should have taken care of it?\\
You wrote how many words? oh.\\
I am sorry if you had come to me right away I could have eliminated the scarring. But since you let weeks go by, the curse used to make the blood quill work has attached itself more firmly to your hand. I can only reduce the scarring, not remove it.

** My take on it is that a single Blood Quill scar is easily healed by Essence of Dittany or other methods, but if (like Umbridge made them) the same scar is reopened day after day, magical Healing will become less and less effective just like you can only /Reparo/ a single object so many times. Presumably, it would still be imaginable to cut off the part of skin with the scar on it by non-magical means and then regrow new skin in its place, but that's a bit extreme.

** I generally assume that muggle means work fine on scars caused by dark magic since the dark magic /prevents/ magical healing; it doesn't magically restore a scar removed by other means.
