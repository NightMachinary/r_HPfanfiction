Obvious things like Dumbledore's lessons, Ron and Hermione randomly deciding Draco's a good guy now, Harry just kinda being ineffectual after having literally been a DADA teacher the year before, but I just kinda came away unsatisfied in a way I didn't in the others.


** I agree with you. in part. But in my opinion there really isn't any stories that are both better and complete both the last years.

Mostly because Harry tends to be extremely over-powered. Another problem is that most of the stories end up with a lot of character bashing, mostly Dumbledore for being the real evil, and Ron as an excuse to have Hermione end up with Harry instead. That is if it didn't turn out Hermione only was friend with Harry because Dumbledore bribed her with access to all the books in the secret libraries.

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

**** Calm down. There's nothing wrong with a boy chasing a girl.

You're the one who seems to have an unhealthy view of relationships, if such an innocuous line triggered you so much.

You talk about respecting people as individuals, and then you go and assume that a girl some boy wants to be with is just a prize and not an individual with agency, simply because of the boy going after her.

Also, most men don't have the luxury of "waiting for someone to come into their lives". Not everyone is a fairy tale hero or chiseled adonis. For men to find a partner and not be alone their whole lives, they have to take initiative and actively work to get a woman and family.

The idea that women will just fall into your lap as you sit around doing nothing is more sexist than the reality of life, if anything. You're not "entitled" to a relationship, you have to work and pursue it.

I can't remember reading this story in particular - I've read so many - so I can't speak for it, but dismissing it by saying it's "sexist" because of that line is absolutely ridiculous.

  Set post OOTP AU NonHBP. Harry Potter and Susan Bones. Gritty realism, independent Harry and a believable Voldemort all in a desperate battle to control the fate of the wizarding world. Rating increased to Mature.

*** In my opinion this story goes way overboard the other way, making Harry an overpowered action hero. I mean in the first chapter he shoots and kills an assassin hired by Voldemort. With a gun. Then he starts going to a new magic school that is way better than Hogwarts.

It's basically your average Gary Stu story.

**** Beyond that, the story expects you to assume Harry's Canon character development right up until the assassin arrives, at which point he already knows how to use a gun (how? He watched Vernon teach Dudley about it? Learning to use a handgun effectively takes a lot more than that) and is threatening to cut out the dude's eye immediately. I saw no reason for such a drastic change in Harry.

It's not like that assassin was the first person to try and kill him, so trying to say "He snapped when he realized his life was in danger" doesn't make sense.
