Long please. Not romance centric. I dislike Snape bashing.

Any suggestion most appreciated


** I mean if youre like me, you might enjoy reading more heartbreak while also... being heartbroken. If so! then: linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--- Yet I Live and I Love) And this one isnt long but it is quite funny linkffn(All The Dementors of Azkaban) (Both arent romantic)

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

  AU PoA: When Luna Lovegood is condemned to Azkaban prison for her part in opening the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter is the first to protest. Minister Fudge is reluctant to comply, but then again he never really had a choice in the first place. Oneshot.

*** Isn't heartbreak strictly romantic failures? I've read the first story, and while it's sad, it doesn't have that (I guess the latter doesn't have it either since the OP asked for no-romance, but I haven't read it). English isn't my main language.

**** I mean i guess i dont take ‚Äòheartbreak' that literally for the story but rather to what i feel when reading it. Depends on the person ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".
