Please /no/ *crossovers*! (or *fem*!*Harry*, I have nothing against her but I feel weird reading them)

Any would do but prefer if they fit at least one of the prompts listed:

- *MOD!/Immortal/OP/etc.* Harry.
- Harry Potter = *Salazar Slytherin* (Is literally him/in Slytherin house).
- Harry has a *companion/pet/friend* - like a *snake, lethifold, etc.*
- *Tomarry (slash)* fanfictions.
- *Time travel* fanfictions (past to future or vice versa).
- *Creature!* Harry (ex. Basilisk, Pheonix, etc.).
- *AU travelling* (going from one reality to another, like 'I'm Still Here').
- *Femboy!* Harry because why not?
- Harry is a *redhead* like his deary ol'(and dead) mum.
- *Other House!* Harry.
- */+Smut/mature's+/* /+fine too.+/
- *Chill!* Harry doesn't give a +fvck+ about everything.
- *Smart!* Harry because i want to feel very smart too.
- *Other-person-raised-the-little-boy!* Harry (ex. Grindelwald, Greyback, Salazar, Voldemort, you get it).
- *Sane!* Tom because why not.
- *Sadistic!* Tom because yes.
- */+Horny/kinky+/* /+Tom yes pls+/
- *Rebirth* *AU* (like Again and Again, Full Circle, etc.)

I'd prefer the fanfiction to have at least *5 chapters* or at least *15,000* (I don't know) or so *words*.

*New tropes* are welcome, but these are the type of fanfictions I /mostly/ read (at this time).
