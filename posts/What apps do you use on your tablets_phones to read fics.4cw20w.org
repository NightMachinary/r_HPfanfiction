Currently, I'm using [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qan.fiction&hl=en][Codex Fanfiction Reader]] on my Nexus 7, but I've been thinking about changing my tablet to an iPad. What apps work best for you?

** I use Chrome for standard reading on FFN.net (who needs the app right?), but I use Aldiko for all my .epub, .mobi etc needs.

*** One of the reasons I use Codex is so it'll download the whole frickin' thing so I can read it offline.

*** I use the Chrome Extension Clearly when I read online. It can filter out ads in pages, and also formats text really well.

** On my iPhone I use pocket fiction. It's pretty basic with some flaws but it gets the job done. I'm just happy I can access so much when I'm offline; it saved me during my last flight when I forgot to download any entertainment Edit: you can't search for fics with it but you can save all of the stories you've found from different sites to it

****** It will just remember. Sometimes if you flip the pages too fast (as in flipping through without pausing to get to your "place") it struggles to remember. I always make sure to let the page number fade out before flipping again. It only remembers where you were at in the app

** Ibooks. Ao3 has epub download and for ffn.net I just use ficsave to convert to epub and save to the app. It has scrolling and turn page options and you can change the backround color. Plus bookmark options, highlighting, etc.

** Lately I've been using the official fanfiction.net app, but other than that, moon+ reader. It has a brilliant auto-scroll function that I would use when I was at the gym.

I use my kindle a lot more than my phone to read, though, and I usually have both with me.

** I use the moon+ reader, non-pro version. If you're getting an iOS device, I believe they support .epub formats. I use [[http://ficsave.com/][FicSave]] to download files. If I want them on my kindle, I set the format to .mobi and email it to my kindle's email address.

** I used to use iBooks, but once I started reading more than an hour daily, I got a kindle which I use now. Changed my life. I don't recommend the iPad unless it's the small version; it's pretty heavy.

** I use Readup Pro.

It allows me to download for offline reading, it has a script to update downloaded fics, it can import your favorited/followed stories, and it has a built-in tts function which for me is huge since 90% of my reading is done while driving at work.

On the downsides it's ffn only, the update script takes a while, the app can sometimes cache out while running in the background causing tts to stop, and the the can't be paused by Bluetooth control.

If anyone has any app recommendations for other sites that include tts and offline viewing I'm more than open to checking them out.
