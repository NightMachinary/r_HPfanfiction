Looking for a something (complete or updated regularly) where harry is told that he is a wizard after age 11 so he isn't coming into that world as a child and most likely as a jaded late teen/adult. Thanks


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344][Grey Space]] linkao3(12424344) - Hogwarts starts at 14, so Harry doesn't find out about magic until then. Gen, complete.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  Just before her eleventh birthday, Violet Potter disappeared from the wizarding world's watchful gaze. When she was eighteen they found her again, but not the hero they were hoping for. Having spent most of her teen years in the streets, she now enjoyed the simple pleasures in life. Why save the world if you could just chill and toke? / Fem!Harry/ /Warnings in first chapter.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  Harry Potter, tragic hero, and Hermione Granger, unpopular bookworm, may not know each other at first, but they have one big thing in common: they don't sleep out of fear. Will they learn to overcome their fears or stay awake?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13306212/][*/The Revelation Of Harry Forrester/*]]

Sirius flees with Harry to America, He gets killed by death eaters leaving Harry in a muggle hospital in Boston. Harry gets raised with a musical obsession. He subconsciously integrates his magic into his playing. Due to a charm Sirius put on Harry during the chase he doesn't get discovered by the American magical authorities until he has a big burst of magic during a concert.

Warnings: Mild manipulative (but ACTUALLY well meaning) Dumbledore, Wizarding world bashing. The fic is like half musical theory.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11341620/1/][*/Harry Potter: The-Boy-Who-Is-Missing/*]]

Harry runs away from the dursleys at a young age and lives on the streets. He doesn't get his Hogwarts letter for a few years because the place he found that hides him from Dumbledore's tracking charms also hides him from owls.

  Sirius escapes with Harry after the Potters die. He makes it all the way into the US before Death Eaters catch up to them and he has to abandon Harry. Now Harry is alone. With no name, no history, and no trace. Then, after 13 years, Harry returns to Britain as a very different person. With a completely different view of Magic. A view that breaks everything. H/Hr.

  Harry Potter: the boy-who-lived, the boy-who-ran-away, the boy-who-is-missing, the street urchin, the boy-who-hung-around, the survivor, the boy-who-changed-everything. AU since 31 Oct 1981. Rated T for some language and violence. A HHr story with a poor relationship with Dumbledore.
