** The wizard looked around the city.

"Where am I?" he asked, before shrugging and turning on the spot, disapparating with a crack.

A moment later, he appeared back at his home. "Excellent, just in time for breakfast."

****** It's an option, but it's a risky one - and how successful it is depends entirely on your view of how easy or difficult it is to do wandless magic. People splinch themselves even with a wand, after all.

  Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.

  “There's no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. “The cellar is completely escape proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he's tried everything.”

  It seemed like a routine assignment for CI5 officers Ron Weasley and Harry Potter: Investigate a physicist who had caught the attention of some unsavoury elements. Little did they know that Dr Hermione Granger would turn out to have more secrets than Ron would have thought possible.
