:END:
Hi, I m looking for this fic where Harry had time travelled to the past (Tom Riddle era) and had come back and during the opening feast, Tom Riddle and I think a few of their friends followed him through time. I remember it ends with a story about a rememberall where voldemort was trapped and that only one Tom Riddle became Voldemort and that they made him travel in time to take Tom Riddle's place. I dont know if that rings any bells. Thanks in advance


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite]] ? I know there is a kinda sequel on AO3, T[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/429367][he Fate Changed Now What?]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Tat/pseuds/Krysania][Krysania (Tat)]] (there is also a prequel on ff.Net)

Not sure if these are what you are looking for but I remember in Fates Favorite, Tom and some others come forward in time. I think in the prequel Harry went back and then Tom follows him back.
