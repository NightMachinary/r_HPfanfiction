Hey guys (and girls),

I just noticed againt that I really should keep track of what I am reading because I always seem to forget (ok: Not that surprising after reading fanfictions for over 10 years now, most of them Harry Potter fanfictions)...still, I am looking for something I've read in the past.

In the fanfiction I am looking for Harry helps a group of muggleborn students at Hogwarts to open their own clothing store (which they can't because in this fanfiction the bias against "mudbloods" seems worse than in canon), they are kind of seducing him in order to ask for that favor and he also partially owns the store (in order for it to be protected by having his name attached to it!)

So, stage is yours and thanks in advance guys, you do great work as I've seldom been disapointed by the recommendations I got on this sub-reddit! (I really should make a list of all the stuff I read, so that I can recommend stuff, too...but normally I don't even think about that because I don't even know of a fiction is worth remembering/recommending before reading it all the way through - and when I am done I've forgotten that I should put it on my list and add some tags so that I can tell what it's about at a glance!)

So again: Thank you!

greetings LAX


** linkffn(11669575) he helps a couple half blood girls open a store. But I wouldn't recommend the fic because shortly after that the fics starts to become a power fantasy with harry knowing better than everyone else. he also gets a harem and the chapters become filled with pointless smut

*** I don't know. I think there was a lot of smut in that fic before that. And as far as it becoming a power fantasy, he did get his butt kicked in Egypt and the vampires seem to be manipulating him into something. I would say he is "in the big leagues" but is still pretty ignorant of the other players.

**** Agreed - he's playing with the big boys, but he's not always succeding (which is a good thing)...but he isn't totally outclassed either (which would also be kind of bad...a hero who's constantly smacked around and ignorant is boring (kind of reminds me a little of certain stages of canon where Harry acts plain stupidly, like not using the mirror to talk with Sirius...kind of strange, for an orphan without parents he kind of should have been using that mirror everyday, but he tosses it into his trunk and fucking forgets about it!))

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
