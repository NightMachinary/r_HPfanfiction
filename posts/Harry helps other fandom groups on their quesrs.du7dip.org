Looking for storys where harry helps people on their own quests like helping the fairy tail mages when they're having trouble in fairy tail and such Thanks


** Well, most Avenger fics have that premise, one way or the other. I'll just link a few that have this. From other fandoms as well.

linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlifecrisis; On Punching gods and Absentee Dads; Harry Potter and the Responsability of Ability; Ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece)

linkffn(Wand and Shield; Slowly and then All at Once; By Courage and Love; FILFY Teacher; Invincible; The Archmage of Arda; Post apocaliptic Potter from a parallel universe)

Those are the ones of the top of my head.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.

  Harry Potter has had many titles in his life: Boy-Who-Lived, Auror, Master of the Mystic Arts. But after an assignment in the United States he gains one more, possibly the most important one yet. Avenger. MCU and other Marvel elements. Pairing undecided. Will be a Marvel character though, not a Harry Potter character. No Slash for main pair. Strictly Harry's point-of-view except the rare occasion I think it can add something.
