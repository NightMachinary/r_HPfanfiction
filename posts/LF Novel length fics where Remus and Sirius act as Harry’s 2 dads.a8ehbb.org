** try the boys of crowhill ! it's a long series & starts with Remus being a teacher in Harry's boarding school / boys' home before he goes to Hogwarts. spoilers ofc but by 2nd year ish Sirius & Remus are raising him. it's my favourite series - I love the writing and Harry's relationships with them. linkao3(5418194)

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

*** Has the author said if it will become Drarry?It's something I'm worried about considering it says Harry and Malfoy are friends in the tags.

**** they're not together yet presumably bc they're young but I'm pretty sure they will get together eventually, yes. If it makes any difference at all I generally don't like Draco/Harry but I'm happy w them in this fic bc Draco is a much better person than canon and it seems it'll be very well-planned

*** I came here to request this!

Finished long series, starts way before Hogwarts, runs until the end of the battles (with lots of one shots and spinoffs afterwards and along the way.) I remember the writing quality to be great, and the storytelling to be wonderful.
