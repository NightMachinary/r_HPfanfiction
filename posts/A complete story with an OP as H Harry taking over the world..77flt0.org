As the title suggests, i'm looking for a story with Harry being as overpowered as possible. Doesn't have to be an OP as h*** Harry. He can be just powerful like say Dumbledore or Voldemort level at the least, but the more powerful the better. I also want him to take over the Magical world, and maybe the Muggle world, but he has to at least take over the Magical world. Light, dark, grey any is fine. Also complete if not he has to of at least completed fourth year, and has to be at Dumbledore level of power at the least by that point, and it made clear to us, the reader, that he's at that level of power. That last point is only if it is incomplete otherwise as long as he gets to that point by say end of fifth year if he stays at Hogwarts, and earlier if he doesn't go to Hogwarts. Obviously i'm willing to read stories that aren't keeping in line with my preferences. This is just what I prefer, the closer it comes to my preferences the more I would enjoy it.

Thanks in advance, Warryn.

*** I just don't like posting explicit language on a website, and on a sub on such a website that literal 10yo, and even younger kids use. If they know the word, bully for them, but if they don't than they at least won't learn it from me. I would also ask if you edit or delete your comment, because I don't want to be the reason a kid learns such a word.

***** Yes I could do that, but i'm not a child, and it get's the meaning across more effectively. It's like asking why t.v. Shows are censored, it's not because they don't use the language themselves, it's because they don't want children to learn such words, because of them. That's why I censor any swear words I use. If you understandit than you'll get it. If you don't than at least I won't be the reason you learn it.

****** Yeah, and I think it's silly. Asterisking or bleeping out swear words is just calling attention to your bad language. My take on it is that if you're REALLY that concerned about the children (who aren't even supposed to be on reddit, but you know, whatever) then don't use the swear words at all. Trust me, the kids KNOW the swear words, so if you are afraid of them imitating you, then set a good example and avoid swearing altogether.

But if you're going to swear, then at least commit to it. Don't try to play both sides. Either use the cuss words, or don't.

******* That's your opinion. The point of censoring it is that only the people who know it will understand it. If they don't know it they at least won't get it from me. You'll understand this better if you had children like me. For example around them I don't say f*** I say fudge. If you don't like it that's your choice, but i'm going to keep doing it. If you don't like it then the answer is quite simple, stop reading or replying to my post. A random person over the internet isn't going to change how I was raised nor how I raise my kids, and I know that my kids aren't on here, but that's how I was raised as well so sorry, but if you don't like it than the back button is up in the upper left corner of this page.

No. You seem to be under the mosconception that I care about this. Well i'm sorry, but I don't apart from the whole trying to get through to you that I don't care, and that you're arguing over something so pointless as a swear word. I mean really, all i'm doing is a business course which doesn't leave much room for a life, but I still have time to answer usless comment's, and questions. After this i'm no longer answering you, because to be honest I still have some work I have to get through, and what you're doing is really indicative of how bored you must be so find your entertainment elsewhere, because for the last time. If you don't like it, don't read it. Not that difficult, nor should it be to difficult to do.

*********** Since I was still here answering anothering question i'll answer yours, because that is a valid question. To your question the answer is no. I'm not asking for you to agree with me or not, i'm just asking that you respect that others have different viewpoints than you, and that if you can't accept that to not bother, because all that will accomplish is nothing. If you can't change someones mind, and you know this(which I should hope you do now) all you are doing at this point is harrasment. So please just accept that other people have different viewpoints, and do something that will affect you positively instead, because when it comes down to it we are two random people on the internet.

************ This is, at least nominally, supposed to be a place for discussions, and discussions don't always involve everyone agreeing with one another.

It's not harrassment to disagree with someone. I stated my opinion on the matter, which happened to be different than yours. If I'd started calling you names or started using swear words just because I knew you didn't like them, then you could have made a case for this being harassment -- but I wasn't.

I stated my opinion, I stated WHY I thought as I did, and -- I will admit it -- I expressed some amazement at your extremely condescending tone. If you think this is harassment, then you have a very different definition of the word than I do.

Responding with passive-aggressive insults REALLY isn't very constructive.

************* Sorry had to reply to this. Yes this is a place for discussions, and you are supposed to discuss on the topic at hand. You are doing neither of these. You are berating my viewpoints, and being somewhat condescending about it. Yes you stated your opinion multiple times, and I have heard, and explained my reasoning, and you still continue to argue with me, and the point. If you have nothing constructive to say about the original post, and if you are just going to continue arguing, all you are doing is proving my point. The only reason I could have a condescending tone is that all you are doing is arguing. Literally that's it. Do you know me. No. Do I know you. No. So please if you have nothing constructive to say about the OP, don't say anything at all.

Also i've been pretty polite, all things considered. Just because you think it's silly doesn't mean I do. It's a point of view. It's how I was raised. You calling it "silly" is quite rude considering these were values my parents bought me up with. So yes I could call this harrasment since this is the act of systematic and/or continued unwanted and annoying actions of one party or a group. Continuing on would be classed, by leagal meaning, as harrasment.

************** Let's see... if we go by the legal reason, "harassment," is defined as "any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress."

Which is not what I'm doing. What I'm doing is trying to tell you that I don't appreciate being condescended to or insulted. Because, I'm sorry, but you have NOT been polite, and since you seemed like a fairly reasonable and intelligent individual otherwise, it was my hope that perhaps you'd understand that you were being rude and condescending.

It started well enough. I made a suggestion, you said that you didn't like the suggestion and made the comparison to TV shows bleeping out swear words. I stated why I didn't like this idea -- maybe I didn't word it delicately enough, or maybe I implied that I thought less of you for it -- in which case I do apologise as this was never my intention.

But at the time I was purely expressing an opinion, trying to explain why I thought so, and opening for further discussion as I'm always interested in hearing what other people have to say even if I may not agree with them.

Yes, I got a little snappish when you responded in a condescending matter, and even more when you began pouring on with the "look-how-morally-superior-I-am-to-you." So I responded to let you know that I don't appreciate being talked to that way.

I'm sorry, but when someone goes all passive-aggressive on me and are two steps away from telling me to "get a life," then it's not in my nature to just shut up and take it like a good little girl. Do I know you? No, but that doesn't mean I have to take your insults. Nor does it mean that me telling you this constitutes harassment.

You post something online, people are going to disagree, because humans have different opinions on just about anything. Claiming harassment just because I disagree with you, that's stretching it.

Now, if you don't mind, that's all I had to say.

**** Hell isn't an explicit language. It's a "place regarded in various religions as a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death."

Yes, it can be used as a swear word, but only when used to emphasis or express anger or surprise. Which wasn't your case here.
