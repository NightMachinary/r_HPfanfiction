I've only found four fics like that:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4594383/1/A-Mistake-Made-Twice][A Mistake Made Twice]] by Dragon0Rose-07
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8317364/1/The-Founders-Four][The Founders Four]] by parihpfan
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4175330/1/The-Founders-Four][The Founders Four]] by JadeofMara
- and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2697767/2/Founders-Heirs][Founders' Heirs]] by fhrulz21

The last three are fics where they travel to a different universe where their families are alive and that's kinda what I'm looking for, but if they're in their own universe, then that's fine.

Thanks!


** I've been working on one, it's not completed, but I'm trying to update it when I can.

****** Will do! I've already got about 7,800 words done for the actual chapters with and additional 4,500 words in scenes that may or may not be added in. I've just got to finish the first chapter.

On the other hand, if you would like to check out my other work (shameless self-promo there), I have begun posting a fic where Harry and Theo (who are Auror partners) are sent back in time. I feel like I made it pretty different than a lot of time travel and fix-it fics so far. Let me know if you'd like to read it and I'll link it.

****** Here you go! It's only the prologue and the first chapter, but it's nearly ten thousand words long. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28257909/chapters/69246993]]
