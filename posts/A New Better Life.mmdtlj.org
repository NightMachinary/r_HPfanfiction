Do you like a good but fallible Dumbledore? A powerful but not overpowered Harry? A story that doesn't depend on ships? A story that follows canon but in a unique and original way? Good grammar? A family friendly story with action? A story that is under the radar and a author that deserves more reads?

If so give it a chance. Year 1 is done and Year 2 is on the way.

Highly recommend.


** oh Hey all, this is actually my story. Linkffn(A New Better Life). The guy above me is pretty crazy, and left me tons of reviews and just gave me a ton of compliments. I don't know if Im deserving off all of them but what can you do. I hope you guys enjoy the story if you choose to read

  A re-imagining of Harry's life where he applies himself a little bit more, works a little harder, and gets closer to more people than just Ron and Hermione. Smartish!Harry, Grey!Harry, OP!Harry Good!Dumbledore, Mentor!Dumbeldore Rival!Draco
