I read this a loooooong time ago, so it was potentially on LJ rather than one of the archives. Have no idea the pairing (if there was one), or even the general plot of the story. Quite possibly written during the Three Year Summer before OOtP.

There's a group of the kids, more than just the trio. I think they're trying to break into a fortress, possibly Malfoy Manor, but definitely Voldie's stronghold. They are going in through a tunnel. One of the obstacles they have to overcome is a quintaped guarding a door the tunnel.

When they get to the end, there is a potion brewing. (Possibly an alternate GoF where this is the resurrection potion?) Snape is on their side but I don't remember if he was with them through the tunnel, or only at the end with the potion.

The main point that I remember is that Snape tells Neville to go stand next to the cauldron. He does, and the potion ends up either exploding or spilled. Snape later explains that he knew that would happen because potions always go wrong around Neville.
