*Edit: Someone pointed out that the chapter I just wrote had a lot of overdone tropes in it (specifically the "Slytherins are victims" trope and those similar to it), and while I pride myself on using a bunch of cliche tropes and making them original and unique, I am acknowledging the fact that the chapter I just posted is* */not that/*. *I'm going to be tearing out those parts that are generic (a good third of the chapter) and I'm going to be rewriting them so that they hopefully fit. I'll make another edit when I post the new chapter.*

*Edit 2: I've removed the bad scenes and I've added the new ones!*

It's a fic where Harry Potter and Theodore Nott are Auror partners three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and during an investigation of a criminal coven of witches and wizards, are sent back in time to their eleven-year-old bodies by an old Egyptian ritual. They decide to try and save as many people as possible while researching the ritual that sent them back in time and they change things up along the way; starting with Harry being Sorted in Slytherin.

My thoughts on the new chapter (spoilers!):

In this chapter, Harry begins to see the difference between how Gryffindor handles new students and introducing them to Hogwarts vs how Slytherin handles those things. In the first book, Rowling doesn't have the Prefects give the first years any sort of speech or anything. Which is completely fine since they're all exhausted, but I thought that while it's rather cliche and overdone in time travel fics, that the Slytherin first years would get a speech from Snape and the Prefects.

They're basically warned about how, as Slytherins, they'll be looked down upon by the other Houses, specifically the older years. I also have them warn them about the older Gryffindors, which definitely put into perspective for Harry how different things are going to be. He is rightfully shocked that they feel the need to warn them to stick together in the halls and to beware of the Gryffindors. As a Gryffindor, he didn't have to worry about being picked on in the halls until much later in the books (the dragon fiasco where he---and others---lose Gryffindor 150 points).

I also decided to go with another cliche (surprise! not) about how Snape has all of the students have check-ups. Harry's not really going to be outed as "abused" because that would put more spotlight on him than he already needs, but his results will lay down some groundwork for future chapters. He's somewhat healthy since he's been eating healthy and has been working out for two months, but he still has old injuries and that parasitic ward that he's been dealing with in the Dursleys (mentioned in chapter three).

I also touched a bit on Harry's---and Theo's---mental healthy but I don't think I did it well. I'm trying to get a good balance between magic, plot, and mental health in this fic and I think I'm overdoing it a bit. I'm going to try and let up on the "magic coiling" thing, but I also want to try and touch on their mental health better. I personally do not have the same mental health issues that Harry and Theo have, but I will try my best to make their issues authentic.

While I'm on the topic of mental health, I am really starting to love that I gave Harry what someone in the comments called a "therapy dog." I hadn't originally thought of her that way since Mischief originated as a way for me to show off Harry's spellcrafting/magic skills and stuff, and then I came up with a future plot detail for her, but I love the fact that she's going to be proactive in the fic as Harry's comfort blanket, so to speak. It's a unique idea that I love and I'm looking forward to writing more of her in the future, especially during third year. Could you imagine Lupin's reaction to her?

Also, I really like the last line of the chapter, what about you?

This fic includes all of that tropey and cliche stuff in (hopefully) inventive ways. Those tropes and cliches (amongst other stuff) include:

- /Fix it!/ As few people die as possible!
- /Slytherin!Harry/. Harry's not suited for Gryffindor anymore, though he could've been in Ravenclaw. He'll be using the politics of Slytherin (favours and allies) to his advantage this time around.
- /Powerful!Intelligent!Independent!Harry./ Harry's got some new tricks up his sleeves, including and not limited to: spellcrafting, warding, and curse-breaking!
- /Lordships!/ Yes, Harry is the heir to two Most Ancient and Noble Houses (Potter and Black), but gone is "extremely powerful, bow down bitches" cliche. Harry, like many other children in Slytherin, is simply only the heir of those two Houses and he doesn't have ridiculous power due to that. The Lordships are only titles for those who have seats on the Wizengamot (though many of the older families were appointed by King Arthur and Merlin themselves) and they only have the political power due to their family. Meaning Harry has to deal with the stigma of the Blacks and the fact that the Potters hadn't been in the game for decades. It's a good thing that being the Vanquisher of Voldemort, aka the Boy-Who-Lived, gives him some political power to work with! Though, a lot of people will seek Harry as an ally because he'll have more votes than others in the Wizengamot, meaning that if someone wants a bill passed, they should get on his side to get him to back them up.
- /Grey/Dark!Harry./ Harry's not evil, Merlin no, but he certainly isn't the "Light Golden Boy" anymore! He's killed and tortured and he's practising darker, sometimes illegal magic! And let's not forget the fact that even though he was an Auror, he lived in a house full of Dark history and secrets; including a secret library! And some other stuff I mentioned earlier in the fic but I'll leave that to you to read.
- /PTSD and Abuse./ So, I might have dialled the abuse up just a bit? It's still pretty canon. The abuse is only mentioned in the fic (meaning no scenes where Vernon violently belts Harry), but Harry does experience some anxiety and panic due to his cupboard. The starvation thing is something I'll be touching on a bit as well as Harry dissociating (see if you can spot the mention of that one). I've also apparently given Harry a service/therapy dog on accident, so that's cute.
- /Canon Compliant/ */and/* /Divergent./ As this fic takes place after the books, it's safe to say that anything you read in the books is canon in my fic. It'll stay that way for most of the major plot points (Basilisk on the loose, Sirius breaking out, Goblet of Fire, Dementor attack, etc.) until after fourth year where the changes kick-off. The magic system I use is pretty fanon, such as magical "cores" existing and the Trace acting differently.
- /Epilogue, What Epilogue?/ I might have taken a few tidbits out of the epilogue (mainly about Harry being an Auror), but Harry never got married to Ginny nor did he have children.
- /Cursed Child nods./ I am mainly ignoring anything that was written in the Cursed Child (mostly because I've never read it), though I did add a few tidbits from the character wikis into the fic. This includes Harry still being a Parselmouth after he got the Horcrux removed and Theo messing around with time turners.
- /Bashing./ My bashing is completely/almost based on canon events/personalities/characteristics. Hermione is a bit insufferable and rude at the beginning ("Are you sure that's a /real/ spell?") and she's a bit closed-minded towards wizarding customs and traditions, Ron's */not/* a prejudiced prat who spits vitriol furiously at the sight of a Slytherin but he will get jealous of Harry during the Goblet of Fire, Molly Weasley will be bashed slightly on the fact that she took over Sirius's house and cleaned it out and threw shit away (like, you could have /sold/ all that stuff, and not to mention the books!) but that's all (and the fact that she's an overbearing, presumptuous person), Sirius and Remus will be touched a bit on their flaws, and some of Dumbledore's manipulations will be mentioned but Harry's not going to be super pissed at him. Oh, and the Dursleys, but that's a given.
- /Harry Potter/Theodore Nott/. I absolutely love this relationship. The fanon version of Theo has so much in common with Harry and I feel like they would just click. There's also the bonus that Theo's a pretty undiscovered character so I can describe him/characterize him however I like. It's also a nice difference to Harry/Draco fics, where Theo is still Dark but he's less well-known than Draco and he can sympathize more than Draco.

Feel free to ask me any questions about the fic or if you want more of an explanation on something I've mentioned above!


** Well I have to say i'm intrigued. and I can't wait for more I would like to ask are you gonna have abused kids from other houses beside Slytherin?...maybe have the students go to Snape. I liked to see reactions from the teachers when they find out their own students went to Snape instead of them. But again like I said you have me intrigued and I can't wait for moreü§©üòç

*** I suppose that there are abused kids in all Houses, but it's kinda unlikely that I'll feature them. Snape insists on his students going to Madam Pomfrey for checkups because it's most likely that students in his House are abused because they'd be used to hiding it and they'd have Slytherin traits due to their upbringing. Snape himself was an abused Slytherin and so he knows what it's like.

As most students see Snape as a surly bully, it'd be extremely unlikely to anyone who isn't a friend with a Slytherin to see Snape as a helpful adult, and maybe not even then. Harry's not really going to interact with abused characters much since he's going to be hiding his own abuse. I'm also not going to be featuring Madam Pomfrey or Snape dealing with abused students since the point of view of my fic is third-person limited on Harry.

I guess I'll go into the abuse much further along the line and that would only be when Umbridge shows up.

The only abused character that Harry will actively interact with is Theo, though there may be others, like Neville.

Hope this answers your question!

***** Aw no don't be upset, it's such a minor gripe and I probably only noticed because I read far too much Slytherin!Harry fanfics and I've seen the trope too often lol. The Slytherin court is also quite a trope but I'm interested to see how you play it. I'll forgive you your tropes as long as you don't include the phrase ‚Äúpureblood mask‚Äù to refer to Slytherins hiding their emotions lol.

But while you're taking criticism- the whole ‚ÄòHermione isn't respectful of wizarding traditions' trope often turns into a ‚Äòthe reason Muggleborns are discriminated against is because they're not respectful of wizarding customs' trope which is victim-blamey and rather bigoted and I think you're going down that road. For one, what customs? The wizarding world has no customs (apart from robes, which Hermione wears without complaint) so then the author generally makes things customs like ‚Äúwizards used to celebrate Samhain but Muggleborns complained and forced the school to celebrate Halloween‚Äù (because Muggleborns definitely have the political power to do that in wizarding society, sure) and it's literally the author making up excuses for why the racists of the story are in the right.

But I'll definitely read it because I love Theodore Nott fics, I have no clue why (I lie: it's the name. Theo is a sexy name and nothing can change my mind). He has so much potential because he's mysterious in canon: a pureblood but not an actively mentioned bully, a loner, can see Thestrals. This fic reminds me of Lomonaaren's great Harry/Theo fics, keep up the good work :D

****** Eh. I wasn't really satisfied with it while writing it but I ignored that in favour of getting a chapter posted faster.

I'll definitely consider a way to even out the whole victim-blaming thing. I plan to add a lot of culture to Wizarding Britain because they were lacking that in the books (seriously, why the hell do they celebrate CHRISTIAN holidays?) and I do mention Hermione not really respecting some aspects of wizarding tradition, but I plan to rectify that, as well. She was only really focused on the surface-level stuff (other than the blatant slavery, I mean) and she'll eventually become more informed. Plus, I'm also going to be pointing the finger at the purebloods. A lot of them don't respect Muggleborns for their ignorant attitude but they don't realize that Muggleborns don't know any different and that there aren't really any books on wizarding traditions---good ones, at least. I'm also going to be doing a lot of political shit on why Hogwarts celebrates Muggle holidays and some other stuff, so I hope it doesn't appear as if I'm making up excuses for racists. :/

I also love Lomonaaren's fics!

Also, I've already cut and rewritten the scenes, lol.

You know, just how so many real-life groups form toxic cultures - see Hazing etc. - that perpetuate abuse.

There's a reason so many of them enthusiastically joined Voldemort and never did anything against Draco and Co., and "it's (partially) the Gryffindors' fault" is victim blaming, in my opinion.

**** I really like the plot of the fan fiction

Usually fan fictions are a load of unrealistic crap, but this one actually sounds really good!

Like, perhaps, this plot would be a worthy sequel to the Harry Potter series as opposed to the cursed child

But anything's better than the cursed child tbf üòÇ

***** Thank you so much! I love the time travel fix-it trope/cliche, but a lot of them get really repetetive. Like that "you've read one of them you've read them all" bullcrap and stuff. And, well, I wanted to write my own version, but instead of adhering to all of the terrible cliches, I decided to make it unique and original, and a lot of people seemed to have loved it so far!

That's actually something that makes my fic more read or whatever, too. Tropes are tropes for a reason and that's because people like reading them and so they try to read as many as possible, but it eventually gets cliche because it's overdone or bad. So, I decided to hop on the trope train but I made it unique and original, which is why I feel like people like my fic. I actually did that with my original book that I posted online, too, and it got really popular for the same reasons, lol. So it's a tried and true method.

I'm glad that you think my fic is interesting and that it caught your eye! And I'm completely flattered that you think that it's worthy to be a sequel of Harry Potter, lol. And yes, anything's better than the Cursed Child. üòÇ

*** Okay, so, I just wanted to let you know that I'm rewriting a good third of the chapter I just posted because I made it "generic" and I don't want it to be that so I'm taking out all of the parts about "Slytherins sticking together" and the health check (because that idea lends nothing to my plot) and the "Gryffindors are bullies" stuff.

*** I'm glad you're enjoying it! I can agree with you that the chapter's too short, the last few chapters were short, as well (I'm considering smushing chapters six and seven together, or maybe seven and eight), but it's in my average chapter length (it's 4,414 words long, though most of my chapters do average around 5,000) so I thought it was a good place to stop. I would have preferred to add some more, but there wasn't much to complete the scene. I might end up combining two chapters together.
