Suggest some active fics that you're keenly following. A fic whose new chapters you try to read as soon as they come out.

They must be regularly updating, i.e. at least once every two weeks.


** Why sure, I've got a ton of fics that I can't /wait/ to read the next chapter of!

** *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): my favorite WIP fic. It's a significant improvement over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] previous work *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, which also features the theme of Muggleborn resistance/uprising. The plot, characterizations, writing quality, and realism are much better. I especially like the fact there are good and evil people on both sides of the conflict, and that all sides do try to act intelligently. The author updates every Saturday.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

For others: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]], like many fics by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]] is a stand out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136762/1/The-Case-of-the-Man-Who-Was-Wanted][The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted]] has started updating in a semi regular fashion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11527977/1/Lord-of-Time][Lord of Time]] which is not everyone's cup of tea, being HP/TMR, still very regular updates. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4177266][The Consequences of A Binding Ritual]] is a super slow HP/TMR romance.

*** I tried reading this and it became draggy near the middle. The writing is excellent; however, the energy of the first few chapters didn't transfer properly to he succeeding chapters. It is a good premise: Potter not being okay after the Dursleys (like Brutal Harry). However, the execution is lacking.

***** I dunno. I like it specifically because it's unrepentantly psychopathic Harry. There's no "the power of love will soothe the evil within" cliche, and no, "friends reel him in and suddenly all he wants is to be normal". It's just pure insane Harry. He is broken and what they were trying to do to "fix" him failed because none of them understood just how deep his issues ran. Harry Potter in that fic is the villain, and the author makes no attempt to change or hide that, unlike other "darkinsaneevil!Harry" fics where "he's the bad guy, but he's not a bad guy, honest. Sure he tortures people but he's really just a nice person inside!"

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL.

#+begin_quote
  The Founders have spent the last fifty years separated and drifting, but with Voldemort rising, they're headed back to Hogwarts once more. Between a wary Golden Trio, Umbridge, and Voldemort's shadowy plans, there's little time to deal with their own problems, even though Godric knows it's tearing the four of them apart---maybe even irreparably.

** linkffn(12048619), Vance McGill is pumping out chapters constantly on this one and I've enjoyed it so far. I've been following linkffn(11898648) as well, though I'm not sure how I feel about the territory it seems to be heading into.

** Well, "actively updating" might be the wrong word for it, since the last few chapters will be posted this week, but I'm very keenly following linkffn(11125620) right now.

It's book 7, however, so you'd want to start with linkffn(8417562) but there's enough written to last about a week of solid reading.

#+begin_quote
  Book 7 of 7, sequel to "Albus Potter and the Chaos Contagion." Definitely WILL be finished before the end of summer 2016! (Read all previous installments first!) The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Albus discovers there is a very fine line between power and madness, a very blurry line between right and wrong, and no line at all between our world and the Abyssal Vortex.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series definitely to be concluded in summer 2016!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
