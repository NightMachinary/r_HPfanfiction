It's been SOOOO long since I've sat myself down and reread the books, I realize I've been stuck around fanon so much I have no sense of what actual canon Harry Potter is capable of.

And I'm trying to write a fic where Harry is just Harry and isn't power-tripping or the Master of Death or whatnot. But you know, if he can maybe pop off ONE wandless spell or shoot a spell without the incantation, that'd give me an idea on where the “ceiling” is.

Can ya help a pal out?


** I can't remember any wandless spells performed by Harry beyond stuff that was accidental magic. Canonically, Harry was able to use lumos without actually touching his wand in OotP (when the Dementors were going after him and Dudley).

*** Honestly, that's good enough? I mean, Harry isn't the shittiest wizard, but it's not like he's exceptionally talented either. I figured he'd be able to do maybe ONE spell without bothering to need a wand. Maybe in the heat of the moment (that's just seems to align with him, since he's always running on adrenaline, and that can give people clarity), but nothing fancy.

**** Yeah, as much as enjoy BAMF!Harry fics, Canon!Harry wasn't shown to be a particularly exceptional wizard besides his Grade AAA plot armor.

That said, Harry is the /only/ person in canon shown to be able to use his wand remotely. I had a lot of fun reading Draco664's Apprentice Potter because it exploited that detail to the max.

***** Personally, Harry's talents include: lithe athletic build for Quidditch/very good with brooms, very good at the very difficult Patronus charm, can use his wand remotely, can see Threstrals, sarcastic quips, reasonably kind, and sort-of street smarts? Like, to me Harry's kinda scrappy. He had to be if he was gonna survive his shitty pre-hogwarts childhood. And how he gets through a lot of his wild encounters is a mixture of friendship, sheer dumb luck, and being a scrappy sassy kid.

That's it. That's Harry Potter.

****** Have you seen the animated series Legend of Korra? There's a skill called bloodbending where waterbenders are able to literally control the bodies of their adversaries. However this skill is very difficult and even the strongest waterbenders need a full moon to be able to pull this off successfully.

And yet there's a person who is able to bloodbend whenever he wants. But in all other regards, he's just a slightly above average waterbender, nothing special.

I sometimes think Harry is like that. He has a natural affinity to cast an exceptionally powerful patronus charm. The rest is luck, love, mum, hard work and plot armor and not him being the second coming of Merlin.

In regards to the criticism, as a Korra fan I think his points were valid and accurate for the most part. There were only a few things I disagree with, and I would have to rewatch the series in order to actually refute them or see if they're accurate. And it's hard for me to actually sit down and watch a tv show, so I won't say that they definitely are inaccurate.

When harry and co go on their horcrux hunt/stupid idea camping trip they are not practicing or leaning a lot of new shit. So you might want to take that into account and or have them not be dumb and practice or not be dumb and live in a house somewhere rather than a tent for no reason at all.

***** LOL, I understand what you're getting at. I'm writing a crossover. Through a series of unfortunate and accidental events, Harry's on his lonesome with nothing but his old wand, the sword of gryffindor, and Hermione's handbag (which might as well be called a Bag of Holding, it can hold so much shit). Seeing as Harry on his own can either be A) reasonably capable or B) an impulsive idiot teenager, I just wanted to figure out how much trouble Harry could get into depending on how much he can actually do. It's been so long since I read the books, I was uncertain just where his actual "power/skill threshold" is.

From the answers I'm getting, the fanciest thing he's done is cast Lumos remotely. So really, Harry's gonna be pretty average/close to canon in terms of ability.

** I read some of the comments that aresaying he did cast anything without words, but I thought he did in the bank in DH. Maybe he whispered but he certainly wasn't heard.

As far as uber powerful, the DADA OWL tester was impressed by his patronus. That's not saying much necessarily, but he was able to chase off how many dementors as a third year? Also, when he's wand connected to Voldemort's in 4th year... well, surely that wasn't easy to hold steady?

My thoughts are everyone has the potential to be as powerful as Dumbledore, Grindlewald, and Voldemort. The difference being practise and perseverance. However, like all talents, some find the talent easier than others. Normally, Harry doesn't show that potential... until he gets freaked out.

*** Much like John Watson in the Sherlock series, Harry Potter is, in my mind, an adrenaline junkie. Not on purpose; but because he's always been in mortal danger since, what, eleven? He's got to now have that sort of adrenaline-panic-clarity that soldiers get when in the heat of battle.

I agree; when Harry's in a tight spot or freaked out, he gets impressive. But I think that's from unfortunate conditioning, the side-effect of being someone perpetually put into dangerous situations and forced to SURVIVE.

Thinking of HP characters (Shaggy and Scooby not included), a person's survivability isn't brought up much. Snape is my favorite character (I reference my former military life if anyone wants to bitch at me for it) and his spying ability is very much a survivor's trait. I'm glad Harry announces that to Voldemort. I think Neville and Luna show a great talent for surviving as well, but if a different sort. What do you think?

I wish the Trio could have taken a nature survivalist with them in DH though. Shooting a rabbit is not that hard boys, c'mon! Maybe if they knew how good Bambi and Thumper tasted they would have done a bit better. That reminds me, I wonder if my ex's dad would give me his recipe for hossenfefor (spelling in English is hard enough, German is damn near impossible).

********* I think most of the DA have a certain kind of "young kid survivability." Like, they go out of their way to disobey the rules of Umbridge to actually prepare themselves for conflict. Neville goes from awkward kid to a very capable, fight-me kid. Ginny, who I already thought was a bit of a survivor because /having that many brothers requires a special set of skills/, flourishes. Luna's quirky intuition (and possible low-key Seer abilities? There's /something/ to her) and general talent was honed and polished in the DA.

Scrappy Harry Potter turned a bunch of random kids into equally scrappy survivors. Snape is also something of a favorite of mine; While flawed, he was undeniably a survivor. I mean, look at their generation. It was really impacted and terrorized by Voldemort's first "campaign." Snape had, in a very Slytherin fashion, considered the situation (which was dire) and decided to pick what seemed to be the most reasonable answer. Playing both sides gave him a unique perspective and a certain level of immunity. While everyone else was playing checkers, Snape was playing /Chess/. And I have to admire that?

Maybe some wizards use rune based magic circles and others use chant based spells. Maybe japan or china has a completely different way of casting magic compared to Britain.

** I read some of the comments that aresaying he did cast anything without words, but I thought he did in the bank in DH. Maybe he whispered but he certainly wasn't heard.

As far as uber powerful, the DADA OWL tester was impressed by his patronus. That's not saying much necessarily, but he was able to chase off how many dementors as a third year? Also, when he's wand connected to Voldemort's in 4th year... well, surely that wasn't easy to hold steady?

My thoughts are everyone has the potential to be as powerful as Dumbledore, Grindlewald, and Voldemort. The difference being practise and perseverance. However, like all talents, some find the talent easier than others. Normally, Harry doesn't show that potential... until he gets freaked out.

*** He learned nonverbal casting along with his peers in his NEWT classes, but actually using nonverbal casting day to day or in the middle of combat is a different matter. Even Hermione, who was the first to learn it in class (as expected), was pretty hit-and-miss with it in DH.

IMO, Harry's Patronus is a consequence of his personality first and foremost. Casting a Patronus in a comfortable setting is not that difficult, as we see in OotP; but casting one in the face of a Dementor is difficult, because Dementors drain the very feelings that are needed to cast one. So, someone more pensive like Hermione, say, has trouble summoning the sort of pure happiness needed---because how can she be truly happy in a world where slavery is approved even by the "good guys", wealth and influence matter more than justice, and people leave their homework to the last minute unless you pester them about it? Whereas, Harry can push all that aside and just /feel/. Priori Incantanem is somewhat similar.

More generally, I think that everyone's magic is integrated with their personality and non-magical talents. Lockhart is obsessed with how people see him, so his magic gives him a precise Memory Charm and perhaps cosmetic magics, but is otherwise useless. Harry's emotions-on-his-sleeve personality gives him a powerful Patronus but also cripples his Occlumency and makes him impulsive. Bellatrix's sadism gives her a powerful Cruciatus, but it makes her resort to torture when other methods of interrogation---such as Legilimency---might have been more effective.

He killed a basilisk at 12 with a sword and a bird, and he defeated Voldemort before he was 18. I'd say he's pretty powerful. He's even considered Voldemort's equal in the prophecy. Though he doesn't know enough magic yet, or has he reached his true potential in canon. Harry is powerful, and with proper training (not the substandard teaching they provide at Hogwarts) and more confidence in his abilities and in himself, Harry would be just as powerful as Voldemort much earlier on.

** My take is this... Harry is never presented as being anything other than within the bounds of normality, except in (a) Quidditch and (b) the Patronus Charm. So, when we see that Harry's very good at DADA it's not in the same way that Snape is very good at potions... he isn't some kind of savant/prodigy, just very talented.

So... the question is when your fic is set.

If you're taking a post-canon approach, I think it's entirely fair to expect Harry to brew reasonably difficult potions, perform non-verbal magic routinely (even if he struggled with it at school), possess good reflexes & instincts and just generally do what we see any adult wizard in canon that is not presented as being "exceptional" without too much trouble. OTOH Harry doesn't show any particular inclination towards some of the more practical kinds of household magic so in that respect I'd follow Tonks' example from OOTP.

** I think in OotP he shouted out Lumos to find his wand in a panic because it wasn't in his hand. Which is technically wandless magic. As for wordless I'm pretty sure most adult wizards can cast basic charms or charms they use most frequently in everyday life wordlessly. Example being Wingardium Leviosa or summoning and or banishing spells. Anything that would be reflexive magic or you do it so often you just don't think about it.

The only comparison I can think of is as an Adult we don't have to think about how to hold a cup of water and to drink the water. We know how much it's going to weigh in our hands, how to twist your hand just right to bring it to you if your laying down and still keep the cup upright. How far back to tilt the cup to drink from it without overspilling. How much force you need to set it down again. But a small child learning how to drink from a cup might spill just bring the cup up to drink from. All because we've learned these Motor skills by trail and error over 20 old years that its not something you have to think about anymore.

** I have always thought that Harry had awesome potential but a lot of factors in his life contributed to him not making full use of it. As many others in the replies have said, casting a patronus is no small feat. However, at the end of the day Harry was just a bit above average. He survived due to his instincts, friends and dumb luck. In my opinion, you can power scale up Harry a bit from canon because let's face, his weakness kind of got annoying sometimes. I am not saying to make him OP but at least a bit more competent than canon.

*** Indeed! After reading all these comments/replies, I've come to the conclusion that Harry probably picked up some things during their nebulous time "on the run." Like, I can't imagine Hermione ever letting Harry or Ron stop practicing spells or not shoving books at them to just try and absorb /something/ that might prove useful (seeing as her general strategy in life in read millions of books and come away with some form of knowledge no matter how little you actually manage to process). She'd definitely use that handy-dandy library in her handbag to give them books to read, try to give her two friends some sort of edge compared to their (at the time) oppressed peers at Hogwarts. And Harry might have eventually figured out how to at least hunt rabbits and cook them? And maybe there's a third spell had can remotely cast? (Lumos and Levicorpus, and then another)

So yeah. Generally a little above average, picked up some things. But the one thing that has generally stayed a question for me: dueling. I've seen how they conduct duels. The wand, the stances, it all looks almost exactly like fencing. Does that translate when Harry or anybody else wields a sword (like the Sword of Gryffindor)? Because in the book it seems like a one-handed sword, then in the movies it goes back-n-forth. And would Harry and Neville actually be any good at it (because of their general wand dueling background) or am I making a fuss over too much conjecture???

************* Right? Some of this is where a really good fanfic really helps for example I wish I could remember the fic but it was a ‘Harry travels back in time' and was trying to hide his magic levels and abilities. It was second year and the Author wrote something like ‘It was the last transfiguration class before the Christmas holidays and the assignment was to transfigure...something... into glass Christmas ornaments. Harry thought back to the last time he had done this assignment he had made a ornament that look like a snitch. After turning it in he had wondered whatever happened to his when he found out Professor McGonagall sent everyones home to their parents. It wasn't until 6th year when he went to the Weasleys for Christmas and on the tree among the 7 of the Weasleys children's ornaments was a little snitch. Later ...someone... had told him that Professor McGonagall had sent it to Mrs. Weasley back in second year. Harry still holding the ...whatever object it was I really can't remember.... felt a swell of emotion thinking back on that and felt a warmth rush down his arm and through his fingerstips. Opening his hand to look held the snitch exactly as he remembered it as the snitch began to unfurl its wings. With a slight gasp Harry quickly closed his hands back over but winced when he heard... Hermione... gasp “ How did you do that?”

God I probably butchered that scene anyways then I just remember McGonagall coming over and Harry claiming accidental magic and her being a bit disappointed hoping it was skill. And then a few chapters Percy questioning the snitch (I think they went to the Weasleys that year I don't remember why) by saying Harry's not allowed to use magic out of school and he was re animating it. And Ron defending Harry by saying that it's been like that since class. Then Percy being in complete shock that a second year could animate something for that long. Then Harry claimed once again it was an accidentally magic. And Percy left it at that but still suspicious of Harry.

***** I agree with that headcanon but also tack on a few things.

1) The hilt can magically change from one-handed to two-handed. I say this because it fixes some plot holes in both book and the movies, and honestly would make sense if this heirloom kept passing between hands; fighting styles changed constantly from medieval times to the semi-present.

2) Its ability to appear when most needed is two-fold: the individual who actually owns it can have it appear when in great need and a courageous person can draw it from the hat when in need. Because /how else would Godric get his sword back after some crazy courageous person called on it?/ I have to rationalize it.

3) Said guidance system is based around the magical properties of the sword: It takes in what only makes it stronger. I take that to be both literal and kinda metaphorical. It can take in basilisk venom and such, but also /for every enemy Godric/his descendants defeated, the dead loser's skills with the blade became theirs./ So the sword would also sort of memorize techniques and such, like a phantom-effect.

*** Ah but movie canon is different to book canon. Also I'd even argue 3 movie has a different canon then the others all together because of the director.

Don't get me wrong over all I enjoyed the movie but I've always hated the increase of Muggle clothes. Because as someone who watches a lot of behind the scenes too all the movies I watch. I know they pick clothes that are chosen to express an aspect of the character, Like Harry and Ron wearing shabbier clothes(cause there poor), Hermione wearing pink sweater (to show she's a girl I guess), Malfoy wearing the black muggle clothes (because he's ‘evil') Crabbe and Goyle wearing plain grey/brown muggle sweaters (background colours). And not because they give a shit about what makes sense in the world of the movie.

For example, When there not in class they should still be wearing normal robes if you don't want them in school uniform. The only exception should be Muggleborns and PureBloods like the Weasleys who live very close and interact with a muggle village. But even then that doesn't make a lot of sense because if you think about an 11 year old Muggleborn on the weekend they might dress in jeans and a sweater at first then notice how much they're standing out. Now include sneers from Slytherins and other PureBloods. They'd probably go and change into at least the white shirt and trousers/skirts part of the uniform if they want to forgo the robes. And as for the Weasleys they hated being poor and Harry hated standing out so I can see them just wearing the uniform to fit in.

Some things I enjoyed was that they started miss-dressing the uniforms. Some didn't tie the tie properly or completely forgot the tie. That makes sense for teenagers.

But all of this was the director's choice and honestly I've never really liked him since he said he tried to not read the books because he didn't want it to change his mind of what he thought the movie should be. I'm just glad JK put her foot down on that one and would question some of his ideas by saying ‘But why?' ‘Where's the logic in that magic?'

Sorry, I didn't realize who ranty this was till I finished. I miss talking about Harry Potter.
