Let's suppose we have a OC who is ruthless like Moody (such as not above killing DE) but less known. If they were stuck with the golden trio and trying to kill a DE (let's say Malfoy senior) how likely would be Harry and co to try to stop them in your opinion ? And to what point ?


** Ron was ready to execute Dolohov and Rowle in that cafe. Another OC with the same attitude would see the deed done.

Now if that OC pointed out that Death Eaters were sadistic genocidal magical Nazis bent on exterminating the Muggleborns like the Jews, I doubt Hermione would have any objections either. She should know how her ancestors fought these monsters.

Harry was ready to crucio Amycus Carrow for spitting on McGonagall, and he definitely had his own ruthless streak. If his other three friends (including your OC) were ready to kill, he would certainly go along.

*** I see Ron as quite pragmatic. IMO he would understand that some things need to be done, even if ugly.

I think Harry can be prone to extreme measures, but only during high emotional situation. He tried to crucio Bellatrix because she caused Sirius to die and I think he *did* crucio Carrow for spitting on McGonagall, he even said something like "wow she (bellatrix) was right, you have to want it"

But if it's in a cold blooded situation, I think he'll have a morality crisis that will make him hesitant, like when he just disarmed Stan Shunpike instead of stunning and was berated for it by Remus. So I could very well see him doing stupid that would endanger someone because it is the right thing to do in his mind. Like you're going to punch someone and he disarms you, only to realize then that he revealed you.

Hermione... I'm conflicted on this one. If she's vindicated, she can be quite creative in her vengeful actions (Umbridge, Skeeter) but on the other hand, she could be quite sneaky like when she stole Harry's Firebolt because she deemed it could be dangerous. Where's Harry's more direct in his approach, she often goes behind their back to ensure something is done.

*** Ancestors? Is there any evidence Hermione has any family connection to Holocaust survivors?

**** Given how many British men were *drafted* to fight the Nazis, there's a high chance her grandfathers fought them as part of the British military.

As long as she sees the war against Death Eaters in the same light, she will know what to do. She might even try to imitate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake][Nancy Wake]], British SOE operative and a very successful leader in the French Resistance.

** As people have said, I think Ron wouldn't take it too bad. He'd probably be the easiest to convince, especially if that OC tries to explain it to make him also angry. (for example, if Neville had expressed the desire to kill Bellatrix and had had an opportunity, I don't think Ron'd have been the one to step in).

I think Hermione would still try to stop them, would try to use logical points and why it's not good and it will not make them feel better, but I think that if she sees that this OC isn't "able" to let the DE go away uninjured/alive, she might give up. I do think she'd feel different around OC but would try not to make their relationship change (knowing it was an exceptional reaction). As I said while using Neville's example, I think Hermione would definitely try to stop him and bring morals into it ("You can't do that, Neville, or you'll be just like them! Your parents wouldn't want you to become a murderer" etc etc) but if that character is decided, she wouldn't risk it all to stop them as she probably knows it wouldn't be that much of a bad idea to get rid of a DE. I think her reaction if it was Malfoy Senior and not a random DE she didn't know, might be a bit different. Not sure how (pity? because she knows Draco, hatred? because of every very hurtful action he did...?) but I think it would impact her choice.

Harry's by far the hardest. I do personally dislike the "good heroes don't kill" prompt so I really felt angry at Harry while reading the books/seeing the movies because he really stays in that zone. I don't think he'd go along? Unless we're talking life/death situation like the Battle of Hogwarts in which case he wouldn't anyway have a choice. I do agree with your other comment, I think Harry, if not in a life or death situation, would probably endanger the OC by disarming them/blocking their attack in some way. The only solution would be for him to be too far/not there or disarmed and unable to block the OC (physically and magically) (maybe knocked out, half-conscious, busy with another DE, or just without a wand around...). I don't really think he'd just watch and be like "okay great that was the right choice" because he always has that "good boy" behavior, just like when he didn't kill Bellatrix after Sirius' death (which if I may say made me really angry). I guess it really depends on the context and the person's motives (even though it wouldn't matter as much as it matters for the two others).

  /" ...Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance...It could be me next, couldn't it? But if it is,” he [Harry] said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.”/\\
  *Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince*
#+end_quote

Harry would never suffer the death of an innocent, and would probably be ready to fight to protect him, but as long as the "victim" is truly evil, I don't think Harry (or his friends) would be very hard to convince.

It's true that there are several scenes in Canon where Harry "spare" his enemies, but there is pretty much always a reason behind this mercy:

- *Wormtail in PoA*\\
  While Harry did say that "It's not what my father would have wanted" to stop Sirius and Remus, he also explained that Peter was needed alive to prove Sirius innocence. Spending the rest of your life with Dementors is also arguably worse than a quick death, but that's not the point.
- *Stan Shunpike in DH*\\
  As Harry later explained to Remus, it is pretty much assured that Stan is under the Imperius. Harry may be ready to kill ennemies, but that doesn't mean he will let any innocent die at his place, and from his point of view, Stan if one of them.
- *The 2 Death Eaters in DH*\\
  The reason he used sound half as an excuse (and even Ron seemed "relieved" to not have to kill them), but technically, he chose to erase their memories because he needed to disappear and the Death Eaters were less likely to investigate 2 amnesiques than 2 deaths.

​

If it happened during a fight, Harry would not say anything if a Death Eater died. If it's an execution, he would probably raise some objections (if only because it may not be the "right" thing to do, especially if alternatives exist like Azkaban), but not enough to stop the OC from acting.

*** I quite agree with your points. Right now, I don't know if I can make the difference between canon!harry and fanon!harry in terms of behavior.

**** That's the problem with fanfics (or at least one of them), discerning Canon from Fanon can become a bit difficult (for some). Is Ron truly an idiot that only pass his classes because Hermione let him cheat on her? Is Sirius truly a manchild that only thinks about pranking people and girls? Is Dumbledore truly an old fool that only thinks about "The Greater Good" and call everyone "My boy"?

** I think in the heat of the moment, they could be convinced. Or at least, they wouldn't actively try to stop it. But if they had time to think about it, especially if the killing were something planned in advance, they'd increasingly reject the idea
