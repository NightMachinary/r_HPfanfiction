"Good /day/!"

Dumbledore sighed as Amelia Bones shut the floo connection with all the subtlety of a slamming door, before he pulled out a piece of paper and started writing a note on it.

Once again, he was in a Super!Harry fic with so-called Manipulative!Dumbledore, and his job was to have all of his schemes exposed, be tied up in legal tape and get booted out of the plot to show off Harry's oh-so-Slytherin cunning and political power.

This particular time, Amelia had floo'd to tell him that there was a will reading at Gringotts regarding Harry Potter's inheritance, an emergency meeting at the Wizengamot regarding Sirius Black, and a meeting of the Hogwarts Board of Governors regarding the running of the school, all at the exact same time, and if he missed any of them then she'd call for his removal as Harry's magical guardian/Chief Warlock/Headmaster respectively. Strange, he felt like he'd seen this one before.

Oh well. Three different meetings at the same time that his oh-so-manipulative self couldn't afford to miss. Dumbledore finished writing his note and folded the paper up into a paper plane, before giving it a toss; it flew out the door, down the stairwell, and towards Minerva McGonagall's office.

After a few seconds of waiting, he slowly got up from his chair and moved around to one of his cabinets, pulling it open and fishing for his reserve of polyjuice potion...and after another second's thought, the invisibility cloak he hadn't yet given Harry.

--------------

"Ah, Professor McGonagall. I was wondering if you could help me with something..."

"Oh, not another hare-brained scheme, Albus...actually, am I supposed to be helping you? Isn't this the kind of fic where I'm horrified at your manipulating a young child and turn a blind eye to all the abuse he ends up heaping on you?"

Dumbledore paused, "...Yes, probably. I don't remember. Would you like to help me anyway?"

"...Sure, what the hell."

--------------

The Time Turner Administration Department at the Ministry of Magic:

Timothy Cloise startled as Albus Dumbledore walked in through the door, holding an hourglass-shaped medallion in his hand, smiling at Timothy.

"I forgot to say thank you!" he said cheerfully.

Timothy blinked, "...For what, Professor?"

Dumbledore blinked, before checking his wristwatch, "Oh...pardon me, I'm five minutes too early. Um...well, I wanted to thank you for fast-tracking the paperwork when I came in...that is, come in, a few minutes from now."

Timothy smiled a little, "Oh, I'm sure it wasn't a bother."

"Nevertheless, thank you very much."

Timothy nodded; Dumbledore backed out of the door again, only to come back a few minutes later.

Timothy tilted his head, "Yes, did you forget something?"

Dumbledore looked confused, "...I do hope not. I'm afraid that my various jobs have left me with a scheduling conflict, of sorts. A Wizengamot meeting and a Board of Governors meeting at the same time, and I'm afraid they can't be rescheduled. I was hoping I could borrow a time turner so I could attend both on time...?"

Timothy looked puzzled for a moment before he mentally connected the dots, and smiled, "Sure, Professor, I'll get right on it."

--------------

A few minutes later, back in the privacy of the Hogwarts Headmaster's Office, the real Dumbledore holding a real time-turner was beaming at a somewhat grumpy polyjuiced-Dumbledore with a fake (but expertly transfigured) time turner.

"I'm not sure why you couldn't have just actually gone back in time, instead of having me pretend to be you from the near future." the fake-Dumbledore grumbled in McGonagall's voice.

"Ah, my dear-"

"Oh Merlin no, no 'my dears' or 'my boys' or twinkly eyes, those are the /worst/ part of Manipulative!Dumbledore fics!" she growled.

Dumbledore blinked, before putting on a pair of sunglasses, "Well then, Professor McGonagall, my coming back would only be possible if he actually did fast-track the time turner loan process, as opposed to taking his sweet time and allowing time for objections and such. So to make things a bit more certain..." he trailed off.

"Yes, yes, I get it now...so I suppose you want me to stay disguised as you for the Board of Governors meeting?"

"But of course, you know just as much about running Hogwarts as I do."

--------------

Amelia Bones fumed quietly as Dumbledore took his place as Chief Warlock, as the Wizengamot started filing in for Sirius Black's long-delayed hearing. What was that meddlesome oaf doing here, he didn't deserve that position!

Oh well, at least he wouldn't be Headmaster any longer, or Harry's magical guardian.

--------------

Harry Potter fumed quietly as Dumbledore stepped in the door and quietly sat down in his assigned seat for the will reading. What was that bastard doing here, he had no right to control Harry or his money!

Oh well, at least he wouldn't be interfering with the Wizengamot or Hogwarts.

--------------

Augusta Longbottom fumed quietly as Dumbledore waved at her from the head of the table at the Board of Governors meeting. What was that nincompoop doing here, he shouldn't be allowed to have anything to do with children!

Oh well, at least he wouldn't be Harry's magical guardian, or head of the Wizengamot any longer.

--------------

Super Harry grumbled as the floo opened to admit Augusta and Amelia to the Leaky Cauldron, not having been able to hold the meeting at Potter Manor due to a certain meddling headmaster.

Well... "Lady Longbottom, did you manage to get Albus Dumbledore removed as headmaster?" he asked courteously.

Augusta Longbottom's similarly foul mood turned into confusion, "What? No, he attended the Board of Governors meeting, I was wondering why we were meeting here if he..."

Amelia Bones stared, "But then who was at the Wizengamot during Mr. Black's trial?"

There was a long pause, before Harry spoke up, "Is there a law against doppelgangers we can use?"

A fourth voice spoke up, "There's plentiful precedent protecting the use of body doubles, and even more for trusted representatives."

The three turned; standing right next to them was Dumbledore, with a tray full of Butterbeers (and one pumpkin fizz) and a great big smile, "The Wizengamot does have specific rules prohibiting a representative masquerading as whom they are representing, though as I was there in person they do not pose an issue. But I digress; seeing as I continue to be Harry Potter's magical guardian, would it be too much trouble if I were to join you in discussing the future?"


** This is great! It's nice to see things from Manipulative!Dumbledore's perspective.

** This reminds me of the fic where Harry confronts Dumbledore and Dumbledore manages to pull one off with brainwshing. Honestly. These type of fics are great because let's face it. Dumbledore is powerful. And cunning. He took out grindlewald. Held off Voldemort. Engineered Voldemorts final destruction and nearly mastered the Hollows. He's one of the most powerful wizards in HP Canon. I would love to see a long dumbledore fic where Harry tries this shit and Dumbledore wipes the floor with the little upstart.

*** In the blue corner, Manipulative!Dumbledore, the old Headmaster of Hogwarts and Chief Warlock! He might be old but he's got magical longevity, and his only scheme of note seems to be to steal all of Harry's wealth (which seems to include owning half of magical Britain and 10% of the rest of the world)!

In the red corner, Independent!Harry, who's 11 years old but acts like an adult who hasn't recently re-read the books! Heeeee's out to level grind until he can pawn (wait, it's pronounced own) Voldemort and gather his harem with an eyebrow wiggle!

"...You know what, you can manage my stuff as long as you don't try to cut me out of it."

"But my boy, it would be for the Greater Good!™"

"GAWD, you can't tell me what to do, you're not my real magical guardian!"
