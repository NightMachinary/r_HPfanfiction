I always feel like the only person who likes the canon pairing and am having trouble finding normal fanfiction about the pairing. Does anyone have any recs?


** I know how you feel and it's why I ended up only lurking here! I write a lot of canon compliant Harry/Ginny the majority of which is on my ao3 and tumblr.

But come join us at [[/r/HarryandGinny][r/HarryandGinny]], you'll get loads of recs :)

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

  “You understand, Professor,” Harry began, after a moment, “that I don't have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn't seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.” “Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter,” McGonagall said, dryly.

#+begin_quote
  While I was reading the Harry Potter books, I increasingly came to wonder why Ginny did not play a more important part in Harry's life, especially after the events in Half-Blood Prince. So, with Harry pretty much ignoring her during and after the Battle, but with Ginny being the last thought in Harry's mind before he "died," I decided their story needed a remedy. The Hog's Head is an unabashed romance that follows the lives of Harry and Ginny from the Battle of Hogwarts through the following year. Chapter One, "Faith," begins during the Battle as Lord Voldemort calls his truce. It follows canon precisely but from Ginny's point of view. My own plot, post-DH, begins with Chapter Two, "Anticipation." Descriptions of Hogsmeade and locations of its various buildings are based on the map of Hogsmeade in The Harry Potter Lexicon. While you are at it, please take a look at my original novels, Hancock Hill and Acting Obsessed.

  Set after the COS. See how Harry Potter's story will change, with Ginny being Sorted into Slytherin. A Ginny who is not going to be a victim, and a Harry who realises those closest to him may not have his best interests at heart. Major Molly/Ron/Dumbledore bashing, some Hermione bashing. Rated for later chapters.

** The Tea Time Series is really great for Weasley-Potter family stuff and does a great job of fixing what Cursed Child left behind. The second story in particular has some of the best written Harry/Ginny I've seen.

** Are you after canon-compliant stories (maybe post-Hogwarts), divergence where they start dating earlier, AU like Ginny being sorted into Slytherin, or something else?

For the first, I generally recommend Northumbrian's stories, particularly linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh), where Harry and Ginny and their children move out to the countryside. For the second, I recently enjoyed linkffn(A Friend Indeed by kb0), where Ginny approaches and comforts Harry during his blow-up with Ron in fourth year. And one of my favourites doesn't actually have them dating, and is unfinished (technically not abandoned, but very infrequently updated), but I love how it develops Ginny's character: [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]

  During Harry's fourth year, what if Ginny had asked Harry how he was feeling when her brother turned his back on Harry? What if she had tried to befriend him then? How would that have affected Harry and his other friends? To cover Harry's fourth year.

** I was pretty indifferent to them to be honest. I never gave Ginny much thought until I read a really good Ginny-centric story and now I've even started paying more attention to her in my own writing. I'm not sure they'll ever by a pairing I actively ship but I would definitely be open to reading a story about them if the plot sounded neat.
