  Harry formulates an innovative taunting-based Occlumency barrier inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Snape retaliates by threatening to reveal Harry's perviest memories and fantasies, including those involving a certain bushy-haired best friend.

** God I remember this story. She uses legimancy and discovers his fantasies. Hermione convinces him that if the girls already know about his fantasies Umbridge can't really cause any embarrassment. So they gather up all the girls into the Room of Requirements with the room divided into two sections. The girls come in one by one into the second section where harry tells them how they were in his dreams (everything from just being a friend to full on sex dreams).

Now if my search can find it.

It may be snape not Umbridge in the story
