:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think it was a time travel fic. HP pre first task in the triwizard tournament decides to legilimize the Hungarian horn tail for shits and giggles I guess and succeeds in possessing her briefly. However something goes wrong and he feels like he left a piece of his mind behind. I'm like 98% sure this was a wip but I can't find it!! Help appreciated.


** This seems so familiar but I can't place a name

*** That's not it, sorry :/

In the fic I'm thinking of I don't think Harry knows/talks to Charlie at all. The dragon isn't named either

** I found it!! It's Resolution by Slytherin's Dragon. A time travel fic that's gen. Harry and Blaise go back in time and take assumed names.

** Doesn't he gain the dragon as a familiar too? If not then I don't think I've read it before.

Edit: Does it also happen to be a WBWL fic?

*** If it is, then it's this one. Chapter 17 is the one you're probably looking for.
