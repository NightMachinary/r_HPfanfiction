Instead of Hufflepuff being the place to sort students that have no discernible traits according to the sorting hat, they go to Gryffindor instead. This leads to the students of Gryffindor feeling insecure about their place there and in so doing, end up in increasing reckless or dangerous situations in order to prove their worth.

This was in part inspired by the fanon idea, that Gryffindor is uniquely boisterous compared to the other houses, the concept that 'anyone can choose to be brave' and it takes a unique form of courage to reflect upon the self.


** In reality 11 year olds are going to end up in Gryffindor - very few are academic at that age, very few particularly hardworking, and the number who are in any way cunning is vanishingly small. But most kids have a ridiculous level of bravery lurking inside them, because they don't know what they should reasonably be afraid of yet.

Unless the Hat has some sort of time magic on it...looking at 4 possible futures and determining which house is the optimum for them based on criteria agreed by the Founders?

*** Much more simple: It looks at potential and then picks in the Founders' name.

Look at it like draft picks. You have a pool of students, and four masters that have different philosophies for teaching their apprentices. And now they do their best to pick those who they think will be worthy to be taught by them, i.e. who they think are the best students. And then the Founders died, and the Sorting Hat took over.

So the point isn't that you have to be exceptionally cunning to go into Slytherin. And "sorting too soon" is also not an issue. The House is /supposed/ to shape you, and you are picked because it looks like you might appreciate the values it teaches you, and the hope is you then do your House proud. In that sense, every House simply wants "the best" students, they just disagree about the definition of "best", and so there's (almost) never an issue.

At 11, there will be noticeable differences between children. And those, plus, I assume, magic (the Hat can look into your head, after all), should be enough to make a call.

Or, at least that is how I always looked at this issue.

***** True, is the one with the most common sense and truly educational.

** I like this üòä.

I personally run with the cannon that you have to ask the Sorting Hat to be put into Gryffindor. Only people who are brave enough to ask for what they want, to properly chose their place rather than being forced into it by someone else get sorted to Gryffindor.

Hufflepuff and Gryffindor for me are quite similar? Loyal, honest, hardworking? The only difference is that Gryffindors are so wrecklessly dumb.

Dumb enough to make demands of a thousand year old hat.

****** Ah, but that doesn't mean it's the /right/ thing to do. That's my point.

It's brave as shit. To ask for what you want. Especially to ask for something when the whole point of 'The Sorting' is to 'Be Sorted' not to 'Chose your House'.

The hat is designed to choose what is best for you based on your traits. That's it's whole thing. It's been doing it for a thousand years. Why do you, an 11 year old child, think you're better than it? You're 11, 11 year olds have no idea who they are, or who they're going to be. 100% I'm handing a decision as meaningless as my class group to a magical object who's sole purpose is to pick the classes.

Was it right, that Sirius was a Gryffindor when it probably got him disowned from his family and estranged from his brother? Was it right that Peter was a Gryffindor? When he was the slyest, cunningest double agent in the whole book that he was able to fool the entire order and his 3 best friends? Hermione is teased for being bookish, why isn't she in Ravenclaw she would have suited it better?

This is why I think Gryffindors need to actively chose their house rather than being sorted. Because Gryffindors are wreckless. The act without thinking of the consiquences. They do what they think is right, even when it's wrong.

They are the type of people who would be dumb enough to think they know better than a sentient hat age 11. Who would be brave enough to try. They don't think of the consiquences that choice might be, and it will either benefit them or it won't.

The sorting hat respect their choices. It sorts them because they chose it and having that wreckless idealism is what Gryffindor aims to promote.

******* I think you're overhyping it a bit. Sure, it takes some courage to speak up, but it's not like McGonagall says "this is the hat, it's decision is final, do not question it", it talks to the kids first, some of them must talk back.

******* For any given definition of "right" ...?

"What is right" is as much (or even more so) one part of what gets you sorted as anything else. Unsurprisingly, at the latest by the time they leave Hogwarts, there will be a /huge/ disagreement over "what is right".

But that aside, I don't think Hufflepuff and Gryffindor are very much alike. Stereotyping to the extreme, loyal and hardworking (in that sense, selflessness -- already visible in Hufflepuff herself, when she decided to teach "all the rest") are traits that are valued in Hufflepuff House, while Gryffindors are stereotypical heroes -- vain, in search of glory, unafraid in the face of danger, not /particularly/ loyal (especially if it collides with any of their other values), brash, dedicated to their cause.

For instance, I could see Barty Crouch Sr. as a Gryffindor. He was a zealot, and as soon as his /own son/ turned out to be "on the other side", he literally threw him into prison with his own hands. This kind of conditional loyalty we also see glimpses of with Sirius and Remus, who don't hesitate to kill Peter once it turns out he betrayed them. Loyalty doesn't mean standing with someone when it's convenient. The awful end or dark side of loyalty is following someone wherever they may go, at the expense of one's own self. I don't think Gryffindor has too much of that.

But yeah, it's a nice idea that asking the Hat to put you in Gryffindor increases your chances to go there. Just, in the end, such an action is only the expression of a disposition you already have -- and that the Hat would see, regardless of what you did, no?

** Isn't that kinda... canon...? üòÖ

Like, Hufflepuff takes those dedicated to hard work and fairness, /not/ everyone. Gryffindor however, while /supposedly/ for the brave and honor driven, also took Peter Pettigrew (whose literal only motivation in life was being afraid and therefore bending over backwards to get protection from the biggest school yard bully currently around). Gryffindor took Hermione, Dumbledore /and/ Minerva who all three would arguably have made a better fit for Ravenclaw. And last but not least, Harry himself went to Gryffindor, although by rights he should have been a Slytherin, simply because he asked to be put into Gryffindor.

If any house in canon just "scoops up" everyone no matter what their traits, then surely that's gotta be Gryffindor, right?

*** According to the Sorting Hat, Helga Hufflepuff said ‚ÄòI'll take all the rest and teach them all just the same' or something to that effect. The meta narrative is that those who would have fit elsewhere, went to Gryffindor ‚Äòbecause anyone can choose to be brave'.

What I was attempting to prompt, though failing, was that those that did or did not fit elsewhere might feel insecure about being placed in Gryffindor so overcompensate by doing reckless things in order to prove their bravery.

** I agree that Gryffindor students are probably insecure and want to be brave (ie. secure). However, I think Hufflepuff would be the "all the rest" house if there even is one!

I don't get why Gryffindor would be the "all the rest." Sure, most kids want to "be brave," but the popular belief is that Puffs are leftovers. Popular belief is very influential, especially to children.

Not wanting to be a bandwagon is not original, so your assertion has merit. But, Hufflepuff is vanilla. They like loyalty. Bland. I doubt that many kids want to go to Hufflepuff. If they believe they should go to Hufflepuff, and it's not because of familial loyalty, they do so because they heard the stereotype. Surely, even muggleborns would have heard others talk about houses.

For those who don't agree with the idea that the hat just places students into whatever house they tell themselves they should be in, here ya go:

I don't believe that a quarter of 11 year olds are "wise" and "smart" or "ambitious" and "cunning".

For Slytherins, just think of the whole "Heir Potter-Black-Greengrass, do you want to join our families in an alliance (and pretend our family heads actually value our words)"? Remember all the cringey shit you did as a kid? Yeah, we weren't smooth.

Regarding Ravenclaw, there are geniuses, but they are anomalies. Unless Hogwarts takes only the brightest, either the average wizard and witch is just smarter than the average muggle or how fanon treats the "smart" thing is blown out of the waters.

Yes, kids adapt to whatever is expected of them. Think of Snape. Sure, he being abused by his muggle father had a lot to do with it, but the environment was just /toxic/. I do understand that by the time they are 17, they will be molded into their house's stereotypes and model their friends, most of whom are probably housemates. Interesting study, btw, is how we can identify people's names with a decent amount of accuracy. My point still stands bc I am talking about 11 year olds, not 17 year olds whose senses of identity are tied to a particular group for 7 years of their adolescence.

The hat could be sorting students into the house they will grow best in, but why the hell would it sort kids into Slytherin? I am a Snape-fan, and I have to admit that the annoying Gryffindors are still "the good guys" compared to Slytherins! Before anyone says the hat doesn't know current events, iirc, it does...
