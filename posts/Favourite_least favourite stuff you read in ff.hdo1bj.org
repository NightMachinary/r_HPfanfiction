** I don't mind characters getting what I feel they deserve, but I really hate time travel fics where someone does a preemptive strike against an 11-year-old because of something their future self from another timeline did.

Probably the only RobSt fic I felt went too far with the bashing was when Future!Ron committed an unforgivable offense, and Hermione and Harry are thrown back in time when they're executed for murdering Future!Ron in response.

The author spends a lot of time hemming and hawing about whether to outright murder an 11-year-old, or just permanently disfigure him. It's even more egregious because the same author portrays Ginny as nearly as guilty in that particular fic but allows her to be redeemed, not to mention making Percy basically an older version of Ron, with the same stupid jealousy.

--------------

My /favorite/ fanfics are the ones get just what they deserve /legally/. There's nothing I find more satisfying than a character being judged by a jury of their peers, and getting a deserved sentence. Umbridge springs to mind particularly. I've only ever seen a few fanfics where Umbridge /wasn't/ an antagonist

*** I said it in another comment but I'll say it again I thing the Ginny/Molly bashing is not needed but I don't own the fics so it's whatever, I like Ron and Snape bashing solely because I dislike these two characters although I suppose I should let up on disliking Ron as much. I don't hate time travel fics but if I'm reading one that has some outlandish out of character stuff happening in them I don't mind because I hate time travel as a concept anyway so I'm just there to see stuff get wild.

** I really don't like harem fics, because every single one has the girls ganging up on Harry and pushing him around. They usually get together and decide --- completely without his input --- who will get to sleep with him in which order and on what schedule. Not to mention the apparently required punitive shopping trip, wherein he is made to take them shopping to make up for some perceived slight, and in which they usually show an unholy glee in tormenting him with trying on countless outfits that they then force him to purchase.

*** Harem fics are an odd duck for sure, always feels like I'm reading an anime/manga version of Harry Potter.

**** I don't think most harem fics are a match for harem manga/anime. In the anime/manga, it's always about the central character ultimately selecting 1 girl, and the girls competing for his attention.

In just about every harem fanfic I've read, they're perfectly willing to share(and even encourage it). Some animes/mangas will have a character aiming for the "Harem ending," but it's almost always one out of the bunch, rather than the girls coming to an agreement.

***** Fair enough, it was a bad comparison on my part as my knowledge of anime comes from friends and not checking it out myself.

No, there's a reason for the [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Marry_Them_All][Tenchi solution]] being a trope. /High School DxD/, /Testament of Sister New Devil/, /Trinity Seven/, /How Not to Summon a Demon Lord/, are probably the most popular harem series in recent years, and all of them appear to be going the full group route.

Chinese and American harem series usually go the group route, with a large chunk of American ones also having the women date each other also. Then again that's also true of most American reverse harems also from what I can tell.

****** Ah. I don't read that many harem manga, to be honest. The only ones I've read for any length of time are:

- /Ranma 1/2/, which is far more about the absurd martial arts adventures, with Akane ultimately "winning". That annoyed me, with how much Akane abused Ranma, especially during the times he didn't deserve it. It always felt like Ukyo and Ranma were the couple with the fewest problems between them.

- /Mahou Sensei Negima/, which I never actually finished, but IIRC it dropped the harem aspect to become a battle manga

- /Rosario X Vampire/, which seems to drop a lot of the harem aspects of the manga towards the end, going full on battle-manga(and saving the world). Even so, Tsukune the only girl he ever really expressed any romantic feelings for was Moka. Everyone else he seemed to only express platonic affection for.

I didn't even know Tenchi married them all. I thought the "Tenchi Solution" was stringing them along forever.

** My biggest pet peeve in relationship fics is when they make a contrived reason to put two people together. People can choose whatever pairing they like, that's fine, if you want to make a well written story about Snape falling for Dobby then hats off to you. But marriage contracts, soul bonds, Veela-mates, and other fics start with the idea “Okay how can I force these two together, and how many chapters of them being sad should I write?” I understand the nice dramatic tensions forcing two people with loss of magic if the don't get together, but you know they will get together in the end, so the whole fic is them slowly coming around to that conclusion, so for me all the tension is dead.

*** Yeah a lot of fics with marriage contracts, soul bonds and veela mates usually have one or both dying as a consequence of rejection so it would be interesting to see a story where it is rejected, I would also really like to see a Snape/Dobby fic because that sounds hilarious.

*** The find most bashing to not be needed like the constant bashing of Ginny and Molly but Snape Umbridge and Ron I really dislike so I'm good with that but they aren't my fics so as long as it has enough good points to it I don't mind. If Harry is in another house I will always prefer it to be the snakes.

** Two things really bug me.

OP first years. Ron accidentally knocks out the troll with his first successful levitation charm. Hell, they're using tickling charms in the dueling club in CoS. First years should not be throwing around cutting curses and explosions. I don't care how many books Harry read in the month between meeting Hagrid and school starting.

Dating first years. Ew.

*** I agree with the first thing.

The second though? As long as they aren't doing anything beyond a light peck and they aren't eloquent, politcal-power obsessed runts, I find it adorable.

**** I don't mind op first years as there always ends up being more mental over the top stuff happening later and I read it like it's a crack fic at that point. It does beg the question though why give eleven year olds a powerful weapon especially when some of them have only known about magic for short time even in the books, maybe Umbridge kinda when she took practical learning out of the equation. Crap I just though lot of Umbridge as a sensible person mostly instead of the hellish she devil I hate.
