:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't know how many of you guys read the "Reading the Books" type fanfiction - I went through a phase of reading them a few years back, and there's one in particular I remember but I can't find it anywhere. It was an abused Harry fanfiction, where he was wearing a glamor and when it eventually wore off it was bad enough that he had to be put in some healing box thing and the others kept reading without him? Also he was a really good cook - he made everybody Knickerbocker Glorys after that part of the first book, and I think he made muggle candy bars too (probably Mars Bars, after the scene with the trolley witch?) There was a scene where he hid with Percy Weasley under the invisibility cloak while the book was being read. I think there was some rule that everybody had to be there for the book to open, and that's why they hid so it could be read but nobody would see them. I think that's how they were able to read while he was being healed. I think Sirius was there, and every Hogwarts Student since it was in the Great Hall. Even if it's been deleted from the interwebs I'm just hoping someone knows it existed at some point and I'm not crazy ðŸ˜…
