Let's make a list people, so we can gradually tick it off as the new fic's roll in, I'll start:

1. Time Travel fic where Harry goes back to the 20's and /somehow/ finds himself in New York.
2. Luna and Rolf Scamander meet Newt at a family gathering, adorable awkwardness ensues.
3. 1920's Newt Scamander time travels to 1990 to mentor Harry Potter.
4. [[/spoiler][1920's Grindlewald]] time travels to 1990 to mentor Harry Potter.
5. [[/spoiler][Queenie]] decides to restore [[/spoiler][Jacob's]] memories and they live dangerously as outlaws, hiding from MACUSA who want to arrest them.
6. [[/spoiler][Credence]] is actually a time travelling Tom Riddle.


** Obviously, Harry is Obscurus because of Dursley abuse.

**** Ariana and Harry I can see, but Tom never tried to hide his difference/superiority.

Though regarding Harry, given the Obscurial phenomena we now know exists, I would have thought someone was keeping a closer eye on what the Dursley's were up to precisely so they didn't inadvertently turn Harry into one.

***** The thing is, it takes more than just abuse to become an obscurial. The abuse has to actually take root i.e. the abused child has to internalise the hatred/fear of magic so that they reject their own magic.

Harry was an extremely resilient child who never internalised anything the Dursleys said to him. He rejected their world view entirely and was never even close to accepting their ideas about rejecting the "unnatural" and fetishising normality.

  FANTASTIC BEASTS SPOILERS! What if the Dursleys had been a bit more devoted to beating the magic out of Harry? Newt Scamander and Albus Dumbledore both have long and dark histories, but there is one thing they both know. They would do anything and fight anyone to prevent the death of one final Obscurial.

Whereas the fanfic trunks are wholly self-serving
