I read it years ago, and all I can remember is that it was really long (25+ chapters, but long chapters), possibly on wattpad? Dumbledore had sent Hermione back with a time turner to Tom's time, but I'm not sure which year. Tom was cold to Hermione for so long, and I think they both traveled around at some point? Tom ran away, I think, after finding out who she was, and left to...create the horcruxes? Hermione chased him from place to place, and I remember them meeting again at the orphanage, in a chapter. I'm sorry I don't remember more, but I'd know it if I read it :(


** Is it this one? (His Persephone)

** This one seems more likely though? It's over 700k words long. And Tom does want to make Horcruxes...and they hate each other at first (because Hermione knows who Tom really is). They are looking for Deathly Hallows... The only difference really is though Dumbledore doesn't send her back (but there are loads of fics where that occurs, so maybe, if you read multiple “Tomione” fics, you are cross-remembering?). Hermione sends herself back by breaking the Elder Wand. Anyway, if this isn't the right one, I highly recommend it anyway! “Ultima Ratio”
