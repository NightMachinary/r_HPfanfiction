I wanted to read Gryffindor!Harry fics where he gets a lot of support from his house. This is true in later canon, but I rarely find fanfictions like this. Would like a house-centric fic. No fic recommendations for other houses please. There are too many of those...


** I really like linkffn(8823783).

  "While you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts," said McGonagall. Following the 1991-92 school year, the Gryffindors decide to make good on that promise.
