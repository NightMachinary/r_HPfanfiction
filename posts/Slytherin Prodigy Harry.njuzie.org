Harry is ambitious and a prodigy, possibly manipulative and other things should remain canon also I mean prodigy in the sense like he learns everything very easily and wants to learn like Tom riddle but not evil just and again possibly a bit manipulative or you can say will do things that are unethical or frowned upon to gain what he wants like betraying someone's trust and the sort. I would prefer the pairing to be Harry/Hermione but doesn't matter if you can't find it with the mentioned pairing others will work fine.


** Check on the Way to Greatness,he is not a prodigy but he became a Slytherin because the hat said he could be great
