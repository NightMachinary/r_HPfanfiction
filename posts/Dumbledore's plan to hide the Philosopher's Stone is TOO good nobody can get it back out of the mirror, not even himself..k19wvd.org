*** That's a good question. Now that I think on it, the stone being trapped wouldn't change the story in any immediately relevant way, but it would change the overall story of Harry Potter in some ways.

As someone else on this thread mentioned, so long as there's still a chance the stone could be recovered people will keep trying to do so. Such an endeavor would open up new avenues for world building and exploring the magic system, as the task would require either a better understanding of the mirror and stone to succeed; Or at the very least, a better understanding of how things can be put into the mirror in the first place.

In any case, keeping the stone in the mirror would also leave a useful tool or plot device available throughout the series. One almost as important if not more so than Griffindor's sword or the Elder Wand.

Assuming that Harry getting the stone was a fluke because the stone/mirror were only supposed to lure Voldemort in, the mirror provably works as a means of safekeeping. It would further make sense that Flamel accepted death afterward if he had kept himself alive so long to protect the stone rather than out of fear of death; His old friend found a way to keep his extremely valuable and potently dangerous creation safely out of the reach of evil people, so he could finally rest?

****** I wrote that on my phone so I kept it brief and dumb.

From a Watsonian perspective your position makes little sense. You aren't interpreting the text based on any actual clues, just applying your own headcanons to a story. There is nothing to ever suggest that it was not the real stone. I would venture to say that, based on my own headcanons, it is equally likely that Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel were old people who were ready to move on.

A huge theme of the series is accepting death. Everybody dies, and when it is your time you should welcome it with open arms. To do otherwise is an affront against nature (ie. horcruxes). I think that, interpreting the story from what we are given in the text, it is unlikely that the stone was not real.

***** If I might offer my two cents, I think the reason the mirror produced the stone in that way is simply because there were two people in the room. Consider what we know about the mirror:

It was made not just to show one's desire, but also to interact in unknown ways with whomever is observing it. It shows an observer things that aren't there as well as what is there, and does so in such a way that two observers won't see the same thing or be able to see what the other sees. It's capable of storing and releasing objects, but it only operates when it is observed and the mirror may do so in ways that ensure no observer but the one it's interacting with can see.

I think the mirror put the stone directly into Harry's pocket because it could not allow the other person in the room to see it carry out a prearranged function. If Harry had gotten there first it's possible the mirror could have been as blatant as spitting the stone out onto the floor straight through the glass for all we know.
