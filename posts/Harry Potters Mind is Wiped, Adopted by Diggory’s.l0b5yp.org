I am trying to find a fanfic where Harry is dropped off at the train station, somehow manages to get on the Hogwarts Express while staying hidden than sneak into the Great Hall without anyone noticing. He then hides behind a house banner but is found. No one is sure who he is at first as he is quite small and only finds out due to his acceptance letter in a grocery bag with a few other items. It is determined Harry is so abused and unable to function well, it is better to restart his life by wiping his memories. He is adopted by the Digorrys as Mrs. Digorry is a healer. If anyone could help me find the story I'd appreciate it! Thanks!


** I remembered it was a Harry/Ginny story, so I found it again: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4084005/1/Fate-s-Mistake]]
