*** I read a few chapters of calculation. One day i'm going to take this fandom and sit them in front of a group of eleven year olds, even super smart eleven year olds, and ask them to explain why they think people of this age can be simultaneously hypercompetant and efficient to the degree of reforming and overworking entire aspects of how a culture works.

It was fun enough to read but I feel like the author should have just written a satirical essay on The Faults of Magical Britain and its Education System rather than a Harry Potter Narrative.

​

I don't know how people can just snatch out stories that they've read to fit these kind of prompts. How do you remember this kind of stuff. I read a lot of HPFanfiction and I could off the top of my head name one or two stories. All the other ones just mesh into a smorgasbord of tropes and varied writing quality.

***** A genius mathematician, more competent at ten then I will be at my prime.

I suppose I struggle with these fics not because being a savant is unrealistic but because a genius child is not the same as an adult, or a genius adult for that matter. If I could I would give specific examples and construct detailed arguments for how genius children SHOULD be written, but alas, my gripes will remain unhelpful at best and obnoxious at worst.

  A mild send-up on a popular genre of Harry Potter fanfiction. As much as I enjoy them, some practical considerations come to mind. Inevitably, Harry has one specific ally in all those fics ... but what if that entity took a different view on things?

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

** In HPMOR, there's a short humorous omake from McGonagall's point of view in which this happens to Harry.

The context of the omake is the last six paragraphs of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/9/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality#review][chapter 9]], in which Harry steps up to be sorted. The omake itself is the last section of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/11/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality#review][chapter 11]] (a chapter of omakes), the part starting “At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly”.

*** To head off some potential reactions, I know that many people on this subreddit dislike HPMOR intensely (hence the downvotes already). Never fear -- since this short omake is from McGonagall's point of view, it doesn't showcase the elements of Harry's character that put people off. The omake stands on its own. You don't have to read the rest of the story to like it.
