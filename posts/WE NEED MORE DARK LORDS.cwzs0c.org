Seriously, how can it be that in like, several thousands of years of magical history only a handful of dark lords/great wizards are known and named? And then why are all of them european? Like, we have Merlin, the Founders, And Dumbledore for the "light" and Herpo the foul, (maybe Morgana, but I'm not rly sure 'bout her), Grindelwald and Voldemort for the "dark". Why aren't there more Famous magicans from like, the Arab countries, Far East, South Asia or maybe even South America or Australia? And where are the famous dudes from the rennaisannce or the age of enlightenment? No way, that there weren't some moderately well known figures in nearly 1000 years since the founders and now.

This isn't a rant or anything like that, I'm just asking that because it seems quite... I dunno, off to me. I'm a real mythological nut so I love even fictional historical stories. (If anyone of you has some Ideas for such figures, lemme know :P!!!)


** JKR's complete lack of real interest in cultures other than British is fairly ubiquitous throughout the books, is the short answer. Even when people from other countries rock up, such as in the Goblet of Fire, there is virtually no mention of their culture or history, and they essentially seem to behave like Brits with a veneer of stereotype layered on top.

Hence why fanon must take up the mantle.

*** Yeah, i mean, take Durmstrang. It's somewhere in 'the North'. Ok, fair enough... but wait, they've got stylistics like a Russian stereotype and their star pupil is Bulgarian. Ok, maybe it's just a Russian school and that's why it is like this... nope, the Russians have their own school. FFS just pick up a map and learn like a tiniest little bit of history of your own fucking continent instead of making shit up from nothing as you go.

*** Another example of this is how careless she was when coming up with the names for foreign wizarding schools, seeing as Castelobruxo is literally just "wizard castle" and Mahoutokoro is botched Japanese for "place of magic", name that she probably got from a Kay and Peele comedy sketch.

** JK Rowling has an interesting relationship with real-world history. Did you know, for example, that the European colonizers gave the Native Americans wands and then they lived happily ever after?

My possibly-compatible-with-canon explanation is that magical Britain is a police state that not only sends people to prison with soul-sucking monsters without trial, but also strictly controls all of the information that flows in and out of the country, which is why there are almost no mentions of Dark Lords ever.

*** Damn. That seems... kinda lazy to me. Like, why not make an epic though equally bloody and horriffic war between the Shamans of the native americans and the magical colonists of europe, which, though unseen from the "mortal" men still had grave consequences? I mean, why bother coming up with something along the lines of: the raw and unrestrained, ancient magic of the great elementals that (maybe to this day) still inhabit northamerica versus the disciplined and tamed spells of the wizards, both sides trying to win in an all out war for survival, with the end of the native american magicals and the loss of wild magic in all of Northamerica as a result (or, something like that), if you can just say "yeah, they got wands and, well, uhm, they're all happy and living peacefully right now and all's fine"

As someone who loves to read and create stories such like this, that seems like a lot of wasted potential to me. Which is really a shame :(

** Those are plot relevant dark lords and great wizards. I'm sure there are many more, but nobody would enjoy HP books if JKR stopped the plot every five minutes to infodump on every aspect of the world the fans are quick to cry "plothole" about.

Now fics are sometimes too fixated on Voldemort and Death Eaters instead of creating new villains, especially when it comes to post-Hogwarts era. Antagonists don't even have to be dark lords, those are frankly boring. Give your villains some other motivation than taking over the world/Britain, for Merlin's sake!

There's no light/dark dichotomy in the books the way it is in fanfiction either. Grindelwald and Voldemort are "dark" because they are basically terrorists; "dark" is a legal concept in HP universe more than anything. The Founders aren't light, they are just historical figures. Godric Gryffindor left a sword that he probably used a lot, including on people. I doubt he would have a problem with a Killing Curse, or Sectumsempra. Medieval morals were very different.

Wizards of that caliber rarely appear. Hence Britain being terrible. Grindelwald was spread out. Voldemort was contained.

**** Dumbledore beat Grindelwald in single combat while Grindelwald had the Elder Wand, yet he couldn't beat Voldemort. Dumbledore seems to be internationally recognised for his power, Voldemort is heavily implied to be the strongest wizard of the century.

** I think you may be looking at all of this too narrowly and are somewhat imposing how much we interact with the wider world today (in the age of the internet) on both modern and past wizarding society.

For one thing, the wizarding world is /small/. We're talking less than 0.01% of the human population. Genocidal maniacs and truly powerful individuals are frankly rare (or rather ones who actually amount to something other than complaining) in history even for muggles, and for wizards its even less so since they need to be incredibly magically skilled. There are plenty of /dark/ wizards (even in Britain you have groups like the Death Eaters which are a not inconsiderable chunk of the population), but what you are missing is that there are very few individuals that we're simply able to become notorious as dark wizards.

Whether this is because they were unable to last long or they left no real mark on history is ultimately the deciding factor for why we would learn of them today. For that we actually do get examples of famous Dark Wizards - Emeric the Evil held the Elder Wand (you don't get a name like 'the evil' without cutting a brutal swath throughout the land), Ekrizidis (you know, the guy who built Azkaban?), Herpo the Foul (created the first Basilisks and Horcrux), etc. But why are there no 'Dark Lords' you ask? Well, there is only one dark lord - Voldemort. That is a specific title attributed to him, and nobody else.

Besides which, I think you are thinking of dark wizards like the Sith in Star Wars (both pre- and post-Rule of Two). As in, they are dedicated to conquest and rule and power over all others. But a more accurate comparison would be with the dark jedi in the Star Wars universe. Dark wizards don't have so necessarily lofty aims - just like most really bad muggles as well. There just doing what they want with what abilities they have, with far less lofty ambitions than those grand individuals. Its about both power and desire (or personality if you prefer), and few have the right combination to truly be remembered in history.

Finally, I'll hammer another aspect down. Without looking it up, can you tell me lead a genocide in Cambodia forty years ago (his actual name)? How about who the Prime Minister of India is? I bring these up because I want to illustrate that most people only learn about people and places that are relevant to /them/ - their history, their culture, people who shaped their identities in whatever area today. So it would go for the wizarding world. Harry only learns more about say Grindelwald because it became relevant in Deathly Hallows. There are likely many infamous wizards across history and the world, but the ones you know about are the ones who shaped history and the modern world in your area.

Long I know, but I hope this helps somewhat clear this up.

*** Thanks man, you really have a good point there. And I think, I might not have my question clear in some aspects. I meant (among other things) that I find it somewhat strange that we have not that much information about all these historical or mythological figures. You know, like in form of a book like Qudditch throughout the ages or Fantastic beasts and where to find them. But maybe there even is, and I just failed to find it, I dont know.

*** For the latter part - you're asking kinda specific things that are irrelevant as to make a point. Knowing at least a few prominent recent famous figures from across the world isn't like knowing who is the current PM of India - it's more like knowing (or at least hearing about) who was Gandhi.

Anywayz, i think we can chalk it all up to the lacluster worldbuilding on JKR's part - and i think we should be all the more grateful that's mostly left up to interpretation and fanfictions, because all the bits and pieces of stuff from outside Britain that make it to the books or some additional media (like Pottermore) are so irritatingly dumb and not properly thinked about that it almost hurts

*** This doesn't really work when the last Dark Lord that we know by name helped wage a World War. Voldemort never seemed to leave Britian after he came back from his post schooling vacation. Sure, his Death Eaters went to other countries and recruited a bit(but not really). Yet in Fantastic Beasts, Grindlewald is all over the news with how he's personally bringing terror to countries all over the world.

**** I mean it might depend on personality. Grindelwald really believed in his cause that wizards are superior to muggles and the only place he didn't touch, according to the books (didn't see the movies) was Britain because he was scared of confronting Dumbledore. Voldemort, from all the hints we get in the books, was not really so tied to a cause as much as he used it for his gains (he's a half-blood and it's mentioned that at some point he tried to recruit Lily... not to mention that he is perfectly fine with dealing with giants and werewolves and the scourge of society in general and for all we know, say, he appealed to the werewolves' disdain for wizards and that's another cause he used for his gain) and his hunger for power. Voldemort doesn't really seem to care about expanding outside of Britain, or even expanding at all. He doesn't take the position as Minister of Magic and based on accounts from both the First and the Second Wizarding War, he tends to operate in the shadows, while allowing his more prominent followers to run amok. Voldemort, in my opinion, only cares about achieving god-like status: overcoming boundaries, discovering new magic, taking down and installing governments on a whim. Hell, he doesn't even have a home but stays at the Death Eaters' places. He's more like a mad scientist than a revolutionary leader (as Grindelwald).
