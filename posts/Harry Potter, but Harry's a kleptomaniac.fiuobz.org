You heard me. It's Harry, but he's a kleptomaniac.

He can go to Slytherin, Gryff, Huffle or the Ravens. I don't care, I just wanna see Harry steal. A lot.

He sees the wrapped up stone and steals it from Hagrid, or he makes it down to the chamber to face Voldemort except he's there for the stone. He sides with Voldemort or something.\\
I don't care, just gimmie some juicy stealing.

  Harry learned to steal very early by living at the Dursleys. It was the only way to get enough food.But after awhile he doesn´t only steal for his own good anymore. He isn´t even sure himself why he steals some of the things he is stealing. Now he goes to Hogwarts and has to balance his need for attention and inability to stop stealing with finally finding friends and discovering the wonders of magic. In addition there is something misterious guarded in the school. Surely it can´t hurt to steal it if he gave it back afterwards?

  What would happen if the Dursleys abandoned Harry Potter before he could attend school? What kind of problems would a street wise, self-reliant, and Slytherin Harry could create?
