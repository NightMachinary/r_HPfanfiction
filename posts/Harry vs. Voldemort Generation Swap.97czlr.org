Just had an idea and I'm wondering if it's been done before!

Basically, Harry is the one who grows up in WW2 era and lives a basically normal life, and Tom is born in 1980.

Their roles are the same --- Voldemort, the dark lord, and Harry the prophesied hero. I imagine Voldemort, powerful and fresh out of Hogwarts, just beginning to enforce his ideals and striking blows against the ministry and stuff, and older Harry being personally drawn into the conflict when Voldemort discovers the prophecy.

If it hasn't been done, can you send any recs where Harry grew up in a different era?

Thanks in advance!


** Voldemort would have had to discover some BS tier magic to get that strong that quickly. I'm thinking... destructive legilimency. The ability to not just read minds but to steal experiences so that their skills and abilities are now his. This kills the victim.

**** My alternate idea was stealing the knowledge and experience that portraits had accumulated. That would also lead to a meteoric rise in ability for someone attending Hogwarts.

***** The portraits would become just a hair less lifeless throughout the years and Tom might hear occasional whispers from some of them in his head. Would be great!

**** It shows up in linkffn(11973480) as an explanation as to why SPOILER (harrymort is able to know so much stuff). SPOILER OFF. (idk how to do spoiler tags). Rest of the story is a complete tech-uplift fest for GoT, so if you like that, go for it, otherwise, now you know.

  Reborn after my embarrassing fall at Godric's Hollow as the Potter brat was an interesting experience. Getting sorted into Hufflepuff, even more so. But reborn as the Lord of Winterfell in Westeros as my playground? Now that was new, even to a retired Dark Lord.

****** It's where modern or semi modern technology ( guns, industrial manufacturing, concrete, etc) are introduced by the protagonist. GoT fiction has a habit of doing this with self inserts and fan favorite characters (mostly Tyrion).

** the ones where i've seen harry grow up in Voldemort's era, Voldemort and him are in an amiable relationship. I like your idea of a role swap. Although it sounds like Harry would end up being similar to canon's Dumbledore. Although it could still be cool to see done out

** Damn, I need this :0

I also feel like it would be more balanced than canon. I mean, I have this notion that Tom was always a powerful little genius, while Harry is more of an average student under special circumstances, so a young adult Tom vs an experienced auror Harry sound great!

*** Yeah, that was what I was going for! Harry's win in canon was pretty much blind luck. I know that was the point, but a more balanced battle between the two would be fun to see.

And for older Harry to have grown up while Grindelwald was in power (not old enough to be part of the battle, but old enough to remember) and then see history starting to repeat itself would lend itself for some really good introspection and character moments, I think.

** could be a solution to the power and experience differential in canon: older Harry has a lot of experience but maybe not Voldemorts raw power, Voldemort is powerful and smart but lacks experience... -> "Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance." - David Mamet

** linkffn(Realignment)

Adult Harry time travels to the 1940s, now it's the young boy Tom Riddle with support from Dumbledore against the mysterious dark lord with an obsession to kill him. And Grindelwald is also a thing I guess.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.
