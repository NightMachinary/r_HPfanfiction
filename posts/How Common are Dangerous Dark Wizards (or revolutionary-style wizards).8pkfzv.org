In canon, the only serious wizards (and no witches) we are ever introduced to as anything like a "Dark Lord" are Grindelwald and Voldemort. But how common are dark wizards who try to affect a significant change in the wizarding world, or even simply revolutionaries?

Obviously, they need to be both powerful individuals (or groups) and have some sort of ideology to rally around. Modern revolutions such as the Arab Spring in the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa have shown that if you start a revolution, it will be invariably be co-opted by more organized and motivated groups to push their ideologies. Thus, dark wizards or the like who would want to affect some change would need to have something to rally behind. But we have little to no example besides the two I mentioned.

There are a handful of dark wizards mentioned offhandedly (Emeric the Evil, Herpo the Foul, etc.), but none of them are ever described as changing either the magical or muggle worlds (which prior to the SoS in 1692, were seemingly intertwined to an unknown degree).

Anyway, I just wanted to get some opinions from people regarding this.


** Its possible that Grindelwald was the first Dark Wizard to demonstrate the ambition to take over the world, and gain significant traction in said goal, while Voldemort outclassed him in depravity. While Voldemort appeared to keep his ambitions limited to Britain, he also used far more of the twisted side of the Dark Arts (Horcruxes, Inferi, everything *around* the Horcruxes, etc.)

Grindelwald was an ideological revolutionary, Voldemort was a power hungry terrorist, all previous Dark Wizards in history were more like serial killers or warlords.

** Not many, from canon. There were powerful Dark Wizards in the past, but they were either more Bellatrix than Voldemort, causing damage on a small scale without a grand agenda (like Emeric the Evil, Herpo the Foul and Salazar Slytherin), or they were content to establish themselves as the uncontested lord of a small domain (like Raczidian and Ekrizdis) without attempting to take over the world at large.

*** Something about that seems off. The dark arts and dark magic seem to be an inseparable part of the history of the magical world. Part of me wonders if its not so much that revolutionary wizards and witches (dark or not) are not that common and more that most of them *won*.

I am reminded of the famous quote by Napolean Boneparte, that "history is a set of lies we have all agreed to." The key point about Voldemort and Grindelwald is that they lost, while Dumbledore and Harry won. Perhaps its that the dark wizards/witches won and re-spun the way things are, and painted themselves as the morally correct and the best hope for the future.

Within canon, magic seems to be able to re-shape entire ideas and concepts of reality; it would hardly be that surprising if a revolutionary took over or affected a significant political change, then either eliminated their opposition or anyone with disparate opinions.

On a similar note, revolutionaries or terrorist leaders today and in the past have generally been highly educated, literate, and well-versed controlling people, while they are generally followed by the unruly, thuggish, or the "proletariat." Since intellect and knowledge also translates in the magical world to being the most powerful/skilled in a lot of cases, there is the double attraction of followers to the fact that these revolutionaries are also the most powerful. It seems likely that most powerful wizards or witches, unless their is someone who far outclasses them, end up in positions of either authority over others or attempting to gain power through alternate means.

I suppose thats the reason nobody but Voldemort rose to power in the wake of Grindelwald's play for power. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort so outclass anyone else that nobody would try to change the way things are. Their like magical versions of tactical nukes: if they exist, the world invariably has to follow/obey them /unless/ you have your own to oppose them.

**** History is written by the winners.

Maybe in the Magical World, that may be more literal. A healthy overdose of memory charms and your uppity new "dark lord" wouod be no more.

Edit: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners][Written by the winners]] is a common trope too.

***** The phrase "history is written by the victors," was actually a rephrasing of Winston Churchill. He more or less stated that "I know history will treat my kindly, because I will be writing it." But Churchill wrote that after World War 1...when he was fired. He wrote that in his memoir's to /defend/ himself.

The message was not that history is written by the victors. The message is history was written by /authors and writers/.

Let me give you an example: Marc Antony. After Octavian defeated Antony's fleet at the Battle of Actium and subsumed full control of the empire, he wanted to completely cement control of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty as rulers of Rome. To that end, he attempted to systematically purge all mention and memory of the existence of Marc Antony. A bit difficult, given the level of impact the man had, but he was fairly successful.

So how do we know about him then? Well, mainly because of Suetonius, writing centuries later on the twelve caesars, mentions how Octavian defeated his opponents, as well as mentions by other authors in history including /Julius Caesar himself/ in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars (if you haven't read that, I highly recommend it).

Victors don't write history, but they do try to influence or control it. Writers and scholars end up deciding what we call history. Octavian himself had the Aeneid written by Vergil to establish his own semi-divinity and descent from the mythical founders of Rome Romulus and Remus. But he didn't write it himself, that was Vergil, who included numerous comments in the work at the fact this was all made-up for Octavian.

In this regard, the Romans actually had A LOT in common with the various Chinese, Egyptian and Byzantine dynasties. In those cases, the new dynasty ruling (either by political or violent means) would typically commission a history to be written about their dynasties rise to power decades or centuries later. It makes sense, after all you want to establish how you deserve the position don't you?

There were several problems with this though. First, often more than one history was written at the time, and typically the one's commissioned by the leadership tend to not only be the /least/ trusted by historians now and in the past (the best historical evidence is usually from outside perspectives). Second, if a new dynasty takes over, you typically want to get rid of the previous histories so you can establish your own right to rule and write your own history.

This is why the only record of the rise of the Tatars under Ghengis Khan, despite it being one of the top ten most important events in the last millenium, is only recorded in one text, The Secret History of the Mongols.

In regard to your point of the magical world, I will give you some speculation. The thing is, even in canon the wizarding world seems to be largely isolated and cutoff, at least compared to the muggle equivalents. That makes sense, magic makes people incredibly self-sufficient. The dark wizards of the past frankly resemble more than anything the various territorial feudal lords and warlords in medieval Europe than anything else. Their objectives seem to have been to make themselves ruler of their small fiefdom or tribe. Why would they care about ruling or becoming king, when every wizard/witch can do pretty much anything they want anyway. They /seem/ to have been focused on increasing their ability to not be taken out by muggle forces (numbers) or other magicals with a bone to pick.

And if you need a better example of what I have described in changing history and controlling information, I invite you to consider "The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts." A book that seems to describe the history of dark magic use, but is obviously written by someone who wants to paint their use as wrong or immoral. *If I used dark magic to take over, this is exactly the book I would commission to be written: so nobody could do the same thing to me.*

** Given the existence of Aurors on top of Hit Wizards, there are enough Dark wizards to require a dedicated force to oppose them. Most aren't revolutionaries in the way Grindlewald and Voldemort were, but that may simply be because the power gap prevents them from even trying. The only wizards we know are close to that level of power were Bellatrix and Amelia Bones, so it's pretty rare.

** I would say we see 3, maybe 4 very powerful wizards in the 55 years from 1945-2000. Voldemort, Grindelwald, Albus, and Harry.

Albus, Gellert, and Voldemort are all very powerful. Voldemort and Grindelwald certainly fullfill the Dark Lord requirement, Albus we don't know for sure, but considering the incredible amount of power he wields it certainly can be argued he was at the very least a "Lord".

Harry essentially has Britain on its knees at the end of Book 7. He could very easily follow in the footsteps of Dumbledore securing political power for decades to come.

4 very influential wizards in 50 years certainly points to the fact that this is common. To respond to [[/u/Achille-Talon/][u/Achille-Talon/]] we only see a "few" from canon as canon is from the POV is Harry. He is far from a historian.

A key thing to remember: These wizards we see are only ones that affect Britain, not the magic world as a whole.

*** Which is what I was sort of wondering about in this whole post to be honest. If you see my response to [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]], I pointed out that it seems likely that dark wizards or revolutionaries rise more frequently than we are made aware of in canon. I will restate my earlier point below:

The gist being that the last fifty years before canon are a period of unnatural peace in their world, because these three so overmatched their opposition there was no point in other powerful wizards/witches attempting to gain power and/or influence the world.

** I believe that there were quite a few, but that the wizarding world likes to forget about them and tries to downplay their power and impact in their history books.

IIRC voldemort is called the most powerful dark wizard of all time, and he seems to be on par with Dumbledore, so that's quite a lot of power indeed, but I can't help thinking that there must have been dozens of wizards on or above Dumbledore's level over the past millennia, and some of them were probably dark/evil. In terms of political power, Voldemort never expanded outside Great Britain, and even there he used terrorist style attacks and imperiused ministry workers instead of risking open war. Grindelwald's campaign in mainland Europe on the other hand was called a "global wizarding war" and it is probably safe to assume that Grindelwald and his followers heavily influenced WW2. While the number of Grindelwald's followers is unknown, they are regularly called an "army", and dominated Europe for quite some time. Compare that to about 30 death eaters Voldemort brought to the battle of Hogwarts.

I think it would make sense for people to forget about dark wizards that came long before them, and most of them wouldn't have involved Great Britain anyways. Voldemort happened in very recent history, every British non-muggleborn wizard alive either experienced his reign of terror or had parents who did. The extraordinary cruelty of Voldemort and his followers probably helped creating the image of an all-powerful Dark Lord.

** Well, it all depends on your definition of "dark wizardry." If it is use of dark magic, then literally everyone who made it through Hogwarts is a dark wizard/witch. This is absurd, so it would be those who use the Dark Arts. So it depends on how common the Dark Arts are. I'd guess that the number of dark witches/wizards we see in canon are probably how many there may be at a given time, but what makes them so different is how they have rallied to Voldemort's banner, as it were.
