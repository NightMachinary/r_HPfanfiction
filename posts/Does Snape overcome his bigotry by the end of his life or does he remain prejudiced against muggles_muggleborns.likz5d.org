** Snape is very complicated.

In his teens he began to buy into Voldemort's spiel because he hated his abusive muggle father. His father sucked, and Voldemort offered a way to be more powerful than his father. That is a very tempting offer for any abuse victim.

But he also had strong cognitive dissonance because he loved Lily more than anyone else. Lily was Special. She was Apart.

Then Voldemort targeted Lily and the mirror cracked and Snape saw a little more clearly how deceived he'd been. I doubt it hit him like a thunderclap, but he likely over the years that followed came to understand that he'd been victimised by a powerful man.

By the time the events of the books happened, Snape no longer seemed to think that Muggles were all inherently /bad/ like Tobias was. But he was somewhat indifferent to them. He certainly did not feel that muggleborns were any less wizards than purebloods, though he kept that relatively quiet. Any time he insults a muggleborn student, it's always to do with their appearance or skills, never their lineage.

TLDR: Snape is the master of cognitive dissonance and likely has internally distanced himself from the whole debate

*** Yeah, I'd agree with this. He logically understands that Muggle-borns aren't worth any less than others, but he enjoys the feeling of superiority because he doesn't have a healthy sense of self-worth. It's how a lot of people get trapped in problematic world views.

****** How can he be a spy if he /is/ indifferent to muggleborns? Why would he continue to gamble everything if he didn't care?

Irl spies usually care a great deal about the people they are spying on behalf of, but they are able to “shut down” that part of themselves when they are “on the job”.

Snape has what is called /cognitive dissonance/, which is a series of conflicting beliefs all coexisting. Dumbledore is right and wrong. Muggleborns are equal and they are not. Muggles are evil and they are not. Lily is Better Than Everyone - but Lily is a Mudblood.

If a person with cognitive dissonance examines any of their beliefs too closely, they tend to have a crisis. Which is /exactly/ what happened when he was forced to face a conflict in his beliefs when Lily was threatened.

So he doesn't examine his beliefs too closely unless he's forced to, and they all exist together in a big contrary soup.

If you're asking why he had cognitive dissonance as an adult - it's because we don't leave our flaws behind when we turn 17. Why didn't Snape become a perfect being with no mental flaws as an adult? Because he was human.

** I've never really viewed him as someone who is a 'muggle born bigot' as much as he was a victim of peer pressure. Not that this excuses what he's done, he was a bad person, but not for his views. There is likely some bigotry against muggles from the way he grew up, and his experience with muggles being generally negative. However, I think that his joining the death eaters and his activities during this time, was more a symptom of the people that he spent time with during school, and less because of his view on muggle-born.

****** No, they're not the same person. Some portraits are of fictional people to begin with (God help us all if Sir Cadogan was really real).

They're more of a reflection of the person was at the time the portrait was made--it's tradition that the headmaster speaks with his or her portrait so that they know as much as possible.

It's not a ghost. It's more of a mirror.

** I don't think he ever was really prejudiced against muggleborns, he's a half blood himself and he knew Lily well.

I think he went along with the junior Death Eaters to gain power and protection because no one was protecting him. From there he became a Death Eater because all of his friends were and how could he say no to that kind of power.

** While I wouldn't exactly consider Snape a nice person, I don't think he ever was a Muggleborn bigot, even at his worst when he was a Death Eater. He was a halfblood himself after all, and didn't care about Lily being a Muggleborn. I do think he was prejudiced against Muggles, as a result of the experiences he had as a kid (Tobias and Petunia, and I doubt Spinner's End was the nicest neighborhood you could be part of), however, although I figured he got over it eventually. Not because he started caring for Muggles, but more on an intellectual level ("why would they be any different?") after seeing what the Wizarding World itself had to offer, from the best to the worst.

Yeah, he used terms like Mudblood and such in his youth, but I think it was mostly just to fit in with his other Slytherin housemates. I don't think he ever truly believed they were inferior.

To answer your question: somewhat, but not entirely. He stops calling them mudbloods, but he still appears to enjoy the company of the Malfoys and such.

** He wasn't against Muggles and Muggleborns as much as people would think. If I'm not mistaken, his father was extremely cold, so he probably didn't know how to voice his opinions--or, at worst, was verbally, mentally, and probably physically abused if he did. His mom wasn't "Mom of the Year" material either, so Lily was his only friend and person who he could trust. Enter Hogwarts, and he probably viewed Slytherin as a way to "bring honor to his family."

But at the end of the day, he is willing to die to get rid of Voldemort, so it's definitely safe to assume he changed his views
