And it makes me so fucking frustrated! I want to just be able to write, to create but I can't get past the “ooh, Hermione / Star Trek 2009 would be cool!” Or “Hermione in the new X-Men would be great!” “Or even an OFC in X-Men..” “or what about Hermione in the Marauders era!!”

I just can't get past this step. Does anyone have any tips? :(


** I mean, there's no real harm in choosing any idea over another, so just get over this analysis paralysis by writing these ideas down and throwing darts or something. Then write a snippet, or begin the story, and then decide if you like it.

** That's a fine step though. If you want to write them, just /start/ and see where your mind takes you, just don't post it until you can see a plot you like forming.

Writing's for fun so take your ideas and role with them.

** Go to [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] and write stuff in response to random requests, and when you find something that you liked writing and that would be a good match for a HP story idea just go from there. I've seen stuff like that happen, though not necessarily with fanfics: one of the authors whose snippets I liked and followed went on to make one of them into a whole series and then into a book that's actually being sold and that I think is worth the money.

Alternatively, just pick whichever idea and start writing, even if you start at some random scene that's twenty chapters into the story, and let actually writing it speed you up to the point where you can write your chapter one.

** Start writing these. You will realise that most of these ideas aren't feasible, the novelty wears off or you don't have more than one or two scenes thought out either way. Keep these fragments around and sorted (give each a descriptive name, 1 folder for crossovers, one for Harry Potter stuff, one for each other fandom) because you might get some inspiration for one of them half a year later.

That is pretty much the thing I do, and I have like 30 of these plot bunnies on my GDrive, and maybe 5 of them will eventually be published. You will eventually notice which ideas have merit and which are just some random thought which went nowhere.
