When Draco died in the room of requirement in the fiendfyre, he thought he would maybe see his friends again? However, faith, death or whatever higher power wouldn't have it. Imagine his surprise when he gets reborn. Not as the heir of the house of Malfoy, but wait.. Red hair, a hand me down crib, too many siblings to count.. MUST BE A WEASLEY.

Or, Draco gets reborn as a Weasley and gets a second chance. Would be kinda a crack fic


** One of the next-gen Weasleys would be fine. Or even genderbender into Rose/ Victoire Weasley.
