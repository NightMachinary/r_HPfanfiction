Seeing as my presented idea is inexplicably popular in that thread, I'd like to ask if anyone knows any fics where the protagonists oppose the very notion that a lycanthropy infection changes a person, and work to spread that idea (and change wizarding society to make things better for victims of lycanthropy) in order to undermine Fenrir Greyback's (and other bad werewolves) radicalism before they can amass enough numbers to start a pandemic.
