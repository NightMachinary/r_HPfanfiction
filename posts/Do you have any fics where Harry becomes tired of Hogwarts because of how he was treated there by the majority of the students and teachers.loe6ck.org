** linkffn(The Power of Paranoia) has Harry dip out of Britain after he thinks Death Eaters are watching Privet Drive during the summer before fifth year. Its fun but old and so some of the tropes it uses are a little tired now, but I still enjoy a reread from time to time.

  With Professor Snape's hateful and cruel words towards her, Hermione's trust in authority figures comes crashing down for good. She begins to question the adults' response to Harry's forced entry into the Triwizard Tournament and concludes that it's up to her to keep him safe. And if they have to leave the country to escape the madness of Hogwarts and Magical Britain, so be it.
