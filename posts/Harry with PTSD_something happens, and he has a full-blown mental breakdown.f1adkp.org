*** A good guilty pleasure fic!

Warning, however, there is a lot of James, Lily, Ron, and Ginny bashing. /A lot./

**** I would argue that there's a lot of James and Lily bashing. Ron and Ginny, spoilers obviously, are affected by the war very differently than Harry and are looking for different things in their life. They go after those things and when alt-harry's lies are all exposed they do the right thing and drop him. They absolutely get bashed but I wouldn't call it as badly as James and Lily.

**** Best way I can think to describe this is a WBWL fic without the the WBWL plot. Also Harry's issues aren't magically solved but something that him and Hermione have to deal with.

**** Hmm, well what I do when I run of a specific trope, like let's say time travel. I always add a tag to the trope, like if i'm searching Draco time travel, then I'd add Gryffindor Draco Malfoy and do on.

Perhaps with your PTSD fics you can add a relationship, certain bashing's, and the suicidal thoughts tag, and warnings such as graphic depictions of violence.

  There is but one way to keep a secret: you lie. But how many lies can you tell, how many secrets can you keep, and at the cost of what? Harry's nightmares are back, and he finally decides that they're taking control of his life; he needs to do something bout them. And in the process of getting rid of them, who does he end up meeting but Mind-Healer Draco Malfoy?
