Any fic with Harry as a seer or medium or anything like that. Preferably something long and slash or gen but I'll read anything that's well written. I've recently reread The Emperor And The Star by Wynnebat again and I've become obsessed with divination in the hp universe

  It wasn't until she was eleven that Harriet Potter learned magic was real. It will be years more before she'll learn that she is more than a witch. Daughter of Loki Harriet's heritage is a mix of three races. A witch, a Jotunn, and a goddess all, her blood is special. Voldemort has no idea what he's getting himself into using this particular enemy's blood for his resurrection.

** Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky It's a Harry/Tom fanfic were Harry is a seer and it's amazing. Harry has a hard time differentiating between his visions in the story because so many different realities are being projected towards him. For example he sees the reality in which Voldemort kills him but on the other hand in his own reality Tom and him are friends and so things start to become blurred after a while.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Arcana)

this one features a Harry with seer abilities that are basically all-encompassing, and he's kinda-sorta trained by another seer. lots of Led Zeppelin lyrics and mainstream tarot interpretations.

  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.
