Hey all been reading Some OP/powerful Harry fics recently (you know the ones where he's the heir of the four founds and is a prodigy in all magic) and a lot of them have “Parsel magic” but it's more so just “oh yeah Harry can do Parsel magic it's super cool” and then it's never talked about again because the fics just have too much crammed into them. So now Im trying to hunt down some decent story's where Parsel magic is either a central part or maybe used more then just once after it's mentioned. Anyone know of anything like this?


** Parselmagic crops up in most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey's]] Harry/Voldemort fics. It's very important to the plot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of Old Laws]] both fall into the "used more then just once after it's mentioned" category, though it's a minor part of the story in both cases.

*** Sorry to hijack your comment, but somehow the reply button does not work on OPs post but on yours and others.

[[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/]] This fic has Parseltongue/magic as a central part of it.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

*** Did you mean by blueowl? That's the only story titled “to shape and change” I've found. Gatewaygirl has three HP fics did you mean one of those? Edit: I've started “To shape and change” by blueowl and it looks like that's the one you meant, again thanks for the suggestion it's turning out quite good so far.

**** It doesn't have the greatest grammar or characterisation, but the story is about 700k words so you really see the characters and writing develop as the story evolves.
