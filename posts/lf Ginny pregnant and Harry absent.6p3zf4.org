I read this fic a couple years ago I believe. It was only one or two chapters. It happened after hogwarts. Ginny was pregnant, but Harry didn't want kids, so he left her. I remember a scene where Ginny takes a bath after doing some gardening while heavily pregnant. They reunite in the end. Thank you!
