Cliches are the way they are because someone did it well and everybody copied them. What are the shining gems of othewise cliche-riddled, bland stories?

To be clear, I'm asking for stories that take a cliche trope, play is straight, and do something entertaining with it anyway. Subversions and parodies are also welcome, but are not what I'm primarily after.


** Harry dosed with love potion: linkffn(An Hour of Wolves). It handles the subject of rape very well, Harry is in character, his thought process is devastating and believable.

If you're open to OC, blood magic is part of my own linkffn(13098062). It has limits and severe consequences.

  Harry's doing just fine: being Quidditch Captain and 'the Chosen One' doesn't leave him with time to worry about much besides school and the growing threat of war. He's especially not worrying about the fact that Sirius is dead. Or about an embarrassing, uncomfortable night with a classmate he'd rather just forget. Really. He's fine.

  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.

** linkffn(What's Her Name in Hufflepuff by ashez2ashes) An OC self insert ends up in the Harry Potter world and befriends a bunch of side characters.

Surprisingly well written and entertaining. I don't usually like self inserts, but this story was quite fun to read. I especially like how things don't always go the way the SI thinks they will and that she doesn't become insanely OP or become part of the trio while experiencing canon events scene by scene.

linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel)

Umbridge finds the Harry Potter books and ends up reading them in front of the entire school. A good take on the reading the books trope.

linkffn(In Blood Only by E.M. Snape)

Snape is Harry's father. This does not make him super nice, a good father figure or make him change his mind about hating Harry in the first place.

** linkffn(11591125)

Part 1 of a series that contains the classic extreme focus on the Dursley's abuse and Harry getting really involved in pureblood culture. Also has Harry learning magic extremely fast and finding a portrait to help him in the chamber of secrets. This is a guilty pleasure fic for me, because I usually hate these tropes.

** Severitus:

For the wholesome, good writing, feel-good story: linkffn(The Best Revenge)

For a for grudging Snape: linkffn(Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof)

Lord Potter: This fic is pretty well-known, has incredible worldbuilding and also features WBWL. Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin).

I'd like to think my series, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) also handles Lord Potter well. It also features a Slytherin!Trio.

Linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw) throws loads of tropes in and manages to create a rather entertaining story. Some of the main features include: do-over Harry, enormous trunks, Harry with a lordship, WBWL, and harem!Harry

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Gen. Harry has reached a very bitter thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the pure-blood bigotry. Then he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear down the system and salt the earth.
