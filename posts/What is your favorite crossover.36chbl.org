[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6353083/1/][Sword and Magic]] is an HP/Star Wars crossover. Really, really good. Also abandoned. There are like 3 other people who have tried to adopt this fic, with varying degrees of success.

** Ooh oh. I love this game.

Obviously, as it's my favourite story ever then my favourite crossover is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes]]. It's just lovely and with a better ending it would pretty much be perfect. It's a HP/Firefly story.

Obviously /the/ HP/Avengers crossover needs to be mentioned, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] is great.

But those are too obvious. Everyone knows them. What about:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10552630/1/Harry-s-Trek][Harry's Trek]] (HP/Star Trek). A fun little crossover in which nothing ground-breaking or galaxy-shattering happens but which is simply well written. As with many of this author's stories it's basically a pure romance story but it's very enjoyable and it never drags.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10568823/1/Average][Average]] (HP/NCIS). Perhaps a strange choice as it feels like a HP crossover in name only. Still, the character interactions are nice and the author has done a good job of the secret agent stuff.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] (HP/Mass Effect). A very good story. If only the ending didn't feel so contrived it would be amazing. It's a pity the author decided to lay the groundwork for a sequel and then didn't follow up. It makes it feel unfinished.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10016768/1/Discordant][Discordant]] (HP/Star Wars). A very good story that I'm sad seems to be abandoned. Avoids most of the normal pitfalls of a HP/Star Wars story and comes out all the better for it.

There's a few more I've enjoyed which I wish had continued just a little further:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4990751/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slayer-Dimension][Harry Potter and the Slayer Dimension]] (HP/Buffy). Well written story. Not being wholly familiar with Buffy I don't know what story it follows but I just wish it had followed up more on the Harry/Buffy undertones.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10951863/1/The-Lonely-Company][The Lonely Company]] (HP/LotR). I was so excited when this appeared and updated so quickly. It's such a pity the author rarely seems to complete stories and has already lost interest in this one. The world needs more Harry LotR in it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8879660/1/Doomsman-s-Herald][Doomsman's Herald]] (HP/LotR). It's Morta's Priest. 'nuff said. He needs to get off his arse and write more of it though!

There's more but I'm on mobile so that's as much as I can manage for the time being. I like Crossovers.

EDIT: Dumping some more:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince that was Promised]], being re-written as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] (HP/aSoIaF). I hope the author hasn't gotten bored of it again.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]] (HP/Hobbit). A bit of a bizarre choice I'll admit. Very questionable concept but written so well I stopped caring some time ago.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10477045/1/Harry-Potter-The-Avenger][Harry Potter: The Avenger]] (HP/Avengers). Another kb0 story and mostly similar review as for Harry's Trek. Not so sure about the characterization of Black Widow but I'll live with it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] (NP/NCIS). Another NCIS cross and fairly similar to the last. But I still enjoyed it.

EDIT 2: It's nice seeing my own story on someone-else's favourites. If you like Shadow of Angmar then I have other stuff that, while not as good, might keep someone amused for a while (Self-plug warning):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10659456/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Queen][Harry Potter and the Sun Queen]] (HP/Tomb Raider). For a while it had been sitting without updates but I'm determined to never leave a planned story unfinished. Fairly early days.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man][A New Man]] (HP/Avengers). Very much inspired by Wand and Shield and also early days.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]] (HP/LotR). My first completed fic and you can tell.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11120132/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elves-Most-Fabulous][Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous]] (HP/LotR). In my opinion a fic of very questionable quality but some people seems to find it jolly funny so I'll put it here too.

#+begin_quote
  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

Long chapters, well written, and reliably updated.

  A bout of not-accidental magic transports six-year old Jasmine Potter to the Elemental Nations, where she becomes a member of one of Konoha's clans and finally creates bonds with new friends. fem!Harry. Warning: Abuse in chapter one, mentions of abuse in following chapters.
#+end_quote

I'm not entirely sure that this one can be classed as a crossover after the first chapter, but it's not finished yet so maybe there'll be more down the line.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11063266/1/Haruno-Potter][Haruno-Potter]] (HP/Naruto)

#+begin_quote
  When Harry comes home after his fifth year, still reeling from Sirius' death, only to find that the Dursleys are mistreating yet another child, he decides to take his young cousin Sakura and adopt her himself. [Inspired by the original FFN story by RuneWitchSakura, which was reposted on AO3 by Ookamijudge.]

Only two chapters so far and it seems a little bashy of Dumbledore but there's a kind of fluffy sweetness to it that's a nice break from the usual grit. Looking forward to more.

Hasn't been updated in a while but still good. The most favourited HP/Bleach story on FFN.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7197392/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Bleached-Phoenix][Harry Potter and the Order of the Bleached Phoenix]] (HP/Bleach)

  Due to an old Friendship between two meddling old men, Ichigo Kurosaki and Company end up at Hogwarts. The mission: protect Harry Potter! Primarily Bleach Characters interacting with the Wizarding World. Rating changed to M to be safe.

The first in a series, it's a bit cliche; has something of a 'Japan fixes everything' feel to it, but I still enjoy it. Shamelessly IchiRuki and I'm okay with that.

I went on a bit of a HP/Anime crossover binge recently.

** A couple of old ones I loved ages and ages ago:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186688/1/Little-Harry-and-the-Mirkwood-Adventure][Little Harry and the Mirkwood Adventure]] - HPThe Hobbit crossover. Seven year old Harry Potter, along with an unexpected someone, falls into Mirkwood Forest just as Bilbo and the dwarves defeat the spiders.

Notes: this is a really old kid fic, posted well before the Hobbit movies came out. I can not speak to how well it has held up. There was one update in 2013, but before that it had been years, so I would call it abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2134100/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Attack-of-the-Clones][Harry Potter and the Attack of the Clones]] - Harry thought his life complete when he vanquished Voldemort. He couldn't be more far from the truth, for he is thrown into a galaxy far, far away and into a time long ago to begin anew. A Star Wars Crossover.

Notes: an even older crossover and certainly abandoned. I remember reading this as it came out and loved it a lot. Again I can't speak to how it has held up, but I loved it back in my college days.

A hopefully less abandoned WIP is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]]. Summary: I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift. A HP/SW xover.

I didn't really take into account that many were abandoned. There are more, not-abandoned fics on my ff.net profile favorites, which is linked in the bottom of the description.

** I completely adore the Pureblood Pretense and its sequels by murkybluematter. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/murkybluematter]] It's a crossover between Harry Potter and Alana the Lioness, but you dont have to have read Alana the Lioness to enjoy it. She somehow mixed the plotline in a way that even knowing the series back to front, i still dont know what will hapen next. I cant recomend this fic enough. It's WIP but she seems to be updating monthly. Its fem!harry which i don't typically like, but she delves so deep into a completely original plotline and perspective of the world that I don't mind. It's AU, taking place in a world that has Tom Riddle and his political party have 'saved their world' by uninviting non purebloods to Hogwarts and so on. Genuinely the best fanfic I've had the fortune of finding. Not really any grammar mistakes. A really good read.
