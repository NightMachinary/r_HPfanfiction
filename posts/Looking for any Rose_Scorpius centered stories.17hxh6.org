** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4828161/1/Our-Little-Secret][Our Little Secret]] is really excellent. There are sequels, but I don't think they're as good. Draco is avoiding his grandfather so he goes to Rose's house for the holidays under the guise of dating her.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7357464/1/Tensions-and-Tea-Leaves][Tensions and Tea Leaves]] is pretty light but fun. Rose is a seer but doesn't realize it and thinks Divination is crap.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6136710/1/I-ll-Do-The-Dishes][I'll Do the Dishes]] is set after Hogwarts. Rose is a wizarding party planner and planning Albus' wedding. Guess who's best man?

This has become one of my favorite ships to read, so I have more recommendations if you want them.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290483][Morocco]] is a great action read. Stellar writing quality, makes it feel just like an action flick. Plot tapers down somewhat toward the end, but very fun nonetheless. The author has at least one more completed R/S.

momotwins also has a whole running series of Rose/Scorpius that she regularly updates. It starts with [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=267031][Just Another Midnight Run]], which I haven't read yet but I've read some of her other stories.

I wrote one - it's one of my older stories - called [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288436][Unraveling]], which I still very much like, but it's not the most romantic.

If you're up for a little friendly parody of Rose/Scorpius, there's also [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=117659][A Cautionary Tale]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=281828][Romeo and Juliet]].

If you like ships with Rose/Teddy or Scorpius/Anyone Else or just next gen in general, I can rec some more stories. *edit: accidentally a word.

*** I'm currently in the middle of Morocco and I love it, so hopefully the ending is just as good and I didn't realize the author had another which I will be checking out. Looks like momotwins does a lot with the r/s relationship so I'll definitely be looking into those along with your story and the other two mentioned. Thank you! Better get started reading!

** The most popular one I'm aware of is [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=240987][Delicate]], on HPFF. It's been at the top of the site's "most read" list for years.

*** Yeah! That's one of the ones that really got me into the rose/scorpius pairing. I liked that and it's sequel Still Delicate
