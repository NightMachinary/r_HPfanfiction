Neville Longbottom failed.

The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. Destined to stand as the Dark Lords equal and vanquish him once and for all... he allowed fame to go to his head and squandered every opportunity he was given to save his world. Fate, as it was known for, would not allow its careful machinations to be ruined by something as pathetic as "human error". Thus, Neville's soul was whisked away from the scene of his brutal execution to his seven year old body, ready to use his knowledge and experience to fulfil his destiny this time around.

H O W E V E R . . .

Unfortunately for Neville, Fate held no faith in his abilities. Remembering that it wasn't just he who had squandered their life, but also its (usually) preferred champion. Thus it plucked a drifting soul of Harry Potter (one of the more skilled and actually successful ones) to send back alongside the failed Neville. Far more skilled, far more capable and very ready to do what Neville could not. Though, there wasn't a "Harry" in this timeline, but a "Harriet". And Fate saw no reason to change that.

Fastforward to 1991, September. Neville has made his own shaky preperations for the fight to come and enters the Hogwarts express ready to face Quirrel later in the year. His attention, however, is on Harriet. The gorgeous scion of the Potter family, an immensely talented Seeker and, in his previous life, his one true love. Doting on her siblings and nuzzling up to her parents just as he'd remembered all those years ago.

He quickly realised this was not the same girl. And Neville Longbottom found his careful schemes (and fragile mind) torn apart as he beheld not the Gryffindor Golden Girl, but the young woman the wizarding world had dubbed: */the Half-blood Princess/*

A girl dedicated to the recreation of House Potter...

▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎▪︎

The story is split between the two "time travellers" perspectives.

- Neville attempts to preserve the timeline as much as possible to ensure he can predict what will happen and act accordingly. Hoping to re-live his life to just make better decisions.

- Harriet is taking a far more proactive approach. She hunts for the Horcruxes early and attempts to stop events before they happen.

Neville is desperately trying to figure out what happened to his true love to make her into this ruthless, family focused witch whilst Harriet is baffled, wondering why Neville of all people is so obsessed with her.

** Merlin's beard, that's one long ass prompt. Kudos for the effort.

So, it's basically Peggy Sue BWL!Neville/Peggy Sue fem!Harry?

*** The idea is that, due to their conflicting ways of saving the future they end up screwing each other over.

And then their own selfish desires (Harriet wants to rebuild the Potter family and protect her parents and siblings above all/Neville wants Harriet, answers as to why she's changed and to not screw up this time around, whilst he suffers from PTSD from the first timeline) they push them into conflict with one another. It's less about the Death Eaters and Voldemort and more about the two of them trying to figure out where they are going wrong.

**** Interesting idea. And I can totally see Harry being focused on his family first (while still being against the death eaters) due to his original childhood. I remember a slightly similar crack fic from a while ago that had multiple people go back and be baffled at how "different" others were since they all went back in different places in their lives (for example, an adult Ron versus a 15 year old Harry time travelling back).

**** Sounds interesting, think it would be better if neither of them ended reviving their original pairings though. Always was something that bothers me in time-travel stories, the characters wouldn't and shouldn't end as they originally did with all the different life-experiences, trying to wrestle them in that roles either-way wouldn't be fair to anyone.

***** They will NOT.

My plan is to have Harriet slowly transition from an anti-hero to (almost) a villain and her relationship is to transition from bemused to outright antagonistic with Neville. With the feeling being mutual.

** This is an interesting promt. Must say, I haven't seen anything like this before.

Although, I would like a couple more details. For example, the stray Harry soul that was picked up. How exactly did this Harry die? If he's so skilled and successful a) how did he die? and b) why would he ever go to hogwarts?

Even without knowing /exactly/ how he died, there are several assumptions one can easily make. That his friends died, for example. Because that's the only way I can see a Harry Potter being broken enough to die. Especially if it's one that's more successful and powerful than the canon one. He got complacent, too cocky. And as a result, he paid the ultimate price. Friends dying due to his hubris. Probably in horrible and extremely painful ways. Then, this extremely hurt Harry Potter could no longer really use his power and was killed by Voldemort.

You could simply have him die in a freak event when he was by himself, but that (imo) is a wasted opportunity.

The severe emotional backlash such a Harry Potter would get once they realised that they are reincarnated, and in a world where the Potters senior survived to boot, is immense. On one hand, you have immense survivors guilt and self-hatred. He /knows/ that he got his friends killed. As such, he wants to distance himself as much as possible from others, in order to "save" them, in his own mind. On the other hand, he can't. Because he lives with the Potters, and he has siblings and /his parents are alive (and he's female to boot!)/. And that many emotions, a stable man (/cough/ woman) they do not make.

(Sidenote: I think it would be better if their souls were instead sent back to their birth, or at least, just Harry's soul. That way there will be no need for any kind of "soul merging" between the old Harriet and the Harry soul. It will allow for memories to form more organically and allow the readers to experience Harry's reactions as he realises how different this reality is)

Harriet is in emotional turmoil. She has no fucking clue what she's supposed to do. She wants to go hunt the horcruxes but she wants to protect her family, and she can't do that if she's far away hunting horcruxes. What if there are even more changes? What if the horcruxes are different? What if Voldemort is even more powerful? Has more followers? She can't take any risks!

Sirius (/Padfoot!/) is alive and a constant fixture of her life. Not to mention her friends. She has no fucking clue what to do with them. She /killed/ them, but they're here, and Nevile is always so nice to her (/all this confidence! Where did it come from?!/) But she /can't/, they will /die/.

​

At least, this is how I see the situation playing out. I really like this promt and it really has a lot of potential for really interesting drama.

*** You've almost hit the nail on the head.

The idea is that Harry was more open to learning (and using) the Dark Arts to fight Voldemort. He got into Spell Modification to try and get an edge by altering the properties and artillery of dark spells. However, despite this people still died and (his emotions tainted by Dark Magic) left him riddled with grief. I've not decided how he died yet but I do like the idea that he continued his experiments and blew himself up (like Pandora Lovegood) after a talk with Luna.

However, I am absolutely married to the idea of Harriet and Neville returning midway through their childhood (partially because of 7's importance in numerology). I want, for Neville's sake, there to be a distinct point where the Harriet he and everyone else recognised disappeared and the new one took over, for when Neville does his own investigations and pieces together what happened.

Harry's guilt massively plays into his (her) decision making and is why she is hellbent on protecting her family. She lost it before she even had it in the original timeline, then she ballsed up saving her friends despite the sacrifices and moral shortcuts she made. Thus she becomes this doting, over protective big sister/daughter willing to do anything. Willing to go a lot further than last time.

I'm also planning on her having a very close relationship to Snape (who is the godfather of one of her younger siblings) and her change of persona is going to make James wary and eventually lead him to catch on to what happened. Though I've not decided if she's using him and hates him or (like in canon) she forgave him and thinks he's brave.

I see the logic in that. Yeah.

They get sent back to when they were 7 years old. Exactly 7 years old. Neville's birthday is at 30th of July. He then meets the old Harriet and everyone else he knew at that age. Then, the next day (31st of July), at Harriets birthday she's catatonic. And he has no clue what happened.

*** Seems like to much needless angst. Harry wouldn't need to have his friends killed to be defeated, could be post-Voldemort while an Auror on mission, as a curse-breaker (always liked this ones) or even due to some big natural catastrophe, there are plenty of other ways for him to die. And his focus on family could easily be explained as a combination of being an orphan and then gaining parents that take great pride on their family history, having seen how his/his children's life's went and thinking it just didn't measure up to what he feels it should be, overprotective instincts to protect the siblings he never had and the parents and uncles (maybe even grandparents, could do with more stories with him interacting with them) that died in his original universe, could go with the old and tried Ginny cheated on Harry and the children weren't his (though preferably with no bashing) or even with a combination of all the above if the author feels like it.

The Hogwarts point honestly seems like it would be the less annoying way for any time-traveling Harry to enter society. Despite what many Indy/genius!Harry stories show, in real life no serious government would let an eleven years-old emancipate himself, realistically the earliest age for any government to even consider it would be fifteen/sixteen and even then only with excellent reasons and proof that the minor could not only provide for themselves, but also take care of all their day-to-day needs and secure an stable income capable of maintaining realistically the average outcome of a person (no, money inherited wouldn't count, no matter how much, it must be an eatable income). Comparatively, by going to Hogwarts not only will he dodge a big legal battle that would probably drag enough to become a moot point but he will also eventually make accountancies with other people of his generation, will later be taken seriously by adults (no self-respecting adult would actually care to listen a ten years-old's opinion on politics to the point of considering implementing their suggestions) and also get to keep his cover as being Harriet (the genius factor would cover for much, knowing everything they teach about magic at Hogwarts while only having a wand for a month isn't among it, at best they would think the Potters are cheating the exam somehow, at worst there would be serious talk about exorcism). In the end of all the options this seems to be the easier, to say nothing about being able to get the diadem Horcrux (maybe also other things?).

I agree with the time traveling being to their baby bodies, if for no other reason than at least to skip the “aged a life in a night” angst plot-line.

**** It's not needless. It's the whole point of the story. Defeating Voldemort in this story is a secondary objective.

It's not about power or knowledge. It's about character. That's why OP also has a different Harry join into a world where the Potters are alive. That's the twist that OP introduced in the time travel trope. The story isn't about having a second chance (with more knowledge) against a powerful opponent.

The story is about two characters. It's about discovering and treasuring family, about two different people that, in their hubris, lost everything and the different ways they deal with their own emotional issues. The main conflict of the story isn't the war against Voldemort (although that adds more substance), it's about the clash of two different ideologies the dual protagonists have adopted.

Harry has a violent background, because Harry/Harriet is the one that represents the "correct" ideology. He is the one that learned the harshest lessons and "grew up" first. Neville still hasn't lost his arrogance, his self-assurance that everything will be fine, if only he tried a little harder. He doesn't yet understand that his way is fundamentally flawed.
