I personally feel the best “redeemed” ending for Voldemort is that he finally welcomed death and no longer afraid of it. He can be forced into corner by some greater power or fell into some horrendous condition because of his own magical experiments. All ships (including slash) welcome, but no fem! Voldemort, no Mpreg, no crack fic. TIA


** I always wondered whether there is any fic (I am sure, there is, there is nothing to be invented in the HP fanfic world), where Voldemort would react affirmatively to this request:

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah, it did,” said Harry. “You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you to think about what you've done. ... Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. ...”

  [...]

  “It's your one last chance,” said Harry, “it's all you've got left. ... I've seen what you'll be otherwise. ... Be a man ... try ... Try for some remorse. ...”
#+end_quote

What if Voldemort tried? Most likely he would die immediately (at least, that is what Hermione's text said happens when the Horcrux maker tries to repent), but perhaps it would be worthy?

** This made me think of a one-shot I once read. Its HpxTmr fic but no mpreg or anything.

Its V tried to make Harry think that soulmates are a thing and eventually won when he made HP switch sides. But V doesn't really love HP and had been lying to him, eventually HP commits suicide. V starts to go crazy, only finding out how much HP has grown on him. V was eventually locked in delusions HP was still alive attacking anyone wgo tried to make him remember, when he ask Snape where HP is. Snape lied and he just went on looking for a dead HP until he looked in the astronomy tower, remembering and jumped off.

** There is this frequently updated fic called the intelligent potter. The last chapter had voldemort sacrificing himself.

It's simple but a well written fic

** Stand against the Moon ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2378855]]) is one of the only Voldemort-Harry pairings I actually like - spoilers, but this does happen to Voldemort later on.

** I've been reading ‘Shogun' and my mind autocompleted ‘Seppuku' after ‘commits' which is funny because thats obviously close to what the title is.

Funny how books really twist your mind.

** Does him swapping sides count? You know that whole soul-split insanity deal? Yeah, Harry fixes that. Riddle fixes things. Manipulative Dumbledore. I would say he was redeemed.

  When Harry is killed by Voldemort in book 7 he wakes up at Kings Cross Station and meets Lily instead of Dumbledore, and she's really angry with him.
