So many times the series seem to have the adults on the sidelines and letting three young kids deal with the hardships, I was wondering if there were any stories where the adults, or a few of them actually helped Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Any rating is fine, would rather it be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femmeslash

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

*** I don't know, I checked this out but the writing feels so dramatic and over the top. I can't really get into it.
