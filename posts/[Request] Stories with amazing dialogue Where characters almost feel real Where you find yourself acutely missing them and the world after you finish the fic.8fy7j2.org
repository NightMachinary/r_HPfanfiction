The Pureblood Pretense [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

The Serpentine Subterfuge [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8239413/1/The-Serpentine-Subterfuge]]

The Ambiguous Artifice [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10041727/1/The-Ambiguous-Artifice]]

The Futile Facade [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11911497/1/The-Futile-Facade]]

Honestly, they read better than the actual HP books. Violet is an incredible writer, and her books are actually book-worthy/publication-worthy.

*** I second this.

The series is incomplete but not abandoned, currently at the start of year 4. I don't usually like reading incomplete works, but this was so, so worth it. If you're looking for characters and settings you'll miss when it's over, look no further.

You'll need to suspend your disbelief at parts, especially near the beginning of year 2, as the main character is extremely precocious, but all that is explained and acknowledged in-story. Stick with it, it's worth it!!

**** I would agree that she is precocious, but not extremely so. At her age (12, I presume), I was in high school (though admittedly, only 9th grade) and doing breast cancer research, so it's not that extraordinary (when you compare it to muggle things). And the author explains it so so well. These characters FEEL like real people. The entire story, all four books (so far), is more than worth the time it takes. Probably worth multiple re-reads too! And she is planning on updating around May-June. And each of the updates/chapters are upwards of 30K words long and more than worth the wait!

***** Good point, I hadn't thought of it in terms of muggle subjects. Not to mention, Harriett is described on multiple occasions to be especially one-track minded in her interests, with an all-consuming passion for a particular subject. With the amount of time spent on it from a young age, plus the opportunities her family's money provides (books and equipment that the average child has no access to), it's no wonder she has such a head start in her subject of choice! It's not unheard of for IRL kids with similar upbringings to make headlines in music, sports, science, etc.

In my original comment I was mainly responding to OP's mention of "kids talking like kids" as being a stand-out point in fics they enjoyed. At first glance, some of the things Harriett does are unbelievable for her age, and the pureblood children are suspiciously eloquent, so I was telling anyone who would be turned off by this to stick it out, because Violet addresses those issues very well.

Now I want to revisit the series! I only read it once, and the more I reflect on it the more I'm remembering what made it great. Brb, off to get re-absorbed into the world of Rigel Black.

Edit: some issues of the word choice variety

****** Ooooh! And if you read it before the rewrite, it's way better now! I think Vi went back after Book 2 and the rewrite brings the Book1 writing quality up to that of the latter books in her series! :)
