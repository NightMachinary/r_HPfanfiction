  But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry.

  “By which time I shall be gone, and you dead!” spat Voldemort. He sent another Killing Curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security guards desk, which burst into flame.

  Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces, but before the fragments had even hit the floor,

I'd say no. These are probably dense statues made of metal, animated and reinforced (Bellatrix casts spells besides the killing curse and they bounce off) by Dumbledore of all people, and they still occasionally break from a killing curse. I'd say that a mirror, typically not something considered strong, would break from a killing curse. The desk, unreinforced, takes damage.

I'm not sure where the idea that spells could be deflected by mirrors come from. Is there an instance in canon where this happened that I'm not remembering? The only sources of deflection seem to come from magical protections such as the shield charm.

There's this:

#+begin_quote
  The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, ‘Confringo!' and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling;
#+end_quote

But this doesn't seem to be because of the mirror; Hermione seems to have miscast a confringo that continually bounces. The mirror still breaks and the spell bounces off the floor and ceiling as well.

** In book 5, the Killing Curse had a tendency to cause things to blow up or catch fire if they're not kill-able. It would have to be a strong mirror, made of something more than just silvered glass.

** The Killing Curse kills. If it doesn't hit a living being, then it merely causes a great amount of damage to the object. A mirror was never stated to reflect a curse - and I don't know why it should, to be honest. In Book 2, the mirror was broken by the Basilisk, but the effect of the magic comes from seeing its eyes - which is the reason why Hermione was petrified. She saw a reflection of its eyes, a lesser copy - and was hit by a lesser copy of the Basilisk's Eyes Curse.

So there's two things preventing a mirror from reflecting the Killing Curse. One, a mirror doesn't reflect magic. Two, the Killing Curse destroys that which cannot be killed.

** Well, you can /stop/ an AK with a mirror, but you'll sacrifice the mirror while doing so. A storm of confetti is the best defense ever, it'll hit one, and stop.

*** I don't think that would be enough, my headcanon is that to stop an AK, or other powerful curse, you need a strong enough barrier to withstand it. So paper wouldn't stop an AK, but a slab of transfigured marble would. A mirror... I'm not sure, but the mirror would definitely shatter at the least.

**** This seems likely, based on the duel between Voldie and Dumbledore in OotP.

It would be interesting to experiment on the minimum density of different types of material to block it, and see if you could put the Auror Office in anti-AK body armor. On the other hand, given how much Potter magic seems to rely on reflexes and dodging, it might be thought that armour isn't worth the reduced mobility, but that could be off-set with lightening charms, etc.

***** I don't think that would be practical, as I reckon especially with the AK that the object could easily be destroyed, thus causing damage to the wearer. Best to dodge, or block it from further away

**** Who ever said it was “paper” confetti? I was thinking Iron, myself. That way, it'll block an AK, but when directed to strike a target it'll work as well as any wood chipper. What spell do you cast to defend yourself against ballistic iron shavings? Better yet, use real iron and keep it in a Mokeskin Pouch.

How much would a Vanisher get rid of? All of it, or only the one confetti piece?

*** There must be a minimum density for it to block something, because clothing doesn't. So confetti wouldn't cut it.

Unless the magic treats the clothing as part of the person for some reason. Magic can work on symbolic rather than physics rules.

**** Okay, fine. Iron shavings, than. The best defense is now a good offense too, in that a wall of iron shavings could rip into someone like a swarm of hornets.

** Physical objects of sufficient density may be able to block it (obviously clothing doesn't). Which makes me wonder if, say, a knight in armor (or a guy in a bullet-proof vest) could survive a hit. Of course, it seems to go off like a grenade when it can't pass through something (blowing apart statues and setting fires during the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort), so it might still be lethal- it just would be messier and less certain.
