What would've happened if the battle of Hogwarts wasn't the first Civil War Gryffindor house had fought in.


** This prompt kind of reminds me of the one where Binns goes batshit and throws time turner dust over everyone one history class. linkffn(4198643)

Also: in 1066, I'm pretty sure Hogwarts would've been in Moray or Alba and wouldn't have given two shits about what was happening to the Saxons on the south end of the island.

** Wrote the time-travel scene, because it sounded funny.

--------------

"The Lightning-Catcher Charm is one of the more advanced structure protection charms," explained Flitwick, a swing of his wand distributing sheets of paper densely filled with diagrams and text, "It forms the sub-default crown of the roof matrix, and is usually layered onto reinforcement charms, impervious charms, fire protection charms and similar. The only charms that layer over it are more direct protection charms like Protego Totalum or Arresto Kines. Everyone, please conjure a standard roof shingle, preferrably made of burned clay if at all possible."

The class did so, some taking longer than others. Malfoy had to surreptitiously aim his wand at Crabbe's desk to make the shingle appear. Goyle managed it on his own, but his was horribly misshapen.

"The incantation for this particular charm is 'Arresto Fulmens Natura', and the wand movement is a single downward stroke, with authority, standing and both legs planted firmly on the floor, along the corners of the home you wish to protect. For this particular exercise, we shall simply use our shingle as an example, but in the future we will slowly increase the size of our house. Begin!"

Quiet murmuring filled the air, as everyone had learned over the years that a shouted incantation was no more effective than a whispered one.

/"Arresto Fulmens Natura"/ whispered Harry, slowly drawing his wand across the glazed shingle he'd conjured. A sheet of light spread across it from the tip of his wand, but fizzled out before he reached the bottom. He stood up, planted his feet and drew a few strange looks before trying again, this time not asking, but commanding. The shingle glowed for a moment, before the light sunk into it.

"Excellent work, Mr. Potter! /Fulmens!"/ a crackling arc left the dimunitive professor's wand, leapt across the air and struck his shingle, before being caught by a small wave of magic and drawn along its surface. It discharged into the table, leaving a scorchmark.

"Ten points to Gryffindor for being the first to get it. Please, keep practising."

Harry nodded, before letting his gaze wander over his classmates. Hermione was observing him from her seat, so he gestured for her to stand and then put on a mock severe face. She nodded in undererstanding. Seamus next to her had looked as well, and seemed to understand too.

He stood up, aimed his wand, and spoke: /"Arresto Ful-ACHOO!"/

There was a blinding flash of light, heat, and fizzling magic. The charms of the room sparked to life, arcane patterns blazing across them as large, crackling arcs of lightning struck the walls and ceiling, originating from Seamus' enchanted shingle.

Everything began to spin, and they suddenly lost gravity, chairs and tables and shingles and students and books being picked up by a wild tornado of magic at the center of the room. Seamus' shingle formed the eye of the storm, being the only thing in the room which was still affected by gravity.

There was a mighty jolt through the rooms' structure, and they heard a crack as it tore itself loose from the castle, spinning wildly into the air.

Hanging on to a student for dear life, Flitwick jabbed his wand into the floor, causing the charms to ripple across the surface, but to no avail. He bagan rapidly whispering into the wood, his words having a deep, unnatural intonation, but whatever he was doing was stopped when the room shook once more, the forbidden forest below vanishing into a vortex of magic and light.

He gestured for everyone to hold on, took his wand between his teeth and shot a sticking charm at everyone he could see. Harry suddenly found himself attached to the floor - to his benefit, as he discovered a few seconds after.

The room shook wildly as the vortex of energy outside was replaced with clear blue sky once again, and with another clap of thunder, gravity took effect once more, sending the room crashing through the forest below.

It rolled a few times, bouncing off the softer ground and various trees, before skidding to a halt, upside-down, on the castle grounds.

Cracking one eye open, Flitwick looked over the room and let out a breath of relief at seeing everyone safely attached to the walls, ceiling and floor.

"Everyone alright?" He called.

A chorus of "Yes", "Yeah" and "I am" answered him.

"And that is why you should always let go of your wand while sneezing, Mr. Finnegan."
