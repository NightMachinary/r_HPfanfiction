Hi all. I'd like to announce the first long-form fic I'm posting. I have three chapters up so far, and I'll likely be uploading on Saturdays to keep a healthy buffer for my beta readers.

The AO3 description is:

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was raised to be a “Christian”, but the Dursleys don't practice what they preach. When his Hogwarts letter comes, he is thrust into a wizarding world where angels, demons, and pagan gods fight in the shadows for influence over the world. A lighthearted, irreverent romp through a world where all myths are true, Hermione Granger met her first demon at six years old, and Ronald Weasley really wishes his brothers would stop showing off.
#+end_quote

I consider the tone I'm going for to be somewhere in the neighborhood of Percy Jackson meets Harry Potter but with Christianity-adjacent mythology.

I'd also appreciate any suggestions for tags. I'm new to this.

Finally, apologies if you prefer more substantial content to be self-promoted. I'll probably post again once I hit a significant milestone.

*** Thanks! I welcome any eyes on it and any criticism, though fyi about half of my responses to critiques will probably be some variant of "please bear with me."

**** You're welcome.

As you said, I wasn't a fan. However, there were parts that I thought were gold. For the premise, your story was executed pretty well.
