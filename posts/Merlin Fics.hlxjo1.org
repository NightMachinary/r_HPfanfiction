Interested in fics that explore the Merlin era (as opposed to the now established use of founders era and marauders era). Haven't really seen any of this but I am super interested in it! We know that Merlin attended Hogwarts and was sorted into slytherin and that he was enemies with Morgan Le Fay but besides that there isn't much added to him and his storyline in the wizarding world. Obviously, there's a lot more through Arthurian legend but I'd really like to see him interact with the Magics of Harry Potter and hogwarts


** I am afraid the issue of Merlin is again one of those one-liners JKR threw around for laugh, which were absolutely not thought through (vampires are the other one) and if taken seriously they would wreck all timelines and logic. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin][Merlin]] is thought to exist [[https://www.thebritishhistorypodcast.com/bonus-episode-king-arthur-part-one/][sometime in the late Roman or early Anglo-Saxon period]] (or [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003k9j2][here]]), certainly a way before Hogwarts were founded (sometime around 990 A.D.). So, her throwaway line that Merlin himself had been a Slytherin just doesn't make any sense.

Having said that, only (and very nice) Merlin story I know about is linkao3(Bloodstone by Northumbrian), which is set exactly in the right time, i.e., during the era of the fall of the Roman Empire.

Then there is also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wardrobe by GenkaiFan), but that's really not about Merlin himself.

*** Well, now we arrive in a bit of a conundrum, because that depends on the version of the tale.

Monmouth's Merlin is supposed to be around the 1100's right? Early Middle Ages.

One of my favorite explanations in a fic was that there were two 'Merlins' that became famous, the first was the wizard Myrddin from the late Roman period that helped integrate the escaped Emperor child with the Anglo-Saxons.

The other was Merlin Ambrosius the one that went to Hogwarts, helped King Arthur, and fought Morgana., that's the one who was uber powerful and had the title of Emrys, which means Eternal.

I don't think so. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Regum_Britanniae][Historia Regum Britanniae]] seems to date Merlin somewhere after the death of the Emperor Constantine? The book itself is from the twelfth century, but its story is about times much earlier, isn't it? (and, by the way, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages][Early Middle Ages]] are between 5th and 10th century) Did you read the book? (I haven't)

  The year is CE 476. Cenau Redhair is a very long way from home, and she's in prison. While she doesn't want to die in front of the crowds at the Flavian Amphitheatre, escape seems impossible. Does her friend Rhea the falcon have a plan? This is a story of the early days of magic, long before the founders.

  Snape gets a surprise when Voldemort sends him on a quest to fetch Merlin's wand. Or, Harry always did have the unfortunate tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.***Do not repost my works without my express permission***Don't copy to another site
