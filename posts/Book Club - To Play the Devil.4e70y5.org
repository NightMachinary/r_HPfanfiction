The next fic will be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11079134/1/Mugglefied][Mugglefied]]. I don't think I've featured a Dramione fic so far. Even if you're one of the people who usually hates Draco, I recommend at least giving it a chance.

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]]?

** I'm reading it on and off... It's very strange, it's generally well written, and the premise is something I usually like, but it's not keeping my attention.

Maybe I'll get more into it after a few more chapters...

*** That happened to me, I read like eight chapters then came back to it like 6 months later read another five then 6 months after that finished it. The visuals were a bit over-explained in it which drew me out of it a little.

It's definitely worth finishing if only because it's a unique tale.

** I honestly can't decide what I think about this fic.

It's well written, the characters all seem to have their own distinct voices, but there is something about it that just seems off to me. I think it is Voldemort and Harry's skill levels? I'd think they'd both be better than they were, but I guess the apathy they were feeling was part of the point?

I don't know, I just honestly don't know.

** It took a little while to get into it, initially I didn't like the whole premise, probably the idea that nearly everyone would be an OC put me off. I did find the pre-quest stuff in the first few chapters a little slow.

The main characters have mellowed fairly realistically, as you would expect over that time-span and I enjoyed their sparring. I thought that the story-line was reasonable and the writing was good. The pace accelerates as the story develops, so if you are finding the start slow, just read on.

** I tried reading it but I couldn't continue. It's not that it's badly written, it just can't get me like other fics. I do like the idea of immortal Harry but this is not the fic for me.

** I really rather liked it. It was different, I'd agree with Serenhime that it was somewhat strange. It was filled with too much description and a little bit slow, but those were its main faults.

The characters were likeable and a little amusing. They seem natural and are well written, the story as a whole is good. I don't know quite how to describe it, the immortal!Harry doesn't really seem to have kicked in yet (I guess because they're only reaching the end of natural wizarding lifespans). There are a lot of OCs, but oddly they don't detract from it.

I am new to the Book Club and I really look forward to seeing what you throw up next. :)

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 39 posted.

  Immortality is not all it's cracked up to be. At least not when the only other immortal around is your worst enemy and the closest thing to a friend you have left. The war ended over a hundred years ago and Harry Potter and Tom Riddle have each been enjoying the quiet life, whilst politely ignoring each other. However, war is coming. AU. Complete.

** I liked the premise, I tolerated the plot, I hated the writing. The wordiness abated -- a bit -- in later chapters, but whether the author used 50 or 30 words (when they should have used ten) didn't make a difference. Their descriptions were contradictory -- not just between chapters, but between paragraphs. They were even worse at punctuation than I am. And I still don't really know what happened to the nemesis at the end, because I have no idea who “woke up in a field in northern France”.

*** The follower of Livia who Voldemort compelled to make sure that Harry and Voldemort didn't die was the one who work up in a field in Northern France.

What happened to each of their nemeses wasn't detailed, I think [[/spoiler][Malfoy excepted...]] but its been a couple of books since I read it.

** Just finished reading it. I liked the story. However, a few times I had to check to see if I had missed a bit where a new subplot jumps in without warning and then just disappears. In particular the side plot with the goblins hunting Harry. There wasn't much lead up as to why they were hunting him. I later realised they had been introduced briefly in an earlier chapter and then pretty much forgotten about for a bit until they became the focus of a couple of chapters. After a fight scene they are then pretty much forgotten about again. If the goblins were willing to enter a war in return for information on Harry's location, they would not just abandon their efforts of hunting him after a fight in Stuttgart, especially when they can still field several armies.

*** I think, if I'm right, that the end of the story takes place much, much faster (as in within a few days) in comparison with the first slow bit. That might explain why we don't see more goblins turning up. I agree they seem to be included as an afterthought half the time they're involved.
