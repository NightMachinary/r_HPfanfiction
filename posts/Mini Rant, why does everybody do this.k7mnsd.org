EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMEONE REWRITES CANON, Draco in Gryffindor, or Harry in Slytherin or Ron in Hufflepuff, whatever whoever, every single time without fail.

They include the scene with Neville's rememberball, like it makes no sense to have Ron suddenly be evil like what? it makes no sense to have a random OC fill in character like Nott do it or Crabbe or Goyle cause let's be honest they didn't do much without Draco, and Draco Malfoy was truly the only Slytherin that obsessed with messing with them, the rest really didn't seem to care, the same way the rest of the Gryffindors didn't seem to care much except for Harry and his friends.

Idk why it bothers me so much, but people do it every time and it's such a little thing but whats the point of rewriting canon and having Draco good just to make Ron the canon Draco, or Nott canon Draco, like be more creative people please. I beg

Edit: It's such a stupid little thing that really doesn't effect the story but like idk i get so tired of it. same thing with the midnight duel, and having everything in canon play out the same way but the difference being a tag a long if Draco is in Gryffindor or a different trio if Harry is in Slytherin, like what's the point at that point,

I do recognize some events are bound to happen but i wish authors would go about them in more interesting ways. Idk


** People are uncreative, lazy, or simply don't even realise there's an issue.

And I think it very much affects the story: It renders them pointless. And that's just about the worst thing that can happen to a story.

Conceptually speaking, there is exactly one reason to add Canon stations into your AU: You want to use them to illustrate how your version of Canon (characters) differs. So if Draco takes the Remembrall, and Harry stays silent, this says something meaningful about your version of Harry. Using them for anything else (in particular, as plot) raises the question of why one should read your FF, instead of the actual book. If the entire reason for a story's existence is that it's different from Canon, you naturally can't use Canon plot (for your main character).

To that end, I'm also not in love with the argument that having a single point of divergence requires everything else stay the same until the changes have spread out enough. Given that it's boring to read the same plot over and over, it's your job as an author to come up with a way to get around that. Shrugging and giving up is just terrible.

*** Yes this is what i mean, i wrote a canon thing that was more or less the exact same thing, years later i changed it, harry doesnt go to hogwarts till fourth year, which means hermione dies first year, ginny dies second year, etc etc

or a harry who just doesn't give a fuck cause he was abused, and stays out of all the drama

** I've read one (1) fic that did this in a way I didn't hate. Malfoy time travels back to first year. When he doesn't steal Neville's Remembrall, Theodore Nott does. And Malfoy's left going "I can't believe the time travel magic is making other people fill my role, this is going to be way more difficult."

** It's a simple scene to adapt to ensure Harry gets on the Quidditch team as a First Year. If the author wants to keep Harry as the youngest Seeker in a century, they either need to adapt that scene, or contrive a different scene that has a similar effect, and one of these is a lot easier than the other.

If they have the adapted scene but don't use it to get Harry on the Quidditch team, they're either demonstrating a somewhat different Harry, or they've messed up and wasted a scene. I would only personally agree with you in that last situation.

*** I agree the first is a reason, but is it a /good/ reason?

If you plan a story with a different characterisation, then it is a necessary consequence that this reflects in the plot. So if Draco does not steal the Remembrall, Harry does not end up on the Qudditch team. That's just the logical default. Wanting two contradicting things just means your story plan is weird and needs to be fixed. Not that it's a reasonable approach to shoehorn Canon in where it don't belong.

That said, if you absolutely must have your cake and eat it (and in FF, we all do), the least of what I, as a reader, expect is that you come up with a clever way to do so. You tweak your story plan such that the outcome once again is the logical default.

So in the case of Draco not stealing the Remembrall /and/ Harry ending up on the Quidditch team, you turn on the creativity engine and come up with any one of the million ways to make it plausible. For all I care, Harry sneaks down to the sheds one night to steal a broom, because he is anxious about the upcoming flying lessons, gets caught in midair doing dives by McG, and instead of getting punished, ... etc.pp.

It literally takes but a minute to come up with something that keeps the story smooth, logical and consistent with itself, and that's why I always get annoyed when an author doesn't even invest that much thought and time.

** King's Indian Attack doesn't have the remembrall scene --- something similar so Harry gets to show off but it's Pansy doing something unseen to Hermione. Ron is a bit of an ass --- but I expect him to be to Slytherin after the twins boo Millie in canon, and Harry was built up as a hero.

(The midnight duel in KIA is actually very different as well)
