Are there any fics where Ron, Harry or Hermione go crazy when two of the Trio die at the hands of a death eater/voldemort, which drives him/her to become a dark lord/lady? Seems like it would be an interesting concept. Something the light side or the dark side does gives rise to a dark lord/lady more fearsome than Voldemort and a threat to both the light side and dark side.


** Man I'd love to read a story where Ron is the survivor of the trio and becomes a badass. I've never come across anything like that before.

*** Yeah! I would like to see a story where Ron becomes his own man..not merely the sidekick of Harry Potter. Him being a dark lord/dark wizard just makes it sweeter.

** Currently updating, but a major theme in linkffn(When A Veela Cries) is Harry's struggle to not fall to the Dark Arts.
