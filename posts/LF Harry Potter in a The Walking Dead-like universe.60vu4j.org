Is there a fic out there that deals with this kind of premise? People don't know what happened but it's the apocalypse, there's no longer a statue of secrecy, zombies are walking the earth, the magical world is in shambles etc? I'd prefer it to be a gen fic, but won't really mind if there's romance. Thanks!

** I had an idea for one where Voldy unleashed a few inferi prior to the battle at Hogwarts. They're bascially zombies, so when in the presence of muggles they would act as such, biting to infect until their population got to a sustainable size then biting to eat. At some point Harry and company (whoever that is) would hole up in the Tower of London and have to rescue the Prince, who was the last known possible head of the muggle government. I never wrote any of it since I didn't really know where it was going, but maybe the rescue is enough for a first "book".

*** But why would they rescue the Prince? Sure he's the head of the muggle Government, but if he's the last it doesn't really matter if he lives. Perhaps he would have some sort of info about a way to get into a protected vault that the government had set up?
