Instead of picking up three titles/jobs, Dumbledore sticks with just the headmaster position from the beginning (maybe suggesting trusted people for the other positions?). This ends up with a Dumbledore much more focused on the inner workings on the school and much more willing to intervene in school matters as he has the time to do so eg. getting someone in to break the curse on the defence position/doing it himself, searching for the entrance to the CoS to prevent further incidents/clear Hagrid, creating school wide events that force the houses to mix to break down the barriers between houses etc.


** This is exactly what I think Dumbledore should have done. He's a great wizard but only a middling Headmaster at most.
