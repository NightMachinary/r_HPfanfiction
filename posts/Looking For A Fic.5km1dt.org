Harry and Ginny are telepathically linked because of a soul bond after the Chamber of Secrets incident.


** Are you looking for a specific one of those fics, or any of them?

Well, in either case, the only soul bond story worth reading (in my not-so-humble opinion) matches that requirement. I hope you enjoy linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond).

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this
