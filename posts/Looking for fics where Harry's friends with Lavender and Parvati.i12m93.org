Like, not in the way where he's friends with them instead of Ron and Hermione, but just something where he's hanging out with them or something. Sorry if that was too vague, but I'm having trouble describing what exactly I'm looking for.

  When Lavender Brown's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion, no one quite knows what to make of it. Except for Harry, who firmly believes that it should have been his name coming out of the Goblet and thus vows to help her get through the tournament alive...at all costs. -- Cover Image credit to jenimal on Deviantart.
