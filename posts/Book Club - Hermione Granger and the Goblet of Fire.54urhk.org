Sorry this one took so long, I've been busy lately.


** *The Good:*

- Magical idioms: 'flooed to the wrong fireplace' (for barking up the wrong tree), 'a politician to his very wand tip,' ‘don't look a Niffler in the snout,' ‘tell it to me straight from the witch's cauldron'

- Emphasis on believable emotional responses: the protagonist genuinely seems terrified before each Task in the Triwiz. The author has done a great job of showing, not telling here.

- Pre-existing character preferences and traits are preserved: It's a canon divergent H/Hr fic that doesn't gloss over Hermione's attraction to Ron or Harry's to Cho. Harry is not as empathic as Hermione and fails to understand Ron's fit for what it is as quickly as Hermione did in canon.

- Focus on character choices: Hermione excels academically due to her choice to frequently study, not because of any innate super-intellect.

- Hermione's parents do not simply exist to blindly validate their daughter's choice in life.

- Protagonist makes a few bad decisions and suffers the fallout for them: believing she can outwit Rita Skeeter in an interview with the /Daily Prophet/, freezing for a lengthy period of time when confronted with a dragon in the First Task of the TWT

- Casanova!Harry and Supermodel!Hermione are nowhere to be seen.

*The Bad:*

- Despite being an AU divergence, it sticks with the stations of canon for a bit too long. Having Hermione face the Hungarian Horntail is a bit silly when the second and third tasks are somewhat different than canon.

- Unbalanced narration: light on needed description in a few tense moments, overload on minor details in other scenes

- ‘Dan and Emma Granger?' Yuck.

- A few spots of narrator omniscience where the author forgets that they've been writing in third-person limited.

- Loads of Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl Luna and hints of Seer!Luna. These tropes completely miss the point of her character in the original series.

- A few conversations indicating that Hermione loves rules, and only breaks them at the behest of Ron and Harry. Directly contradicted by canon on several occasions.

- There is an unchallenged assumption that what Hermione starts to feel for Harry is genuine love, and not a typical teenage infatuation. While this is eventually addressed later in the story in a moment of self-reflection, I would have preferred to have the protagonist tackle this internal struggler earlier... preferably as soon as she realised that her feelings were more than platonic.

- Unironic use of the phrase ‘limpid emerald pools.'

- Hermione runs roughshod over a sputtering Dumbledore at the end. Hardly realistic.

*The Minor Nitpicks:*

- Inconsistent convention: Muggles capitalised, but Muggle-born is not.

- Overly-verbose dialogue tags: ‘Declaimed' was a new one for me.

- Ginny's Bat Bogey Hex^{TM} was lame in canon, it's lame in fanfic.

  Dan and Emma Granger

It took me so long to realize that they were the names of the actors, I read a bunch of stories with the same naming scheme before someone pointed it out in the sub. I wonder if that is the case for some authors.

**** H/Hr fans have often been accused of treating the films as their preferred source material given that the directors basically kicked Ron to the curb and added in additional scenes in DH.

Naming Hermione's parents after the actors to portray them in the films doesn't do anything to dispel this notion.

*** Point of Luna's character? - I might be the only one, but I think her character was POINTLESS! (She's goofy for goofynesses sake and nobody tells her to snap out of it/to go to therapy!)

Also: Hermione DOES love rules - she doesn't have much of a problem with breaking them if it's for a higher cause, but over all she's in love with rules, structure and authority figures (Dumbledore, McGonagall etc.) - otherwise she would have told them off for sending Harry back to his relatives (much less putting him there in the first place!)

ps: That doesn't mean that I condone people bullying her, as a former victim of bullying (it's still hard to overcome to this day!) I hate bullies and think they should all face the harshest punishment that's possible (at least if telling them to stop several times does NOT help!)

pps: I will have to read this fiction...I don't normally read fictions that put Hermione in the spotlight (particularly because I think she's so overrated in fanfiction (she can basically do no wrong - unless the writer dislikes her and bashes her! Very few fictions actually aren't biased in favor of her or against her!))

** I read the fic a long time ago, and liked it very much. I agree with most of [[/u/MacsenWledig]]'s comments, both good and bad. It is, as far as I know, the only exploration of how someone like Hermione --- not as athletic or recklessly courageous, but more disciplined and better at magic --- would have handled the tasks, and Hermione's gradual development into an action heroine was excellently done. Having her make mistakes and have the mistakes have consequences was also well done.

On the downside, I think the fic could be edited down by about a third without losing much, by reducing the amount of text dedicated to plot threads that didn't lead anywhere, like the attempt to use Muggle Law to get out of the Tournament. Also, my feeling is that the ending was a bit too fixfic: Voldemort wounded, his return acknowledged by the Ministry, so while it is unfortunate that there is no sequel, I am not too sad, since the tension that had set up the canon OotP is gone, and I can't see anything waiting in the wings to replace it. And, I wish I could say that any of this happier ending was due to Hermione's actions or planning, but it was mostly because 1) Voldemort made even more unforced errors than he had made in canon at the time, and 2) Hermione had better lawyers. (That is not an exaggeration.)

I admit that I would have liked to see Hermione *win* a little more: actually manage to put Draco down for the count in the Slytherin exercise, rather than needing the rescue party, or maybe not need to be pulled out of the water after the Second Task.

** I liked this, I thought it was a fairly clever fork from canon that returned us to canon at the end in almost the same state as the books. Characters behaved in character, the dialog was realistic.

I did find that Hermione's parents disapproval of Hogwarts was really similar to that in The Arithmancer (which I had just read), so that dragged a bit.

Plenty of accurate references to contemporary Britain which would be normal for a muggle-born.

** Overall a good fic -- I did start at the "limpid green pools" bit though. Sometimes dialogue didn't correctly shift tone (Harry and Ron using Hermione-style big words) with characters, and Krum's language barrier was a bit much. There was some serious idiot ball holding in the last few chapters.

In the end though, it was enjoyable, and had a decent amount of unique, interesting ideas, even if the idiot-ball made it a bit frustrating at the end.
