I'm pretty sure the fic was reasonably popular.

It has multiple chapers.

It has canon pairings.

There are a few parts I can remember. In one chapter, Harry meets with Hermione in the ministry, but he has some sort of portable dessert which may or may not be Cherry flavoured, and he gets distracted with thoughts of seducing Ginny with his dessert eating skills.

In a later chapter, Harry is with either Albus or Scorpius, and Harry mentions to his suitably horrified charge that he wanted to name Lily 'Hayley' because he and Ginny conceived her in a romp in the hay.


** It could be linkffn(Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot by opalish).

*** Yeah, that's one I was just reading and it reminded me of my request. Thanks for the suggestion though, but SMatIP isn't the one.

  Scorpius really should have listened to his father's numerous and dire warnings about the Potter clan. Harry feels his pain. Gen crackfic WIP, yo. Seriously, so cracky.
