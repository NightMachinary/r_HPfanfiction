Any stories out there that came close to being good/great but let you down. What was wrong? what would be different? Was it a great story let down by poor writing or great writing but a boring plot? A nice idea but how you wish it was written by another author. Link you fics and what you would want fixed, be constructive.

Amalgum was a great read in the first arc. Lockhart-Harry was a really fun character. It got really bad, really fast when the fic started introducing Lordships and all that shit. I've never seen a fic go from "really funny" to dumpster-tier in so few chapters.

*** I thought it was such a great concept and really fun the first few chapters but what turned me off it more than anything was how pushy it was towards Hermione who I personally dislike as a character. I could have kept going were it not mentioned every third line.

**** I thought the way in which Harry drove his younger counterpart towards Hermione rather funny. Though I agree that around the point when the fic itself got tedious, the Hermione wank was just ridiculous.

***** Is that the one where Harry pretty much bullies the 12-year old Ron whenever he can?

****** Yeah... Its a bit pathetic, but the Lockhart rethoric used to do so makes it funny.

*** Yeah, once his teaching year was over things got strained a bit.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!
