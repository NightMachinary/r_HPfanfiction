Saw the post on the home thread and one thing that stood out to me was femharry tendency to fall for mainly three men: Voldemort, Draco and Snape. Maybe my personal bias is seeping in but I'm sick of seeing this. In fairness, I'm not overly fond of pairing Harry with ANY dark wizard/witch no matter how good looking they are/were. The only non dark pairing I've seen is femharry/the Weasley twins. Absolutely nothing else. Femslash pairings are also acceptable.


** The reason is easy, for some reason 'Dark is Masculine' in Fanfiction even in the Slash pairing department Harry is the bottom dojour for numerous Dark Characters.

*** The fanfiction community in general has some mildly startling tendencies. Taking someone like poor Harry and making him the perverted lower half in a submissive relationship with the literal monster that murdered his parents and attempted to ruthlessly kill a one year child because of a half over heard prophecy told by a drunk oracle. There are ways to make these relationships seem believable, but the authors tend to err down the path of prolonged deus ex machina and sudden and unexplainable shifts in character. I don't know /what/ in a story for /children/ about a magical school, told from the perspective of what I've read is a self insert, has engendered so much /strange/ attention. Myself, of course, included. Only Merlin knows what that story has done to us.

**** Yeah, there's a reason I avoid HP slash and read almost exclusively straight pairings. All of the popular slash couples are creepy garbage like Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort or Drarry. How about someone NICE being in a relationship with Harry for once? Like Neville for example, I would love to read a proper romance like that.

Please not. Neville sucks in fanfics, either as Ron v2 or WBWL. Literally, the only decent characterisation of him I've read has been a smutty "Harry joins Neville/Hannah" one-shot (and there was a fem!Harry one where she has an exhibition thing and turns Neville into a friend with benefits, but neither have much of a plot).

***** The problem begins when Harry is in a slash relationship with anyone from the canon cast. Can you seriously imagine anybody from the acceptable canon age group who would be compatible with Harry? First Voldemort is right out. He is not even in the list. He killed the kid's parents and he is about 70 or 71. Snape literally spend his all his teenager years hating kid's dad and lusting after his mother. Draco is almost acceptable but that is just for the sheer fact that he is more like a tsundere/yandere girl in a boys body. I would like to see Neville/Harry but I can't imagine them going further than being bros for life.

******* It is really, I mean Really Hard to do justice to Ron. Most fanfic writers who wrote hp fics can't write him anything but a jealous poor kid, someone who speaks without thinking, the glutton, Ron the Death Eater or not even bothering to add him into the fic itself. Ron's character matures as the books advance. We don't see a genius kid or a protagonist when we read him. And that makes it really hard to write him as he is. And all of this is even without going into the can of worms that is Romance in HP. Like I said, Ron is a character that matures as we see on the screen or while reading the books. He isn't a happy go lucky shounen character from some action manga.

*** The Last Peverell is pretty bad though. Interesting backstory which could have led to some pretty cool stuff given the time travel, but all squandered doing (and failing) at being a schoolgirl. It features the completely (or nearly completely) irrelevant magical core, a manipulative Dumbledore who is both super obvious, and super incompetent, some random pureblood culture that doesn't really do anything for the story, nor does it really fill much worldbuilding, and worst of all, a Mary Sue who is simultaneously the best thing ever and also incredibly incompetent given her backstory. I mean really? Defeats Voldemort and other dark lords nine times, is an adept politician (which can be inferred from her backstory), yet fails to do anything of notice politically despite having huge amounts of influence over other Houses, and is beaten black and blue by a pack of six Death Eaters-in-training (which includes a Hufflepuff somehow), nearly losing. Honestly, canon Harry, at the same age (5th year), has her beat for for both leadership and magical skills.
