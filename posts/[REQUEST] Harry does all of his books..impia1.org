Hermione mentioned at some point that Harry was an explorer adventurer according to her books.

I'm looking for a fic where Harry has done all these things, and has a Nathan Drake-like personality.


** The closest thing I've seen to a Nathan Drake Harry is in the second of the Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider series by Starfox5. It's definitely not Nathan Drake, but it's close. The links below are to the first in the series, which you kind of need to read the other one.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

***** Sure. Enjoy. :)

Just a note, if you reply to the bot, the person who commented doesn't get the message. You have to reply to the actual comment for them to get the notification.

I only noticed because I saw this thread had three comments and got curious enough to check. :)

******* No bigs. Just one of those reddit things we don't know unless someone points it out, so I got into the habit of doing so, just in case people don't know it's a thing. :)
