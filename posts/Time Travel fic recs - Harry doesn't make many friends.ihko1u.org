I'm kind of tired of time travel fics where Harry befriends Ron and Hermione again, or even befriends new 11yr olds from other houses.

Can anyone recommend any fanfics where Harry time travels but has difficulty making friends with 11 year olds since he's mentally an adult? Ones like Resurrect the Living, where he's sort of friendly with his housemates, but has difficulty making any genuine connection bc of the time travel.


** Sorry but I don't have any coming to mind rn, but I commented to link the fic you were talking about

It's for different reasons (he doesn't end up 11), but he seriously struggles to connect with anyone for fear of a paradox and also cuz the kids his age are just, more innocent.

** Posted in a previous thread:

In this one he tries his best but there's definitely a difference between mentally being 18 and 11. He's still friends with Ron and Hermione as well as people in the other houses but he takes up an almost mentor role. I really enjoy the characterizations in this one, it all feels a lot like canon. It's completed and a sequel is being posted.

  He looked up to see Dumbledore had drawn himself to his feet. The old man now stood directly across from Harry, on the opposite platform. "My dear boy," he called, across the sound of the swelling train noise. "My child. Harry. Are you sure? Is this what you want?"

  Harry gulped. He wasn't, precisely. But still... "I know now," he responded, "if I can go back to make a difference..." He paused. "Knowing this, if I can go back, then this is the only choice I can make."

  Dumbledore was silent. The sound of the train grew closer.

  Once more, Dumbledore opened his mouth. "My dear boy, you would be alone."

  Harry was slightly proud of his crooked smile. It said everything that needed to be said.

  "I would never...Do you realise...?" Dumbledore looked flustered, lost for words. "No one would ask you to do this."

  When the most powerful magics collide due to Harry Potter's desperate, last sacrifice, he creates for himself a chance to fix up the wrongs in his world. Yet going back in time isn't everything that he expected: Voldemort is a threat, but it is Harry himself who no longer fits comfortably in the world. Time has changed him, he just hasn't yet figured out how.
