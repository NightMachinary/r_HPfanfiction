There are a ton of Ron bashing fics out there and I had to have read most of them. Now if like to see if there's any with Ron as a clever or at least cool character that isn't just an idiot or a 'bloody hell' machine. He doesn't have to be the central character, in fact it would be best if he isn't. No slash or Nonmagic fics


** I've been working to correct my prior fanon bias against Ron, but I won't ascribe any extraordinary powers of strategy to him, since aside from chess he's exhibited no such clarity of thought. Ron's a very practical guy, and knows how to enjoy a laugh so long as it isn't at his expense.

He has one extraordinary talent which most writers overlook: "Tends to be wrong when he is serious, right when he is joking."

Whether this is a form of subconscious divination or simple intuition, I try to follow that fundamental guideline whenever I include him in a story.

**** This is what Pottermore says about Charlie's old wand. An ash wand with a unicorn core.

#+begin_quote
  "The ash wand cleaves to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. This tendency is extreme if the core is of unicorn."
#+end_quote

The fact that Ron was able to use the wand at all is nothing short of amazing, especially in its damaged and worn state. Add to that his first time using the levitation charm wasn't with a feather, but a large, heavy club, and that he was able to non-verbally cast a slug-vomiting charm with a broken wand. Admittedly, it did backfire.

Also, what Pottermore says about willow; Ron's wand wood.

#+begin_quote
  "Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and I have noted that the ideal owner for a willow wand often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity, however well they may try and hide it. While many confident customers insist on trying a willow wand (attracted by their handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic) my willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn. It has always been a proverb in my family that he who has furthest to travel will go fastest with willow."

****** The wand was damaged by the time Ron went to Hogwarts, being splintered with the unicorn hair sticking out. This may have caused problems for Charlie since damaged wands are prone to accidents. But with only two children of age at the time, I don't think the Weasleys would have needed to pass down something as crucial as a wand. Them doing so with Ron goes to show how tight for money they are. Especially since Fred, George, and Ginny got their own wands. They had to completely cop out on Ron since he was the last boy and they didn't have the money to buy school supplies for both him and Ginny. That's why he's the only one to get hand-me-downs.

Besides, the rest of the entry on Pottermore is a clear indication for Charlie.

#+begin_quote
  "Old superstitions regarding wands rarely bear close examination, but I find that the old rhyme regarding rowan, chestnut, ash and hazel wands (rowan gossips, chestnut drones, ash is stubborn, hazel moans) contains a small nugget of truth. Those witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not, in my experience, lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes. However, the brash or over-confident witch or wizard, who often insists on trying wands of this prestigious wood, will be disappointed by its effects. The ideal owner may be stubborn, and will certainly be courageous, but never crass or arrogant."

*** Looking out over the units in motion Harry had a tender moment of nostalgia, and spoke, "Ron will be sorry he missed this. He's good at chess."

His father gave him a strange look. "Why does everyone assume that being good at chess makes you good at strategy? All of the generals Napoleon crushed were masters of chess, moving a unit here or a unit there and expecting their enemy to do the same. They were totally unprepared for this short guy who'd never played the game charging them with his entire army."

James turned back to look over the field with his charmed binoculars, saying, "One of the reasons he had so many early victories were his enemies were all chess players. That game teaches you all the WRONG instincts when it comes to actual war!" He insisted.

"Chess has no variables." Remus explained, while also keeping his attention focused on the battlefield that was due to blow up any moment now. "Every piece has exact and specific moves, on a tiny playing board that's exactly the same every time, with no terrain, weather, ill luck, bad supplies, good positions or communications problems. And everything is known at all times, there are no secrets of any sort."

"You couldn't ask for anything LESS like war than a game of chess!" James snorted, his prankster pride offended that his son had such a moment of idiocy and determined to correct the error. "War is nothing BUT variables! Outflanking enemies, hiding in forests, getting lucky breaks, supply problems and looting, morale problems and units that refuse to act or do whatever it is they're supposed to do because the local command structure got its wires crossed or some arrogant ass decided that he knew better than to do what the entire rest of the army was depending on him to do! No deserters give away plans, no betrayals by subordinates, or disease outbreaks taking down entire units for weeks - all of which have decided more wars than the pike."

"Also both sides in chess have exactly the same force structures!" James ranted, upset by his son's ignorance on this point. "You couldn't point to ANY SIGNIFICANT BATTLE IN HISTORY where that was even close to the case! But chess is almost farcical about the extremes to which it pushes it. Everything for both sides is precisely identical. You each have the same amount of precisely identical troops with exactly the same moves, the same space to maneuver in and completely arbitrary boundaries. All of which are as far from real world conditions as it is possible to create!

"And there are no options like digging in or fortifying, taking out an enemy with ranged weapons, sneaking into his camp in the dead of night, letting him get heavily dug into a defensive position then marching around his field army and taking the city behind to cut him off from supply or, really, anything that resembles real world tactics at all!

"Or even just FAILING TO TAKE AN OBJECTIVE! That happens all the time in actual war. But failure to take that hill, or even deliberate defensive action is completely impossible in chess. In real life three hundred Spartans occupying a strategic pass were able to stop the entire Persian army from invading. In chess if it is legal for your pawn to move into an enemy's square, he can take that square guaranteed, every time, no matter what it is guarded by.

"Really, you couldn't ask for a worse simulator for wars than chess. Toss a bunch of rats a hunk of cheese and you'll learn more about war." James settled down, having said what he needed to.

Sirius grinned in support of his friend. "Saying someone's chess skills show that he's a skilled battlefield tactician is like saying being a Monopoly whiz qualifies him to take on Wall Street."

It teaches you to avoid a tunnel vision style of thinking etc. The importance of sacrifice is also taught (look at the 1st book) Those qualities are good for many aspects of life, and it is something I wish Ron would explore more.

***** Does chess actually do that (as in the skills carry over)? Like are military leaders explicitly trained in chess?

The way I view Ron, his chess mastery indicates that he is intelligent and willing to put in hard work to learn a subject, which means that once he puts his mind to something he can get it done. I don't really see it as suddenly giving him tactical abilities or the like. I feel like those would need to explicitly trained.

****** Not indefinitely. But more often then not, skills like these go hand-in-hand. Like solving a rubik's cube doesn't automatically mean you have good spatial intelligence, but it's a safe assumption. Military leaders are trained in tactics and strategy, depending on how high up the chain of command they are. Chess could help with things like analysis, foresight, cognition, logic, and so on, so while not actually taught to military commanders, it's a valuable study nonetheless.

Ron is shown to have exceptional cognitive abilities and executive functions. (Many people may disagree due to his short attention span, but really, he's just lazy.) Though Ron is intelligent, chess skill isn't directly related by intelligence. The reason he's so good at chess is because it just comes naturally to him. Ron is very different then Harry and Hermione in his way of thinking. Hermione is very by-the-book style and always approaches situations in a one-dimensional, textbook fashion, and Harry relies on his intuitiveness and gut instinct, whereas Ron likes to think outside the box.

If compared to military leaders, Ron would be more of a Hannibal.

**** They're wizards, so supply lines and battle formations are all but lost on them. But being good at chess does affect someone's ability to look ahead and make predictions about a person's tactics. A chess board may be one dimensional, but there are several variables to account for in chess that can easily be translated into real-world scenarios.

This trait in Ron highlights his ability as a /tactician/, not a strategist. I'd say Hermione is a far better /strategist/. He's highly adaptable and can change plans at any moment, which is a large, underlying factor, and is clearly capable of changing up his play style, since no one's been able to beat him.
