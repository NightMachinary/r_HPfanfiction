What if instead of getting rid of the Elder wand, Harry decided to use it to make good around him. Maybe using healing spells on Neville's parents to help them get over the after effects of the Cruciatus Curse. I would advise him to place the knowledge of being the owner of the Elder Wand under the Fidelius Charm so it can't be traced back to him. And probably use some kind of Parcelmagic or cleansing ritual on it to get rid of its dark leanings and history. If the wand is fabled to have been produced by Death, then we can only assume that it can stops and heal everything short of death!


** I think he'd still need an education in healing. Repairing a wand with an especially strong Reparo is quite different from healing something no one knows how to heal. The Elder Wand is nothing without a spell and we don't see magic working by simply imagining what you want to happen. So I think he'd still have to do the research of how to heal them.

*** Of course researching about it is essential. But healing spells are just that : spells. The Episkey spell is a very useful and easy spell to master and still is a minor healing spell. Once mastered it just becomes part of the witch or wizard's skill set. I don't think he has to be a certified healer to heal them. Have some knowledge, yes ; be an expert, no. But if he wants to help more people he sure has to get a Healing mastery. Perhaps go through it with the Phoenix wand to get fair assessment and then use the Elder wand once a master. To heal the Longbottoms before getting his mastery he can look at their charts and what has been done for the Longbottoms thus far. The treatment might not have worked because the spells were too weak to fix what was going on. Maybe mastering the spells and using them with the Elder wand would make them work.

**** I know that it's just another spell that you'd have to learn, but someone would still have to teach him or he'd have to teach himself. He'd still have to learn all the spells. He'd still have to know the problem to use the correct spell. Also, it's not just a physical problem, I assume a huge part of their condition is psychological due to extensive torture. I doubt normal healing spells would be sufficient to heal them.

***** I'm going with the assumption that Harry is highly intelligent and determined when there is an incentive (Patronus Spell). I'm not he should just show up with a Elder Wand and yell “Healus the Longbottomus” What I mean is that unless there is a breakthrough in the Healing field, there is little chance of retrieving Frank and Alice. What I'm suggesting is that with the power of the Elder Wand, known spells and treatment could work and a breakthrough wouldn't be needed. If Harry didn't have to work for it, the fanfiction would be three line long, and it's not interesting. Of course he should study, plan, study the case and then go in with his eyes opened. I'm just frustrated that a powerful tool was used only for war and repairing a wand when it could have been used more altruistically if it had been kept. And to go with your remarks, I love a studious Harry and would like to see him training intensively so he could get Neville's parents back, the parents of the man who was instrumental in Voldemort's defeat. Maybe Healing won't be his calling, maybe it will. But the Elder wand has power which deserves to be used for good. Rebuilding Hogwarts? Rebuilding families? A wand which likes to kill, trained to heal and repair.

****** Perhaps research, the Elder Want and some Felix might be a good combination to achieve that. I actually wrote a fic in which his parents are healed. It's a Draco time travel fic in which Draco befriends Neville (Neville is trying to heal his parents while Draco is looking for a cure for his wife). In my story it's a combination of Herbology, Potions, Legilimency (for some mind healing) and a dose of Felix.

******** Oh thanks ☺️ [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12506935/1/A-Slytherin-Through-Time]]

Most relevant for you would be chapters 5-8, 51, 59, 64-66 (they all deal with Neville's parents in some way) :) I'd love to get some feedback, even if it turns out the story isn't for you (perhaps even more so if it isn't for you, as I always try to improve the story).

** Considering that it was (supposedly) a wand made by Death itself, I feel it wouldn't be good for healing spells.

** You know what people say: the road to hell is paved with good intentions or playing with fire or people did not sin, but treasure caused sins (匹夫无罪，怀璧其罪)..etc..etc... That Elder wand (if it has abilities it's said to have in legends) is treasure and hellfire, poison and alien technology altogether. I don't think Harry was capable of keeping or using it (Harry knows that too), (maybe it's better to put it in a staff for later use (like someone had put the stone in a ring) but it's still not safe enough)

** Harry goes up to neville's parents after realising he could maybe heal them

When he gets there, he realises that he only knows two healing spells

”Eh whatever” he says before trying to heal Neville's mom

”//EPISKEY//”

Now all the problems with any kind of bone have been fixed and their bones are stronger than should be possible

”Oh well”

”//VULNERA SANENTUR//”

Now all of their cuts have been healed so well that their tissue far around them is better than should be possible

Then Harry repeats the gesture to Frank

”//EPISKEY//”

This proved to make a problem for Frank, he now sported a forever-boner

”Uhm, oops?”

”//VULNERA SANENTUR//”

This gave no problems to Frank and then Harry left

Forgive me for my absolutely horrible writing but this had to be done
