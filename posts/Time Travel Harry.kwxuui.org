I'm looking for several fanfics where Harry travels back in time to attend school with Tom Riddle. Preferably slash and Slytherin Harry.

I also like fanfics where Harry is super powerful and not really the reckless type where he faces a situation head on.

Also a bonus if Harry is a Peverell or is related to one of the Ancient and Noble Houses. Thank you!


** [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/23670349/chapters/56822665][Gilt in Silver and Gold]] is kinda like this.

Harry travels in time after DH and ends up accidentally defeating Grindelwald.

But he was sorted into Hufflepuff.

  It started with a wretched scream from a Death Eater, a burst of accidental magic so powerful it flung away the people holding him down.It started with an unknown spell and a potion bottle and a desperate cutting curse from an unknown wizard trying to save him, it started with a blood sacrifice and a gargled mispronounced spell from an accidentally half-decapitated head, and a broken bottle exploding at his feet.And the world heaved around them.Harry Potter vanished in the plume of burning potion fumes, a burst of golden smoke that engulfed him so suddenly he hadn't the chance to move.It started with the death of Voldemort and the one person in the entire damn world that wanted to save him for his own sake following on his heels, and the unspoken left to hang between them, and the single sliver of soul that knew love through him. Harry had no idea where he was, just that he was under attack. He didn't intend to irrevocably alter the timeline. He didn't intend to draw attention to himself at Hogwarts. He didn't intend to get the attention of Tom Riddle. But he did it anyway.

** The only one that hits most of the points (off the top of my head at least) is linkffn(Lord of Time) it's still currently being updated and I started it recently and highly recommend it.

Can he change Voldemort prevent him from becoming the darkest wizard of all time? Or will he be caught in Tom's web? Slash TMR/HP?
