I've been looking for this fic that I read some time ago. I don't remember more than a couple random details. I recall that due to some reason, Harry grew wings, and could breathe this flammable liquid. Hermione joined him later in the fic, and they broke their wands over some random thing, and moved to Bulgaria(I think).

If anyone has any inkling of which story this is, I would praise their name to the overlord llamas for all eternity. Thanks!


** That would be linkffn(Cold Blood by DerLaCroix). Twas a weird one.
