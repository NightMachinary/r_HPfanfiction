Hello all!

There was a request posted here earlier, asking about Multi fics that aren't hypersexualized. It got me thinking, what is it about multi fics you dislike? I mean, do you dislike them in general, or is there a specific reason?

Let's leave the fact that it is unrealistic to the side for this one, since we probably all think that. And please, let's be civil and have a proper, reasonable discussionðŸ™‚

Answers like "It's stupid" won't further the conversation.


** My main issue with multi fics is that the more partners Harry has, the more 'diluted' the romantic focus/quality often gets.

I mean, think about how much effort is already needed in order to write a quality mono ship. Now think about how each new partner means having additional build-up, development, romantic moments (i.e., dates), etc. in the story, all while trying to fit the new partner into the group's current dynamics.

It's not impossible, but considering how real life often gets in the way of writing, going multi often leads to extra stress (and perhaps extra POVs) that tends to bog down the fic. This, in turn, has a high chance of making the author feel overwhelmed with all the personalities (because nobody likes cardboard cutouts), which therefore has a high chance of making the author resort to using generic stereotypes for each partner, i.e.:

- The 'clever' one.
- The 'nice' one.
- The 'sporty' one.
- The 'fun' one.

etc.

Harry/two partners can still be written well enough without getting too overwhelmed, I think, but once you start leaning into three, four, and more territory, it becomes more and more difficult to do Harry and each of his partners justice. You could almost say that it becomes exponentially difficult, depending on who you add (as some characters can be more complex than others). Hence cardboard cutouts often appear.

I don't hate multi shipping, but I often find it tedious to read once it becomes Harry/three or more, especially when there's more than just romance in the plot.

Then there's also the fact that multi fics tend to neglect the relationship between the partners themselves (i.e., without Harry's presence), while also cutting corners and rushing things for the sake of smut.

My view is that if you're going to go multi, then fine. But please take the time to consider who you truly want Harry (or whoever your main character is) to end up with in your fic. For example, is it /really/ worth adding person x to the ship? Are they going to be in for a fling or here to stay? Either way, you need to consider the extra words that will need to be written in order to accommodate each new partner and their dynamics within the group.

*** What I'd like to see is a multi fic from the point of view of one of the partners. We would see a lot more interaction between partners, especially if it is more of polygamy rather than a harem, which I prefer

** I find the idea of several teenage girls agreeing to share one boy to be more unrealistic than the concept of magic lol

** I don't think multi is unrealistic as a pairing, as real people have polygamous relationships all the time. They are uncommon yes, but not as uncommon as people think, they just aren't talked about openly like monogamous relationships are.

With that said, personally I don't see anything wrong with the trope. My only dislike is when it becomes a harem. I think harry + 2 girls is best for a multi, anything more becomes a harem and THAT is unrealistic

** Personally I love harem fic and read a good bit in the haremlit genre. The problem in some fics though is authors will try to squeeze everyone they can in and most are just window dressing. They'll focus on harry and 2 or 3 girls and while the rest are part of the family they never do much.

*** As far as I'm concerned, three would be the most you could have and still have it be a relationship, instead of a harem, if that makes sense. Then again I'm writing a fic with relationships in the background, not a dating fic.

** In general, I dislike Multi fics (or rather Harem fics since it is what a majority of them are) because I think having the Main Character having several relation is detrimental both for the plot and for the characters of a story.

I think it's something that is easier to see with all the asians Light and Web Novels (since they have a loooooot of Harem), but most of the time the MC will be more focused on his next target for his Harem that he is on the plot. I mean, do I really need a whole arc in the Middle of HBP where Harry drops everything he is doing at Hogwarts (caring for Ron who had been poisoned, following Draco who is very successfull, training with Dumbledore . . .) because he just have to spend 2 weeks in France fighting with the Delacours to add Fleur (or Gabriel) into his harem?

Concerning the characters, female characters of a Harem story are often . . . boring. Sometimes you'll see a girl that has some personality, but the second she joins the Harem, it's like she lose any fire she may have had and become some bland character, only good to snog the MC (or more) when he wants and repeat how much he loves him. I also hate how "unrealistic" the relationships are between members of a harem. When you look at history, most Harem were true viper's nest where the girls were always fighting against each other to gain the Man attention. But in story it's always the same "/We are all sisters, we love each other almost as much as we love Harry and we will always be living in harmony/".

Basically, I hate Harem because they never make a great story. At best, a story may be good despite having a Harem.

â€‹

Also, you asked to not mention the unrealistic aspect of a harem, but I want to point that I dislike them even more in the HP fandom /because/ they are unrealistic.

Outside of the fact that the HP fandom does not mix very well (or at all) with Harems (quasi equality of sexes, Christian morals, . . .), Hogwarts is a school. I know some people may (very very rarely) decide to have a polygamous relationship, but here we are talking about 15/16 girls, whose parents may be a bit opposed to this kind of relation.

I am also very surprised that, in the Harem story, Harry is never taken aside by a teacher like McGonagall who would then explain him that he is technically not supposed to snog a girl while at school, let alone 5.

** I actually really enjoy Hermione/Harry/Ron, but it's because they're already so close that it feels /natural/. In my opinion, when fics have random multi pairings with people we've barely met it rarely works because it feels like there's no connection or that the ties that bind are quite loose indeed...

** I don't mind them in principle; as in I wouldn't ignore a fic just because it was multi/harem, but there are some things that makes me not care for the relationship. This will variably cause me to stop reading depending on whether the rest of the story holds up or not.

The main issue I have with a lot of Multi/Harem fics is that the others involved often don't really have three dimensional personalities. They more exist as a result of their physical characteristics, and/or a boilerplate personality (for example, one will be the pureblood expert, one will be outgoing, one will be the 'planner', and so on).

In this case the only reason why the Multi/Harem exists is often so that the main character has a collection of support characters around them that are (generally) on their side. Which ultimately makes the Multi/Harem useless except for smut purposes, as the same effect can be achieved if they were just friends.

The other main issue I have is when the Multi/Harem becomes very big. Personally I could just about accept maybe Main Character + 4 at the most before I think simple logistics makes managing such a relationship difficult at best if not basically a full time job at worst. When I see Multi/Harem fics featuring more then that my suspension of disbelief rapidly falls apart.

** Because there's never really a point to it other than to fulfill the writer's fantasy (or the reader's). The wives never have a purpose beyond sex and generally speaking have about as much personality as a fleshlight.

Mind you, this is for harem fics, not really for triads. Anything more than a triad and you can ensure that those wives won't matter to the actual plot one whit.

Multi/harem in anything other than PWP is a bunch of pointless filler imo.

** I have a polyamorous OTP in another fandom, but I avoid most HP multi-fics like a plague. A good litmus test for me is the main character of the story is. If it is Harry, I close the fic immediately. The problem with Harry-centric mult-fics is that, typically, the women there are essentially trophies for Harry. They do not have personalities of their own and they do not exist to do anything for the plot except fawn over Harry. If you are a fan of those female characters, which I usually am, it can get really insulting.

That said, I /have/ found multi-fics that I thoroughly enjoyed. There is a short Hermione/Pansy/Daphne one-shot that I thoroughly loved because of how cozy the fic felt for example. And there is the Eyesight Series who built the relationships and the personalities of all the characters really well despite there being so many relationships.

Otherwise though, the bigger the Harem is, the poorer the writing of the characters is going to be, and I read stories for the characters first and foremost.

** Being an author of a Harry/multi fic, I'd like to tell you guys my approach to the whole thing. Since over half of the story takes place after Hogwarts, and Harry's partners are older than he, most by some margin, it probably changes things. I also had my mages live longer, so that Harry being with women that are so much older than him was less... problematic, if you will.

Oh, and there is no smut to distract from the plot.

I find, that if you give each person a role to play, a job to do within the plot, you give yourself a better chance of fleshing them out, to a degree. Have them help advancing the plot. Don't just have them them in the story like some kind of vessel for Harry's... release.

Another thing I do in my fic, is I gave every woman I paired with Harry 'a moment' with him, to better understand them, and their motivations, dreams and desires. I suppose each woman fills a certain trope, however.

And I kind of hoped to have each woman represent a facet of Harry's personality, that he might have repressed to a degree, because of the role he took for himself. And the way he was raised. Kind of like Captain Malcolm Reynolds' crew on the Firefly, in fact.

For example, Narcissa, while a little warmer now, compared with how she was with Lucius, is still a Slytherin through and through, a manipulative b$%ch. She's very intelligent and cunning, and willing to do some... questionable things to get her way, which is the reason why she's Harry's proxy for the Black seat on the Wizengamot.

Bellatrix, while not a completely insane, sadistic murderer anymore, doesn't give a shit about Harry's quest. The only reason she even bothers with it, is because she's utterly in love with Harry, and she loves her sisters, and niece. Getting rid of Riddle is the only thing that will keep her precious people safe. And she's out for revenge, so you better believe she's going to cut loose against her former colleagues!

I felt Tonks's silly, mischievous and playful character would help Harry cope with everything, and draw out his own silly self. That being said, she's not just comic relief, but an actual character, who has recently lost her husband to a Dementor attack. She has yet to deal with that.

Andromeda is a gentle and kind woman, who cares very deeply for people, and has a strong conscience. She lost her husband, but fell for Harry when she saw his true self, and how good he was for her sisters. And he brought them back to her. Harry's also going to have the Black name stand for something better. Despite her kindness, she's still a Black, so you best understand her claws are sharp!

Being a Veela, Fleur understands the loneliness that comes with being TBWL. Most people only see the Veela, while most only see The Boy Who Lived. Of course, Harry being immune to the Allure, makes him irresistible to /Her/ Fleur's Veela, whom she considers to be a separate being, living inside her. She struggles with that part of her personality.

Minerva represents Harry's strict and disciplined side. I have yet to give McG her proper time in the sun. Sure she and Harry have had a moment, but this latest chapter I'm writing should flesh her out a bit more. I wonder how people will react to a completely ruthless Minerva?

And lastly, we have ... well she's a bit of a blank page as of yet. She's very well known in HP, but she's practically an OC, so. I'll flesh her out properly and It'll happen in this chapter.

While doing this, I still tried to not completely disregard the canon personalities of the women involved. The chapter I'm writing now also adresses why the group was drawn together in the first place.

Whew, that was a bit more than I meant to do, but I found I wanted to outline how I tried to tackle the multi trope.

** Specifically for that reason... they are just sexual fantasies of authors. People do find themselves in polygamous relationships but most often that's because they seek the novelty of new relationships... however managing the relationship with a single person is work enough... why in the world would you want to deal with more partners at once?
