Harry Potter: Exploited, was great (and very slow on the update), and I also remember some other cool ones.

Anything else? Just something fun to read (does not have to be completed, it's sad but realistic).

Bonus: anyone knows the name of that crazy one in which Hermione is the gamer, and she somehow made a family with hybrid magical creatures, saved Sirius and brought him to a tropical island that's full of orgies?


** I have no idea what that last fic is, but I have four game fic recs that I posted in this request a couple months back. I haven't gotten any more since, unfortunately. :)

  Harry Potter catches Voldemort's AK to the noggin only to find out that his life is a video game and he forgot to save. So what does he do? Does he return on Hard mode and work for the challenge? Heck No! Harry uses every exploit, grind, or underhanded tactic he can get his hands on. His life may be a video game, but nobody plays Harry Potter. HIATUS

** linkffn(Might and Magic)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Game of Death) Fairly recently updated. Synopsis says harem, but so far it's strictly Harry/Hermione. With no Ron bashing.

linkao3(Harry Potter and the Harem Game) Addams Family x-over. Hasn't done anything that inappropriate for a bunch of 11 year olds either.

** linkffn(13638854) a grown Harry dies and is transported to another universe with the gamer ability. The entity he met after he died tricked him by saying he can't go to the afterlife and must go to another dimension, which it said was a place where he wouldn't face any troubles at all. The reality of it was that universe was where most of the dangerous stuff gets sent to so its technically exponentially more dangerous than his home universe, hence the name the dumping grounds.

  Dead again after fullfilling someone else's Destiny, I find myself granted a 'reward'; a new world to play in, and finally a chance and the tools needed, to do things my way, or at least, I hope so.
