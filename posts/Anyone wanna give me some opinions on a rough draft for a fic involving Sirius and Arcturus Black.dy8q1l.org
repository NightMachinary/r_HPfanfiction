** I very much enjoyed this, the family being stricter with Sirius because they could afford to be because they had Regulus as a spare is an interesting idea, I hadn't considered that before. Not sure what the Ravenclaw Rebellion is exactly, though, perhaps you could expand on that?

*** ah, sure! The ravenclaw rebellion was basically a club within the order of the Phoenix that held meetings every week, they were dedicated mostly to research, scavenger hunts, things of that nature. Basically, as Sirius described it, a swot-fest. Thanks so much for your input! I'm glad you liked it, it especially means a lot considering Im a huge fan of your Black family fics as well!
