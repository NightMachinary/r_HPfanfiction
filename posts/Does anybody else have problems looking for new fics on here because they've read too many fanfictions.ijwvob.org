**** Ofc. Heres some constructive criticism:

Punctuation: you need to include more commas, m-dashes, and break up lists. You should also try for more descriptor sentences (e.g. the first line should be more akin to:

"Number 12 Grimmauld Place remained silent through this particular night--a rare oasis of peace in the aftermath of the Battle of Hogwarts."

This would concatenate your first two sentences, and draw a picture of what you want the setting to be. Here, being vagur is not your friend--emphasise what you believe to be important characteristics, otherwise readers will never see it that way. When introducing characters, at least give a brief look-see at them. Kreacher might be introduced as "a battered relic of times past" or something like that.

Also, I would give advice on what seema to be the tripping point for most fanfiction writers--dialogue. There needs to be descriptors around it, it needs to feel real, and I only recommend reading LeGuin, and maybe some King to better see what im talking about--its never just two people talking to each other in a vacuum. They are in a place, fiddling with things, feeling emotions, coming from somewhere, going to somewhere--and all of that needs to come through.

Im not going to critique the plot, as I feel that even the worst plot, if written with an adept hand, can be quite good.

** I've been reading HP fanfiction for 15 years and obsessively.

I'd say conservative estimate I've read 100 million words of fanfiction (and thats being super conservative)

I still trawl this subreddit occasionally and get new suggestions a surprisingly high amount of the time.

Sometimes you just randomly miss good fics and you think 'how have I never read this?'

For example, my favourite fic is Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais. Only a couple of months ago I discovered he/she has written a bunch more, and for some reason I had just never checked them out.

So that was a fun time.

**** Honestly yeah. I rarely go a day were I don't have my phone out in class just reading fanfics. It's so much more interesting that most of what we learn. Somehow, I've become so good at hiding my phone, that it has only been confiscated about 2-3 times in around 3 years. And it's not even that the teachers don't care, whenever they see another kids phone they take it. Somehow they always miss mine.

Fanfiction had taken over my life. Not sure how I feel about that cause I've got around 70 books I have sitting on my shelf waiting to be read. It's already ruined English for me. Spelling and grammar mistakes I just read over cause I've gotten used to sub-par fics.

I don't suppose anyone else has realised the similarities between Shakespeare and fanfiction? In class we're looking at Othello, and it's honestly just a really shitty fanfic. My teacher mentioned that there was an interpretation of Othello in which the genders of the characters were swapped, and it's given me a headache with how cringey it would be. Apparently, it was a complete failure, but the fact that it exists kills me.

*** Too true, since I started reading fan fictions on my phone, reading physical books seems like a lot more work and money (I still read books, just not as much). So sometimes it's a little strange when people ask what I like to do in my spare time, and my answer is reading. When they ask what books, it's just, uhh...

I usually try to recall some random books that I've read before, because fanfiction has a bit of a stigma against it. I'm definitely addicted to fanfiction, but not exactly alone in that matter

*** The library has a lot of quality and not necessarily popularity, everything in there is really well done and there's a lot of stuff you won't find on the front pages of FFN or AO3. They do have a taste for dark Harry and AU fantasy epics, so if you're looking for high quality lighter stuff it might be hard to find everything you're looking for there. But it's always a good start.

** Honestly i don't read fanfics that much. Used to be 1-2/month, since i started writing them that number is more like 1 every other month. Afraid i will subconsciously rip someone off.

That being said, i'm a member of a HP fanfic author's discord, and there is stilll good stuff being written, it just gets buried by the 1,000s of "Harry is sodomized by a neo-Nazi" and "Hermione is molested by her Potions Prof" fics. You really have to dig to find anything that is well written by someone typing with both hands 🙃

** Very common problem amd if I dont have a fic to read I dont feel right. Used to sort by over 100k words and completed, then it included in progress and slowly the filter is being lowered but the frequency of finding good fic that actually get finished is slowly dropping. After a couple hundred fics all you can do is start over and re-read your favorites.

** I've been reading Harry Potter Fanfics for about a year now, I am relatively new to it considering, and yet I'm in the same predicament you're in.

​

I have certain fics that I like, for example I prefer the longer, darker, and more realistic side of Fanfics, where Harry grows to become a bit jaded and darker, but still the character we love, so the maturer side of the Fanfic world, however the few good ones I've read and the rest are just poor smut filled nonsense that's incredibly cringy to read.

​

Don't get me wrong I don't mind "Lemons" in stories, it happens, its life, but when it's just the focus point its just awful and mind boggling.

​

So whilst I have not been around for probably as long as most people here have been, I am also just struggling to find stories that interest me.

** I extremely rarely read fanfiction now because I went through most of what was published that I wanted to read/considered worth reading a few years ago and it's such an incredible struggle to find something worth reading. The overwhelming majority of fanfiction, even the stuff recommended here, is just absolute garbage. Every once in a great while something sparks interest and ends up being good, but it's rare.

The last long fanfic I read was Antithesis and that was last September. Before that was a half dozen Twiligh femslash stories when I first looked into that a couple months before Antithesis, and then before that was back to August/September of 2018 with four or five HP fics.

** I do, but at the same time, I don't. Just let me explain myself.

I've been reading fanfics during four years now, and I think I've seen the most of types of fanfics. Good Voldemort, Drarry, Gray Harry, time travel, Slytherin Harry, fics about other characters like Percy Weasley, the lost sister of Harry, etc. But the thing is that, even when you know the most of the plot, it's still fun to read the histories.

I don't know why, but doesn't care how many times I read about how powerful is Harry at true and how evil is the light side, it still entertaining me. So, yes, I have problems looking for new creative fics, but I never found myself in the search of a fanfic. There's just too many I didn't read!

(Did I explain my point well? English is not my first language, so I'm sorry if this is confuse or it has bad grammatic).

** I mean I have the same issue, but sometimes there are some really great hidden gems both on ao3 and on ffn, just have to look for them. Some of the ones I found a while ago are picking up speed now, which is great for them but I kind of wanted them to stay a secret, y'know? I'm reading one at the minute its pretty good called The Glass Orphan. The author's written two more and she's good. Veery Black Family based.
