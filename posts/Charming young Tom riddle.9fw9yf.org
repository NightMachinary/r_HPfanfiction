An absolutely amazing story with some of the best OCs I've ever read. A big rec for anyone interested in young TMR.

It is romance, but it's an OFC, so maybe it is okay.

** Are you okay with crossovers? Or are you just looking for something only in the HP verse?

**** Alright, how about one where Luna went back in time and raised Tom, however the core of his character is still manipulative. No romances at all in that one.
