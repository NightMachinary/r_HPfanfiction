I just posted chapter 13 of In the Bleak Midwinter. In 1927, Tessie isn't yet Ron Weasley's great aunt. She's a young, ambitious woman, who deserves to be shipped as much as any other character. I can confidently say that this is the best story on AO3 shipping her with anyone. Of course, it's also the worst.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** I've enjoyed this story very much so far, although I have found myself wondering where exactly it's headed. The pacing is very slow but I have to say, the outrageous attention to detail and dated dialogue kill me because it just sounds so authentically 20s!

*** I'm glad you're enjoying it. Don't worry, the ending is written already, but yes, I'd better get a move on if I hope to get there this century. Future chapters will cover more time. Readers who've been enjoying my attention to detail will be like, wait, Tommy's how old now? I missed a bunch of birthdays!
