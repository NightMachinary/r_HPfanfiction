Seriously, given the number of fics featuring "reformed" versions Narcissa and Bella, typically involved with Harry or Hermione, it's clear many fans enjoy older women pairings featuring aristocratic women yet Andromeda is barely ever written about despite being both "good" in alignment and with few canon strings attached. I'd say she could easily fulfill the Marauder Era version of Daphne Greengrass; that of a character who has little official information that the fandom can mold into various forms.

*** Strange really when other "housewives" in the series get expansion in fandom (Molly is seemingly an evil manipulator in certain quarters).

With Andromeda all we get is a description of resembling Bella to a large degree only with kind brown eyes and features. From there you could go sweet and innocent, a controlled cruel streak, an heiress now integrated into the Muggle world, a forgotten matriarch ready to take her place post-War or anything in between.

** Bella, Narcissa are the ultimate taboo fantasies. The mother of your rivals, and a bad girl who you show her place. While Andromeda has a much better counterpart, Tonks. Older girl? Check. Exotic? Metamorphmagus? Check. Check. Has Black blood? Check.

That's my reasoning. Though many harem stories do include her just for /completeness/.

**** Belive me, I like to use her in my fics, but the simple matter is that she is quite difficult to fit into most plots you usually see with Narcissa or Bellatrix because she is actually a decent human being. Her simply ditching Edward like, for example, Narcissa does to Lucius in quite a few fics would be quite OOC.

I mean, you could try to spin Andromeda's marriage as one of convenience and therefore Harry is not really butting in, but I feel like that takes away from her character because her motive was "love above her own family" rather than "cold-blooded calculation".

****** But, disregarding the common plots from Bellatrix and Narcissa, what is really left for Andromeda? You can have her adopt Harry (I'm writing a fic with that premise), but romance is not really an option due to the age difference before at least HBP, and even that would be kinda questionable at best. After all, Andromeda is ~6 years older than his own mother.

So you are left with postwar scenarios, and, in a fic centred around Andromeda and Harry, that would really emphasise how Pyrrhic the canon victory was. And any postwar fic should come with a mountain of emotional baggage, at least with those two as protagonists.

Maybe time travel, but honestly, I have an easier time plotting out a Harry/Lily fic in the 70s than trying to tie Andromeda (who had Tonks by 1973) into something which would resolve Voldemort without massive time jumps.

********** I object on the attention bit. I'm writing a fic with her as a central character which has 2655 followers and 1735 favourites, making it my most popular work by far. And numbers 14 by favourites and 9 by followers when it comes to Andromeda fics on FFN. But that's because it has Harry as a main character and Andromeda "merely" adopting him. And judging by the reviews, most people are happy to see that and their interactions rather than reading something without Harry in it.

If you look through Andromeda stories and disregard those with Harry in them (and some Hermione/Bellatrix and Hermione/Narcissa), you won't find much until your deep down the result pages.

As for Andromeda being involved with the Order, well, she wasn't a member in book 5. Obviously that can be changed, but it's either a token effort or her effectively fixing the canon issues the Order has. The big problem with a ya literature is useless adults. And having one of them competent makes the rest look really bad. A competent Order would defeat Voldemort pretty easily, if he is made competent, magical Britain stands no chance.

We had Snape hook up with half of Hogwarts by now, but I can't think of one single, normal fic that has Sinistra, or Vector.

The same argument works for Bellatrix as well. There's even a cute gif of Helena and Emma from the DH set where they hug each other in costume (I think it was after shooting the torture scene).

** I would love more fics about teenage Andromeda!

I wrote a one-shot and have an expanded version on my (very long) list of future fics because I just find her early life so fascinating. When did she fall in love with Ted? Did she run away with him during school, like Sirius did, or wait until she had graduated? If it was during school, what was her relationship with her sisters like? Was she close with her sisters at all? Did she confide in them about her feelings for Ted? Or did they have to keep their relationship a secret - and how did they manage that? Did Professor Sprout help them by giving them detentions together as an excuse to spend time with each other? Did they disguise themselves so they could go on a Hogsmeade date together? Did they write long, beautiful love letters to each other during the holidays, or was that too risky for Andromeda? Did she sneak out of the house to meet him during the summer? Did she sneak out of the Slytherin dungeons to meet him in an abandoned tower? Did Ted play Quidditch, and did Andromeda watch him play? Did /she/ play Quidditch? Did they realise their feelings for each other when they had an Amortentia lesson in Potions, or before? I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING!

That depends on how old you think she is. She was the middle sister, meaning that she's born between 1951 and 1955 (52-54 if she is not the twin of Bellatrix or Narcissa). Tonks was born 73, meaning that she was conceived in 72 (otherwise she would have shared a year with Harry at Hogwarts). Conceived in 72 means that Andromeda was somewhere between 17 and 21 (18-20 most likely).

So assuming that Andromeda did not have her daughter from the first (few) times she has slept with Edward, it is pretty reasonable to assume that they were involved at school already, or at least interested in each other.

**** I was actually talking more about whether she ran away from home during school, as Sirius did, or whether she hid her relationship with Ted from her family until they had both graduated!

Interesting points, though! I tend not to get too bogged down in the maths of it all, personally, as we know that JKR has issues with maths. I take any canon-adjacent dates, including the birth and death dates of the extended Black family, with a pinch of salt anyway. Because if we take the charity tree she drew as fact, then Walburga and Bellatrix were both born when their fathers were just 13 and presumably still at Hogwarts, which makes me feel more than a little uncomfortable. So I usually just shoogle the dates around a little to suit whatever I happen to be writing at the time!

The wards might have been airtight, yet it would still have been ridiculously easy to simply starve Harry out. How much food do the Dursleys have stored? A week maybe. And Harry could maybe last three weeks without food. So that's two months which Harry could survive with Voldemort in charge, yet he'd be holed up and unable to leave unless he fancied his odds of fighting his way out, which means that we're back at square one where Number 4 is useless.

** Because Narcissa and Bellatrix get far more time on paper than Andromeda does, not to mention her complete absence in the movies. The vast majority of the ff pairing Narcissa/Bellatrix with a younger person are because stupid people saw the gif of Helena Carter hugging Emma Watson after the torture scene in the last movie.

What does poor Andromeda do in comparison to her sisters? Offer her home as a safe point to the Order, get tortured for her troubles, watch and care for her daughter after her son-in-law walks out after getting said daughter pregnant, watch and wait as her husband is forced to flee for his life after the Order is unable to help him, hear her husband's murder over the radio, and finally, watch as her daughter and son-in-law leave for battle a few weeks after her grandson is born - only to never see them alive again.

All that is not quite as "amazing" as Helena Carter hugging Emma Watson, I'm afraid.

** I 've been wanting so badly to read a fic about Andromeda dealing with life post-war. Raising Teddy, forming some sort of relationship with Harry, scrutiny from the Wizarding public because of her sisters.

These are a few ideas:

- Hermione, Ron, and Harry get to know Andromeda and Teddy after the war. They begin to deal with their year on the run and Hermione's torture, and Andy learns what happened to Ted.\\
- While Andy is arranging the funeral of Remus and Dora, Rita Skeeter thinks she has her next big scoop with the finding of Ted Tonks' body in the forests near Malfoy Manor.

**** I don't picture Andy as a frail grandmother. She was strong enough to walk away from her parents and sisters to marry Ted, and stayed with him when things got tough. She even aligned herself with the Order, which likely incensed Bellatrix. Having to deal with the disappearance and presumed death of her husband, the murder of her daughter and son-in-law, and suddenly becoming the guardian of her baby grandson would be extremely stressful. Yes, she may recover, but loss of loved ones would have a profound effect on her.

I was thinking more along the lines of Rita finding out about the existence of the Order and getting the names of some members, and then deciding to scuttle around.

Yes, Andy would understandably not be fond of Remus, but that doesn't mean that she can't have some good memories of him, or be upset about his murder.

From where? They did not share time at Hogwarts and Andi did not become an Order member until HBP or between books 6 and 7, at which point the Order was basically nothing but a radio show. If anything, she has heard of how he showed her daughter the cold shoulder. And how he ran. At which point there was probably very little which could ever move her opinion higher than "contempt".

** There's a few reasons for it - primarily, though, it's because she's not a prominent character - and both Narcissa and Bellatrix have much more prominent roles.

Secondly, her position - starting off 'good' and happily married - makes her less appealing for a pairing with Harry. I'd liken that more to a pairing with Molly than with Bellatrix or Narcissa. With those two, the appeal is less 'aristocratic' women I think, but more 'redeeming the evil girl' method. There are also many more options for pairings on the 'good' side than on the 'evil' one - so you're likelier to see Tonks get chosen as a pairing over her mother. We see the same thing with Draco (and would see the same thing if flipping his gender or he had a sister).

You're right that she could be an option in Marauder era fics for a Daphne type character, but... well, Marauder fics aren't as popular as the mainline one, and I think her lack of presence in canon makes it less appealing, particularly since there's usually another redeemable slytherin or two running around.

In the main time period, I think she's most fitting as a sort of mother figure or family to Harry, and she shines in such settings. Adopting/looking out for Harry works in a pre-war setting - and in a post-war one, they form Teddy's family, so there's a lot of room for interaction and more familiar relationship. But I think a non-romantic one fits better there, at least for Andromeda.
