Writing a Muggle AU fic where basically Harry was stuck with the Dursley's and have gotten a few comments hating on Dumbledore and how they can see that this was him manipulating the situation. And like I'm all for a good Manipulative!Dumbledore but honestly that isn't what the plot is like. So I feel like I'm letting down the readers who are expecting and wanting that.

But on the other hand it's my fic and so many times I'm like #yolo let's be different. It's ugh sometimes. Does anyone else ever feel like this?


** I've had a few comments that were either reactionary or completely misunderstood a certain plot point. In those cases, I tend to think like-- Even though I was expecting a different reaction, it's good that the readers are engaging with the story in that way. It signals their attachment.

On the other hand, I wouldn't allow the opinions of your readers to sway the trajectory of your story. Only you know the message you're trying to convey, and, though your readers may give valuable input, if your intention is to reveal later that Dumbledore wasn't actually being all that manipulative... Then stick by that. Let the reader go on that journey with you. And if they don't like it, and they leave, then there will be others to replace them. And those will be /your/ people, who really jive with your style & identify with your storytelling.

*** Chiming in as Merry's co-writer for our fic.

Like she said, stay the course. To draw an example from our project: People have repeatedly had difficulties with our Ron and assumed we were bashing, considering that at the time we had him acting in such a way that he was aggressive and butting heads with his friends. It wasn't until later chapters that he was revealed to have motivations behind his aggression that he was able to tackle head on with the people he trusted and now our readers are seeing a side to him that they thought they'd never get, because they assumed what they had from what little information was given.

This is the occupational hazard of episodic writing. People are going to have thoughts on what current information they have and then expound upon that. Sometimes they hit the nail on the head and are incredibly perceptive, other times they're completely off base. Don't change the story solely because people are misinterpreting what you've characterized for Dumbledore. This is your story; if Dumbledore being manipulative ruins what you have planned down the line, then it isn't worth it to change him to a manipulative Dumbledore just to placate the audience.

Maybe some people will get disappointed and not stick with the story; that's just the way of writing. But those who do stick around and appreciate what you've worked hard to lay out, those are the people you want to write for!

** I can't speak from firsthand experience of writing, but I've come across cases before where someone stopped reading a story because they didn't think something made sense, and having read the whole thing I knew that it would be adequately explained if they kept going.

If they've made their minds up, there's not much you can do. Those who like the story are more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt and keep going to find out.

** Can confirm as someone who's written a different sort of Dursley situation with reasonable sympathetic Dumbledore, I've had people make things up and twist events in the story to fit this narrative they wanted to see.

Sometimes when Dumbledore looks at Harry, it's because that's how people talk to each other. Not because it's ligilimency. Sometimes a rock is just a rock.

Some people equate the Dursleys mere existence with a manipulative Dumbledore. Some people have crazy expectations.

So my advice is don't worry about feeling like you're disappointing your readers, because to put it bluntly, you ARE disappointing some readers. They're upset because your story isnt for them.

The one you dont want to disappoint is yourself. No one else is spending even close to the time with it that you are, so you're the one you need to take care of first.

** I've stopped following fics because the author takes it in a direction I disagree with. No hard feelings, it just means the fic simply isn't for me anymore.

I've also seen authors influenced by comments, for better or worse. This can improve a story, but can also make it worse, or simply just different. I know one particular fic that I was fairly sure was heading in a certain direction, but then suddenly did a 180 in a completely different direction. While this didn't stop me from reading it, and there was plenty of things in the fic I liked still, I was not at all a fan of the sudden change in direction. I suspect the change might have come about from comments, but I never bothered asking the author about it so I might be completely off.

** If you have 30 people read the first few chapters of a book, they're all going to have a different expectation of the end product (outside of the absolute bottom line details). This is the same with fanfiction. To me the important part is making sure you're sticking to the idea of the story in your head as ultimately thats the only vision that matters. People will always find something to criticise or dislike at the end of the day.

** You probably are letting some readers down, but there is nothing wrong with that. There are plenty of fics I dislike that are praised on here and plenty of fics I like that are filled with tropes that are pretty much universally disliked. It isn't your job to cater to your readers, just write what you want to write.

** Write a Dumbledore who isn't always infallible and perfectly in control. Someone who doesn't know every little detail. Who is genuinely shocked by how bad the Dursleys are.

** Comments on my fics when I was a pre/young teen put me off writing for good. People are cruel out there.

For what it's worth, Manipulative!Dumbledore isn't my cup of tea. There's fics out there for everyone - so try not to worry about their expectations because you're providing something that people are looking for, just not those particular commenters.

** I'm not an author so it's probably not my place to give an advice, but you should consider yourself as your most important reader.\\
Write a story that /you/ want to read, and the others can either like it or leave it. The most other readers could ever ask of you is to be consistant in your writing (as an example, don't do half your story with a pretty canonish universe, before going full tropey with "Lord Harry" and "Magical Core" to your second half without any reason for the change), and even this is debatable.

** If your readers are not disappointed by fact that your story is a Muggle AU then that clearly shows your readers are undisapointable so don't worry about it.
