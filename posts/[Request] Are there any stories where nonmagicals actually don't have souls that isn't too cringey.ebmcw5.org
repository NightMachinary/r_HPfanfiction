I'm really interested in a played-straight story where nonmagicals /actually don't have souls/, but the characters are the same. So, y'know, repercussions from that irrefutable fact (in that universe).

Are there any good, or at least okay, stories with that premise? Heck, are there any READABLE stories with that premise?

EDIT: The origin of this pondering was that it's a common trope that Dark families believe that muggles don't have souls, with their lack of being able to produce a ghost being proof.


** Aside from the dementors terrorizing Dudley, there's no indication that muggles have souls in canon.

*** You are totally wrong since the dementor tried to kiss Dudley too. Remember, dementors only go after those who have souls.

**** That's why I said aside from that. That's the only scene that requires a muggle to have a soul. The rest of canon works fine without muggles having souls.

***** It's the only scene that even is relevant to muggle souls, no?

Isn't that enough evidence to think that they so rather than don't?

****** It's enough evidence to show that they do have souls in canon, but that fact has no repercussions on the plot whatsoever.

I mean, if muggles can't make horcruxes or be secret-keepers, that doesn't change anything since it's not like they do that anyway. It would be cool to make muggles immune to dementors. That idea has potential.

** Well, what they call a "soul" is just a thing detectable by Dementors and dark magic, it's not necessarily the same thing as what religion describes with the word.

** I haven't heard of any, but jeez, that would certainly make magical elitism impossible to wipe out, if it wasn't already.

*** Yeah, I'm really interested in "playing it straight", as it were. A bad fanfic would have all wizards immediately become psychopaths, but it would be an interesting conflict for a piece of fanfiction that doesn't have to be Voldemort-centred.
