I remember a really bizarre crack!fic from years and years ago called something along the lines of "Life ain't no tupperware party - The story from the RIGHT side of the war"

It was dumb, and pointless, and I loved it. If anyone has any leads, I'd be super grateful! I know trying to hunt down anything from quizilla is pretty hopeless nowadays.


** This is the best I could do! One of her other stories (Destined Tragedy) is one of the first fics I remember reading. Might have to give it another go haha [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080211102206/http://www.quizilla.com/users/rohanelf/stuff/]]

*** I was trying to figure out how to get to it with web archive! Couldn't remember the author's name :)

I'll copy it into a word document and read it that way, just in case something happens to the archive. Thanks!

EDIT: Actually, looking up Destined Tragedy, I definitely remember a fic by that title and description! Thanks doubly :)
