This was brought up by a review I received, and I got to thinking (yikes). I've read the Springhole article on the subject, but I'm curious about a more specifically HP view. What do you think about giving canon characters another sibling/offspring? Is it possible to do it well, or does it always feel a little 'off'? Have you ever read any fics where it really seemed necessary to the plot, or do they always feel tacked on?

More specific to the review I got, what about OC siblings/offspring that are born in the course of the fic? Do you think it's good when well-written, or always unnecessary?


** To respond in general:

Nothing is *always* anything in fanfiction.

But having a character be related to X might not be /necessary/ in your specific story (I don't know which story or character we're referring to.)

It also depends on the context. A story who's opening premise is something akin to: "what would happen if so and so had a sibling?" obviously needs that additional character to exist.

Whether that story will then be any good depends on the author's ability to make it work but that's a separate issue.

It's like... SI's. Stories with SI's are usually bad. But that's not because an SI exists in the story, it's just a bad story for the same reasons any other story would be bad and happens to contain an SI. I suspect the number of extant SI fics that are bad is a side effect of the reason I'm writing an SI story- It's easier for a new writer, so you get a lot of goofy first timer mistakes, rather than anything inherent in the genre. SI's, after all, are just pre-cogs with bizarre attachments to random people.

***** Oh, I see. I understand why SI's are usually bad, too, then, keeping many fanfic writers in mind.

But I find it fascinating, the way writers imprint themselves into the story. Some try not to do it at all, and come up with stories that have nothing to do with them at all, and then there are writers who use their own self-image when creating characters and have their book filled with different versions of themself. I've never read any papers or books about the way writers affect stories and vice versa, as in: what came first: the writer or the story? But I'd love to read about it.

*** All very good points, especially about nothing being 'always.' :) There are 'usually's, though, like usually stories where Harry wrongfully goes to Azkaban are not very good. Out of curiosity, since we seem to be the only two talking about this right now, have you ever read a story with an OC sibling you liked (the story, not just the character)? I can't think of one I liked, and I've been wracking my brain.

**** Well... my SI main character I was talking about in my "I'm a new writer" story has long since stopped being me and developed attachments to other characters. I'm rather fond of twisted logic involved in the fact that he legit considers Faith Lehane his sister because Drusilla made them both the way they are (Vampire in his case, and Slayer in hers.)

In a similar vein, there's a story out there somewhere that has Tom Riddle get loose from the diary a few years early and kidnaps Harry to study him and winds up adopting an older brother role in Harry's life... but I can't recall anything else other than liking the story and it ending unfinished far too early.

Aside from those... I actually never got into the Wrong BWL or etc genre and can't really recall reading any stories where there was an extra sibling that was... relevant.

** In the Innocent series by Marauderlover7, Draco has an older brother whose presence drastically alters Draco's personality and upbringing. I don't think Draco's (extremely well written!) plot would be able to unfold the way it does without having a brother.

To contrast, Draco also has an older brother in the They Shook Hands series who feels extremely unnecessary. Having him there doesn't really damage the fic though, it's just odd.

As to the second half of your question, I think it depends on the fic. I've seen several stories where Lily and James live and go on to have more children after Harry. It makes sense in the course of the story because if they hadn't died, why wouldn't they have gone on to have more kids?

Out of curiosity, to whom did you give a sibling or offspring?

*** I tried to read They Shook Hands, and I remember Draco's older brother being the first turn-off for me. I agree, he's very unnecessary, and I felt like he messed with an otherwise interesting dynamic, although that wasn't what ultimately made me quit the series. I have never read the Innocent series, although I've seen it recced before.

That's very true - James and Lily always struck me as the kind who would have wanted at least two kids, if not three or four.

I didn't give anyone a sibling or offspring, but apparently some people really want Draco to have a sibling? The review suggested giving Lucius & Narcissa a second child (makes some sense in context). It was a very intelligent, very well thought out review that asked several excellent questions, so it seemed wise to at least mull the idea over.

***** Ah, I see. No, actually I gave a canon couple a miscarriage in their backstory, after which they stopped trying to have more children, leaving only canon offspring. There were other things in the review, but that particular part of the review suggested that I have them have another child in-story, presumably as a means of healing, although they didn't specify why they thought it would be a good idea. I doubt I have the skill to pull that off well, but it made me curious about the general attitudes toward that kind of thing.

Okay, in that context I'd say that it's "not necessary."

Which is different than saying it'd be a bad idea, just that there are other ways a couple could 'heal' which pre-supposes that the couple is even still struggling with it in the context of the story and hadn't already come to terms with it off screen.

I don't know about them being 'healed' or not, because they just...never talked about it again, and they've had separate bedrooms ever since. I can see where that might not be considered healthy, but I also don't think that succeeding in having another baby would magically fix everything, either, you know? All the old issues would still be there, and the strain of a new pregnancy would probably just make things worse, and since there don't seem to be any therapists in the wizarding world....

I guess that's part of why I even considered it - it would make for great drama, if handled correctly.

** I think there's a few different types and tolerances people have for it.

There's giving an OC sibling / offspring to a major character we canonically know didn't have any. Like giving Harry a sibling or Sirius a daughter who is friends with the trio. Usually these have that "what if Sirius had a daughter..." premise where they re-write the story to fit around the OC. People enjoy that stuff and it can be written well, although others might dismiss it as Mary Sue or Self-Insert fantasy. Some of it do it well and the OC fits in well with the universe. Others, not so well. I read one story (and this was well before the Pottermore stuff on Remus came out) that gave him an older brother and it worked well because the brother had feelings of resentment towards Remus over causing their family so much stress growing up and how they always had to move around to protect him. But they managed to overcome it and become closer as the story progressed.

Then there's giving siblings / offspring to characters who we know little about their home life. For all we know, Kingsley Shacklebolt might have had a wife and kids that's not mentioned in the books or Hannah Abbott might have had a brother in another year.

I write a lot of stories with minor characters so I do the latter quite frequently. It doesn't make sense that everyone in Harry's year is an only child so I'll give characters like Hannah Abbott or Terry Boot siblings. I write next-gen so it's pretty acceptable to give canon characters offspring there. I've done Harry-has-a-sister too and most people who read it are reading it because they enjoy the trope although I get the occasional nasty anon who just writes "MARY SUE" with nothing else. Considering I've put a lot of effort into my character and making sure she's realistic I would have liked to known why they felt that why. So I just dismiss them as one of those people who think all female OCs related to canon characters are Mary Sues.

As for siblings/offspring born in the story, I'm sure it can work. Teddy Lupin was born in the course of the HP stories. I imagine the pregnancy would be a plot point or there would be some reasoning behind it. Otherwise, it's just random to suddenly have, say, Narcissa get pregnant and have another child, but the pregnancy and child have no effect on the story.

*** Oh, I /hate/ that kind of 'review'! 'MARY SUE' and nothing else doesn't help you improve, since there is no actual criticism attached. Not that that kind of person is at all concerned with helping - just whatever jollies they get from feeling superior, I guess. And they probably have no idea what they're talking about, since being a female OC does not automatically equal Mary Sue.

That's an excellent point - I actually did read a fic once (non-HP) where there was the MC, the MC's Love Interest, the Sidekick, and the Antagonist, all doing the Plot, right? Well, about halfway through the story, Love Interest got pregnant, and /immediately/ the Plot ceased to exist. Even the Antagonist completely forgot that he hates these people and started helping out with baby preparations.... I had to wonder if the fic got abandoned and then picked up by someone else, it was /that/ jarring. Definitely an example for me to keep in mind to avoid!

** Hmm ... well, my viewpoint of it is that for as long as it's done well, “sure, why not”.

Because really, any character like that is basically an OC, no different than any other OC really, and what matters is that the character is interesting and not pointless and the story is actually well written.

I do remember reading a fairly good story centred around Draco and an OC who was basically his squib younger sister, hidden by the family from the world. And there is also a story (“Biting the Hand That Feeds You”, by Andrew Joshua Talon) in which most Death Eaters have squib children that they “disposed of”, and it results in something utterly hilarious (the story is generally made of crack, to be honest, highlights including “the Godfather”, “the Loremaster”, and “businessman Draco”).

** Meh, canon is broken constantly, be it subtly or massively. If it benefits the story, then I see nothing wrong with it, that includes creating more siblings or other family members.

I read one fic in which Harry had a little sister, and they grew up together at the Dursleys. I remember I didn't really like the direction in which the story was headed, but I really like Harry as a big brother. His protective tendencies are heartwarming to read when done right. And that story also had them teaming up to do sneaky shit and get Harry to Hogwarts, and they had a catchprase like "We're Potters, and we ..." can't remember. Maybe one of you could tell me which fic I'm talking about: it was a Harry/Ginny pairing fic, if I recall correctly, the little sister was called Emma and she was a metamorphmagus.

Anyway, to answer your question: I don't mind. It could spice up the plot if done right.

** I feel like if nothing states that a canon child is an only child, then it should be fine to add children to them. Usually when I thought of it, I wouldn't give a canon child offspring unless they were really minor and Harry didn't know. For all we know, someone more minor like Madame Malkin could have a sibling or even an offsping we don't know about.

I wouldn't do stuff like give Harry a non-canon sibling since that would be too AU for my liking, however some characters can be given OC siblings and not contradict book canon at all due to the way its done. Characters like Madame Malkin might have a son/daughter that Harry just never met in canon. Even with some more relevant characters, who is to say Fudge or Scrimgeour never had siblings/offspring? Theoretically, nothing denies that it happened and could have reasonably happened at some point.

The only time I make characters related to canon characters is if the canon character wasn't that important, if I'm writing a sorting scene of a non-Harry generation so I just need a few OCs related to a canon character. Even if its just being in the same family as some wizard from a chocolate frog card not even from the books, but only if the OCs are really minor to the point of apathy. I just go to wikia, go the the frog cards, pick a person, then use their surname even if the OCs are just minor characters (its more about laziness for me in THAT case). Then I'd just make up like 30 other names unrelated to cannon. For example in one of my ideas, I made one of the OCs being sorted be from the Lestrange family. Now nothing says that Rabastan and Rodolphus never had another brother/sister, so I made the OC's father be an OC brother to Rodolphus/Rabastan. If I didn't make that distinction, readers might assume the OC was the child of either Rodolphus or Rabastan (which since the OC was born in 1987 would literally be impossible since those two would be in Azkaban) whereas I added a third brother to avert that.

My personal advice: if you are going to make an OC be the child/sibling/niece/nephew/descendant of a canon character, just have a way to explain it which doesn't wreck canon. As long as the OC doesn't make the canon character act too OOC (unless its an AU in which case it would be somewhat expected) then its fine. Someone like Bellatrix isn't going to have a kid born between 1982-1994 because she's in Azkaban and never had kids in canon according to HBP. Someone more minor like Madame Malkins or Madame Rosmerta, or one of the people in Harry's year we didn't really meet like Sally-Anne Perks? They could have had family that we never knew about because Harry didn't know. Someone like Dolohov? Maybe he had a son/daughter before he got arrested.

** Only do this if it is INTEGRAL to the story. Do NOT add new siblings (older, younger or babies) unless there is a specific reason to do so. Even then, that person had better be super important to the story, and then you'll probably get accused of making a Mary Sue or direct Self-Insert.

If it is a mostly unknown character like Slyth or Puff then you have a chance, but a main character who's story we already know?... just no...

btw I despise the "wrong boy who lived" fics where Harry has a sibling... The only time I see Harry having siblings work is when he travels to an AU, or its an AU where James and Lily lived. Even Hermione doesn't need siblings (but it might work only because her family is completely off screen for most of the series, but why didn't they get mentioned when her parents were sent to Australia?)

** I mean, to me, as soon as you add a non-canon sibling, your story is AU. Harry does not have a sibling in canon. If you give him one, we have entered an alternate universe. Which isn't good or bad on its own, just a reality. So then it comes down to what you prefer to read. Me, I don't like AUs. I have only the smallest passing interest in them. For me, it doesn't matter how well written it may be, if it strays outside of canon, I'm probably going to hit the back button because I'm much more interested in seeing how people write inside the world we've been given. That's just my personal preference as a reader, though. I'm sure it is possible to do it well, but what I've seen of these AUs, it does usually feel tacked on, or self-insert.

For canon, I just re-read the books, because they're beautiful as they are (with the exception of the epilogue, which accounts for my usually reading AUs even when they're set post-canon). I just love 'what if' scenarios, so you wouldn't have clicked on my story in the first place. To each their own. :) Thank you for your opinion, it's good to see all the sides!
