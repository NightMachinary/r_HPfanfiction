LF stories in which upon being confronted with the fact that the official way of solving the Umbridge Problem won't work Harry promptly jumps to the brute-magic approach and starts using magic to make to get away while making her believe he attended detention.

I honestly am kind of baffled by why there isn't more stories in which the good guys erase their enemies memories to solve problems when they can't use the law. Frequently obliviating Umbridge seems like it should be the first response of anyone who passed even just one detention with her, and if it permanently damages her mind... well, not like it's harming anyone important. And this would be even more so considering that she is antagonizing children and teens who would have little to no sense of consequence of their actions to themselves or others, would be quite self-centered, hormonal enough to anger quickly and have access to a library with practical guides of how to erase someone's memory -and double so for Harry as he also has the emotions of an unstable and quick to anger Dark Lord swimming around on his head.


** Something not quite similar but within the same vein happens in linkffn(Son of Potterx Daughter of Black).

Melania (fem!Harry) is a wolf animagus, still getting used to controlling her inner animal and being able to transform. Dobby, Kreacher, and Winky all look after her while at Hogwarts, and see that Umbridge is a threat. They slowly dose her with some kind of drugs that make her more paranoid, and slightly hallucinate, so over the course of the year she sees signs of Mel's wolf animagus and thinks that she's a new breed of werewolf, eventually abandoning Hogwarts and fleeing the country in fear. At this point in the story Fudge is essentially over politically so, by extension, Umbridge is too, so she wasn't able to interfere nearly as much at Hogwarts or abuse the students like she did in canon. It's moreso played as a background gag.
