Hello everyone ! I'm looking for a fic where Harry would be fascinated by comics like Marvels and the likes in his childhood and when discovering that he is a wizard, decides to become the first superhero ever. Trying to reproduce some of the powers of his favorite superheros, and saving people in the muggle world (and maybe endangering the Statute of Secrecy in the process). Please no Godlike!Harry.

I don't want an actual crossover, just Harry inspired by muggle fiction. I'd prefer no slash though it doesn't bother me much, but please no smut.

If you could find m something like this it'd be great, thanks guys.


** Heh. In my story Harry kind of did this by reading and trying to imitate comic books, but only to develop his powers, not so much to become an actual superhero.

I had a read of it so far, I'm liking it well enough.
