** /Ice Princess/ by Luan Mao might fit your criteria of Daphne as an idiot. She has brain damage due to childhood abuse and thus has an odd personality and has trouble remembering things. It's an interesting, short fic at the very least.

** To be fair, she is a blank state and the only time her name is mentionned in Canon is when she passes the Charm or Defense OWL (can't remember which one) at the same time than Hermione.

Later, Rowling said that she was a Slytherin, and member of Parkinson gang. I know that fanon loves to portrays her as a Ice Queen who is too inteligent to believe in Blood Purity, but few infos we have gives more credit to a bigoted girl who is just as mean as Parkinson. May or may not be beautiful, but Harry never ever looked at her so we don't really know.

â€‹

As for recommendations, I remember some "Idiot Daphne" fics, like in linkffn(Innocent) , but she is just a background character in most so don't know if that counts.

*** There are a fair number of Haphne fics where Daphne and/or her family are blood supremacists even though Harry himself isn't dark!harry or evil!harry.

To be honest those are my favorites as they seem the most realistic given what we know of canon.

**** I'm surprised we don't see it more often. Rather that Harry discovering the existence of Daphne in 4/5/6th year (which is a bit ridiculous when seem to be less than 40 in their year and they spends half their class in the same room), I believe a bigoted Daphne that grow out of her view would more interesting.

Not only would it give a cursed lover plot (I admit to have a linking to this kind of scenario), but it also gives the opportunity for a lot of character building.

***** While I generally agree its not that ridiculous. Harrys year has considerably more than just 40 students, the 40 we know of are just from some list Rowling used to have names on hand for when Harry had to interact with people from his year, it was not intended to be his enitire year.

Him discovering Daphnes existence in later years makes perfect sense, simce in canon he didnt know Theodore nott until they shared Slughorns class and he didnt know Susan Bones until they met at Dumbledores Army.

** linkfnn(13041698) What's Her Name in Hufflepuff, one of the very few self inserts I recommend, in which a girl over her head accidentally fucks up canon and has to be the heroine.

Daphne in this one... We don't know yet whether she's an excellent slytherin fucking with people or has been smoking that Greengrass as she seems to have more than a few screws loose. We do know Daphne absolutely loves turtles and hates being told who she's allowed to talk to.

Edit: Either I screwed something up or the robot is busy getting drunk, sorry bout that but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][here's the link]]
