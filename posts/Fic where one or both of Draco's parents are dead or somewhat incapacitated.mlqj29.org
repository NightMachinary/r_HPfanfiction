I meant incapacitated as in, they might be sick, in a coma, missing, etc. I don't care if it's more of a minor detail or will occur later. Any ship, if there's any, except dramione.


** Well it will be EVENTUAL dramione but that isn't a point in the plot in this bit. Draco's Dad is killed pretty early on:

  Draco wants to kill himself, but he's trying not to be dramatic about it. Harry wants to sleep with Draco, but he's trying not to be obvious about it. Misunderstandings! Pining! Grief! Self-loathing but in a kind of charming way?Feat. Misty the house elf who takes shit from no one, an Astoria who has her own mysterious aims, a Draco who is determined to use humour to get through things, and a Harry doesn't know what he wants, except maybe to touch Draco's pretty face.

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy is convinced that his mother has been murdered, not committed suicide, the way the Aurors have decided. He demands that Harry Potter, disgraced Auror, help him investigate to prove it and catch her killer. But the longer Harry and Draco investigate Malfoy Manor, the more Harry becomes uneasily aware that there is something strange about the stories Draco is telling him---and the little room that's always kept locked.

  Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy knew how to conduct himself with the decorum befitting his pureblood status. That did not account for how he felt and acted around Albus Potter.

  Draco will die in six months if he can't get Harry Potter to fall in love with him. Since that's not going to happen, he might as well spend his last days working through his Bucket List. Tap-dancing lessons? Rock climbing? Poetry-writing? Threesomes? Cocaine? Getting to know his adorable cousin, Teddy Lupin? Draco will try them all! Feat. Cheerily pessimistic Draco, devoted bitch queen Pansy Parkinson, and a Harry who can't help but notice that something seems DIFFERENT about Draco, these days.Inspired by a lovely piece by khasael called Somebody To Love.
