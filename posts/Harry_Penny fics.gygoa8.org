Any good Harry/Penny fics where Penny is the only pairing. Would be awesome if you guys can comment finished fics. I've only encountered Harem stories. I would be interested if Hermione and Luna aren't involved.


** Penny Haywood is about seven years older than Harry. The only time they would have been at Hogwarts together, she would have been a seventh year taking her NEWTs and Harry would have been a first year. Shipping them would be creepy on several levels.

You'd be better off specifying this as an "after Hogwarts" thing, but by that point, I still doubt they'd be a ship, given how they'd only really have interactions post-Hogwarts when Harry's already got far stronger relationships (romantic or otherwise) with those he's actually grown up around.

*** I'm pretty sure OP was talking about Penelope Clearwater, the Ravenclaw prefect Percy dated. Even then Penelope is still several years older than Harry, like 4 I believe.

*** Definitely creepy when she's at Hogwarts. OOTP/HBP after he's been Shazammed, Penny fits into the same sort of plotlines Tonks does. Maybe not as interestingly, but still viable.

I take the opposite view. I think with how much crap the studentry put him through, he'd actually have a hard time getting involved with someone he went to school with due to trust issues. He'd always be waiting for them to turn on him the second DP published some bs rumor about him.

IIRC isn't it pretty much just Hermione, Luna, Ginny and the Vixens that never took part in a harassment campaign and he actually spent enough time around to be aware of it?
