Lord Voldemort reclined in his throne, reveling in the sensations that came with having a body. Feeling the robes he wore, the seat beneath him, even the heat from the fireplace -- sinister, not welcoming, of course -- was a joy he could not describe. Coming back to life certainly had it's perks.

It was time to learn what he'd missed during his years as a spirit. Lucius, smug bastard that he was, would be able to tell him. Right on queue, a knock sounded at the door. “Enter.”

The man opened the door confidently, striding to his feet and bowing low. “My Lord.”

Voldemort told to him to rise, striking right at the most important issue. “Lucius, before my... falling, I entrusted a plain book to you for safe keeping. I'd like it back.” The man paled at the question and Voldemort felt his eyes narrow, the beginnings of rage beginning to stir. "Lucius, you had better have that diary.”

“Ah. You see, it is no longer in my possession.” Malfoy winced.

“Then whose possession is it in?” Voldemort hissed.

“It's -- It's, yea, it's fucking gone.”

“What do you mean it's fucking gone?! Where the fuck did it go?” His voice was showed his displeasure clearly and his victim lowered himself even more.

“Well, I gave it to a little girl two years ago. The Weasley daughter.”

Whatever the Dark Lord had been expecting, this was not it. “A little girl?”

“A little girl.”

“Why the fu -- You know what, I don't want to know. Just get it back.”

Another hesitant response. “I can't”. He hastily added on a “My Lord,” when he felt Voldemort's glare.

“Explain.” God damn Malfoys.

“I don't know all the details, but it appears the diary possessed the girl into unleashing a basilisk on the school. Many students were petrified.”

Voldemort leaned forward, finally intrigued. /No deaths? That's interesting./ “And what happened? Why is there not a mini-me walking around murdering people wantonly?”

“I understand that you... mini-you almost succeeded. But Potter showed up.”

Lord Voldemort closed his eyes, mentally preparing himself for the fuckery he was about to hear. “Are you telling me a twelve year old defeated my past self and a basilisk?”

Malfoy seemed relieved he hadn't been cursed yet. Fool. “He had help from Dumbledore's phoenix.” /Of course he did./ “And the sorting hat.” /Wait, what?/

“Lucius, talk sense. Quickly.”

“Well you know Gryffindor's Sword, the legendary weapon that's been lost for ages?”

“Yes, I know of the sword.”

“It fell on Potter's head, out of the hat.”

...

“The sword of Gryffindor fell on Potter's head.” It wasn't a question, just a statement to help him understand the words that came together in such an absurd sequence.

“Correct, my Lord. He stabbed the basilisk through the mouth, getting bitten in the process.”

“Then why is he not dead?” He was back to hissing now.

“The phoenix cried on him, my Lord.” /Of course it did./ Voldemort held up his hand, silencing whatever Malfoy was going to say next.

“Just- just give me a moment,” he said, looking away as he grappled with Potter's existence. The boy did not follow the normal rules of the universe, The fates must be pranking him. It was the only explanation.

There was only one thing for it. Malfoy was going to fucking die.

***** I don't think any of DEs knew about Horcruxes. Why would Voldemort tell them? He's clearly not a trusting type. They could sell him out to the Ministry, bargain with them if they got captured, get captured and interrogated, deceid to blackmail him, any other number of unfavorable (for Voldemort) opinions. It's more likely he just gave DEs those objects for safekeeping and told them that those were extremely valuable and not to fuck up.

******* ‘Rare' doesn't automatically translate to ‘horcrux'. Allowing, he even knew what they were. Horcruxes are not at all a common knowledge in canon.

More than that, Lucius didn't really know what exactly happened. The only people who knew of ‘memory' Tom were Dumbledore, Ginny and Harry (probably Hermione and Ron later on) and none of them would have told Lucius. How it must have looked from Lucius' side: he gives a dark artifact to Ginny in an attempt to discredit Weasleys -- it ends up at Hogwarts -- students start to get petrified -- creepy messages appear on the walls -- all is resolved -- Dumbledore returns him the artifact. In the end, Lucius has no way to find out what exactly transpired, aside that it was somehow caused by the diary.

I also don't think that manifesting physical memories is common to horcruxes. The Trio wore the Locket and it didn't appear to communicate with them or possess them or manifest any ghost-like memories. The most it did was affected their moods. I would say it most likely that the diary was charmed/cursed on top of being a horcrux.

**** Actually there are only three instances in the books where Voldermort is described as actively using the cruciatus on his followers: when Wormtail loses Crouch, the Death Eater (forgot which one... I think Macnair) that disgusts him when he begs for forgiveness during his resurrection and on Dolohov after he loses Harry (technically he is making Draco do it). Two other suggested instances are when he punishes Avery for fucking up and allowing Broderick Bode almost spill the beans on Voldemort's return, and the Malfoys after they lose Harry again.

So as far as canon is concerned, Voldemort is more likely to mentally torment his followers than torture them, unless a major mistake is involved. And as Dumbledore said, the diary was indeed intended as a weapon.

*** Voldemort most likely didn't know that the diary was destroyed until he started to check his Horcruxes in DH. Lucius hardly would have admitted he ‘lost' something his Lord gave him for safekeeping and Voldemort didn't really have any reason to doubt its safety. If Voldemort knew that the diary was destroyed he would have bothered to check on other Horcruxes way earlier and would have probably discovered that the locket was a fake, thus leading him to looking for it/relocating other Horcruxes. Especially seeing how the diary being destroyed at Hogwarts meant that Dumbledore now knew about them.

** "That explains the Basilisk. How did he defeat mini me."

"When the Basilisk bit him one of it's fangs broke off. From what I understand he staggered over to the diary pulled the fang out of his arm and stabbed it; My Lord." He couldn't believe what he was hearing. How the fuck did Potter manage to do this with Basilisk venom flowing through his veins. It should have at least weakened him to the point where he could not do anything if not killed him in a matter of seconds. Something's going on with Potter that he does not understand.

He distinctly remembers his own confrontation with the brat in the graveyard. How the brat had writhed and screamed in his binds as he cruicoed him. How he had writhed on the ground screaming as he crucioed him once the duel began. But he also remembers how the boy had quickly scrambled to his feet. How the hell was the brat able to get back up. He remember him barely being able to stand due to an injury in the tournament. He should not have been able to brush off that much pain. Then the brat had resisted his imperious. No one had done that before. He had put hardened aurors under it to act as his puppet. To do so after being crucioed twice. One of the first things his death eaters had learned about Imerio was that it was a lot more effective if used after Crucio. The freedom from pain that Imperio gave made one likely more likely to follow orders just to keep the pain away. How had that Potter brat done that.

Then there was that strange dome and their wands being locked. No matter how much effort he put in he was not able to keep the beads from his wand and then ghosts had started coming out of his wand. The fact that the boy had managed to evade his 30 death eaters attacks and had even taken down Yaxley one of his strongest death eaters is concerning too. He had put it all off to luck. But luck doesn't make someone able to stand back up after a Crucio or resist an Imperio. Was this the power that the prophecy spoke of that the boy would born with? He doesn't know. He needs to know the full prophecy to understand exactly what is happening with Potter.
