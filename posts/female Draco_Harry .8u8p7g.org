I found many female harry/draco, but most are.... ridiculous pwp... so i tried the other way around! Aaaand... i pretty much only found Serpent Lord... wich i had to drop 10~ chapters in since it was just a rewrite of canon with minor changes.. (if that changes later and its worth it...tell me).

So! Any suggestions? ;)


** With the shear amount of hp fanfiction I'm surprised how rare this is. I don't think I've ever come across a full story with this.

** its changes quite a bit after year 3, but still stays a bad fic. Though, if you find a good fem!draco/Harry, let me know, I'd read that too.

** I remember reading one, I think that it is call 'For the sake of a name' in AFF.net. (At work and that site is blocked).

The premise is that while at a detention from Snape, Draco knocks over (and thusly gets coated in) a bunch of random potions. The effect is to (semi-)permanently change him into a her.

Draco and Harry hook up because he is the only one nice to her (he is aware that Draco is a girl), and they reveal that they were interested in each other when they were both guys, but they were afraid of speaking about it. So they decide they want to be in a relationship.

It is unfinished, but what exists is pretty good.

*** Reading it right now, not going to lie but the Draco transformation did make me a bit uncomfortable. It's mostly because I can't help but still picture it as a slash.

Slash isn't really my cup of tea but the writing is actually pretty good, even if I feel the pairing is rushed in the beginning

**** It is pretty rushed with a lot of the early drama being a little over the top, but it settles down later on.

I do totally understand the slash feelings.
