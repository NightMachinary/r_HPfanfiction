** I forget the name, but there's one where Harry decides to say fuck this and goes to the US, and Dumbledore tracks him down. He and Harry make a deal where if Dumbledore takes down the death eaters , Harry will come back and kill Voldemort and fulfil the prophecy. He does kind of hold up his end, going no holds barred, ambushing Lucius Malfoy and others in their homes and kidnapping them.

I don't think this was "good" Dumbledore though.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

******* I'd have to get a good background for such an arrangement. The trio in "Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water" works because they were isolated and trusted only each other, so the relationship developed between three rather damaged people.

For a Harry/Hermione/Luna relationship... not sure. It would rpobably take a much bigger part of a story than I usually use for romance, unless it's so much of an AU that the characters are changed a lot. Could be a ménage à trois, with Harry unwilling to drop either, but even that would need a big impetus to start.

Canon Hermione definitely won't tolerate sharing a man with another woman, and you have to remove Ron from the picture credibly.

One scenario could be similar to "Stages of Hope" where Weasleys were pretty much killed off, and the three of them were forced to live together in isolation for a long time.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
