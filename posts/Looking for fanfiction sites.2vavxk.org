The three site I know of for fanfiction are

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/]]

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/index.php]]

(On a mobile won't let me copy/paste) and fanfiction.net

Any other suggestions on good sites. I'm new to HP fanfiction so looking for advice on the best places to find some. Thanks in advance for the help.


** Seconding both AO3 and DLP! Good websites. Note that AO3 has a lot of slash and explicit writing, and the strangest tagging system I've encountered yet. Still, the standard of writing is generally higher than other sites. (I'm looking at you, FF.N...) And DLP just don't tolerate bad writers, from what I've seen.

You should also search LiveJournal for various Harry Potter communities. There is a TON of old fic on there! I don't think it's nearly as active these days but there's enough stuff lurking around to keep you occupied for years!

Here's a few sites to get you started--

#+begin_quote
  [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/][Potions and Snitches]]: Harry and Snape genfic (think mentor/master/teacher/guardian/father relationship)

  [[http://thequidditchpitch.org/][The Quidditch Pitch]]: All sorts. Small archive. I like it. There's one or two fandom classics lurking there.

  [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/main.php?list=2][Skyehawke]]: It's not been updated for years, really, but there's 10k+ fics here. Note that a lot are slash and/or explicit ratings.

  FictionAlley's websites - there's [[http://www.riddikulus.org/][Riddikulus]] for humour, [[http://www.schnoogle.com/][Schnoogle]] for novel-length, [[http://www.astronomytower.org/][Astronomy Tower]] for romance, and [[http://www.thedarkarts.org/][The Dark Arts]] for angst galore. It used to be a whole lot easier to navigate but their site had a meltdown a while back and it's never been quite fixed properly. Still a bunch of good fics there if you look! If you also check out the [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/][forums]] you'll see a whole heap of old posts with people searching for fics, or posting fic recs.

Oh! Also, you can try searching for "harry potter rec list". There are a million bajillion out there, and you'll sometimes find links to websites you've not come across before. Of course, sometimes they're dead links, but hey. That's what the wayback machine is for, right?

Er, yeah. That should probably be enough to begin with! There are a lot of smaller archive sites out there, too, but they tend to be quite niche. What sort of fics are you looking for? Is there a specific pairing you'd like? Theme? Do you mind explicit ratings?

*** Thanks that was way more than I expected. I like Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione pairings and Harry centered stories. I'm starting to really like some of the AU stuff. Super Harry and apprentice to someone awesome stuff but sense I'm new, I'm trying to keep my mind open to whatever is out there. Thanks again.

A word of warning, you'll probably find a whole bunch of lists that haven't been updated for 5+ years, and that have a bunch of dead links. Unfortunately, with most of the fandom dead, one of the first things to go were well updated rec lists that aren't tumblr-loved (think Hermione/Snape...Ew).

** I would highly recommend the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/library_list.php][DLP Library]]

I've found it to be the best collection of high-quality fanfiction around. I've been a member since 2008 (though I don't think I've ever posted, just lurked) and have consistently used it for recommendations and just looking at discussion. The WbA portion of it is really great.

I never see it recommended over here and I honestly have no idea why that is, but give it a shot!

*** Worth noting that, due to the increasingly high standards of DLP members, the Library has become almost static, with almost all fic discussion taking place in the "Almost Recommended" threads.

The staff are now taking action to revitalise the library but it's probably going to take some time to take effect, so for the time being looking at the old Almost Recommended threads is advised.

** On the sidebar of this subreddit, there is a link to a post that lists all the archives, forums and sites for fanfiction. It's pretty extensive. Please read it.

**** This sub. Hop on a computer or get a reddit client that let's you look at sidebars (I rec Reddit Sync if you are on Android) and read it. Or ask a mod. Also browse this subreddit in desktop mode. Or just search reddit (I know this works on mobile) 'list of fanfiction archives'

** There's some sites out there that cater to specific romantic ships if that's what you're into. For example, Granger Enchanted caters to Hermione-centric stories.

There also Fictionalley.org Use desktop mode if you're mobile, and the right sidebar has navigation. Navigation isn't visible on mobile.
