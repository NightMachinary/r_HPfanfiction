Looking for a story about hermione and Oliver I read a while back and forgot the name of. Long shot because I don't remember the details but

Started with hermione in her first year year, the girls are all having a girls only sleepover but the boys spy and they overhear her moons confessing she likes Oliver. He tries to save her embarrassment and makes all the guys leave and then he overheard them dare her to kiss him so he goes down to the common room and when she comes down he kisses her to save her from becoming embarrassed.

The story chapters skip big time gaps from there to the point where she's dating krum and Oliver hears about it and is back to watch some of the tournament with his new girlfriend (who he doesn't like) Fred and George are like his wingmen because they know he loves hermione even if he doesn't know yet. Fred and George also don't like Krum cause when they got out of the lake he went off and left Hermione there soaking wet so the twins get her blankets and sweaters to warm up

I don't remember much of it but it was really good and I want to reread it
