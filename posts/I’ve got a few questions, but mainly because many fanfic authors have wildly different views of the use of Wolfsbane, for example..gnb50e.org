I'm currently reading linkffn(With strength of steel wings, by angelastarcat), and it talks about how the wolfsbane needs to be taken over the week before the full moon, and several others have had it being a single dose on the day of, and yet most of the ones I read said that it takes a month to brew.

Why is there such a wide range of times/doses/length of brewing/etc? Is it simply because JKR never specified it in canon, or because the various authors decided to use this as one way to advance the plot or flow of the story?

And I'm also looking for any recommendations for some light reading material (and I love long chapters and a big chapter number, because the BWL's story just cannot be told properly with only 20 chapters), at least when the author doesn't really use it as a crutch for why Harry, or others, just HAVE to go a certain way...


** I think it's probably because in POA when Snape brings Lupin the potion, he specifically mentions he has more and Remus says that he will need to take more "tomorrow". So we know it's not just a one time thing, and iirc, Harry sees Lupin later that evening at dinner (or I might be getting their meetings mixed up), so it's clearly not the day of. It's also clear that Remus is unable to make this potion himself, so making the potion complex and lengthy to make would make sense.

*** In addition, Lupin looks less stupid for forgetting to take his potion if he just forgot the last dose of a long series, than if it's literally "you had /one/ job this /entire/ month".

**** Yeah that's true - especially if he's feeling poorly then gets a big shock, I can imagine the days blurring a little!

** Book 3, chapter 18 says it must be taken for the week preceding the full moon. [[https://pottermore.fandom.com/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion][Pottermore Wiki.]]

*** The direct quote from PoA, as I generally don't trust the wiki:

#+begin_quote
  “The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. ... I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.”
