Maybe after he gets to Hogwarts, so that his base personality is still present. I would want him to still be the hero and willing to die to defeat Voldemort. But I think the in between could be fun.


** Some please post a good story. I survive work by reading good fanfic, for the love of God this is a life or death scenario

** linkffn(the horcrux within by althor42)

Interesting story, I read it a while ago, when it had much less chapters, but I thought it was good.

  AU When Harry is fighting Voldemort for the Philosopher's Stone, he makes the horrible discovery that he is keeping Voldemort alive by hosting a fraction of his soul. What is the rest of Harry's time at Hogwarts like when he knows that he has to die?

  Nearly two and a half years had passed since Kreacher had woken up to find Harry Potter asleep on his kitchen floor, and Grimmauld Place had changed dramatically since then. Sequel to "Innocent".

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.
