*** Runic Animagi is practically a crackfic, with Harry spending the first dozen or so chapters constantly mentioning all the weed, tattoos (magic and otherwise), powerful house-elf enchantments, and Muggle pussy he's getting. Oh yeah, and it is in first person. Practically a workshop on how not to do that, in fact. Lots of spelling and grammar errors, as well as oddly put together viewpoint shifts.

Not a lot of Dumbledore, though. He sort of shows up to apologize and tells Harry how awesome Harry is, I guess.

And again, super powerful Harry, for no reason. Maybe it gets better. I can't make it that far, if so. Readers beware.

Not one of my favorites, if that wasn't clear.

**** Yeah, I agree with you, it's a wish-fulfillment fic that only really works for the author and people who still think weed and swear words are the paragon of coolness.

Object Lessons wasn't much better, to be completely honest. It feels like reading the feelgood-y epilogue of a series of books, after all the action and challenge is over. There's no challenge or goal, just people talking about how happy they are.

*** I would highly recommend this one. It's a great mix of action and comedy.

**** Pacing and tone are a little off. Could be a non-native issue, but a lot of words are subtly misused or are not in agreement. Unpolished. Seriously AU Harry.

As for content: an okay Dumbledore, at least at the start, but the author seems to occasionally lose what the focus of the story actually is. Lots of rather straight-forward powerful Harry. Strange and off-putting sexual imagery and dialog pops up out of nowhere sometimes, which is jarring -- and this is from me, someone who sometimes writes straight-up smut fics. Poor sense of new threats to meet the powerful new character of the writer's Harry Potter.

Overall, wasn't worth my time to finish, but it might just not be my thing.
