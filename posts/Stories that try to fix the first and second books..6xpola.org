  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) does that pretty well. The earlier chapters require a bit of slog to get through but his writing really improves towards the end of first year and a lot of plot holes are plugged (like why Dumbledore never revealed Riddle was a half blood, how Harry found the mirror of Erised or how the diary could pass through Hogwart's protections)

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Ok, to defend JK, here I go.

So first, she tells us Voldemort was in Albania until Quirrell encountered him there on his sabattical. So from there he possessess him not for the stone, but for the chance to get into Higwarts when Harry is there. This is all explained in Voldemorts monologue in front of the mirror of Erised.

From there, I'm sure that Quirrellmort, along with the rest of the staff, was informed that Dumbledore was bringing the stine to Hogwarts.

From there, it wasn't a huge leap for him to realize it was pribably at grungitts and attempt a break in.

Why did it take so long? Because Dumbledore and Snape were watching him 24/7. The only opportunities he got were when they were occupied (troll/albus in london).

Hope that helps

** It's been a while since I read PS, but didn't Voldemort know the stone would be in Hogwarts because he got Hagrid drunk and Hagrid brought it up? And I suppose it takes him so long because he wanted to be prepared for the traps - I think Fluffy injured Quirrel.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.
