Yeah, yeah Ayo, Voldemort, it's time. It's time, Voldemort (aight, Voldemort, begin). Straight out the hot dungeons of rap.

The book drops deep as does my heart. I never run, 'cause to run is the partner of art. Beyond the walls of thoughts, life is defined. I think of Magic when I'm in a London state of mind.

Hope the art got some counterpart. My start don't like no dirty chart. Run up to the smart and get the part.

In a London state of mind.

What more could you ask for? The crazy book? You complain about Ministry. I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the overlook.

I'm rappin' to the head, And I'm gonna move your shed.

Lifeless, strong, sexy, like an angel Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a black archangel.

I can't take the Ministry, can't take the fairy. I woulda tried to hit I guess I got no arbitrary.

I'm rappin' to the shed, And I'm gonna move your head.

Yea, yaz, in a London state of mind.

When I was young my partner had a crook. I waz kicked out without no look. I never thought I'd see that cook. Ain't a soul alive that could take my partner's hook.

A greasy knight is quite the insight.

Thinking of Magic. Yaz, thinking of Magic (Magic).

** It would be interesting to see who can say words quicker-

An actual Rapper or Harry "I can say sectumsempra before you can say o" Potter.

Personally I have to go with Harry.

For anyone wondering I am talking about the bathroom duel against Malfoy in which Malfoy had already uttered 'Cruci' before Harry started saying sectumsempra.

*** There are rappers who have surpassed 20 syllables a second, that's far faster than saying 4 syllables in a second. Even mid-speed ones like Eminem have parts with 11 syllables a second.

**** That is still comparable speed. I don't know how to count syllables so I will assume that sectumsempra has 4 syllables as you said (How did you get that number BTW). Average speaking speed is 5 syllables a second. I assume that o is one syllable (if not, my bad).

So in this case Harry said a 4 syllable word before Malfoy could say 1 syallable. So by the time Malfoy says 5 syllable Harry would have said 20.

And I was not actually serious about Harry being quicker with words than a rapper. I was just poking fun at how ridiculous that scene was. I do want to know how you came to that 4 syllable though.

***** He said a 4-syllable word before the enemy could say one syllable, from a word already begun. It was a presumption of mine, and a lower end at that, so to speak.

As to how I got the number of syllables in Sectumsempra, the same way you count syllables in any word.

It really isn't, though. There are pretty well defined rules for splitting words into consonants. I understand you can't really teach young kids a structured way of doing things, but I figured once you got into an English class that taught poetry or something, you'd learn a less... organic way. Like [[https://www.howmanysyllables.com/divideintosyllables][this]] (which works perfectly fine for “sectumsempra” without using any thing other than the first couple rules. Namely, split between consonants, but not consonants that have the same sound when spoken together (of which the only occurrence is “pr” of “pra”).

** Don't non verbal spells make this defunct? You can almost always think faster than you can say something (or rap) in this case. If non verbal spells work mostly on intent, then speech becomes redundant. Just an idea. Could be completely wrong.
