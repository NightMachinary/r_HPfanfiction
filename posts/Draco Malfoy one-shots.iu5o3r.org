I don't want to self promote, but just for some background info, I have written three one-shots regarding Draco, Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe, Goyle, ect. and the humorous situations they get into in the Slytherin Common Room. I was wondering if anyone had any one-shot ideas that they would like me to write. If so, give me a brief summary below and I'll try to make your Draco centric one-shot come to life!


** I would love to read your oneshots! I feel like the slytherins would get up to the best hijinks (SFW and otherwise). I don't have any good prompts though, sorry!

*** Aw, thanks for the interest! These are just silly little things I wrote for fun, but if you'd like to read them then that would be great. They're titled, "Slytherin Choir Class," "Slytherin Acting Course," and "Slytherin Art Contest."
