Most time travel fics I've read send the entire person .... or personality ... or memories ... into the past

regardless, which it is, the fics typically send a full set of memories with all the knowledge of future events and skills

What if the mechanism for time travel is not so refined ... what if future Harry had to choose one thought ... and one thought only ... to send to his pre-hogwarts self?

*What would that thought be?*

Here are the requirements for the thought:

- it must be short and simple enough that younger Harry can hold it in the forefront of his mind with ease (for writer purposes .. lets say .. 7 words max)
- there is a risk that younger Harry could dismiss it as an errant thought, so the thought must be able to shock him into taking it seriously (It is okay if the thought arrives with a headache accompanying it to give it legitimacy, but more creative options are encouraged)
- the thought must be sent with the goal of averting a calamity in the future (ex: opening of Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). Which calamity (or even canon event) .. is up to you
- you must send the thought a minimum of 1 year into the past. There is no maximum

  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.

*** I think I read partway into that one, but quit when Hermione had absolutely no reaction to Scabbers despite the weird name/word "Scabbers" being included in her message from the future and thus clearly very important and memorable. That immediately broke any suspension of disbelief by being such an obvious contrivance to keep the plot going longer.

** - *Thought:* BUY BITCOIN
- *Arrives on:* Mid 2009
- *Sent on:* Epilogue

Since changing anything in the war would change history and erase his new family, he instead sends something that won't change much of the world except for his wallet.

** To get the ball rolling, i will go first:

- *Thought:* Animagi spy in the dorm (fear emotion)
- *Arrives on:* First day of transfiguration in first year, later in the day
- *Sent on:* Thought sent at the end of 3rd year

Goal is to get Harry running to McGonagall in his first year to ask about her turning into a cat (which he saw earlier that day ... hence why this date is targeted)

Harry would try to get scabbers unmasked in first year by McGonagall

*** Easy win. Peter escaping is the linchpin on which all of canon after book three happens.

Voldemort fucked off to Albania for a decade after almost dying. It took the combined lure of the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts, along with the convenient body of Quirrely to bring him back to Britain. Upon which he spent nine months living on the back of someone else's head under a sweaty turban, drinking cursed blood getting hit with snowballs and eventually burned to death by a child.

Voldemort was probably figuratively shitting himself when he fled back to Albania. Dumbledore knew he was alive, he was so weak he was bested by a child, and the child prophesied to destroy him had a magical protection that prevented him from even touching him, let alone kill him.

The only reason he left Albania the second time was Wormtail, Bertha Jorkins, and Barty. No Wormtail, no one to help him gain the grotesque baby body he lived in. No one to milk Nagini and brew the potion to give him his full body. No one to bring Bertha Jorkins to him with news about the Tournament and an actual loyal and powerful Death Eater he could free.

Without any of that Voldemort would have likely stayed fucked off for who knows how many years. He may have even decided to wait Harry out, chilling as a wraith for a century until his enemy died before convincing someone to help him gain a body and starting over from scratch.

**** That certainly eliminates Voldemort, but not the war.

Remember, many death eaters are still out there, and they are in positions of power. What's more, in HBP, Snape talks about how the death eaters were all hoping Harry would be a standard they can rally around, though were disappointed.

Who's to say they won't find another person to rally around given enough time? This action could very well delay the war

  This is a AU where Harry and Hermione use the timeturner to change one more thing and it makes all the difference. It changes the course of the world to a better turn. A lot of politics and also Fluff.Of course, this is a fan-fiction. I don't own Harry Potter in any kind or way and I don't make money with this story.
