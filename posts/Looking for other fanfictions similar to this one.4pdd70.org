Hello! I just finished reading this fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3719160/2/Deathly-Hallows-Revisited]] (I downloaded the entire book and even printed it) and I'd really like to read something similar to this, maybe even from the same author (I like the Harry/Ginny romance and the way the author used ideas from previous books). It would be very cool if somebody would be able to help me! Thanks in advance!


** Are you looking for rewrite of Book 7? Here are a few candidates:

*The Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(2818538): this fic was almost taken as a leaked copy of the Deathly Hallows. Ginny went on horcrux hunt too.

*What If?*, linkffn(7671626): horcrux hunt with Trio + Ginny.

*Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum*, linkffn(8286141): both Hermione and Ron left Harry in the tent, and things actually turned out for the better?

  Harry has to decide who to trust as he moves closer to fulfilling his destiny. Will he be able to find and destroy all the Horcruxes? And at what price? Will he be able to find the strength within himself? And...can he do it and still get the girl

  When Ron stormed out of the tent, Hermione went after him to stop him and disapparated with him. What will happen following this small change to DH ? What will Harry do without his friends?

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
