** I probably wouldn't change any events. However, I would make the books longer by having more PoV characters and filling in some of the missing moments.

The different PoV characters/scenes would be used to make certain characters more sympathetic and real.

- a PoV from Percy when he walks away from his family, showing us his reasons for doing so and how he feels about it
- Petunia as a child and how she sees her sister being stolen away by Snape and the magical world
- Draco as he receives the dark mark
- Ginny the summer after her first year reflecting on and working to recover from her possession
- Ron's feelings after Harry is chosen in the Triwizard Tournament
- Ron after leaving Harry and Hermione during the Horcrux hunt
- Neville visiting his parents and noticing that the Weasleys and Harry saw him there

And so on and so forth.

I also would have given Charlie more of a role in the story too
