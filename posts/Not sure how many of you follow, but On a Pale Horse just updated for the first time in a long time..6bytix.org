** What are the chances, I just reread it 2 days ago.

Thank you for that post, somehow this fic found itself off of my follow list.

** Not sure why I started reading this since the description sounded awful, but wow. I am only a few chapters in, but I have to say that I did not expect such an entertaining and well written fic. The OP death/Harry character is very hilarious and awesome in how completely overpowered he is. The descriptions and prose describing him are just beautiful and I love how he is oblivious and confused as to why everyone is freaking out around him while he performs impossible magic like it's nothing. Reminds me somewhat of Harrymont in seventh horcrux with his kind of crazy, overpowered and hilarious behaviour. I hope the story tones down on Dumbledore bashing but so far this fic is very fun.

*** I had the exact same thoughts when I first picked it up. The ambiance is fantastic.

As far as the dumbledore bashing goes... just roll with it. This is so AU and bizarre that it's easy to just let go, haha.

**** Hm, just finished it and I feel like this fic went completely downhill from when voldemort was defeated. I just don't understand the need to bash characters to the point that all sense of their characterization is gone and the plot only moves forward because they are so horrible. It's like a crack fic whos only purpose is to put down characters for made up reasons in the most humiliating horrible ways you can think of. Its too bad since the beginning was actually very funny and well written.

***** It's /totally/ a crackfic. I'm gonna reread later in the week, but from what I remember, it read more like a dark comedy. At least that's how I rationalized it.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.
