Okay so yes, I did get a new idea for a story and I have started to write a bit of scenes and pieces into a notepad file in my IDEAS folder! And I have a great character personality concept in mind! :) But I need to make a new prophecy for it so it fits, like thematically and stuff, but I can't come up with anything! :(

Well I did come up with two lines for it, but I can't figure out what to make the rest!

The story's idea without spoilers or details, is that my female Harry, Violet Potter, is sent back in time every time she dies so she gets to have a reset/do over of things a lot. Sort of the main reasoning behind the concept of the story is that it lets me make a story where totally nobody gets any plot armor! Not even main characters! It will be so fun to write.

The lines I've already come up with for the prophecy are this:

#+begin_quote
  /Whether by heart or soul, she takes with her./

  /When times take a toll, the Dark Lord will skirr./
#+end_quote

It's a huge spoiler so I'm not sure I should explain it! But anyway I don't know if these should be the FIRST lines, or the LAST, or in the middle? But I am thinking I want the whole prophecy to actually rhyme like these do. I found SKIRR, which means to move rapidly, from googling rhyming words with "her", so that helps me out a bit...but I still don't know what to make the rest of the actual CONTENTS of the whole prophecy be!

Can my friends Autumn and Taure and Achille and stuff please help me make a prophecy? :)


** Here's a couple lines for you:

She learns from her past mistakes, No evil is left in her wake

*** :o Zepwnzer! Thank you, that's a very good line! :)

I modified it a little to be more prophecyish!

#+begin_quote
  She learns from mistakes, lest evil be left in wake.

** You do know that going back in time everytime she dies is actually a form of plot armor?

*** I meant for everyone ELSE! :) But it also still isn't for her, because it means she can die a crapload of times over stuff anybody should have died over in a normal story, but that they always luck out of it like canon Harry always does somehow. So yes it's not plot armor in that sense, which is what I mean. :)

**** Except her deaths won't matter, no matter how she dies. It's like dying when playing a video game, sure it's sort of frustrating that your character just took a fatal blow, but, you can just load a previous save so that's fine. When a character can't stay dead, and death just means starting at the beginning of a story, it leads to me wondering why the character even bothers.

Friendship doesn't leave a lasting impact because all it takes is dying and your friends dont remember you anymore, which would be hurtful and depressing for your mc. Learning things just to know them won't help, because there are limits to what knowledge is available to the young. How will this girl who realizes that her actions have consequences but only until she dies, and then nothing she has done has any lasting consequences to anyone but herself actually act?

That's exactly it! I'm writing the story around those things, I wrote her personality BECAUSE OF these things! The story does ask these questions and it DOES answer them! :) I thought of all those things too, and they're the main FOCUS of it all!

** Skirr is an obscure word and will feel to the readers like you're reaching. Unless the whirring sound is an integral part of plot, I'd recommend finding something else.

Without knowing your intentions, it's hard to know what to suggest for words, but if you're still writing, you have time. Dot down the main things you want it to say, work it for a day or three, and revisit as you need to see if it fits the tone of your emerging story.

Don't make the prophecy overly long, as you want readers to remember it.

*** I just used skirr because it rhymes with the other word and it means what I need it to mean. :) But I can find another word that rhymes too to replace it with I guess.
