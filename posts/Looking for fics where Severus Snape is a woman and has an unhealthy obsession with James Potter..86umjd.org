*** If they grow up the same way as in canon and Severina (?) and Lily start out as best childhood friends, I think she would quietly resent Lily and harbor a great deal of jealousy toward her for obtaining James's affection. I think eventually the jealousy would cause her to say something she regrets ("a mudblood like you doesn't deserve a pureblood like Potter!"), thus ending the friendship, just like in canon.
