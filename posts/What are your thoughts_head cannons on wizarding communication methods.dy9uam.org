In the books we're given Floo, owls, enchanted mirrors, Patronuses, enchanted galleons and a cryptic reference to efficient ways the order has to communicate with one another.

Still, its hard to imagine a world that has magic but communication isn't even as easy as calling or texting someone. So for a fic I'm writing, I've been thinking of ways wizards might use to communicate.

I think enchanted notes and notebooks are used a lot, especially in school. But my mind is refusing to get more creative than that.

I'm curious as to what head canons/ ideas everyone here has about this.


** The two way mirror Sirius had seems like it could be used like a video phone. If they only work in pairs and not in arbitrarily large networks it'd explain why they aren't the go to choice for communication, and it gives a relatively simple improvement your main character can invent if you want a story about a magical tech entrepreneur.

**** Obviously the technology is being kept down by Big Floo, and only tiny, indie setups lacking the resources for advertising and large-scale manufacturing can get past their obstructive blockade on the industry.

Let's see a /real/ Indy!Harry fic, where he must take down the corporate establishment to allow weird gadgets to flourish.

** Given the speed and ease of wizard travel, why bother? If an owl is too slow just pop over and talk to them then pop home. Unless the person is at Hogwarts or the Ministry it will take two seconds. If they are at Hogwarts or the Ministry, that's what floo calling is for.

*** I imagine owl mail is only for people you are not close too

sort of like introduction and business stuff but when your older you just floo or apparate in.

****** Do you think there are mechanisms to let people into your private floo? Like the option of rejecting a call, basically.

*** My only reservation with those two options is that they're so public and inconvenient at times.

What I mean by that is if you just want to ask your friend a quick question about what brand of salamander eyes or whatever they prefer, flooing over or apparating to them seems like a lot of effort.

And also physically talking to someone is so much less discreet than say, a text.

Of course, these are the arguments of my 21st century, takes-smartphones-for-granted mind so make of that what you will.

** Enchanted diaries could exist as personal messaging devices. Ministry memos could be adapted. I know many fics like the idea that anything could be enchanted to fly. Magical animals could work too. Any mythical animal could work as transport, just ensure to add realistic and believable origins. In some fics Gringotts has special 'letter boxes' for Harry when he innevitably discovers that Dumbles is diverting his mail.

Anything you do add to the wizarding world, always, and i mean always, create a well thought up origin story for said object. Otherwise the trolls of fanfiction will tear you to shreds. Good luck!

** It's not just Purebloods, people in general overlook House Elves. Have them deliver the note or message, there's no wards that can stop them. And one form of communication they use at the Ministry of Magic is enchanted paper airplanes that fly themselves to the target.

Or if you want an idea that doesn't appear in canon: write a note then turn it into a portkey to appear next to the person you want it delivered to. Just make sure you let go of it before you send it!

** Floo is widely agreed as pretty convenient. What about a pocket floo. Zippos have been around for a while, so why not have little zippo like objects that have small amounts of floo powder, that allow cross compatability face to face communication? Tl;dr holo-zippos that you can use to talk to other zippos or to floos.

*** It's funny you say that, cause I was thinking about pocket sized fireplaces the other day for Face Time-esque communication.

But zippos is a neat idea! And a lot less awkward than carrying a tiny brick frame around.

** The protean charm is hard to cast but not impossible for a bright 16 year old and seems permanent. Little proteaned objects could be sold in stores in various shapes and sizes. I have linked balls of wax in my wip that you can mash into various shapes and trace letters on with your fingers.

I've also seen basically communicator wristwatches where you turn a clock hand to point at someone's face to talk to that watch.
