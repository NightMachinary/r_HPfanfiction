I have a rather odd taste in characters, and the one I'm craving the most right now is Regulus. So, do you all know of anything that involves Regulus either somehow living through the cave, being resurrected, or involving his afterlife. Generally, I'm at an age now where I realize that he died /far/ too young in the books, and I want fics that remedy it somehow.

Here's the challenge to this. I think I've already read everything that involves Regulus as a main character. So, please, which fics involve Regulus substantially, but don't necessarily have him as a main character? For instance, through random chance I found one that is listed as a Severus/Lily, but has I think Sirius and company swooping in and saving him last minute (sorry, I forgot to favorite it, so I don't remember its name). You can recommend something with him as a main character, though it'll probably be more for the benefit of anybody who comes across this thread in a search.

/EDIT:/ Here's what I wrote in a comment below. I think I might keep this updated when I find a good Regulus story, considering that Archive of Our Own ate up my favorites list (damned beta), and I can't find the LiveJournal fics I've liked.

Here you go:

[[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewseries.php?seriesid=21][7 Spells: Heroine, Consternation]], I'm not listing the rest.

This was the first one I read, and it's Regulus/Hermione. It involves time travel. It's what got me into Regulus as a character.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3533833/1/The-Soul-Crossing][The Soul Crossing]]

Hermione falls through the veil during a failed mission and finds herself face-to-face with Regulus. Takes place in 1999. It's been awhile since I read this, but I remember staying up late to read it, so it couldn't have been bad.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7306800/1/][The Life You Lose]]

From ff.net: Regulus survives the cave, and, after realizing suicide is not as attractive an option as he had previously considered it, attempts to finish what he started and destroy the locket.

This one has a WIP sequel.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8739316/1/The-Right-Path][The Right Path]]

This one actually ships Regulus/Hermione. Essentially Hermione is thrown back in time, meets Regulus, and she uses her knowledge of the future to everyone's benefit. I don't remember too much about it, but it has a bunch of chapters, and I'm following it, so I can't think it was too bad.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3897199/1/Adventures-In-Babysitting][Adventures in Babysitting]]

From ff.net: Harry and Hermione have a simple task: babysit Teddy while Andromeda is away. How much trouble can a toddler get into anyway? Hermione/Regulus

Funny! Regulus isn't the only one resurrected in this, and it was an entertaining read. There are a ton of Hermione/Regulus fics out there, by the way, so it's not just that I rather like the pairing.

[[http://kris-fic.livejournal.com/46149.html][The Death of Him]]

Author summary: She's made questionable decisions before; they've just never backfired on her this badly.

Regulus is resurrected in this. It's Regulus/Hermione (surprise, surprise).

Also go to [[http://elaboratefic.livejournal.com/][Elaborate Fic]]. ATC is an excellent fic, but you have to friend the LiveJournal account to read it. I have to say, it's an excellent read, and characterizes all of the Marauder-era people perfectly. It also has a bunch of side stories. I'm technically not supposed to talk about it because the author +is silly+ wants to keep it a secret. Honestly, this is the best of the bunch, and is well worth seeking out. 62 chapters so far, and it hasn't been updated since August because the author is currently migrating all of his/her fics to the LiveJournal from fanfiction.net.

There are also a few that I liked, but can't recommend at the moment for various reasons:

There's /For You, Brother/, where Sirius and Regulus switch places, and Regulus winds up doing what he thought Sirius would want and steals Harry when the time comes. It looks like it's going to be a bit of Dumbledore bashing, though considering it's written from Regulus' perspective, that's probably to be expected. It's too early to say whether this is good or not.

/Two Brothers/, where Regulus goes to Sirius for help. It has the most believable way that Regulus avoids detection from Voldemort, and it's rather entertaining thinking of Regulus somehow getting along with Muggles for several years (though considering how he had no real friends during that time, it was more of a truce than anything else). However, while the story is fun, the writer is not a native English speaker, and has been working with a few people to beta it before he/she updates again. It's not that the writing is bad, it's that you'll come across something that obviously isn't right, like the entirely wrong word in some locations, some grammatical errors, and at one point uses quotes entirely inaccurately. Once it's properly beta'd, I'd recommend it.

/It's Love/. From ff.net: "Hermione Granger had her life pretty much in control, until a young man showed up on her doorstep nearly frozen and disoriented on a February night. No prophecy could have prepared her for what would come out of opening that door." I actually had stopped reading this one because I found the relationship to be building far too quickly, but it starts off great, and if you love Hermione/Regulus (see what I mean?) then you'll adore this.

I've made this /way/ longer than I meant to, but that pretty much covers all I can recommend. I follow some more, but they're guilty pleasures more than anything. For instance, there's a Teddy/Regulus that I adore that has good characterization, but they pretty much fall into the relationship right away, so it's not really believable.

/EDIT:/ I literally just finished reading what's available in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]]. It sounds like an odd concept, but get past the first couple of chapters and it is /wonderful/. It's a WIP, but I'm loving it. Essentially, it's about Harry wishing upon the dog star to change his life, which affects what happened to Regulus. It involves divine intervention, though, if that's not your thing, but it is easy to look past that. The action writing is wonderful, the chapters are long, and it updates regularly. The author has a good track record of finishing stories as well. /Edit:/ Okay, there are some Americanisms. If I can spot them, then they must be pretty bad. I still greatly enjoyed it, but be warned about it. Plus, I've spotted another silly plotline, though I'm sure that the author knows what they're doing with it, considering how well they handled the potential silliness of the previous ones.


** I'm sorry I don't have anything to suggest for you, but could you recommend a few of your favourites that revolve around him? Seeing this has made me quite keen on the thought of reading Regulus-centric fics, but I don't want to have to trawl through the rubbish looking for good ones.

*** *EDIT 3:* Snip. Read the self post if you want my list. I don't need two of these lists floating around.

** He turns up although quite late (in the 5th book) in Lightning on the waves version where Harry is the slytherin twin brother of Connor-the-boy-who-lived Potter. I just finished this version which is quite good and interesting even though with some extraneous point of view moments which is why it's longer than the original series.

*** Great suggestion. I've already read it, though. I hadn't realized he was in it, so it was a great surprise when I came across him. Plus, the way he lives makes sense, at least within the Harry Potter world.
