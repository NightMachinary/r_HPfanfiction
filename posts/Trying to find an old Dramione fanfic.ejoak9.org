Hi All! I'm trying to find this old fanfic, but I can't remember what it's called! I know that it was DracoxHermione, and it's been years since it was posted. It's a parenting class story where something goes wrong, and Draco and Hermione wake up in an alternate reality/future where they're married with kids. I know for sure it's not “Playing House with Malfoy”. This story is definitely complete, too!

(I also vaguely remember they had a kid that started with an A, like Adrianna or Arianna, and that another part of the plot was that there were exchange students at Hogwarts, and they weren't cannon characters/I think the author made them up)


** I want to read this and I'm very sad that no one knows of the name! I hope you find it!!
