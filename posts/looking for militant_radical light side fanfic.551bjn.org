So recently I've been getting more annoyed with how all of the good guys (except saint mad-eye) just go with dumbledore's weird pacifism:

I mean one side are actual wizard nazi psychopaths who murder, torture, pillage and rape their enemies and the general population to their hearts desire under the watchful eyes of a corrupt and incompetent ministry; while the wizarding population of Britain buries their head in the sand or has secret blood purist sympathies.

On the other side everyone's favourite spell is expelliarmus or the tickling jinx, because killing makes you a baddie and even in times of war you shouldn't stoop to their level....

"okay maybe we can make an exception for magical Hitler, but magical goebles, mengele and himmler should totally be rehabilitated! Let's just enable them to retain or regain their positions in the upper echelons of society, so they can spread they're ideology and prepare for a second try. Actually,while we're at it, why don't we take all their kids and isolate them in one house under the supervision of an ex magical nazi, whose main job is pretending to still be a magical Nazi by rewarding school children for their murderous racism and punishing other children for having lost their families to the magical Nazis!" -dumbledore

TLDR: looking for story where the main character takes a hard line and doesn't take shit from death eater children, death eater teachers or any magical biggots. If at all possible without immediately being tempted by fear, anger and hate to join the dark side like some emo jedi.


** First of all, a lot of that attitude is fanon: yes, Dumbledore wanted to redeem Draco, and even risked innocents to do so (and I think he had good reasons for doing so, but I don't want to get into that), but most of the Order was perfectly fine with deadly magic. Remus Lupin argued for Stunning Imperiused Stan Shunpike off his broom, even though a fall from that height could be fatal. (Harry disagreed, which is ironic, given how many fics have Independent!Gray!Harry lecturing the Order on being more ruthless.) Molly Weasley used a deadly spell against Bellatrix. Hufflepuffs dropped mandrakes on the enemy during the Battle of Hogwarts.

I think that it would be more accurate to say that the Order was saving its strength for a final confrontation once Harry did whatever it was that Dumbledore had assigned him to do and called them up. They were too few to sustain a war of attrition.

As for the actual request, linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) is the best fic that does that that I know of: radicalized Muggleborns, led by Hermione, engage in guerrilla warfare against Death Eaters and their sympathizers.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

**** They were a bit of both, I think, and, also, there's that most of the Order were well-adjusted civilians, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killology][humans have a general aversion to killing, even in battle, and especially in cold blood, to the point where a high fraction of soldiers in the first two World Wars essentially shot to miss, though the research in question is controvercial]]. This would go double for wizards, because whereas a gun fires equally well regardless of how the shooter feels, nastier spells require the caster to really mean it. This would put the Order at a disadvantage against Death Eaters, who would probably be more antisocial in general and better at dehumanizing their enemy in particular. (Although, the masks might have actually made them easier to curse to kill.)

***** Also, in the wizard battles we saw, distance was so close, they had an easier time to kill since they knew that they were about to die if they didn't take the enemy out. It might be different in a battle over 400+ meters, but if your enemy is right in your face and trying to kill you, humans generally fight back.

That also makes killing more traumatic.

If you drop bombs out of an altitude of 10000 meters and kill tons of people, you are far less likely to get traumatized than say killing one person at point blank range.

** There was one oneshot, can't remember the name, but the 'Light' side won the first war. The AU/Militant/Radical element was then shown during the Hogwart's sorting- If you were in Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Gryffindor, you were fine, do whatever you please. If you were sorted into Slytherin, however, you (an 11 year-old, mind you) were immediately thrown in prison. One of the only times I've ever felt bad for Draco.

** *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), is probably the ultimate fic about militant/radical 'light side'. The trigger was the old establishment trying for a tyrannical marriage law after Voldemort's defeat. Hermione and Harry countered by staging a revolution, taking over the government, and executing every Voldemort and marriage law supporter. Of course, foreign pureblood regimes wouldn't let this go easily.
