I would like to request any and all fanfics where harry has a good relationship with a snake. It can be where he has a pet snake, it can be where Voldemort turns into a snake (me referencing linkffn(A Snake Named Voldemort) ), it can be someone else's pet snake, it can be Nagini, I would actually love if it's the basilisk.

Can be drarry, tomarry, hinny, harmione, lunarry, I don't care, just no shipping snape with shippable characters.

Gimme dem snek bois

** Meet lovely little Sals the snek in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]] ETA: I'm not sure exactly to whom you're referring to when you say "shippable characters" but Snape does eventually date someone who is his age

*** Thank you for the fic! I just meant like, Snarry, Lupin/Snape, etc. Basically shipping Snape with more popular characters, who, according to my side of the fandom, would be much more likable, and much more attractive. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What can I say, I've never liked snape.

Edit: I've just read the tags on the story. I have no qualms with Snape having a heart and being a good person eventually, especially in regard to his relationship with Draco, I just don't like thinking about his possible romantic relationships.

**** Totally understand. If it helps, I'm pretty sure the relationship starts in the sequel's sequel, so it's a ways off! And I think the most explicit scene is Snape and the woman both appearing on the Marauders Map together, so you won't need to think too much about Snape's sex life ^{^}

I think this author does a decent job of showing Snape being a dick to Harry until the two are forced to actually interact with each other instead of just reacting based on their prejudices and preconceptions. They don't really rush the transition from bigoted asshole to healthy and kind in either Draco or Snape's case. I hope you enjoy it!

*** I would like to thank you for this wonderful fic. These 96 chapters have been an absolute ride, it's been amazing. I'm so grateful for whatever series of events led to you posting this and me actually reading it. It's been a journey and it's been wonderful.

I can't say I'll ever appreciate snape in cannon, but this fic has been so much better than cannon could ever be. It shows Snape as an actual decent human being, and the changes to his very character happen so smoothly and make so much sense. I'm so happy that Harry and Draco have the imperfect but loving family and father they deserve.

And I haven't even gotten to the sequel.

Thanks.

**** I'm so glad you like it! This was one of my first fics in the fandom and I've been following it for... I think 10 years? I will say, the first one is the best, but I definitely recommend continuing.

I absolutely agree that it made me feel a little softer towards canon Snape. The fic doesn't change his personality to someone sweet and cuddly, but it allows him more space to grow than in the books.

Happy reading!

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
