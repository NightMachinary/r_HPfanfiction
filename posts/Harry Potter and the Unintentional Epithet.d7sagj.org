/Or, a cautionary tale for writers who address characters by descriptions instead of their given names./

.

The end of the summer holidays came too quickly for Harry's liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at The Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up in Privet Drive.

On their last evening, Mrs Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner which included all of Harry's favourite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.

But before Mrs. Weasley could herd them upstairs, Harry stood up and said, "I want to thank you for your kindness to me. If it wasn't for a certain red-headed Gryffindor, I'd be stuck behind bars at Privet Drive the whole summer."

"He's talking about me, isn't he," said a red-headed Gryffindor, turning to his brother.

"No, that's clearly me, can't you tell?" said the aforementioned red-headed brother, pointing to his hair, which was red. /"I/ drove the car."

"I was the one who came up with the idea!" said another red-headed Gryffindor, his cheeks bulging with the delicious treacle pudding prepared by his red-headed Gryffindor mother.

"Do my ears mistake me, or has someone just spoken of a 'red-headed Gryffindor'?" said a voice by the kitchen window, sliding up the sash and popping his head in. It was a balding, skeletal man with sunken cheeks and stringy white hair, dressed in dirty robes in a color best described as /probably grey/. He nodded in the direction of a female red-headed Gryffindor. /"Guten Abend, holdes Frau./ Is that pudding? I haven't had a proper homemade English pudding since 1899!"

"Who the ruddy hell is that?" exclaimed a red-headed Gryffindor.

"I will not have that language at my table!" scolded his red-headed mother.

"This is superb cooking," said the white-haired wizard, helping himself to a spoonful of pudding. "I shall never again underestimate the talents of a red-headed Gryffindor."

A knock on the front door interrupted their meal. A red-headed Gryffindor opened the door, allowing a greasy-haired Slytherin to step into the Burrow.

"I regret this intrusion to your... house, but I believe I heard mention of a certain red-headed Gryffindor?"

"Ugh," groaned the emerald-orbed ravenette. "Where did all these people come from? Why are they here?"

"Oh, you must have used an epithet," said the white-haired wizard, shaking his head in sorrow. "The last time someone used an epithet unwisely, it sent a Dark Lord on a murder spree. /'Those who have thrice defied him'/? What did they do, jump the queue at Gringotts?"

I dislike the overuse of epithets when characters have perfectly serviceable names you can use. Some people think overusing characters' names or pronouns like "his" or "he" is bad, but epithets are /worse/, especially if they're wrongly used, eg. "blonde" for male characters, when the French spelling specifically refers to female subjects. And the worst of the worst when it's just... wrong, eg. "raven" used to refer to either a Ravenclaw student or a person with black hair. Please, no. Don't do this.

Sorry, but this is the hill I'm going to die on.


** This kind of thing does have a name. Lavender Unicorn Syndrome. It comes from the MLP fandom where it is all too convenient to use color and race (pegasis, earth(normal), unicorn) to describe the characters in a scene.

#+begin_quote
  Lavender Unicorn Syndrome occurs when, instead of using a characters name or a pronoun, you repeatedly use other descriptors for them, such as "the baker," "the ninja," "the dragon."

  Common in FanFiction, the term spawned from the Friendship is Magic /fic/ board where writers would refer to Twilight Sparkle as "lavender unicorn" rather than using her name to describe when she was doing something.

  #+begin_quote
    "As Twilight Sparkle walked into the room, the lavender unicorn lifted the book from her shelf with a wave of her horn."
  #+end_quote

  That's Lavender Unicorn syndrome right there. We have pronouns for a reason, people.

** Jfc, Naruto is rife with this shit. Nothing worse than seeing an otherwise good fic ruined by constant hair-color epithets. Brunette, pinkette, blunette(?), rosette - we get it, anime characters have weird hair colors, but please don't use them as their freaking identities.

**** Pinkette, bluenette, and ravenette are insta-drops. I don't know why people do this, and have no clue why they think it's appealing. It's very disturbing to see it slide into the HP fandom, just like the a/b/o stuff from the Teen Wolf fandom.

** In the slash writing world, epithets are as common as knuts because authors try to avoid the ambiguous pronouns. Compare the gay version to the straight version of a sexytime scene between two partners: "She took off his shirt" to "He took off his shirt". The hetero pairing makes it obvious who's doing what actions, but with the slash pairing it's unclear.

#+begin_quote
  He took off his shirt.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off his shirt.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off Draco's shirt.
#+end_quote

Authors think that it's clunky and slows the flow of a sentence to refer to someone's name every time they reference the character. Because they can't use pronouns (he/him/his) without it becoming ambiguous who's doing what action, they instead refer to hair color, eye color, Hogwarts house, or broomstick preference.

#+begin_quote
  The green-orbed Firebolt-owner took off the blonde Nimbus 2001-owner's shirt.
#+end_quote

Now we're cooking!

In all seriousness, I have seen authors go well, well out of their way to avoid using people's names and pronouns, to the point that the writing becomes unreadable. You know they have come to this point when characters are referred to in relative, as opposed to /exact/ terms. "The greasy-haired potion master said" versus "The seductive taller wizard said".

Yes, there are reasonable times when you can use an epithet. But within reason, please.

*** I recall this ambiguity being discussed once in a Swedish lesson in elementary school. We have a pronoun that English lacks which means "his/her own" ("hans" = his, "hennes" = her, "sin" = his/her own). This fixes some of the issues. Not saying Swedish is superior -- but it does have an advantage in this case.
