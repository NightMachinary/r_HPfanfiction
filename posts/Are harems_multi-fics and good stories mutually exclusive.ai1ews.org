If you look at the popular harem stories around, you will quickly notice that most of them suck. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the women basically say the same shit all the time and the MC is treated as THE MAN for simply having said harem. The issues which would result from such a type of relationship are rarely addressed, much less convincingly resolved. Mostly it ends with a deluge of children to "keep the houses separated", a big orgy or similar drivel.

I feel like you could piece together a decent harem fic if you took elements out of several existing stories and combined them, but I have yet to see a harem story which does not have a glaring issue if they pretend to be more than porn with a smudge of plot (like "It could only happen to Harry").

Tl;dr: Is it possible to write a decent story where the MC has several partners and if so, how?


** here's a comment I found that might apply:

"The romantic arc was obviously written by somebody who has never been in love, but who has heard lots of nice things about it, and maybe read a saucy book once."

** It is possible, though requires more skill than most fanfiction authors have.

If you take elements from Imperial Chinese harem systems and adjust as necessary for the social mobility (inside the harem) that you want and the lack of actual Imperial titles, you can have any number of individuals jockey for positions of prestige in the harem. Lots of internal strife that may or may not be hidden from the focal point, and even to the public at large. Where securing an invitation to a party or as a speaker at some conference or whatever before the other spouses can is all a ploy to help them be considered the primary spouse

Alternatively, the harem itself can be the driving force for the conflict. Like, if you have a harem with at least one pureblood, one halfblood, and one Muggleborn (especially if the Muggleborn is the focal point of the harem), that's going to send the traditionalists into a hissyfit. Perhaps enough to make them take rash actions to take the harem apart by force of politics and law, discredit all of them socially, or hire extralegal problem-solvers (read, assassins).

A third problem is audience: people who look for harems don't tend to appreciate the plot that gets in the way of sexy times, and people who look for plot don't tend to look for harems.

I wouldn't say that four characters are too much to develop them sufficiently, especially if you take four somewhat established characters where you only have to show how they would adapt to the harem situation (say Harry, Hermione, Ginny and a wildcard like Tonks or Lavender).

I mean, from a narrative point there shouldn't be too much of a difference between establishing four characters in a tightly knit group and four characters who all are in relationships with each other. It's twelve interpersonal relationships either way. It certainly would be challenging, but certainly doable if you are willing to commit to a longer project (200k min).

5 would be worse and 6 near impossible (just look at how much canon interactions we have between Neville and Luna or Ginny and him), but 4 should be in the realm of the possible.

** There are exactly two fics that I can honestly say I read through till the end and actually enjoyed that were multi. Here goes:

linkffn(13059856) - has a good start, but is currently not updating and stops right before the multi can visibly happen, but up till that point, the people actually involved in the multi are reasonably fallible and human. No OP mega-masculine power wank. Triwizard AU fic.

linkffn(12501270) - is a four way soul bond fic. okay, I lied, I haven't read the last 2 chapters or so, but up till that point, not a lot of smut (none at all) was going on, and the fic focused on developing the relationships between all four people in a pace that was comfortable for the people involved.

In case you are looking for well written straight up harem fics, I can't help you there :/

** While it's possible, of course, to write a good polyamory story, harem fics are a distinct trope/genre which is 100% unrealistic male fantasy that requires total character assassination and complete disregard of common sense. The difference is that in a poly fic all the participants in the relationship are treated as equals as the writer explores their relations with each other, while in a harem fic, there is the protagonist, THE MAN, and all the women he has as a prize. C'mon, does anybody really thinks that canon Hermione, for example, would stand for this shit?

It's also ironic that while marriage law trope is bashed to oblivion (and rightfully so), all the "marriage contracts" get a pass, despite often meaning basically the same thing for the participants. Probably because it's Harry the girl has to marry, so she'll be in love with him by Sunday anyway and completely OK with him having other wives, like she is from a country with Sharia law and not Britain.

I don't say that it's wrong to write this type of fic, but it's pure wish fulfillment that has little to do with good writing.

*** You can have a harem without turning Harry into über-chad. Say after the war there is some residual spell damage and Harry has to do some obscure ritual which binds three women to him or die. The end result is the same, but you lack the harem dynamics ("all women please the sultan"). Harry doesn't want it, Hermione not so much, but prefers it over Harry dying and uses emotional blackmail to make him agree because she doesn't want to bury a friend.

You could make it into a huge hurt/comfort arc with Hermione (whose crush died in the battle), Lavender (who is shunned as a werewolf) and Tonks (whose husband ran away after knocking her up and got himself killed). You don't even have to make the sexual part the central element and still end up with Harry married to three girls.

Obviously it would still be a little wish fulfilment, but honestly, we are discussing a world of magic. That has some wish-fulfilment by default, even before taking the triumph of good over evil for granted.

I'm not saying that she would be very happy, but it is a sacrifice she would be willing to make in canon, especially if you killed off Ron at some point. And while not into having Lavender riding her face, I can easily see a postwar reconciliation of the two which turns into a friendship, especially if the magical society decides to shit on Lavender for being a werewolf.

I also did not mention that there would be any lesbian shenanigans (although who knows what Harry and Tonks can get up to with some Polyjuice)

I agree. Porn should be porn and often those justifications ruin the story because they are too complicated/forced. But we are not talking about some "Harry bangs all girls" smut. The example I gave might not even result in regular sex after the ritual is done (or outside of it if it is an ongoing effort).

*** You can go for subtler changes, like children accidentally forging magical marriage bonds akin to unbreakable ones by accident (and magical children being taught not to do so). Say, Harry, Hermione and the Patil twins end up in the same kindergarten/elementary school and they "play" wedding. They exchange the vows and forget about it until a decade later when someone checks the Ministry paperwork in the aftermath of the war and finds three magical marriages for one Harry Potter.

One of the biggest issues I see with harems is that quite often, they are "fuck or die", which is not a good base for a relationship. So the whole marriage law spiel is a no. Similarly, I don't see Harry caring that some magical family would die out if he doesn't take a second/third/fourth wife.

#+end_quote

What is the alternative, really? Would a story about a wimp who gets a gaggle of girls be a better story? I've found this narrative of anti-Harry rhetoric over the last year very frustrating. I'm not opposed to reading stories where others are heroic, but maybe it's just me, but I like stories where Harry is a bit of a badass. And maybe because he's a badass, he attracts a few girls who want to do him. Also, on a similar note, when have we decided that there can only be one badass per story? A lot of newer stories have Hermione be all awesome and shite, but Harry is diminished in some way (Escape by Singularoddities, I'm looking at you). Why can't they both be awesome? I want to read /that/ story. (*sorry for the rant, it wasn't really pointed at you, your statement just got me thinking*).

I agree that a lot of Harem fics are contrived. They have to fabricate rampant bisexuality amongst the women simply to make it semi-believable. I'm not saying this can't be an enjoyable read, but it isn't realistic. There aren't /that/ many bisexual women out there, so the chances of all the women in Harry's life also liking women just seems unlikely.

But then, are harems realistic? The only real ones are in situations where the women aren't usually there of their own free will. +Or Mormons.+ So there's a reason why harems in fiction have to reach beyond realism in order to make it work.

I enjoyed Rune Stone Path (someone linked it elsewhere so I won't), but again, despite it being very well written, the author had to make all the women love each other too. There's nothing wrong with that, but it makes the situation more and more unlikely. I also enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble), as that was one fic where they didn't have to force the girls together to get them with Harry. Instead, they're all sisters. Granted, that's contrived on a whole other level as they had to shake some magic in order to get Hermione into the bond when it should have just been the Delacours.

In the end, the answer to your question is: it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for uber-realism and believability, then no. If you can look past the things that authors tend to do in order to make harems happen, then yes. There are a lot of harem fics out there that I've enjoyed, but I don't point to them and say "that's realistic."

And he can have a lot of casual sex with these girls, it's totally believable. But actual relationships and marriage to multiple women? No woman would ever agree to that.

Actually, now I kind of want to see a realistic fic where various female characters end up in a harem due to forced bonding or marriage contracts or whatnot. Hermione researching the ways to get out day and night, and then taking up the cause of outlawing harems once and for all. Daphne taking a page from Mrs. Zabini's book.

You can have him a badass when tearing through the Death Eater ranks but needy for attention because he was deprived of love for most of his life.

You can make him inexperienced because if, for some reason, he ended up with Fleur, Tonks and Gwenog Jones, he is a 17-year-old virgin and the others are guaranteed to have some experiences when it comes to sex, relationships and life in general.

You can have him wary of the weight of the world and needing someone who can take the burden off him for a few hours. There is a saying that behind every great man there is a great woman, and while that is overgeneralised, you can certainly apply that to Harry.

And it would be more believable than OPHarry bitchlapping foes left and right before pounding his harem all night long.

#+begin_quote
  Why can't they both be awesome?
#+end_quote

As someone who gets that kind of criticism in one of my stories, often it is not very believable for Harry to be awesome as soon as the story starts. I mean, unless you go with post-war, he has no combat training, no proper DADA education and he is struggling with silent casting. If you pair him with someone like Tonks, who went through years of Auror training, mastered the DADA course and was tutored by Moody, he will be lacking behind in pretty much every aspect other than balls, luck and the plot-armour against Voldemort. You can obviously train him up, but that won't happen overnight. Harry and Hermione would balance each other out, but someone like Tonks, Lily or Bellatrix (time travel is your friend) is bound to be stronger. So at least initially, he ought to be the weaker link. He can certainly outgrow that, but it takes time.

*** Honestly, most stories on that list are unbelievable by virtue of chosen partner. I mean, Fred or Molly's brother would do, but Crouch Jr? Lestrange? Hermione would rather take cyanide than touch the men who worked towards the systematic extermination of people like her. The Death Eaters were literally magical Nazis and she was their "Jew" equivalent. Such pairings are basically Anne Frank/Heinrich Himmler, but with magic. Even discounting all the atrocities and murder, they would be out just for their involvement in Lily/James death, the parents of her best friend by association alone. And that whole Longbottom business. Don't get me wrong, the idea has some merit, and I am a sucker for the whole "it's always the quiet ones" trope this builds on, but the partner choice is, well there is no polite language to properly express my opinion on that.

Also, reverse harems mess up succession/inheritance considerably, especially if you have more partners than children. A woman popping out 10-20 children is way worse for her health than 10-20 women popping out one or even two each. I mean, given that a pregnancy lasts 9 months and you need some recovery time afterwards, it would not be an effective tool for repopulation.

Why would Hermione even agree to that in the first place, you can simply marry muggles and have them repopulate the world? Hermione wouldn't care about potential blood purity and given that she brought down one inhumane Ministry already, she would be the one leading the charge with the Red Banner of the Revolution, not bending over and taking their laws which violate countless human rights.

Because no one has done that so far. DPSW has a really, really creepy undertone to it because Harry is basically grooming his own Harem. Rune Stone Path was decent but dove too deep into pureblood culture to justify the whole thing (because you have to marry everyone for some reason).

Emerald Coven was decent IIRC, as are "The Power of Seven", "It could only happen to Harry" and "Fugue", but all of them focus more on the porn than any deeper plot.

** harem/Multi fics usually share the same point of views when dealing with such relationships and suffers from overuse of the same cliches and that is why, I think they are so reviled.

​

Also, the authors tend to lazily address such issues and place very little focus on their writing.

​

But yes, it is possible for an author to go and write a very good multi fic without cardboard and adoring female characters, or to have a harem fic where the world does not revolve around the amazingly manly male character. ( Btw, you can also read some parodies that are pretty good or crack fics and have a blast.)

​

I really, REALLY like the Cult of Dionysius , as the author created a whole A-U about Harry having strange powers and where his multi relationship is a natural consequence of the plot. Harry and the girls struggle with the idea of a multi relationship and when they start with it they are very young, but it is not a smooth sailing and they keep having problems in how they behave towards each other, the rules they want to establish etc...

​

The author also has a couple of other fics that deal with such issues in other settings, but read and see if you like his style:

** A bit late, but Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is the only one I've fully read so far, and none has managed to top it since. It helps that it is regularly updated to this day and the author is very self-aware with the story and is clever in handling the cliches, lore, world-building, magical system, politics, and the overall direction of how the story started and where it is heading. They also made the girls well-written characters in their own right that are actually competent people, and it pleases me to no end that there is no repeated explicit bashing of any characters in the story.

*** Isn't that the story where a time traveller grooms a bunch of pre-teens to be his harem?

**** Yeah, much weirder is that the 1st years of that world act a bit like adults with their extensive knowledge of wizarding culture and being heirs to Ancient and Noble Houses. It's kind of ridiculous, but really well-written and enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. Maybe it's the complicating planning, the secret identity thing going on, or the revenge scenario in similar vein to The Count of Monte Cristo, but it appeals to me much more than the romance/harem part. That's just a bonus.
