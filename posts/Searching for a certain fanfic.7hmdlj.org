Tried dozens of sites, tried all kinds of patterns, and I hope this won't kick me off of here. Harry Potter fanfiction with Regulus Black alive (but a vampire and an assassin maybe?) Regulus takes him to an assassin/vampire area and it has all kinds of boys also there Harry is trained by these assassins and they are pitted against each other in fights Harry has a tattoo on his cheek and it changes colors or brightness if he loses his emotions, which I think he does at some point? NOT a crossover fic. The vampires in this are OCs, I believe.


** I believe the fic you are looking for is Sleeping Somewhere Cold by DarkCyanStar. Its on ff.net and ao3
