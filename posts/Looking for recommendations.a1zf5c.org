I'm wanting to find dark harry and dark hermione fanfictions. I also like slash fanfiction with harry and some other character like Snape or draco.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is my favorite in this category. It actually features the Dark Trio.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106) has an awesome 'Harry' who likes throwing around killing curses.

Hermione summons demons as friends in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436), and considers Voldemort her 'ally'.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]] has lots of tropes, but is a fun curb stomp fic. This Harry and Ginny pair enjoys torture quite a bit and likes having rough sex after battles.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]] is time travel. Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan all became very disturbed people after a brutal war. Once back in time, they unleashed hell on their enemies. Dark humors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455), is basically an one-shot, but this Hermione simply killed Tom Riddle in his orphanage, instead of raising or shagging him.

Finally, I'd like to recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]], linkffn(13088810). Although it doesn't fully fit your request, as it's about Voldemort getting a second chance in 1943 after falling to Harry, it's nevertheless very well written with a compelling plot.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

  When Hermione travels back in time and kills Tom Riddle, the destruction of evil becomes an addiction she can't sate. Follow Hermione as she extracts her revenge...slowly. ONE-SHOT Time-Travel. DARK! RATED-M. R&R.

#+begin_quote
  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...
