#+TITLE: Ron is hella confused. Like He has no idea what the hell is going on. Why did his best mate call him a blood traitor and Hermione a Mudblood? Why is the ferret Malfoy defending them? Why is Harry a Slytherin? Did he step into another dimension but then why are the puffs and claws also confused?

Or alternatively Sirius gives Harry ideas and Draco gets dragged along and the only ones who knows are are the lions and snakes and they think it's hilarious


** Not sure why Malfoy would go along with this, but it is an interesting idea for Sirius/Harry trolling Draco and Ron missing the memo due to being lazy and getting confused...

*** Draco would go along because he would want to see ‘the weasel' make a fool for himself

**** And why would Harry troll his friend? And bring an ass like Draco along with it? I don't see it.

​

I could see them pranking Ron, but they wouldn't do it publicly with Draco, of all people. maybe in Grimwald, with Harry, Hermione, and the Twins with Sirius to get him back for something he said.

However, I could see them pranking Draco but having the effect of confusing the hell out of Ron because he didn't keep up with the scheming (or they just didn't bother to tell him)

***** Ron has shown in the books that he has very good instincts and is not the fool you him as in your comment. Besides he and harry got almost the same Marks every year. If you wanna argue with logic, use it for everything and not selectively for a particular point you are trying ta make.

****** Eh? I wasn't commenting on his intelligence. "didn't keep up" wasn't a diss on his intelligence at all.

(ie, it would be a 'he forgot to open a letter with the prank planning' and thus is confused as well when all his friends are acting this way. Probably resulting Harry/Hermione saying "Ron, did you read my letter", him looking sheepish, and then a "Too late, Malfoy's comming, *PLAY ALONG*")

******* Ah okay. I think I misunderstood your wording then. There is so much ron bashing present that the mind automatically goes to that now.

It does, though. Otherwise you kinda break the reader's suspense of disbelief.
