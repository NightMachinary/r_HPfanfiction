Didn't really know how it word the title.

So, Harry and Draco live with snape to protect them from Voldemort. Harry has been abused and does his best to be friendly with Snape and Draco, while doing all the chores in the house, but they constantly bring him down, until Snape finds out he is abused.

I believe one scene consists of Draco and Harry having to clean the potions lab but Draco breaks some things and blames it on Harry.

Thats all I remember about it. I read it a long time ago and recently poped into my head.

Thank you in advance for your time!!!


** Does Harry Potter and the Awakening Power sound familiar?

** Ok, I swear I've read this before. Is there a part where Snape brings the Dursleys back to his place transfigured into rats or something?

** Could it possibly be linkffn(The Unwanted One by Amyria) by any chance? It isn't Draco, it's a different boy named Keiran who is Snape's illegitimate son, but the character is basically just Malfoy with a different name.

I think around chapter 6 or 7 there's the scene with the potions incident. I'm not sure, but I feel like it meets a lot of the description you gave.
