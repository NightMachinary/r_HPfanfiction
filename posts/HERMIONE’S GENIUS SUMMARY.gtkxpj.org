In which Hermione Granger publishes concise, ever so slightly cynical summarized account of the golden trios adventures and misadventures at the end of the war. Her journal is wildly popular: playing against a giant magical chess, camping with horrocruxes, robbing a bank and breaking out with a dragon, all told with a mixture of acerbic wit, matter of fact and self deprecating humor that would make Snape (it's professor Snape Harry) proud if he had survived. Hermione gets a tic every time people compare her journal with Gilderoy Lockhart and dies a little inside.


** I would read the ever loving crap out of such a story.
