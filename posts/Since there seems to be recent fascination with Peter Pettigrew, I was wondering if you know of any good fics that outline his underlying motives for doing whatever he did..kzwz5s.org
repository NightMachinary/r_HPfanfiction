The books heavily hint at the fact that Wormtail had turned before he became the Potters' Secret Keeper because the switch happened in such secret that not even Dumbledore or Lupin knew of it. Even if someone like Snape or other former classmates of the Marauders would have given away to Voldemort James's or Lily's friendships, the likely candidate would have been Sirius, yet there is no indication that Voldemort had ever reached out to Sirius.

Furthermore, while it's a fanon trope, it is still my headcanon or otherwise the Fidelius Charm would be useless, the Secret Keeper cannot give away the secret unwillingly so the whole justification with the torture that Wormtail spouts in PoA falls. Finally, when Voldemort comes for you, he either exploits your weakness until you submit to him or he kills you. Therefore I wonder if there is any good fic depicting Pettigrew's thought process when he joined the Death Eaters.

Maybe he himself had a crush on Lily and chose to punish James for getting her or maybe due to a botched Order mission, the other members shun him off or maybe he was even abandoned by his friends and ended up Voldemort's prisoner who instead of killing him chose to seduce him over to the dark side. Maybe the Death Eaters threatened his mother if he wouldn't comply or maybe he willingly chose Voldemort's side because, at least at first, he thought that he was in the right and Dumbledore was wrong.

Anything goes. Thank you!


** The best Pettigrew analysis I've ever seen is chapter 20 from Remain in Light.

The fic itself is a "what if Sirius didn't die" fic and him and Remus run the order and it's great

BUT chapter 20 is something else. It's essentially a oneshot of Peter over the years and why he did what he did? He was trying to save them really? It's really really good honestly. You don't need the rest of the fic, Peters chapter can be a standalone.

I've linked it below. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1918284/chapters/21226295#workskin]]

** This fic, Peter's Plight by TimeTurner394 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23218372/chapters/55586488]]) is probably quite similar to what you're looking for. The author's summary: “An exploration of what might have happened if Peter had a glimpse of his future while still in Hogwarts.”

  She acted like she loved Peter like she loved the others. That was the worst part, because no one could ever love him.

** The Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian. I could go on about this fic for ages, but the Peter characterization is my favorite part. It goes into why Peter did what he did in 1981. linkao3(The Age of Lies by TheDivineComedian)

** I'll let others recommend the fics but my guess is that canon Peter (as described in one of the fics) sees after Order members die left and right the price they pay is too high and it benefits him more to be on the bad side because Pettigrew's main motivation seems to be self-preservation and not dying.

And I think Vold would have targeted Sirius-he would have been well known for being a member of the Black family, and he would have had intel (maybe from Pettigrew himself) that Sirius was the Potters' closest friend.
