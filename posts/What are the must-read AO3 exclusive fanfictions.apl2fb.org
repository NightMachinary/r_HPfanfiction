I know, this might be very vague, but still wanted to give it a shot. I have been reading HP FanFiction since 2004 and must have broken the 100m word count a good few years ago. Actually used reading HP fanfiction as a way to learn and improve my English. But all of that was on either ff.net, fanficauthors.net or the old, now defunct, sites like fictionalley or portkey.

Now, after I came back to HP fanfiction a few months ago and caught up on most of the new and good fics on ff.net I wanted to give AO3 a try. Problem is, when I use the obvious way to find the best fics, aka sorting by hits or reviews, all I get is very badly written smut. Now don't get me wrong, I love me some smut. But it must be very well done or packaged in a good plot. Having tried out the first 5 fics that my search showed, I can savely say, they are neither.

So, seeing as my old forum of asking these questions ("Help! I'm looking for..." over on the fictionalley forums) is dead now, I thought I would ask here.

So, what are your favorite AO3 exclusive fics out there? I prefer Harry centric, but if its well written, absolutely anything goes.

EDIT: With "exclusive" I mainly mean that it isn't also posted to ff.net because then I probably already know it. If it is on AO3 and some other site it will still be new to me.


** I quite like the Island of Fire series linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041]]) by esama. Also, Pursuit of the Jackalope (or, Fantastic Friends and Where to Find Them) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/974929/chapters/1917367]])

Island of Fire is an ensemble piece, and Harry is featured. Jackalope is mostly Teddy & Luna, with Harry at the beginning and end.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  It is also very pro-Death Eater.
#+end_quote

Eh, I've read some "Dark Harry" fics that were pro Death Eater, and in comparison SaS is taking a middle road. The Death Eaters are presented as more rational than in canon, but the story shows negative aspects of both sides of the conflict, which makes Harry justifiably reluctant to pick a side. At this point (midway through book 5) it's hard to tell whether Harry will stay neutral or not.

** I always sort by Kudos on AO3! I've found it's the best way to get a broad scope for what's biggest and/or best in a fandom.

You specify Harry-centric; are there any pairings you do/definitely don't want?

Edit: Just re-read some of your other responses re: pairings, sorry. I will definitely second Debt of Time; it's highly lemony but also a great long read.

My other recommendations are Linkao3(stately homes of wiltshire by waspabi) and Linkao3(slithering by astolat) - I'm not sure if either of those is posted elsewhere, and they're both Drarry so if that's your squick, my apologies. Really good examinations of post-war Harry and Draco.

"And no, have no particular ship in mind. I have a slight non-slash Harry/multi preference but good stories with that trope have always been hard to find. Else, non-slash overall is a preference but has never been a reason to not read a good fic. Some of my all time favorites are slash."

**** I've never directly compared the two so mileage may vary here, but I've noticed in the past that Comments isn't necessarily a great measure of how many people have read and enjoyed a work as compared to Kudos, since oftentimes Comments threads involve a smaller group of readers commenting more than once, or having a discussion with the author - which isn't a bad thing at all, just not as indicative of wider appreciation, if that makes sense? And a lot of people don't take time to comment on their favorite fics, whereas clicking the Kudos button is quick and easy.

**** The problem I have with sorting by comments is it favors fics with frequent short chapter updates. Kudos has obvious problems too, though, so I generally just try to exclude enough terms that I can at least read the summary of every fic in a search.

The best way to find new stories will always be recommendations; either from friends, a community (like this subreddit), or an author's loved/bookmarked list.

** I'm petty sure my fav Luna/Hermione fic is only on ao3 linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) Harry is around but its very Hermione centric I'm afraid, Very long at 230k(and still going though only has 6 chapters left according to the author) and its mostly just really cute fluffy romance though in the later stages it has gotten more plot and gotten a tad bit darker now Bellatrix has been introduced as the main villian. There is a tiny bit of smut but its mostly done with humour and comes off as playful and cheeky with very little swearing, I'm hesitent to say if the writting is great....I myself really enjoy it, though i'm not sure if i've just read so much fanfics now that my mind suddenly makes anything with average writing seem better than it is lol so i hope it doesn't disappoint.

**** Luna is so sweet here she makes my heart flutter haha Hermione has been made regrettful of her earlier attitude toward Luna and her strange belifes so that is a tiny bit out of character but i still feel its possible for Hermione to become more open like that so i was able to go with it. Also she doesnt get off scotfree either for her pervoious attitude and Luna does remind her on occasion of her' poor review of the Quibbler' and sometimes shows flashes of anger around this topic haha. Stuff like that is why i really enjoy this one it felt real to me depsite how much cute sweet fluff nonsense is in there

** I actually think the quality on Ao3 is better, but filter by bookmarks or comments instead of hits. Hits tends to be porny. Do you have a particular ship in mind?

​

Here is one of my favourites Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]

'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

*** When I said reviews I meant comments. Had sadly the same effect as hits. But will give sorting by bookmarks a try when I get home. And no, have no particular ship in mind. I have a slight non-slash Harry/multi preference but good stories with that trope have always been hard to find. Else, non-slash overall is a preference but has never been a reason to not read a good fic. Some of my all time favorites are slash.

As to the fic, sounds very interesting. Haven't read too many "Harry does not learn about magic at 11" stories. Thanks!

It's on ffn, but the smut has been removed and it's not the same fic without it. Hermione/Sirius, but there's plenty of Hermione/Remus too, if that's your jam.

Linkao3(the man who lived by sebastianL) is Draco in New York, working with troubled kids. He tells them that he was in a neonazi gang. Harry/Draco.

** Cest La Vie by cyscross seems to get recommendations around here in cycles around here and I believe it's only on ao3. And esama has a bunch of written works for many fandoms and all of them are on ao3 (For Harry Potter specifically, my personal favorite is Whispers in Corners. Id just add the caveat that it is a Harry/Mycroft Holmes pairing. That pairing isn't the center of the fic, or indeed particularly why I recommend it, and what there is of it is well done. But there are some for whom that pairing makes the fic an instant pass)

Seven Names by angelholme linkao3(5265569) is one I really enjoy, even if it isn't perfect. But if I could only recommend one, it'd be Face Death In The Hope by LullabyKnell linkao3(5986366) and it's companion fic with alternate PoV

Smoke and silvered glass is a Snape one-shot of his life from his POV, has some AU elements but I thought it was wonderfully done.

Rose Petal Red is an SI born as the youngest daughter of the Weasleys, it is currently the only SI-centric story I've read that I truly truly love, and that's saying something! It actually has stakes, not some mary-sue bs that everyone's so sick of, this takes that concept and turns it on its head. The end of the second arc has quickly become one of my favourites in any fanfic I've read be it in hp, naruto, worm or any other fandom.

** Thanks for this thread, OP! I got some good stuff out of it, too. I recently switched to AO3 and I'm still not as efficient as I want to be when I'm searching for new stories. I tried the general recommendations tab in the sidebar, but it isn't limited to AO3 and I found it hard to browse. That said, I do have two recommendations to give you as well that I haven't seen mentioned here yet, though I am unsure whether they aren't posted elsewhere.

Linkoa3(Of A Linear Circle by flamethrower) is an on-going series that has 9 parts and got over 1M words written for it already. Without spoiling too much, it doesn't start out as Harry-centric but it /will/ come. What I especially liked about the series is that it added a load of depth to Hogwarts and the founders, as well as their first students, partners, and children.

Edit: I see the bot didn't pick up this one, so [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][here is a link for the lazy]].

Linkao3(The Prince of Slytherin by TheSinister_Man) another ongoing series that currently has 3 parts and over 700K words written. It is a Wrong Boy Who Lived story where James and Lily survived Voldemort's attack and Harry has a twin brother that is in Gryffindor. Harry isn't on good terms with his family and Peter Pettigrew is outright scary sometimes.

Yes, I enjoy it a lot! It's not my most favourite among the HP longfics that I follow, but it is certainly captivating and very in-depth, especially with the different cultures and their differing stances on magic. I hope that will be explored more throughout the series as well. Though it already seems to be set on remaining quite internationally involved from different perspectives/angles.

*** Loved loved Eclipse Wing. I have hated most James or Lily don't die stories, normally because the writing is bad or the cliches are too much. But this was so good and so tragic.

And the fact that Sirius was dead before James awoke really put a knife in my heart. I've always wanted a retelling of this story where it's actually canon, so James becomes the DADA professor in 5th year while the Order is holed up at Grimauld. And I just really wanted a Sirius and James reconnecting scene. Honestly we can all cry about Harry being an orphan, but I still think Sirius is the most tragic character in HP.

Use word country If you are in the mood for a long fic for example.

Dont like a pairing? Exclude it from the search.

Like time Turner fics? Search for the tag...

Beware of summaries- some are misleading- and also, run from super ambitous fics that Will never bem fineshed.

  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.

** Harry Potter is a Card Captor. Not much wizarding magic happens, it's very much exploring Harry's effect on the Cards and the whole finding family theme. Linkao3(1622579)

Wrong boy who lived story that's dark af. It's excellently written and an enjoyable read, but Wow Dark. Might want a palate cleanser interspersed here and there. Linkao3(7322935) There's a sequel in progress too, but I'd recommend waiting for it to be posted because it's apparently even worse than this.

Powerful Harry, Pureblood family shenanigans. This was a fun read. Focuses on the Blacks and the Potters and the politics around them. Harry tries to stay out of it all, but power talks. Linkao3(11063892)

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation at this point.Skylar is the boy who lived, that's why he's important. I'm not Skylar.Going to Hogwarts is part of the plan, waking the basilisk is part of the plan, taking potions, learning spells, being tortured, murdering others, watching people di-

    I'm going to tell you a story, although it's a bit long. I'm going to make you listen, because I want you to understand how you made me a monster. I'll call this story antithesis, and you're going to learn every single moment where things went wrong. I want you to cry, and beg for me to kill you, and when I'm done with this, you're going to want to do that to yourself. You're going to listen, because in the end, you owe me that much. You owe me so much more, but here we are, and this is how it's going to end. Who knows, maybe this useless battle between you and me and this bloody world, well, maybe we always were fated to kill each other.\\
  Do you know what it is like to be unmade?

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
