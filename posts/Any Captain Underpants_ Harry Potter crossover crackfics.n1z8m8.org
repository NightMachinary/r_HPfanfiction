Maybe it was just sleep deprivation, but as I was reading Captain Underpants to my kids at bedtime last night I just thought how easily George Beard and Harold Hutchins could be replaced by Fred and George Weasley, and the mean teacher they accidentally turn into Captain Underpants could be Professor Snape instead of Mr. Krupp.

Alternatively Ron and Harry could be in George and Harold's place.

Does anyone know if this has been done or have any interest in doing it because it would read the heck out of it and don't have the skill to do it myself. I feel like it could be an amazing crackfic in the right hands.


** Oh, thank you very much. I now have the mental image of Albus Dumbledore running around the castle in his tighty whiteys.

Snape would been to be the villain they fight.

*** Now I'm imagining it being acted out by the Harry Potter Puppet Pals cast, with the naked Dumbledore puppet as Captain Underpants.
