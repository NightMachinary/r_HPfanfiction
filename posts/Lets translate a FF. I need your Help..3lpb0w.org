** Somebody asked me if they can translate my fic into Czech, and I said yes, but I keep changing my mind. I don't know why I'm a bit uneasy about it. Has anyone experienced the same?

*** Translation is an art, not a science. Anyone can replace words with the translated equivalent, but to preserve the tone and spirit of the original text takes a lot of skill.

******** Picked it up, go to around 80 chapters but will probably drop it, way too many redundancies, whenever something happens she explains/retells it to every single person what happened and how it happened.

Does it get better ?

Could you recommend me another german ff ?
