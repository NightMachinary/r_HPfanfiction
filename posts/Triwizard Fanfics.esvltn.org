I'm looking for good Triwizard fanfictions recommendations. Preferably one where the champions interact ( and maybe even befriending) with each other. Any pairing is okay except for Harry x Ginny.

#+begin_quote
  A disillusioned Harry Potter begins to unravel his potential as the wizarding world follows the Triwizard Tournament. Harry delves into a world that is much greater, and more complicated, than he was aware of. Story contains more detailed magic, politics, and more. It is a story of growth and maturation.

** Three fem!Harry stories:

- linkffn(13132217) is a gender-swap (no romantic relationships mentioned) Harry, which has some strong, some less strong parts, but yes, champions are very much working together.

- linkffn(13197260) is fem!Harry born-such, and pretty nice what-if-people-behaved-with-a-bit-of-common-sense story; I just don't know why it is fem!Harry story at all, because it doesnÂ´t have any dramatic effect on the story line

- linkffn(13285012) is a time-travel (Harry returning from the death as a female) fem!Harry femslash Harmony; very much WIP, but actually new chapters are being published. Not sure how much I care

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

** /The Diggory Papers/, the tournament from Cedrics PoV. linkffn(2846963)

I like it, it's quite fun but certainly not to everybody's taste. There are some caveats:

- It's written in first person; I know some people hate that and won't read them.
- Cedric is a *shit*. He's a lying, lazy, cowardly, lecherous, selfish, manipulative scumbag, But he's outwardly likeable and very good at maintaining a false front of being decent and noble. It's entirely consistent with canon because that's written from Harry's PoV and Harry is simply taken in by Cedric like everybody else.
- The Trio are minor, background characters.
- It says straight away that's its the "memoirs" written by an elderly Cedric, living abroad under an assumed name. So it's no spoiler that he survives the graveyard incident (on his own, without the aid of Albus, Scorpious and time-travel) .

And yes, Cedric befriends Fleur and they do interact. A lot.

  Cedric Diggory tells the story of his last year at Hogwarts, the Triwizard Tournament and an unlikely survival. Because Cedric Diggory did not die in Little Hangleton. Nor was he anyone's hero. Coward, lecher and cheat, but never hero. Complete.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
