:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry is sent back in time. He ends up in his 5th or 6th year as a slytherin. Hermione is Gryffindor and apparently up until his time Harry is best friends with Draco Malfoy and also takes drugs. I think Neville is BWL.


** AO3 or FFN?
