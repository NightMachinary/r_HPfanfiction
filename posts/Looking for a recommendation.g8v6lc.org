So you know in a lot of bad/evil Dumbledore stories, Lily or James was bad too. Same for the few Harry being the son of Riddle, Lily or James (or both) kidnapped or illegally adopted him. I was wondering if there were an Harry being Riddles son where Lily and James didn't know. Like Dumbledore lies or spells them and they really do die to protect him and his their heir and when he finds out the truth he tries to like honor both sets of parents?


** I know one where Riddle is spelling him, instead of Dumbledore, but it's definitely worth the read and very angsty but the storyline makes up for it. It's called â€˜The Darkness Within' by Kurinoone and it's on fanfiction.net
