Recently read the Firebird Trilogy, found myself actually supporting Voldie and his beliefs for a fair bit of it until later on into the story when a few things were revealed. Are there any fics similar to this?


** linkffn(Circular Reasoning) quintessential antihero. Well written, and the dark themes are downright amazing.

  Torn from a desolate future, Harry awakens in his teenage body with a hefty debt on his soul. Entangled in his lies and unable to trust even his own fraying sanity, he struggles to stay ahead of his enemies. Desperation is the new anthem of violence.

** is slash okay? Because I got a bunch... all of them either updated relatively recently, or completed 100+k words for the most part. +I think Paraselenic is the only exception (sitting at 80k).+ welp forget it it's 200k, so all completed work are comfortably sitting over 100k words, and the others are updating regularly.

- linkao3(Again and Again) LVHP Slash time travel, updated recently.
- linkffn(Death of Today) (sortaish) Slash LVHP, Complete. A must-read\\
- linkffn(The Nightmare Man) No slash, insane!Harry, Complete. A must-read\\
- linkffn(Paraselenic) LVHP Complete. Bittersweet ending.\\
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) A must-read. COMPLETE Harry + horcrux teaming up. This one is complete and the sequel is updated every other week. Mention of slash, no main pairing (and author emphasized he would not pair Harry with anyone soon)\\
  linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis) sequel to Accidental Horcrux)\\
- linkao3(The Train to Nowhere) INCOMPLETE, updated relatively recently, supposed to be LVHP later on, but is currently Mentor!Voldemort. A must-read\\
- linkffn(Dreams and Darkness collide) LVHP serialkiller!Harry writing can be iffy and overly detailed in the "alpha/beta" dynamics (non verbal language and position of bodies, not pack-like alpha/beta), but it's a fun read.\\
- linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation) Grey!Harry mentor!Voldemort No Slash. Really amazing, updated recently too (29 Jan). A must-read\\
- linkffn(Xerosis) Complete, sortaCrack, BAMF!Harry LVHP slash.\\
- linkffn(Keep Your Enemies Closer) Mentor!Voldemort no slash, updated last week or so. A must-read\\
- [[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=Hit+the+ground+running][Hit the Ground Running]] COMPLETE, pulled out of FFN, Awake!Horcrux, Horcrux + Harry teaming up. No-slash.\\
- linkffn(Shadowed Malice) COMPLETE, Harry siding with Voldemort (adopted!Harry, Orphan!Harry, BAMF!Harry).\\
  Redone of shadowed Malice: linkffn(Antithesis) INCOMPLETE updated yesterday.\\
- linkffn(Fate's Favourite) That one may stretch the bill, but it does figure a TOMARRY, with a good depiction of a psychopath tbh. worth to try.\\
- linkffn(lesser evil) More ruthless!Harry than dark, does not side with Voldemort. No-slash.\\

I have a few other dozen (featuring LVHP, most probably) waiting on me that I still have to sift through. All either Complete or updated in the last year or so, but I did no quality control on these. I can still send them to you if you want.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

  Redo of story 'Shadowed Malice' originally posted over six years prior. Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

**** I'm a bit confused where "evil" comes from. Morally ambiguous? Definitely. Evil? Definitely not. He didn't go and kill innocents. He only killed people who stood in the way of his goals.

Evil would be Harry, Ron, and George going into Marcus Flint's house, tying him to a chair, torturing his wife and kids, gutting them, killing them, and leaving Marcus disfigured but alive. Or any one of them minus the chair tying part.

***** I would definitely consider becoming a Dark Lord as "evil." Certainly evil enough to be considered an anti-hero.
