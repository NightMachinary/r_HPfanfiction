** I'd say Herpo the Foul was probably number 3. Honestly, he deserved to be number 1, but not many people know what kinds of evil he did. Salazar Slytherin is likely also one of them, having bred a basilisk for the sole purpose of killing children.

*** I would have thought Morgana Le Fay would be 1st until Grindelwald came around then she would be second. But after Voldemort she would be third

Although I suppose she was a dark lady instead

Edit: I don't know much about the Arthurian Legends or what Rowlings interpretation is but where would Morgause fit into this theoretically

*** We don't know whether the Basilisk was intended for killing children. It's a bit too big to be really stealthy, any small ordinary venomous snake would be a more practical assassin. If the charms that hide Hogwarts from muggles weren't added until later and Slytherin feared that muggleborns might open the gates for a muggle army of knights to raid the castle, it's probable that the Basilisk was intended to slaughter the army, a task to which it is far better suited.

**** It was stealthy enough in the books, it was never seen by anyone other than who it targeting.

And while there is no concrete proof, only the legend, there is no other suggested alternative.

***** The basilisk was only "stealthy" because it could move around the castle using the pipe system, which was installed centuries after Slytherin left the school.

I don't know if Slytherin truly was a Dark Wizard (view about what magic is dark can evolve with time, and I can't help but think that Blood Purism is a bit more justified when you are litteraly witnessing witch burning rather than after centuries of peace). But I think that if he had truly become a Dark Lord after leaving the school, history books may have mentioned it rather that just say he "dissapeared".

***** It was only stealthy because Tom attacked really rarely, for example when the castle was almost empty because Quidditch. A handful targets over a year? A weapon intended for assassination should be able to do that in a week.

****** Tom wanted the muggle borns to be forced out. To do this he attacked a handful of targets, even leaving them alive (luck saved their lives, but he could have finished them off. Why leave them alive? Idk. Maybe ginny fighting back, maybe he thought it'd be a scary message, ect). He wanted to force the teachers hand.

And who said anything about assassination? The legend talks about 'purging' the students. The basilisk could do that in a matter of hours, hell, minutes! (if slytherin's heir couldn't do it the slytherin way, like Tom was trying)

Finally, presumably whatever creature he locked in the chamber had to be alive by the time it was opened. The basilisk has an average lifespan of about 900 years, so it'd his best bet for future users

** I guess the list would include some wizards from outside of Europe. Maybe the Aztecs made a lot of human sacrifices because they were ruler by a Dark Lord who used Blood Magic. Maybe Qui Shihuang (1st chinese emperor and builder of the Great Wall) was a Dark Lord, and the 5000 statues in his tomb were true soldiers changed in clay, ready to serve him after he had rised from his tomb (I guess this part of the plan failed).

*** Correct if I'm wrong but wasn't Morgause the bad one? I'm not British and it's been years since I read any interpretation of the legend but I'm almost sure Morgause was the bad one here...

**** Morgause was Morgana's half-sister IIRC and yes, in some versions, she was the evil one, same thing with Nimue. Some times all three. Sometimes only Mordred and one of them.
