This is my first post, so I hope this is the appropriate forum.

I recently read /Detained/ which was a Marcus Flint and Katie Bell pairing and absolutely loved it, so something along similar lines would be perfect! I'm looking for a long fic (100,000+ words) or a WIP with minor characters as the main pairing. I love a decent plot with a bit of smut mixed in. I don't have many preferences for the characters but if one could be a Slytherin that would be ideal.

Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4020275/MandyinKC][MandyInKC]] is famed for linkffn(Order of Mercy), which primarily features Bill/Fleur and Percy/Audrey (Audrey is Percy's wife in the epilogue, basically an OC), but by volume her OTP is Katie Bell/Oliver Wood, which you might like more.

*** I've tried to read this fic before because it seems like exactly the kind of thing I'd like, but I could not get past lines like this: "Underneath her slaggishness was a witch with a good heart."

**** Yes, Audrey is the weakest part of the story (besides, it is my firm headcanon, that she is a Muggle).

** If it helps, I'm writing a Dudley Dursley/Cho Chang fic right now? No Slytherins, unless Dudley somehow counts, but heavy emphasis on plot.

**** I've got it from linkao3(651870), but since then I have these two firmly in my headcanon (and from other fan fiction Dudley being a policeman, which makes him completely thrown from the Dursley's family, because no Dursley can work for the government or be altruistic, for that matter).

  JK Rowling once said in an interview that she thought about having Dudley have a magical child on platform 9 3/4s at the end of book seven, but decided that no magical blood could survive contact with Vernon Dursley's DNA. In a long list of ideas she got wrong about what should happen to her characters post-canon, I've always thought that this was pretty near the top.Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he has an encounter that will uproot the course of his life, change his relationship with his cousin and his parents, and introduce him to some really fun new alcoholic beverages.Mostly non-ship focused, but there are plenty of relationships happening in the background. Despite my reservations, this mostly takes the Harry Potter epilogue as written, but makes a few significant changes the plot revolves around.
