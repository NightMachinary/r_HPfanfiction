:END:
So I'm looking for a real bad fic I read once. He has a brother. It has him going to Durmstang and then absorbing other magicals powers including the greek/roman pantheon. Please help me find it.


** I vaguely remember reading something like this years ago. I think it was a Percy Jackson crossover?
