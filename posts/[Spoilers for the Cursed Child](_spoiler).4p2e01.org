[[/spoiler][Cursed Child spoilers below.]]

[[/spoiler][If you have seen spoilers for the Cursed Child/Attended the screenings, and you are of the opinion that the spoilers are generally accurate to the plot of the play, I thought it might be a nice idea to have a thread where we would throw up our own plot suggestions for an alternative version of the Cursed Child.]]

[[/spoiler][These changes could be anything you desire. If you wish to subtly change a few scenes, or if you wish to change the narrative completely, it is your choice.]]


** [[/spoiler][I would change all those stupid time turner travels to dimensional travels. Let's the kids and the adults go through all kinds of 'what could have been' scenarios would be fun.]]

*** [[/spoiler][I too would remove Time Travel. However, Dimensional Travel presents its own narrative challenges. If Dimensional Travel were possible; then there must be alternate dimensions, and if that is the case, there must be a myriad of dimensions where Voldemort is alive, or where Dumbledore and Grindelwald took over the world, and therefore, if CANON! can dimension travel to other worlds, it stands to reason that other dimensions could also travel the other way - which opens up a can of worms. I don't mind Dimensional Travel in fanfiction, but I don't like it in Canon.]]

[[/spoiler][Unless the play is presented as out of canon - or in Canon, and in WWW's Patented Daydream Charms - which would allow ambiguity. What happens in these travels would be influenced by the person who was using the charm.]]

**** Since we now have [[/spoiler][time turner extravaganza]] in canon, dimensional travels seem awfully tame.

** [[/spoiler][Isn't Delphi Riddle supposed to be about Teddy's age? I'd love to read a fanfic where Delphi goes to Hogwarts and the two interact (not necessarily as a pairing). Preferably having Delphi find out about her parentage while at Hogwarts and coming to grips with that (hopefully she wouldn't turn out to be irredeemably evil).]]

*** [[/spoiler][I think she is; and my first reaction when I read about her, and her desire to meet her father, and her hair colour and how she was orphaned and how she was born just before the Battle of Hogwarts, I thought to myself... Who fits all this criteria, and is already a canonical character from the books? TEDDY LUPIN!]]

[[/spoiler][Of course, Teddy wouldn't be the main antagonist, but the themes of loss and family could still be explored with him. And if Albus is feeling alone and disconnected with his family, Teddy might be able to relate to the feeling.]]

** Sorry, but I can't read this thread with all those black bars and hovering your mouse over all the different sentences. Wouldn't it be better to just slap a spoiler warning at the top of the post and consider that enough? And why is "Cursed Child spoilers below" also censored?

** [[/spoiler][Here is my suggestion. Bear in mind that I've only read spoilers, and I haven't seen the play for myself]]

[[/spoiler][Okay, so I have a few problems with the play's plot points and how the characters interact with each other. I think that many characters are OOC to drive the plot, the narrative ignores world-building rules set up in the books, and the plot itself is convoluted.]]

[[/spoiler][The major changes I would make are: There will be no time-travel, and Delphi will not be Voldemort's daughter.]]

[[/spoiler][From what I've read, it seems like Rose Granger-Weasley is kind of a jerk to Albus and Scorpius in the Cursed Child. So we need to establish why she acts like this - and we will learn, early in the play, that Hermione is campaigning to become Minister for Magic. We also learn that whilst Harry and Ginny tried to keep their children's childhoods as normal as possible, Rose has been more exposed to the prejudices that still simmer under the surface of this world. Hermione Granger-Weasley has been stepping on a lot of toes, and whilst relations with Slytherin House has thawed since the end of the Deathly Hallows, old suspicions still run high.]]

[[/spoiler][So we can understand why Rose is unwelcoming of Scorpius.]]

[[/spoiler][Onto the sorting:]]

[[/spoiler][Scorpius Malfoy is the first of our trio to be sorted - into Hufflepuff. Draco Malfoy said that his son, despite his best efforts, was a follower, and from what I've garnered from reports, he seems to act like a Hufflepuff.]]

[[/spoiler][Albus Potter is a Gryffindor/Slytherin hatstall. He chooses to go into Slytherin.]]

[[/spoiler][Rose Granger-Weasley is sorted into - Slytherin. And suddenly she is confronted with the stark reality of her situation. Things are no longer simple to quantify. Rose thinks that the Sorting Hat is wrong, that she doesn't belong in Slytherin, and she takes her anger out on Albus; she loathes where she is, and the internal searching this is making her do.]]

[[/spoiler][Perhaps Albus, in an attempt to bridge the gap with Rose, will reveal that he chose to be in Slytherin, but she will not be pleased. I don't intend to keep Rose as being the antagonist all the way through, but she'll have to overcome her own feelings and importantly, with Rose's reaction, Albus now has legitimate reasons for feeling that his induction into Slytherin might not be met with approval. If we're going to explore distance between Harry and Albus, Harry doesn't have to be a colossal moron.]]

[[/spoiler][Meanwhile, Albus will be forming a friendship with Scorpius, as the play goes. The extended members of the Weasley bunch should be included in some way, even in minor roles.]]

[[/spoiler][So we've got a bit of a reason as to how Albus can feel distanced from his family - they don't have to treat him poorly; he just has to feel like they are, or they might be in the future, or they're hiding it. Hermione's campaign is taking years to build, so Harry is concentrating on helping her, which takes up a lot of his time.]]

[[/spoiler][It is in the third year where the plot starts to get serious. Astoria is dying, and of course, Albus and Scorpius want to stop this from happening, but they also need to come to grips with the realities of mortality.]]

[[/spoiler][Now we can introduce characters that can relate to how Albus and Scorpius are feeling. Teddy Lupin is one (they can meet in Hogsmeade). Perhaps Neville and Hannah Longbottom can have a scene where Neville deals with his parent passing away. And it is in Hogsmeade where we are introduced to Delphi.]]

[[/spoiler][Now the plot of the antagonists is still shaky, even in concept, but I'd like to utilize the Deathly Hallows. But we need to build this up: Why do people want the Hallows? Why is their plan being enacted now? And how and why do they know of the Hallows' locations.]]

[[/spoiler][The first two are pretty simple. There are different people/groups, but in broad strokes, they want power over life and death. Now I know the Hallows don't work like that, but it is the belief that they do that drives the plot.]]

[[/spoiler][The second reason, the reason for their delay, is that want to unite the Hallows quickly, rather than grab one and hope to be able to hold onto it. The Elder Wand is probably the most famous, so they will probably be able to establish the location reasonably easily.\\
The Cloak is a little harder to find, but they may eventually deduct that it is in the possession of the Potters - and it is the passing of the cloak from Harry to James that triggers the attempt to find the Resurrection Stone, which is the hardest one to find.]]

[[/spoiler][This is where Delphi comes in. She works in the Ministry, in the Centaur Liason Office. Somehow, she has to learn that the Resurrection Stone is in the Forbidden Forest somewhere, and her job is the perfect cover for her plans.]]

[[/spoiler][She will also befriend Albus and Scorpius, and after Astoria dies, they will be emotionally vulnerable to her plans, which is to use Albus to steal the Invisibility cloak from James in order to bring Astoria back to life. Now as we've established, this is not how the Hallows work, but it is how Albus, Delphi and Scorpius believe they work. Harry has been intensely private, even with his children, so he hasn't really discussed the Hallows, and Albus doesn't really talk with Rose, who might know more. This also uses an established character trait of Harry's - he doesn't communicate freely. Harry doesn't have to do anything bad, but his actions and inaction lead to this situation.]]

[[/spoiler][Delphi establishes that she wants to bring her parents back too; and so once the three find the Hallows, Delphi suddenly reveals that her father was Voldemort, and her mother was Bellatrix.]]

[[/spoiler][Meanwhile, Harry is knuckle-deep in work at the Auror Office. Hermione is now the Minster for Magic, and it seems like Voldemort's old supporters are up to something - but Harry can't put his finger on what it is. Hermione's reforms have not always been popular, even if they are right; and sometimes Hermione has been overzealous in her application. The world is changing.]]

[[/spoiler][And some people want back to the good old days.]]

[[/spoiler][So back to Delphi; she uses a pre-arranged system to bring the sympathizers of Voldemort into the Forbidden Forest - perhaps a Portkey, and now the Voldemort Sympathizers have the power over life and death- or so they believe.]]

[[/spoiler][Delphi successfully brings the image of Bellatrix back; but she cannot work out how to bring Voldemort back. So now she has to use Albus to get Harry to show her how to use the Hallows, so Albus is the bait.]]

[[/spoiler][Then the Climax occurs. There a lot loose ends in my plot, but it is revealed that Delphi is not the child of Bellatrix or Voldemort, instead, she is the daughter of a couple of Snatchers who died in the Battle of Hogwarts, and how she was groomed as Voldemort's child. Now she does do some horrible things - perhaps she could murder a Centaur, but now she has a tragic backstory - she was an innocent child who was moulded into a monster, and it once again shows that choices matter, and that we must come to terms with our own mortality.]]

[[/spoiler][So that's the basic skeletal structure of the play. There are still many gaps to fill in. We need to bring Rose's arc full circle; we also need to have more interactions between the Potters, and whilst Harry will not say "I wish you weren't my son", there will have to be reasons as to why Albus would not be open with what he's planning with his family.]]

*** [[/spoiler][The main issue I have with the CC - and indeed, my script, is that it doesn't really establish anything groundbreaking in the Wizarding World. When the CC was announced, my biggest fear was that it would rehash - instead, the reality seems to be far worse, with it changing what has already been established.]]
