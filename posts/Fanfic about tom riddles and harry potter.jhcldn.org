  Harry and Tom have been together since their fifth-year, proving once and for all that Slytherins and Gryffindors can actually get along. Fifteen years later, they are both professors at Hogwarts and more in love than ever. Harry plays Quidditch with the Weasleys on the weekends, and Tom is secretly a vigilante named Voldemort. This is the story of their friendship, their romance, and their family.

Summary:

When Harry finds Tom Riddle's diary he does not write 'Hello.' He does not write anything at all. He draws. Tom Riddle falls in love with the artwork.

--------------

Sketch by sketch, drawing by drawing, the ink Harry pours into the diary manifests as creations in Tom's monochrome world.

Harry is big uwu energy and Tom would literally die for him.

1)The Nutcracker Riddle by duplicity Summary: During a playful fight with his husband Tom, Harry accidentally gets knocked on the head and passes out. When he wakes up, Tom is dressed as a nutcracker, and is suddenly saying that Harry is something called ‚ÄòThe Chosen One', and that his destiny is to defeat ‚ÄòThe Snake King'... whoever that is.

I mean just look at these tags!! How fluffy can you even get? Alternate Universe - The Nutcracker FusionDreamscapesFairy Tale ElementsTrue LoveSnakesFluffRomanceAdventureTom Riddle is a Disney PrincessChristmas Fluffis it christmas fluff? i'm going to count it as christmas fluffGood Tom Riddle

2) To the Waters and the Wild by Paimpont Summary: Flying back from Godric's Hollow, Hagrid accidentally drops baby Harry over a wild forest. Harry is raised by rebel fairies until his Hogwarts letter arrives. The Dark Lord is in for a surprise... HP/LV romance.

I swear on my honor that I've never read such a fluffy story in my life. Harry's heart is just soooo innocent and pure and Voldemort is so in love and smitten with him that it's honestly pathetic. The fairy aesthetic and cuteness will just melt your heart. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/610384/chapters/1099778]]

3)The Gift by Paimpont Summary: The Hogwarts students are playing Dirty Santa. Harry's gift is a romantic candle-light dinner. But who is his mysterious masked dinner companion? Time paradoxes.

‚ÄúPerhaps," breathed the boy, "this will remind you..." He leaned forward and kissed Harry softly on the lips. His kiss was as light as a whisper of wind against Harry's mouth, but it sent Harry's mind and senses reeling. "Do you remember me now?" There was a plea in the boy's silver-grey eyes. "Almost..." whispered Harry. "Kiss me again..."

4)The Dance of the Dreoilin byPaimpont Summary: The Yule Ball did not go well, so Dobby decides to use ancient elf magic to create another Christmastide ball for Harry and his friends. But elf magic is a dangerous thing - you may get exactly what you wish for. Harry/Tom romance. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/609958]]

‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è5)To Kill You With a Kiss by Paimpont Summary: After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts in 1945 where he meets an 18 year old Tom Riddle teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts.

Its so fluffly romantic, whimsical, and dreamy its like a beautiful colorful aesthetic movie that turned in to a cotton candy dream you never want to wake up from. Everything about this story is heartwarmingly nice.

6)To Seduce A Gryffindor

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7557109/1/First-Surrender]]

9) After Disaster SingingInTheRaiin Summary: ‚ÄúTo my cheating husband, I leave you a curse in my name. Every time you see movement out of the corner of your eye, every time you hear a noise with no cause, every time you feel a cool breath against your cheek, or an invisible weight on your chest as you sleep, know that it is my curse to you. Know that you hurt me with your foul, disloyal ways, and that I will rest peacefully in the ever after knowing that you will never rest peacefully again. Love, your dearest Emerelda.‚Äù Tom scoffed as he lowered the note once he was finished reading it aloud, and looked at the solicitor with one eyebrow raised. ‚ÄúThis isn't for me.‚Äù Tom's got a bit of a curse on his hands. Luckily for him, this curse comes in a rather attractive form.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20529170?view_adult=true]]

10) Pass the salt, Daddy by DarkkBluee Summary: Tom and Harry have a family dinner.  ‚ÄúDaddy, can you pass the salt?‚Äù Or not. Seven pairs of eyes swivel in his direction.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20854631]]

11) His Gravity Wiegenlied, You_Light_The_Sky Summary: Harry and Tom will tell you that they have always avoided each other from primary school to Hogwarts, and that they will continue to avoid each other as Teaching Assistants. They would be lying. Fluffy ace Tomarry

It's simply the story of two people who read and loved the Little Prince and allowed themselves to be influenced by it.

Tooth rotting fluff ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13546410/chapters/31080255]]

14) The Love of a Good Wizard SweetSorcery Summary: History of Magic has something to teach after all, and two resourceful students decide that the key to having any future at all lies in the past, and in Tom Riddle's heart.

15) Harry Potter's Attempts at Botching Tom Riddle's Love Confessions Description: Tom Riddle schemes to try and get Harry Potter to fall for him. Harry just thinks Tom's an idiot.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
