** Oh man, so Harry doesn't survive because there's no mother's sacrifice to power the magic protecting him?

So I imagine Sirius coming in and absolutely breaking down when he sees James and Harry's bodies. Lily is the one who sternly commands him to pull himself together, her eyes absolutely flat.

So, imagine, the Order shifting all their resources to protect Neville Longbottom, now pinpointed as the subject of the prophecy. Lily and Sirius are treated with pity and sympathy (as others have also lost family to Death Eaters) but are on the backburner. Remus, stung at being thought a traitor and also very loyal to Dumbledore, who says it is of paramount importance that the Longbottoms be protected, leaves them alone.

So together, Sirius and Lily plot - withdrawing to Grimmauld Place, plunging into its darkest books and scrolls.

They somehow find out Snape was the one who gave the prophecy to Voldemort. Lily pretends to be grateful that he saved her life, meets him alone - and uses her own formidable potions skills to poison him over tea. Mockingly, she allows him to stagger over to his potions lab and try to make an antidote, knowing he will not be able to in time.

They hunt down Peter and leave him impaled on a spike of ice in front of a known Death Eater's mansion. "Sic semper proditores " Lily conjures in letters of ever-frozen ice, remembering that in Muggle tradition, a frozen hell is reserved for traitors.

Dumbledore, by now aware of their vengeful rampage, is trying to corner them, sending Remus to speak to them, but between their own formidable skills and Black family strongholds they remain hidden from him.

And in the end it is Lily Potter who kills Voldemort with her dead baby's laughter ringing in her head as she does so. The power he knew not was the power of having a very powerful, very driven mother.

********** But talent doesn't /have/ to mean somebody is a good person, does it? Voldemort and Bellatrix are talented and no one detracts from their skill...

I've always found the overwhelming need of some people to put people into categories astounding. If Ron is the bad friend, Hermione is good. If James is bad, Snape is an angel. If Sirius is awful, Regulus is mother Theresa. It's almost as if these characters aren't shades of grey.
