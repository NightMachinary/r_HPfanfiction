Any fics where Harry doesn't forgive the Dursley's at the beginning of Deathly Hallows?

Honestly, for some reason I have never seen a fic like this so please insert your best down below.

They can be any length, preferably complete but if not that's ok.


** Please clarify, are you just asking for a canon remake but Harry doesn't forgive the Dursleys?

*** I mean I guess. I was mostly looking for Oneshots that shows the effect of such an action or something. But full length stories are also good

** Honestly, the only one that comes to mind is The Monster Beneath, which is a 5th year fic.

  Harry went alone to the Department of Mysteries. He expected to find Sirius a prisoner there... he hadn't expected the Death Eaters to have other hostages.
