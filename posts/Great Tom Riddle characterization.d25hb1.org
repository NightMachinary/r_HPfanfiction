** Thanks, I'll check it out. In trade, here's another story with great characterization of Tom and Hermione. That's to Hermione's influence, Tom is a bit less evil, but he's still Tom.

** *Pros about this fic:*

- There is a plot outside of the romance/shipping. It's an interesting plot.

- It vaguely follows the events of GoF, but has enough mystery and twists that the stations are avoided. Once the twist is revealed, there is still enough plot left to explore that the story doesn't feel like it suffers from "premature resolution". Game of Thrones is the prime example of this, where all the tension was sucked out after Season 8 Episode 3.

- Interesting character dynamics. Viktor, Hermione, and Ron can all be friends and work together without bashing and petty bickering. No one gets hit by fanon characterization, each member of the cast has reasonable motivations, and scenes with lots of characters shine as the dialogue gives each a unique voice.

.

*Cons:*

- Weird writing style. The author loves their one sentence paragraphs.

#+begin_quote
  The whole story is written sentence by sentence.

  It can be a useful tool.

  In adding tension and movement in action sequences.

  But because all the slower moments are also written this way, the pacing feels off.
#+end_quote

- Punctuation. The author uses so many commas in every sentence that reading this story feels like the wheelchair kid with asthma from /Malcolm in the Middle/ is narrating this fic to me. Throws the sentence flow right off.

#+begin_quote
  "What's worse, though, what makes him right furious at Fleur, and his parents, and Hagrid, and Riddle, and You Know fucking Who, at them, is that they could be."

  "Harry should be used to it by now- that look on her face, but it sits, uneasy, at his chest, still, because he understands it, cannot blame her for it, cannot recognise her, and yet she is still so Hermione Granger, more even, perhaps, than she ever has been."
#+end_quote

It's extremely distracting once you notice it. And once you see, you cannot unsee.

**** Do you have recs for fics with good plots?

So many of these kinds of fics focus purely on romance, which becomes same-y once you read 20 of them and the stories all run the same way.

I enjoyed linkao3(15873207) "Ink", which is similar to Renatus in certain ways - mysterious young DADA professor comes to teach at Hogwarts, and guess what, he's secretly Voldemort.

linkao3(2296544) "Lithium" is probably my favorite Tom mentors Harry fic. It's one of those fics that has a strong grasp of character and voice, and an actual plot. The romance is background slowburn, but the story focuses more on character development. Tom Riddle gets an actual, believable growth arc, and that's like a fanfic unicorn.

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle is not the diary, but during his more lonesome periods the line between his consciousness and the yellowed pages of the timeless journal thins until the leather cover is his body and the black ink is his tongue. In spite of his own mind's hallucinations, where every rustle of the paper feels like the fluttering of his robes, Tom Riddle is but a memory with its own will, chained. A snippet from an old newspaper futilely rewriting its own articles, never to be read.
#+end_quote

The writing is top notch. A good present-tense story that reads so much smoother than the choppy present-tense in Renatus.

****** I've read Full Circle before, haven't heard of the other, but I'll check it out.

I found another list of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b167ov/tomione/eik7673/][most popular rec'd fics here.]] Having read them myself, the writing style in those fics ranges from a minimum of competent to excellent, and I'm usually a stickler for good prose beyond spellcheck and punctuation. They should keep you occupied for a while if you're looking to fill up a reading list.

The plots are decent, too. All of them qualify for having a storyline outside of the standard shipfic's drawn out "will they get together?" tension.

#+begin_quote
  When the battle in the department of mysteries heads south, Harry finds herself flung backwards in time to 1942, where Tom Riddle is a prefect in his fifth year. Armed with this knowledge, but little else, Harry desperately tries to find a way home and for once in her life not screw it up. Tom, for his own part, wonders when Harry Evans will head back to the mothership.

Tom knows nothing about her, and despite the fact she has whisked him away from the orphanage to live with her, he's starting to think he never really will either. Regardless, he is determined to never let her go, not even in the face of time, space, or dark lords. timetravel
