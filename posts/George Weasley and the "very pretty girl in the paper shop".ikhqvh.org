:END:
I remember reading a fic where George Weasley dated the aforementioned Muggle girl from the paper shop in Ottery St Catchpole, but I can't remember what it was called.

Things I remember:

The girl's name was Crystal.

George revealed magic to her by showing up on his broom outside her bedroom window one night.

George dies instead of Fred (not at the Battle, though), and the girl ends up with Percy.

** The Dangerverse is fantastic, starting with Living with Danger. You'll have to wait a while for Crystal to arrive.
