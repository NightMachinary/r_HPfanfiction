From what I remember, Neville recommends Draco to Harry for mind healing. Blaise, a corporation ceo, becomes great friends with Harry. Also, Harry is married to Ginny. Deeply angst, and from what I remember Blaise had thing for Ginny. It was posted on fanfiction.net and quite a while since I last seen it.


** Was it the one where Harry was cursed with everyone believing that he was lying about everything?

** Could it be Iridescent Lies by The Lady Arturia? on Fanfiction.net? It mostly fits with your description (sorry I have no idea how to link it)
