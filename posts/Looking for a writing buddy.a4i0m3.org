I don't have a lot of writing/fanfic experience and I mainly write for myself; but, I want to improve and that is a bit hard to do without sharing your work... I've never done any writing buddying/beta-reading, so please excuse my inexperience.

​

I'm working on a Harry Potter fanfiction -- it is currently in its second draft (which is drastically different from the first draft if I'm honest...). The story takes place during the Second Wizarding War, where the main character joins the Death Eaters as a (double) spy. I'm looking to write along the Teen-to-Mature rating, exploring perhaps darker themes of torture/murder/a "do the ends justify the means" sort of thing. Also with a touch of romance just so that it doesn't get excessively dark.

​

I'm looking for someone to help proof-read/further develop the plots and realism of events, characters, and character development. Also to help me determine where the 'line' is for the darker stuff... Since this is the second draft, I do already have a rough idea of what the plot is and will be, as well as what I'm changing. The first draft hit a total of ~55 chapters, averaging 1800 words per chapter. I'd be looking to do this more in terms of arcs, rather than the entire story in one go (depending on the arc, it's roughly 5-15 chapters). That way errors don't get carried throughout the entire story.

​

Basically -- someone to chat with about the story, and bounce ideas off. Perhaps not scared to tell me if a chapter or more just /sucks/. In return, I can do the same for your work -- original or fanfiction. Although I know the HP realm the best, it doesn't have to be HP.
