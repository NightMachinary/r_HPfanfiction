Harry/Draco is always a bonus!


** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/78824][Earthbound Spook]] has a gryffindor Draco sorta and is Harry/Draco. This fic uses a cool plot device that I haven't really seen much before (A Black Comedy kinda uses it)- there are multiverses and certain spells could send a person from one to another. Draco from an AU where he is a Gryffindor and best friends with Harry and Ron jumps into a mostly canon 7th year universe. The new Draco is really well written as he is very similar to the Draco from canon but his Gryffindor side is heightened. Also, I kept expecting Draco to reveal that he and Harry had been romantically involved in the AU, but they were not exactly... (you'll just have to read it to find out!). And if you like this one, "If Sieve" by this same author is also really good. linkao3(78824)

  “Is this about your parents?”

  “You've read the letter, Hermione. They're not -- I'm not welcomed back home, I don't think I have a home.”

  It's the end of their first year at Hogwarts and everyone's ready to go home - everyone except Draco and he has to quickly make arrangements for summer and the next term.

  A few years after the Battle of Hogwarts and everyone is struggling to adjust to all that's happened with the war. The one having the most trouble is Draco Malfoy, who faces scorn from everyone, as well as every other Slytherin. He tries to think of a way to fix things, to make things better, to maybe...maybe make up for all his mistakes.He devises a plan to go back in time to the very beginning. To where he first met Harry Potter. If he can befriend him- Really befriend him, then maybe things could change. Slytherin could be seen in a more positive light, he and Harry could be friends, and he could stop Voldemort sooner. He didn't know everything - not all of it, but he knew enough to make a difference.To save lives.If he was able to do that one thing...sacrifice all his years to save so many people- To do something with this life, well... Wasn't it worth it?

Sadly after the interesting, but deeply flawed first part we got second and third part which rehashed canon plot to the point of pure idiocy considering how many things change.

***** I'm pretty sure that's because [[/spoiler][Voldemort was back, and the blood protection only worked with a family member, and Harry not dying was kinda important.]] But IMO the series kinda slogs after 2nd/3rd year until the last book/year, when things actually get interesting and the author's 'special' enhancements to canon actually make a bit more sense. Also - I have to recommend Be Careful from the same author - takes much of what made DV good and moderates it with the combination of having regular canon characters and [[/spoiler][a much much different parallel world]]

  Through a dark ritual, Draco Malfoy is sent back in time, from his seventeenth year to his eleventh. Now he has the chance to use his superior knowledge and skill to change everything and save all his friends and family, but there's a terrible complication: it turns out that not even time travel can cure a case of lycanthropy.

One is technically an alternate Draco, but most of the story takes place in that alternate dimension, so I think it fits.
