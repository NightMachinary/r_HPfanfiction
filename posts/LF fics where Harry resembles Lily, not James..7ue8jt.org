Looking for fics where Harry looks more like Lily than he does James, and it is referenced by the rest of the characters.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** I'd like to see this as well. /NOT/ Harriet Lily Potter (or whatever), the Girl-Who-Lived who resembles Lily, but the male Harry James Potter

**** Funnily enough thats a relatively recet development. Early fem!Harry all had red hair. When people got a hang of the Black family is when this switch happened and Fem!Harry got black hair "because thats how Dorea looked".

***** To be fair, the fandom Black family is the prime example how something with a lot of potential gets turned into a pile of shit. There are so many different ways to make up a good head canon but let's go with the same three ideas all the time.

#+begin_quote
  What, Harry Potter just took up the title of Lord Black? Well, better bend over and lube up, cause he got more cash than all of South America combined and is now independent from Dumbl3s. Also there's this old marriage contract with House Greengrass, who, unlike everyone else, never did anything shady.

****** I didn't comment on the fandoms general habit of turning anything with potential into yet another way to write an OP!Harry, but only on the fact that Dorea Potter / Black gave a lot of people ideas in regards to fem!Harry's looks.

I do agree, though. Lord Potter fics are mostly trash - fun trash in the best case.

***** Doesn't Dorea resemble Narcissa more? A quick Wiki look says the only depiction of her was blonde on one of the family trees.

****** Hmm, you're right, the wiki says she was blond. Honestly, I think most ff authors just went with what seemed to be the most "in theme" haircolor.
