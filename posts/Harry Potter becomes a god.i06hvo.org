:END:
I know there are plenty of Fanfictions where Harry Potter ends up a god in either the Marvel or Percy Jackson universes, but I can never find them. I want one where Harry becomes a god fairly early on (at least before the middle of the story I guess), and the I'm hoping for a long story but will accept short ones. Can anyone recomend any?

Side note: The gayer the better xxx


** Not remotely gay, I'm afraid, but The Professional/Dunuelos has a long running series that centers around a dimension-hopping version of Harry Potter called the Lone Traveler, who eventually becomes a god.

** What I can give you is this. It's a Marvel crossover where Harry is the MoD and ends up in the MCU. Not quite a god but very powerful. Pairing Loki/Harry. One of my fav crossover fics.

  Centuries after that fatal day of the battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter has fallen into legend, a bedtime story parents tell their children, a name whispered around campfires. He wanders the world alone and immortal, until one single reckless moment sends him hurtling into a parallel dimension of heroes and villains. A new enemy arises from an ancient power, and Harry must take a stand as the last wizard to protect this new world. If only SHIELD would stop trying to track him down...and someone could explain what the hell was an 'Avenger' was supposed to be. Honestly, muggles...

** It doesn't happen early on in Lokison, but it's quite gay and he's OP anyway :P This is a good author to follow if you want some OP!Harry with a pretty much fully gay cast and liberal doses of smut.

A non-gay one is Punching Gods. Again, doesn't happen early on.

And finally, in October he starts out as one. This Harry is asexual though.

  Harry finds out that his dad is alive, has been the whole time. Instead of being overjoyed, Harry's disgusted. His dad left earth and abandoned his friends. Every painful thing he's ever gone through can be traced back to one man. Now Harry's got super strength he can't control and an almost unnecessary amount of magical power. His dad might be living it up with the Avengers now but not for long. With the help of his friends, Harry comes up with a plan for revenge. Get ready Avengers, Harry's out to punch a god.
