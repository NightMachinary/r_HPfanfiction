Like maybe Tina or Newt?


** Quite a number. You can search by character on fanfiction. net (and select them). You can also do so on AO3, or just search there under "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" (Movies). I don't read these stories, so I have no specific recs; if you're new to the fandom, I'd suggest searching by favorites on fanfiction and kudos on AO3.

** I'll soon be writing a fic where Grindelwald tries to manipulates Newt by showing him how destroying the Statute of Secrecy will mean that his Beasts would truly be free and no longer having to hide in secluded habitats, making the same argument he does for Wizards... If Magic blooms only in rare souls, why must they skulk in the shadows, and in the same way, why should these Fantastic Beasts not be allowed to roam freely?! Yes, they may be dangerous, Grindelwald may argue, but they deserve a chance too...whaddya guys think?!

**** Thank you...I'm going to stick to the roots of these characters and this fic will essentially be a what if scenario, as in, if Grindelwald also chose to manipulate Newt just like he did with Queenie and Credence. Would it work?! Would Newt's moral compass become murkier if his Beasts are concerned and not humans?! I'll send you a link when I get to it!!
