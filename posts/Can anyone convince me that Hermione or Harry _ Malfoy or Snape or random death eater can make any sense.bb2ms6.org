** The better ones diverge from canon earlier, or introduce the characters /before/ they become irredeemable.

If Draco Malfoy chickened out about the Chamber of the Secrets in Year 2, before he started spouting his "Mudbloods are gonna get it, haha!" lines, and tried to apologize and made amends with the trio after finding out Harry was a Parselmouth, then he'd be a better person by Year 6, where in canon he starts passing the Point of No Return.

For Snape and Regulus Black, there's usually a time travel aspect that sets the pairing up /before/ they joined the Death Eaters and taken the Mark (Snape at 18/19, and Regulus at 16). Before that, they're just regular schoolboys from abusive families who like Dark Arts, but haven't participated in criminal activities. Still moody and emotionally tortured, but the good kind of darkness that can be healed by the power of love.

The shipfics where the characters /have/ done irredeemable, illegal shit I don't get, unless people enjoy the taboo aspect of teacher/student and bad boy/good girl. I don't think they're meant to be realistic, or something that is encouraged for IRL relationships, but rather some sort of weird kink fantasy stuff.

Snape/Hermione makes as much sense as Harry/Bellatrix, yet the latter is more accepted in this subreddit. Weird double standards, man.

*** At least Harry/Bellatrix has a smidge of an excuse where you claim that Bellatrix has always essentially been insane, so while it's not really okay for Harry Potter to fall in love with her, you can get some weird twisted relationship out of it. Never seen it done with this pairing, but once in a blue moon someone tries it with Harry Potter/Voldemort. I think I've seen like one actual success though, so there's that.

Regulus, because he's such a blank slate, does have an opportunity to redeem him at the point where he goes to retrieve the Horcrux. You can write him almost any way you want, and it's always possible to characterise him as full of regret and turning away from the cause, and retrieving the Horcrux is how he chose to go out and make penance for what he's done. I saw a fic like this recently that seemed fairly popular on AO3, but dropped it because the romance between him and Harry was too quick, and their personalities seemed too sappy.

** A large part of canon Draco is a /child/. Children are impressionable and almost never irredeemable (psycopaths are, but that's a special case). I don't think 12 year old Draco during CoS truly understood the implications of what he was saying -- the fact that he was essentially wishing for racial genocide. Hell, he couldn't even kill Dumbledore when almost at his majority.

Give Draco better influences, and nothing stops him from becoming a good person who can realistically get involved with Hermione (or Harry if you swing that way).

Severus is probably the easiest Death Eater to redeem. On the whole, he's a very unpleasant person and a bully, and is mentally stuck in past grudges and loves. But when it truly matters, I never considered him genuinely evil apart from his brief stint as a legitimate Death Eater. What he really needs is psychological help to allow him to let go of the past, or at least time to let go on his own once the war is over, allowing him to stop being an asshole to everyone. However, no matter how good of a person he ends up being, shipping him with Harry is a really bad idea; his major connection to Severus' childhood love makes any relationship attempt very dangerous and is likely to be unhealthy (even moreso if this is fem!Harry of the "mini Lily with James' eyes" kind). Especially if the canon Severus-Harry antagonism still happened, because now they have an abysmal history on top of that.

Other Death Eaters need much more development than we see in canon to see them redeemed, but that doesn't make it /impossible/. Only psychopaths are truly irredeemable, everyone else can become better people with the correct influence.

** Most of them are undoubtedly terribly written, but I have definitely read some good ones that convinced me at least Draco/Hermione and Draco/Harry can work (never personally read any Snape or other Death Eater)

I think you have to write Draco's redemption as truly convincing, a lot of them tend to have Draco as still being a prejudiced arsehole, which obviously isn't very convincing. There also has to be a justified reason for Harry or Hermione associating with him, such as forcing them to be reluctant allies against Voldemort. Draco rescuing Hermione from the abusive Ron that a lot of stories seem to do isn't convincing.

Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run is a truly superb Draco/Harry story that sold me on the pairing. And Midnight is unfinished but also quite good Hermione/Draco.

** I was originally of that opinion, but I've developed an exception for Harry/Draco fics that are epilogue-compliant, really show that Draco has changed, and don't bash Ginny in the process of putting Harry in a position where he's single again. (Infidelity fics of any kind need not apply.) I'm at work so I can't dig out links now, but I will when I get home. (As a shortcut, look for Teddy/James Sirius stories on AO3 --- some authors write both, and some of the better Teddy/James stories are also Harry/Draco.)

*** As I was thinking about it more after posting, I think there are two common threads in the Drarry stories I find plausible. Albus and Scorpius being friends brings them back into the same orbit, and Scorpius' personality and attitudes show that he wasn't raised the way Draco was, thus making the redemption of Draco feel quite plausible. And they address the tension and antagonism between them as boys as there having been some attraction there, at least on one side. In a lot of cases, it's Draco and that was a competing force against his father's indoctrination into Voldemort's opinions.

The first link is to a series where the first story is not long after the war, but it really is epilogue-compliant.

  It's not easy being dead. In a post-apocalyptic nightmare that once was the shining city of Zootopia, walking corpses fill the streets and they are hungry for brains. One of these nightmarish creatures is a fox who, like the others, is always hungry. But after years of walking the decrepit streets of the city, he finds himself a bored and perhaps a little lonely. When a living bunny stumbles into his life, his whole world will change. This work is in collaboration with Katie Katastrophe, who has provided the artwork featured in this story!

  Harry's happy with his life twenty-two years later. He has his job as the Head of the DMLE (albeit with a bit too much bureaucratic nonsense for his tastes), his not-really wife (and her incorrigibly charming shit of a boyfriend), and his three children (plus Scorpius Malfoy, who's somehow become the fourth child in their brood). The only thing that's missing is a partner, though not for a lack of trying on his part. However, the assignment of one case to Barrister Draco Malfoy -- a polite and cordial acquaintance on the peripheral of Harry's life -- leads to a deep friendship and the slow realisation that the partner he's been waiting his whole life for has been standing right in front of him all along.
