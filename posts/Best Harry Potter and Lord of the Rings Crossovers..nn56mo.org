I enjoy everything, but I'm not the most fond of fics where Harry is basically an awkward third feel in the fellowship/has no impact on the story.

I'm all for fics that don't include the plot for the hobbit or LOTR and are unique.

I'm fine with all slashes (...I think...I haven't come across a weird one yet)

I do not shy away from long fics either!


** Anyone will tell you that Linkao3(The Shadow Of Angmar) is one of the best.

Less popular but interesting recs:

Linkao3(Dreamers by Bobika) From the author of /Beyond The Curtain/.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed, but the wounds inflicted during his time in Angmar's dungeons run deep. He wishes only to return home, but that road is long and twisting, and fraught with danger.Begins 1000 years before LotR.

  It took Harry one slightly more successful assassination attempt to realise she was immortal.It took Luna one question to persuade Harry to help with an old research.It took the dwarves of Erebor one meeting with an Easterling thief to change the course of history. A competent fem!Harry travels to Middle-earth crossover, spanning from the reclamation of Erebor to the end of the Third Age.

  The Valar chose many companions to help them create Arda... save for Námo. The Judge of the Dead chose only one companion, who eventually pled for eternal rest. Too bad Námo had different plans. Eons later, Harry Potter woke up in a field of grass. "Sodding dreaming potions..." -Not your typical genderbender-

  Eternal Wanderer, Lonely Traveler, Chained Sage, and Master of Death. He was known by these and many more names in several worlds, though he found no solace in any name or world. Hallowed in blood, forged in war and baptised in loss, Harry Potter has run far away from the world that birthed him. He traces a path through infinity, intent on reclaiming that which was lost.

  The way to Valinor is lost. Men and Dwarves and Elves despair in their decaying world as an old evil arises again. All of Arda stands upon the edge of a knife. And then there's Lily, a source of magic unlike any before seen in Middle-earth. And Sauron knows it. (Fem!Harry, set 200 years before the events of LOTR, canon divergence)

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter helped with the rebuilding and then went back to school, sitting his NEWTS and graduating with the rest of what The Daily Prophet called ‘The Disrupted Class.' Following that, everyone expected him to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy.He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

  The one grateful thought that he threw to the sky was that he was not surrounded by trees. Truly, Harry was used to waking up in enchanted and lonesome forests and while he could surely survive in one again, the wide-open, grassy plain was a sight for sore eyes.The untamed magic and general feel of a land unknown to him were far outweighing any relief he could find, however.Because of course Harry Potter, the boy who had never stuck between the lines of “physics” and “magic,” would again defy the rules and end up very, very far from Hogwarts -- the place where he should have been at the moment. Appearing in a world with nothing but the clothes on his back and the wand in his holster for protection was very unfortunate indeed, and it was only the mind-numbing shock Harry was in at the current moment that saved the grass in a small radius from him from an explosive destruction.“What,” he said, “is this.”OR.The one where Harry finds himself in Middle-Earth and goes with Bilbo on his quest, making attachments and saving a few lives along the way. But don't be fooled: Fawkes is the real hero of this story. This is basically an "EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH FAWKES" story. I'm a big fan of his.
