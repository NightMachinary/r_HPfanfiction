She wrote The Denarian Renegade series, and finished three parts before apparently abandoning the fourth part.


** She's still active on DLP. Last I heard she was pregnant, so that's probably taking most of her time up.

** Sheeza is well known through out the community to abandon fanfics, it could just be a bad day of writing after 50 chapters and he would quit. I understand authors owe nothing to readers, but it really puts you off from reading any of his current works.

**** I would still give it a go if I was you, the first story arc is complete its just the author leaves us with the start of a new story and never updated the sequel sadly (although I remain hopeful).
