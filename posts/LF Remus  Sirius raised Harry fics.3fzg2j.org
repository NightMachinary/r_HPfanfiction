I would appreciate if anyone could post some Remus and Sirius raised fics over 100k words please.


** linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge) is a classic.

linkffn(What you leave behind by Newcomb) is one where the Harry raising stuff happens mostly in the background.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

      Warnings: Discussion of child neglect/abuse; violence towards children in the later chapters\. This is a newly\-edited version of a story written the early 2000s\. It has been edited primarily for grammar; having been written around the time OOTP came out, it does not incorporate canon from Half\-Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows\. Earlier versions of the fic are available in ebook formats from Chandri \(containing all the files of the Stealing Harryverse\) and from Deinera \(containing only Stealing Harry\)\. There is also a mobi version of it available from Mickawber\-fics\.

** Ffn (innocent) and it's sequels (which are still being updated weekly) certainly fit the bill--sirius breaks out of Azkaban five years early. But be warned, this is the longest fanfic I currently follow. We're about at the end of CoS and we're more than 800k words into this already.

Heavily AU, Harry is raised by Sirius outside of Britain until he is 16.

Less AU, Harry is raised by Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, and Tonks within Britain until he is 16.

Those are the only two fics I can remember by name.

**** It's been a while since I read that one, but I believe she helps train him. To some people that may count as raising?
