I'm looking for stories of a similar type of stories such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10131514/1/Back-to-the-Beginning][Back to the Beginning]] by CrystallineX or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11154214/1/Wizard-of-the-Storm][Wizard of the Storm]] by Mortred.

It doesn't have to be Lord of the Rings, it could be any universe but I'm fascinated by the stories where Harry just wakes up as a girl and has to deal with that and everything else thrown at him/her.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] and its sequel, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9908146/1/Jamie-Evans-and-the-Lonely-Queen][Jamie Evans and the Lonely Queen]].

*** The sequel seems abandoned, but the first fic didn't really need one so don't worry OP.

***** In my experience, "dormant" is an authorword for "it's abandoned but I don't want my fans to bother me about it"
