I can't believe Rowling put so many actually sapient species other than humans in the series and /didn't explore them or any possible culture at all/

Please, give me fics with goblins, house elves, merpeople, centaurs, giants, and any mixes in between.

One recommendation I have that fits this idea is the Realm of Song series by Lomonaaeren, which is a goblin-raised!Harry fic that is actually really interesting

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1423924]]


** That is the fic I came here to recommened after seeing the title... Realm of Song is excellent. Lomonaaeren is a great author. Sorry I don't have any others to recommend but I'd be interested in reading others like this too.

  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby arrives, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, his life, and the world forever. A very long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
