Having a read of The Ilvermorny Champion, I think I found my newest favourite quote from Severus Snape to Dumbledore in Chapter 29.

"Go fuck yourself, Dumbledore. With the Elder Wand."

You can tell I hate Dumbledore! (I only like this quote because it's Snape who delivered it!!)

What's your favourite quotes a character has said??


** Yet another one of these? I'll just give the same answer I gave last time.

"You stop this nonsense and get back in your diary, young man." -Seventh Horcrux

Honestly, I could quote the whole fic, but that's my favorite.

Also, obligatory "Seventh Horcrux" mention.

*** I love that fic, rereading it just doesn't get old. Here is a good quote I found on my recent reread:

"Hermione, are you trying to imply that I can't believe two things at once? I find that offensive."

Hermione frowned. "Harry, no one can. That's a sign of insanity."

** I have never been a fan of swearing by characters such as Snape, especially when he is older. I find that it takes me out of the story. I feel like Snapes humour tends to be more dry and sarcastic, swearing just doesn't work for him.

As for favorite quotes, that is very hard question since most of my favorite quotes don't make much sense without context. I do love all the conversations between Snape and Harry, especially in first few chapters of Prince of the Dark Kingdom:

#+begin_quote
  "Instead, he met the coal black eyes of a complete stranger. The man was tall with a large hooked nose, and was dressed as if ready to attend a funeral. Bloody hell! They called the government. They're going to dissect my brain!

  "Young man," the stranger said, his voice silky even in disdain, "Considering how tiny your brain is, I doubt anyone would be able to find it, let alone dissect it."

  He read my mind. That is so ...awesome... or would be if he weren't such a twat about it."
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  "There are those who strive for violence, young man, and those who live it. Those who strive so meekly can not possibly hope to stand up to those who live it. Like those who try and those who do. They are people on completely different levels. Now, your name."

  "Harold James Potter."

  A strangely sardonic look came across the professor's face, and his scowl twisted up in a mockery of a smile. "Of course it is."

** u/NarfSree:
#+begin_quote
  I remember how humiliating the bondage of my becoming my master's property was, Neville taking me in the Common Room in front of the fourth and fifth years, forcing me to suck him off in front of everybody, the humiliation being unable to come out due to the bond, how he took me in all three holes, the pain of the aftermath being a pain I will never forget

  Feeling his call through my collar, I remind myself that for my master I am only one thing in the grand scheme of things

  His Filthy Little Mudblood.

** Why thank you [[/u/GryffindorTom]], I loved writing that entire scene. Only time I didn't use the "said [character]" style of writing.
