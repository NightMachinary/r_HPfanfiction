So, I'm midway through reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/13/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][this]] beautiful, beautiful work of art. I say midway because I've broken my golden rule of never starting a story until it's marked "Complete". I'm stuck a few weeks into 3rd year, going crazy between updates from story withdrawal. Please help me find some similar stories, preferably complete, to help me through until the next update?

Possible spoilers for the story linked, but not too many:

Just in case you haven't read this masterpiece (and I truly suggest you do), Hermione is sorted into Slytherin and begins studying like crazy, learning advanced spells and thinking of creative ways to use them, so that her peers will stop tormenting her for being muggleborn, and respect her for her power. Along the way she accidentally falls under the tutelage of a dark wizard, and becomes involved in the politics of pureblood families, turning slowly darker and more terrifying, though still showing constant remorse, in the bid for more power, more knowledge.

This sort of thing is what I'm looking for, a gradual seduction of power, and internal confusion and remorse, as opposed to a Hermione who relishes evil and tortures people for fun; basically I'm looking for a mostly IC Hermione reacting to a tricky situation, as opposed to a re-packaged Bellatrix Lestrange.

Romance, smut, etc. is fine, but I would prefer for it to not be the focus of the story, or for her to turn dark to win the affections of an evil character. I'd also prefer stories with little or no rape, physical torture, or overly aggressive magical torture. Hermione at any age, any universe is fine.


** Roundabout Destiny By: MaryRoyale Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc. Rated: Fiction M - English - Romance/Adventure - Hermione G., Sirius B. - Chapters: 29 - Words: 169,487 - Reviews: 1,514 - Favs: 3,670 - Follows: 1,332 - Updated: Dec 3, 2014 - Published: Jul 11, 2012 - Status: Complete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8311387/1/Roundabout-Destiny]]

This Hermione is not dark dark... she is fighting for the 'right' side. She does, however, have Slytherin traits (many-- the girl is sneaky/talented/cunning). It is super AU, takes place in the Marauders era, she is shipped with Sirius but its not that 'serious' a plot point till they are older. The story begins when she is 11 and covers her years at Hogwarts. I don't want to give anything big away but you should really check it out. One of my favs. Excellent world/culture building. Take the chance.

*** I really loved the pureblooded, victorian style upbringing she got in that story. 'A lady glides', I felt myself identifying with Lily as she was jealous of how cultured Hermione was without even paying attention to it. It was also nice to see a story portray pureblood culture like that without coupling it with bigotry.

**** Not to mention how delicious Lucius was. When he wore jeans that one time... whoa. And the changed dynamic with Snape was really refreshing as well. We got to divulge into Lily's life more which was nice, as well as getting a front row glance into pureblood society. Hermione was super smart, super talented, and super pretty but I was never left feeling like I was reading a Mary Sue. Probably because there is a logical explanation for her natural skill. Character dynamics where also realistic and engaging. Only negative comment I would make would be about the slightly lack luster climax. I believe it was done intentionally though, and not without humor, so forgiven.

  Hermione receives the diary. Neither she, nor Tom, is what the other was expecting. [Origin story for a dark Hermione. This is not a romance. Canon AU.]

She isn't exactly dark /yet/, but I believe the author is planning a sequel.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]] - Very dark story but she fights for the light.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4546325/1/The-Contract][The Contract]] - Hermione gets married to Tom Riddle by Fudge's idiocracy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027125/1/The-Green-Girl][Green Girl]] - Hermione sorted into Slytherin. I think this might be the closest to what you're asking for, although it does have romance as a strong motivation.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4418411/1/Life-of-a-Pureblood][Life of a pureblood]] - Pureblood Hermione is sorted into Slytherin. currently year 1-3 is complete and year 4 was updated just today. Check author's page for other years. She's straight up evil in here, so perhaps not to your liking but I find it amusing so I put it in here.

Edit: I just read the last paragraph of your post, and I think the first one might not be to your liking, because of torture/rape, and her not actually turning to the dark side. I'm leaving it in here for others that might be interested though.

** I can give you a story, but I have to stop short of recommending it. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5010568/1/In-Too-Deep][In Too Deep]]: Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target.

This author loves angst the way a fat kid loves cake.

** I'm afraid you've found the top of the mountain, from here on all roads will lead you down again.

I'd recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]], alas it's on-going and far from complete. Summary:

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
#+end_quote

Also, if you're into Naruto fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2675402/jacobk][Jacobk]] also writes an amazing Sakura who would probably fit your taste.

There is also a very good crossover where Hermione gets reincarnated as Sakura: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8525251/2/Effloresco-Secundus][Effloresco Secundus]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

*** Ah, I was afraid of that :(

That's the horrible thing about finding the perfect story, nothing else will ever measure up. I've already re-read it 3 times waiting for the next update, so I'm kinda just hoping for something similar to tide me over in the meantime before my obsession turns into full-blown hysteria. I'll give Reign of the Serpent a go, thanks.

Thank you for the recommendation, I did check out the author hoping for some similar stories. Unfortunately I have no love for fanfiction apart from HP, and no knowledge of Naruto whatsoever, which might make it a little awkward to read.

**** Hehe. I've also re-read the story a few times, although I've been following the story for a few months now. If you're really desperate you might want to know that whenever a new chapter comes along, if will be posted [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/applied-cultural-anthropology-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cruciatus.256787/][here]] at least a few days before it appears on ff.net. Also, you can filter that thread for only the author's [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/search/40957210/?page=8][posts]] if you want to read stuff like reviewer replies, potential spoilers and the author's general take on fanfiction and the hpverse.
