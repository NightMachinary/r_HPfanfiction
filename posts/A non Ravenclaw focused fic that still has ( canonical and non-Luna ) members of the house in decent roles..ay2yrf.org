I don't particularly care what ; anything from Padma being Ron's Secret Santa to Terry,Anthony and Michael being male versions of Margot,Serena and Pilar from Legally Blonde. No bashing please.


** Harry and the Mysterious Case of the Girl Who Lived is a Harry-focused fic in which Padma serves as the intellectual foil to Hermione, where she constantly contradicts Hermione, mostly as an academic exercise. Funniest Padma in all of fanfiction.
