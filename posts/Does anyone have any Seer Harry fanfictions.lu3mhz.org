I want one where Harry's a seer and just knows when stuff is gonna happen, any recommendations?


** In linkffn(Harry Potter and the Arcana) Harry is a seer, although it's not exactly knowing the future. He mostly works with cards and such.

  Harry Potter's life as we know it is entrenched with destiny, sewn together like a tightly plotted book. But what if his bond with destiny was far more imminent? What if whatever card said that Harry Potter is rubbish at divination was turned upside down? Discontinued, for all intents and purposes.

  He is the first seer the Potter family has ever had, but is it really as much of a blessing as it appears? Harry knows he has a chance prevent the horrors of the First Wizarding War from ever happening and set things right. Things don't go quite as planned, however, and Harry instead finds himself being part of a larger game with hidden rules. A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired pawn that is trying to survive the war that looms.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was not the boy-who-lived and therefore he was not the favored child of the wizarding world. No, his twin brother Nathan Potter was and Nathan was easily loved by all, including the supposedly emotionless Harry Potter himself. Under the guidance of cold and strict tutors Harry has grown to be a rather emotionally detached young man but with the help of new friends who aren't his brother, perhaps Harry can learn what it's like to be seen as an individual. And maybe, just maybe, guidance from professor Snape, and upperclassmen can help Harry become the empathic Healer that he did not know he could be.That is if he can learn to navigate and cope with his visions as a seer and not fall victim to Voldemort's ever growing obsession with him that may very well lead him to insanity.!!!***01/01/2021 editing and rewriting AGAIN (Still, ah ha...) >_<||| sorry but I will still update as soon as I am able, sending much love<3**If you dislike characters being quite a bit OOC then this story is not for you.

  NEWT-level Divination student Harry Potter bullshits his way through a major arcana reading, best friend of the year Tom Riddle offers a marriage of convenience with no ulterior motives at all, and the wizarding world's changing future is much less important than the seventh years' love lives.

#+begin_quote
  Since the singular incident of being a Horcrux for many years has left Harry with a sensitivity to Dark magic, Harry begins training with Jacob, a Wizard who lives in New York, using this sensitivity to his advantage to cleanse magical spaces of Dark magic. After a year of training, Draco Malfoy shows up, wanting to learn from Jacob as well, and unexpectedly the two men grow a bond, both magical and physical. But Jacob's sudden death leaves Harry floundering and growing increasingly dependent on drugs and sex to avoid his problems. After his brief and tumultuous affair with Draco ends, Harry begins a life of travel, avoiding returning home permanently and continuing his drug habit. He flits from job to job, from place to place, never settling down for a moment, until, years later, Harry is called back to England by his friends to help Draco find his way out of a cursed Manor.2018 *UPDATE* I have finally decided to post on A03 as well, for everyone who doesn't want to bother with the pdf.

** I'm currently reading one, though his /prophetic might/ may not be as prominent as you wish? Harry has some seer dreams, however he does not know that's what they are until he's midst the prophesised events. so there's not much "here's what happens!" followed by preventing it.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
