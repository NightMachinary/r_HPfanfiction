Minerva sank Heavily into the chair covered in blood , sweat and Various other bits She didn't want to contemplate. They had won but at what price, a quarter of a generation lay dead at the gates . Child soldier in a war that had been Raging for generations All because the older generation , her generation couldn't adjust, they let hate grow in their hearts and it destroyed them. Tom destroyed them.

If only she had known what he would become back then , she could have done something. She could .... She could do it .stop this from happening . Minerva wrenched the drawer to the desk next to her open . Albus's last resort, the last master time turner , she could go back, but not the normal way, she would be a child again transcending time in spirit but not in body . Merlin she could save them, she could save them all. With shaking hands she began to turn. 67 years , her eyes began to burn.

What seemed like an eternity pasted only in an instant, she was back . A Hogwarts letter in her hands.

Does anyone know of any good Minerva McGonagle time travel fics?

** Decent idea, but your grammar isn't great. Probably because of mobile. I look forward to seeing what you do with a proper keyboard and without being rushed/bothered while writing.

One thing bothered me a bit: You open up with two very serious sentences and then say 'various other bits she didn't wanna contemplate'.

It seems like an odd juxtaposition where you're using serious language talking about dead children and lakes running red with blood and then you swap to less serious language for half that sentence with 'various other bits' and 'wanna'. You could've just said 'blood and sweat' or 'blood, sweat, and viscera' and it would've worked better to my brain.

I'm not trying to throw stones I'm just curious if anyone knows what the proper term for this is, if it even has one, and if I'm just making it up in my head.

** Linkffn(2894304) is a good time travel fic. I am not pleased with the Dumbledore bashing aspects but I recall the magic being fairly interesting with decent combat.

*** It's not a bad fic, but thing that made me drop it was;

chap1 spoiler: Voldemort joins on the travel back (unsure how completely, as I dropped it before that was explained)... I don't enjoy fics where the antagonist has the upper hand and things don't work out^{or seem like they won't}, so this one didn't do it for me.

**** He does not actually receive his memories back as you might think. He gets them back disjointly, they're more like dreams, hard to actually remember other then brief flashbacks. He actually both loses and wins within the fic.

  PostHBP. When all hope seems lost and everybody is dead, Harry transports his soul into the body of his one year old self. This time, he's going to try and set things right.
